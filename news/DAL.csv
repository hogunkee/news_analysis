4,DAL,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) continued to show strong earnings in Q2 and laid out steps to offset higher fuel costs, leaving analysts wondering why the stock doesn't reflect all that seems to be going right at the airline.XOn a conference call Thursday, Delta executives were asked different versions of the same question: What can it do to get investors to actually like it?JPMorgan analyst Jamie Baker prefaced a question by noting the airline industry's merger wave in years past that kept it from imploding, and the sense that things for Delta and others are ""different this time.""""But the economy is roaring,"" he said. ""Your stock's down 10% year to date. You're trading at a multiple that's no better than when the industry was basically a joke. You're essentially getting zero credit for what you've accomplished. ... So my question is: What is still broken here?""In response, to him and others, management stressed that it was succeeding in countering the swelling fuel costs that have gutted airline stocks this year. CEO Ed Bastian said margin expansion would be important to appeasing the Street. The company said its plans to trim its fall flight schedule have set the stage to accomplish that goal by the end of the year. Management also said it would continue to shuffle flight schedules in areas where they can't pass on fuel costs to passengers.What's more, corporate-travel revenue rose 10% during the quarter. As President Trump doubles down on complaints over international trade, Bastian said the carrier was ""not seeing any signs that the rumored escalating trade wars"" were hurting travel, business or otherwise. Delta Air Lines on Thursday also hiked its dividend by 15% to 35 cents a share.Shares of Delta Air Lines rose 1.8% on the stock market today, though they are still below their 50- and 200-day averages and are 16% 52-week highs. American Airlines (AAL), whose shares sold off 8% on Wednesday, rose 1% Thursday. United Airlines (UAL) picked up 3.1%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseEarlier in the morning, Delta Air Lines slashed its full-year earnings-per-share outlook to $5.35-$5.70 from $6.35-$6.70, citing a $2 billion expected increase in fuel costs. Analysts expected earnings per share of $5.70.Management expects total unit revenue growth of 3.5%-5.5% for Q3. The midpoint of that range would mark a slight slowdown from the 4.6% gain notched in Q2.For Q2, the carrier's EPS rose 11% to $1.77, above Zacks estimates for $1.73. Revenue came in at $11.8 billion, just above forecasts for $11.68 billion. Adjusted fuel costs surged 33% to $578 million.""With strong revenue momentum, an improving cost trajectory, and a reduction of 50-100 bps of underperforming capacity from our fall schedule, we have positioned Delta to return to margin expansion by year end,"" said Bastian said in a statement before the call.Precisely how Delta might rebalance its flight schedule later this year is also not completely clear. The carrier said it is reducing capacity in underperforming markets in Latin America, the region it said faced the most difficulties during the quarter.Elsewhere, international travel remained strong. As negotiations in the U.K. crumble over the terms of its departure from the European Union, Delta said its business traffic to and from the U.K. was at record levels. The outlook for corporate demand remains strong, the carrier said.Higher fuel costs have led analysts to wonder how airlines might adjust flight schedules to shore up sales and profits. Airlines could potentially deploy flights to areas where it's more expensive to fly and pull them back elsewhere. The smaller supply of seats and flights could help airlines raise fares.American Airlines on Wednesday added to those worries. The carrier lowered its Q2 unit revenue outlook on weaker domestic pricing power in the U.S., even as strong travel demand and higher oil prices increasingly allow airlines to pass higher costs onto consumers.Some analysts said American would likely also adjust its flight capacity growth plans as the higher fuel costs eat into profits. Southwest (LUV) last month cut its own outlook for full-year capacity growth.Unit revenue, an important efficiency metric that gauges airline revenue as it relates to flight capacity, has generally improved since last year. American's announcement left some analysts wondering if competition from Southwest Airlines (LUV) was to blame, and if American's demand relied on low fares. Others downplayed American Airlines' forecast, saying the downbeat forecast was expected.On Thursday's call, Delta said domestic yields, or its ability to charge passengers more to fly, were weaker than they would like them to be. But a ""flush consumer"" with an appetite for travel experiences helped leisure travel, management said.Delta also said there was room to improve corporate airfare trends in the U.S. The company said that corporate fares have moved up internationally.When asked by a reporter about the point at which higher fares might curtail demand, Bastian would only say that trends were still pretty good.""We're not seeing anything other than strong demand for our product,"" he said.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Top Airlines Issue These Warnings As Higher Fuel Prices BiteSouthwest To Abandon This Piece Of Its 'History And DNA' PermanentlyS&P 500 Earnings Hot, But Will Trump's Trade Wars Chill Guidance?Airline Industry News And Stocks To Watch

5,DAL,"Southwest (LUV) on Tuesday reported a bump in June traffic, but a gauge of seats filled slipped, as questions about rising fuel costs and a trade war weigh on airline stocks ahead of second-quarter earnings.The carrier on Aug. 1 will also abandon of something it described as forever a part of its ""history and DNA"" — peanuts — citing the risks they pose to passengers with peanut allergies.""Peanuts forever will be part of Southwest's history and DNA,"" Southwest said in a statement. ""However, to ensure the best onboard experience for everyone, especially for customers with peanut-related allergies, we've made the difficult decision to discontinue serving peanuts on all flights beginning Aug. 1.""""Our ultimate goal is to create an environment where all customers — including those with peanut-related allergies — feel safe and welcome on every Southwest flight,"" the statement continued.An airline spokesperson told IBD that the end of peanut service will be permanent.Southwest will continue to serve free pretzels, along with its ""wonderful portfolio of free snacks on longer flights."" The carrier said it hoped those offerings ""will please customers who might be nostalgic or sad to see peanuts go.""The carrier will join United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) in not serving peanuts aboard flights. United, on its website, warns that it is ""not possible to prevent customers from bringing food items on board that contain major food allergens including peanuts.""Southwest edged down 0.5% in the stock market today, still above its 50-day line. United dipped 0.7%, while American lost 0.5%. Delta Air Lines (DAL), which reports Q2 earnings Thursday, rose 0.2%.Southwest's passenger traffic rose 2.6% in June. Capacity, or an airline's supply of seats and flights, rose 3.2% during the month. Load factor, a measure of seats filled, was 86.9% during the month, down from 87.4% a year ago.As airlines report second-quarter earnings in the weeks ahead, Wall Street will be on the lookout for ways airlines can contain costs as jet-fuel prices rise. Southwest already dialed back its full-year flight capacity last month due to higher jet-fuel costs.In the wake of an engine blowout in during a flight April that resulted in the death of a passenger, Southwest also cut its outlook for unit revenue.

7,DAL,"American Airlines (AAL) on Wednesday cut its second-quarter unit revenue outlook on weaker domestic pricing power on airfares. The announcement appeared to surprise Wall Street, denting airline stocks and leaving analysts searching for reasons after rising fuel costs and strong demand have given airlines more leeway to charge passengers more to fly.One analyst, in wondering about reasons for the cut, said ""most fingers are being pointed at"" competition from Southwest (LUV). Others said American's less upbeat view on unit revenue was unusual because many airlines had suggested the worst fare discounting was behind them.American Airlines said it expected second-quarter unit revenue to increase around 1%-3%, lower than an earlier outlook for a 1.5%-3.5% gain. The carrier said the cut was due to ""lower than anticipated domestic yields."" Yields measure how much money an airline can get out of passengers when they book flights.Shares of American tumbled 8% to close at 35.96 on the stock market today. The carrier's stock has been at lows not seen before the 2016 election. Airline stocks this year have suffered due to higher jet-fuel costs and President Trump's trade-related provocations.Other airline stocks retreated as well. Delta Air Lines (DAL), which reports second-quarter earnings on Thursday, slipped 1.5%. United Airlines (UAL) lost 3.4%. Southwest fell 0.9%, touching its 50-day line.When fuel costs rise, investors prefer that airlines push fare costs higher. In a solid demand environment, higher fares usually translate into higher unit revenue. Unit revenue gauges how efficiently an airline operates by measuring sales in relation to an airline's overall flight coverage.""In an environment with higher fuel prices and what by all accounts seems to be very strong demand, it's curious that domestic yields would be weaker than expected,"" Stifel analyst Joseph DeNardi said in a research note.""We have some theories but no concrete explanation. It seems like most fingers are being pointed at American's neighbor,"" he added, referring to Southwest.American on Wednesday also said it would lose $35 million in pretax income as a result of computer-system problems at PSA Airlines, a regional airline the carrier owns, that forced the cancellation of some 3,000 flights last month. But it said costs at non-fuel units would only be up 2.5%. That's less than the 3.5% bump expected earlier, due partly to lower-than-expected maintenance costs.The Trump administration on Tuesday said it would impose tariffs on an extra $200 billion in Chinese products. U.S. tariffs targeting $34 billion worth of Chinese products took hold on Friday. Some analysts worry that a full-blown trade war could force companies to cut spending. That spending pullback, in turn, could crimp corporate travel.As airlines prepare to report second-quarter earnings this month, Wall Street will be focused on how carriers can counterbalance rising fuel prices. American CEO Doug Parker said last month that customers could face rising airfare costs, as higher fuel expenses prompt carriers to pull back on the flights they offer. However, he said such a scenario was unlikely in the near term.Southwest, which reported June traffic results on Tuesday, has already pared back its full-year flight capacity. Delta could announce its own decision on how many flights it will ultimately offer for the rest of the year when it reports on Thursday.""In a rising jet fuel environment, airlines should be raising prices, and investors expect yields to show improvement to offset higher labor and fuel costs,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note. ""The increase in yields will take time, but investors did not anticipate a reduction, mostly because most airlines have indicated that a lot of the deepest discounted fares have left the system.""She said that even though American has benefited from strong demand, that demand appeared to be the product of low fares. As jet-fuel costs rise and unit revenue flags, American would likely trim its fall and winter flight schedules as well, she said.""Demand remains solid but they need to show they can overcome rising fuel costs with higher fares,"" she said.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:S&P 500 Earnings Hot, But Will Trump's Trade Wars Chill Guidance?Delta Air Lines To Make This Key Decision Over Next Month As Fuel Hits ProfitTop Airlines Issue These Warnings As Higher Fuel Prices BiteAirline Industry News And Stocks To Watch

8,DAL,"When Delta Air Lines (DAL) releases second-quarter earnings on Thursday, Wall Street will be bracing for its response to the higher fuel costs and international tensions that have converged on airline stocks and profits this year.Delta Air Lines last month cut its second-quarter earnings-per-share outlook, citing a ""sharp rise"" in jet-fuel costs. The carrier this month stuck with that EPS forecast, of $1.65-$1.75, compared with Zacks forecasts for $1.75, up 7%. Analysts expect revenue to rise 8% to $11.679 billion.But fuel costs and labor are typically an airline's biggest expenses. Since Delta first cut its EPS outlook in June, analysts have been waiting to see whether the airline will trim flights from its schedule, or otherwise rearrange it, to recapture sales.Delta in June said it would make a decision on how to handle its flight-capacity plans for the fall. The company said that decision would be made ""through the lens of strong demand and volatile fuel.""""The first course of action may be to adjust their fall and winter schedules, while trying to raise fares in strong markets,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note last week.Despite the concerns about fuel, corporate and leisure travel remain solid. Delta expected a 4%-5% gain in second-quarter unit revenue, or an airline's sales as they relate to the scope of its flight coverage.""Delta's unit revenue outlook will be important as investors continue to worry about the industry's ability to raise ticket prices to cover rising jet fuel prices,"" Becker said in the note.Southwest Airlines (LUV) last month also pulled back its outlook for flight-capacity growth this year amid higher fuel costs. American Airlines (AAL) said travelers might have to deal with steeper fare prices as fuel costs run higher.Delta stock rose 0.2% in the stock market today. American Airlines stock lost 0.5%. Southwest Airlines stock retreated 0.5%. Delta, American and Southwest all recently hit their worst levels of the year.United Airlines (UAL) was down 0.7%. United stock tested support at its 50-day line; it has been consolidating for more than a year.Morgan Stanley analyst Rajeev Lalwani said in a research note Monday that he expected Delta to cut its earnings-per-share outlook for the year. He said American Air earnings per share would likely come in at the lower end of its expected range. He also said airlines' foreign-exchange-related advantages were ""subsiding.""Conditions could also deteriorate for U.S. airlines' international business — an area of strength for Delta in recent quarters.Some analysts remain concerned that a U.S. trade war with China, Europe and others could ding companies' spending plans, which would ultimately hit corporate travel. Outside the U.S., where the airspace is crowded with rivals, all kinds of difficulties await.Airline stocks have been ""pressured by rising fuel prices, trade issues, supply concerns, Iran sanctions, Italy, North Korea, Russia, Brexit, etc.,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Michael Linenberg said in a research note last week. ""In our conversations with investors, we have encountered far more excuses to sell them than reasons to buy them.""Analysts also worry about the state of Brazil's economy, and how much that will weigh on demand in Latin America. But any good news, Linenberg said, could be really good for airline stocks.""That said, investors' expectations toward the sector are quite low, and we are of the view that it probably wouldn't take much positive news to send airline shares higher by 5%-10%,"" he continued.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:S&P 500 Earnings Hot, But Will Trump's Trade Wars Chill Guidance?Delta Air Lines Flags This 'Wild Card' In Earnings Guidance This YearSouthwest To Abandon This Piece Of Its 'History And DNA' PermanentlyAirline Industry News And Stocks To Watch

16,DAL,"Just how bad will the U.S.' slap-fight over trade, which escalated with China on Friday, be for S&P 500 earnings and stocks? Just how much can the U.S. economy, which delivered solid June jobs growth on Friday, still grow after a nine-year expansion?Analysts expect another blowout quarter in Q2 — 20.7% earnings-per-share growth for S&P 500 index components and an 8.1% jump in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters. Wall Street is betting on continued scorching results for the rest of the year. But they may not be as scorching if President Donald Trump's trade wars with China, Canada, Mexico, Europe and others become more heated. The quiet earnings growth next year might be even more muted.Analysts say the effects of a trade war have yet to be priced into financial forecasts.""I think the first tangible impact should start showing up in estimate revisions as these earnings results come out,"" said Sheraz Mian, director of research at Zacks.In other words, the second-quarter earnings season could offer some higher drama than CEOs' usual blanched remarks about ""headwinds"" and ""tailwinds."" Investors, even more than usual, will focus on earnings guidance and post-earnings call commentary to get some answers as to how the tariffs will affect profit, sales, prices, corporate strategy and shareholder returns.Higher costs for parts and supplies that U.S. companies bring in from overseas could mean higher costs for customers. Businesses could rethink or even uproot complex global supply chains. Higher prices on U.S.-made goods sold overseas could crimp international demand. Companies could cut or delay major investments.S&P 500 index companies, filled with hundreds of U.S. multinationals and exporters, are more exposed to tariffs and global demand than the U.S. economy itself.As for the second-quarter itself, the gains from S&P 500 companies come courtesy of President Trump's tax cuts and an enduring U.S. economy.Rebounding oil prices will lift the energy sector's Q2 earnings by around 141.5%, with sales up some 20%, according to Thomson. S&P 500 energy stocks, which include Dow Jones giants Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) as well as ConocoPhillips (COP), Valero (VLO), Marathon Oil (MRO), Schlumberger (SLB) and many others, have generally been strong performers.Analysts expect the S&P 500 financials to clock a 22% gain in earnings on a 4.5% bump in revenue, as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and other banks enjoy lower taxes and deregulation. Thomson forecasts semiconductors and internet software and services to lead the S&P 500 tech components toward 25.5% earnings growth. Tech revenue is seen jumping 12%. Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Facebook (FB) are all slated to deliver solid-to-stellar growth.As estimates stand now, Thomson Reuters is forecasting the 20%-plus earnings growth to reach into the third and fourth quarters.""The last time we had earnings growth in Q3 and Q4 like this was in 2010,"" Tajinder Dhillon, senior research analyst at Thomson Reuters, said in an email.However, looking past 2018, analysts appear to have a harder time justifying bullish expectations for S&P 500 companies.""You look at the numbers going forward, you really don't start to see a significant drop in growth until you get into 2019, when again, you'll be back to apples-to-apples on the tax rates,"" said John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet.But tougher comparisons aren't a massive concern right now, analysts say. And next year's growth still looks solid. Dhillon said that for 2019 investors can expect a 9.7% earnings growth rate, ""which is still higher than the 20-year average of 7.3%.""Wall Street also worries that the U.S. economy has fewer tools at its disposal to keep its marathon run going. The dollar is stronger. The yield curve is flatter due partly to the Federal Reserve's decisions to lift short-term interest rates.The narrowing yield curve, the gap between rates on short-term and long-term government debt, looms large for banks in particular. The flatter curve, also seen as a precursor to an economic downturn, has dragged bank stocks lower in recent months.Banks also lend money to borrowers based on long-term rates, but borrow from depositors according to short-term rates. The narrower the difference between the two, the narrower the banks' net interest margins. JPMorgan, Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) report second-quarter earnings on Friday.The three banking giants, which all announced hefty shareholder-return packages last month, are expected to deliver solid EPS growth. But JPMorgan stock, along with that of Citigroup, Wells Fargo and others, is near 2018 lows.When the Fed raises rates that affects the money flowing into global, emerging markets as well.""If U.S. interest rates are going up,"" Mian said, ""and an investor or a class of investors is scouring world markets for yield and returns, and if the yield and return is going up in a developed market like the U.S., then there's no reason to take the extra risk of going to Argentina or Turkey when you can get it in the U.S.""The U.S. on Friday lobbed tariffs at $34 billion worth of Chinese products — more than 800 types of products total. That's the first part of a $50 billion response for what Trump says are China's trade abuses against the U.S.The U.S. tariffs target aircraft parts, industrial parts and equipment, some vehicles and other machinery. The duties from the U.S. targeted products related to China's tech-focused ""Made in China 2025"" plan. Trump has said that initiative would ""hurt economic growth for the United States and many other countries.""""The United States can no longer tolerate losing our technology and intellectual property through unfair economic practices,"" Trump said in a statement last month.China on Friday responded with penalties of its own on U.S. products, including automakers and agriculture. China aimed those tariffs squarely at Trump's base.Trump has threatened to levy another $200 billion in tariffs on China, and even more. Meanwhile, Trump has threatened to impose a global import tariff on autos. That follows duties on steel and aluminum that have spurred Europe, Canada and Mexico to retaliate.Further trade discord could force companies to rethink their supply chains. Those adjustments could undo corporate America's efforts over the past two decades to more efficiently manage their inventories. Such practices over that time firmed up businesses' balance sheets.The brinkmanship has swept up some of the most iconic American businesses along the way. General Motors (GM) said as much last week, warning that more tariffs would lead to ""reduced presence at home and abroad for this iconic American company.""Harley-Davidson (HOG) said it would offer more detail, on its earnings call this month, about its plans to move some production out of the U.S. to skirt tariffs from the EU. Brown-Forman (BFB) is raising the price of Jack Daniel's in parts of Europe because of the tariffs imposed by the EU.No one knows how the Trump trade wars, and their impact on S&P 500 companies, will play out.""We expect company-specific risks from tariffs and China-trade exposures to be a central discussion topic during 2Q18 earnings calls,"" RBC analyst Deane Dray, who covers industrials vulnerable to steel and aluminum tariffs, wrote in a note last month. ""But no one has a crystal ball on how the tariff situation will ultimately play out, especially the potential knock-on effects.""He said companies like 3M (MMM) and Danaher (DHR) looked best equipped among industrials to handle the trade disputes.The trade war also threatens chipmakers like Micron (MU). A Chinese court blocked sales of some of its chips in the country, a move seen as pushback from the nation against Trump's trade salvos. China has held up approving the Qualcomm (QCOM) takeover of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). Boeing (BA) isn't subject to China tariffs, but Beijing could favor Airbus (EADSY) jets in a protracted U.S.-China trade war. The aerospace company in April downplayed worries over a trade war.Baird analyst Benjamin Hartford covers transportation and logistics companies like UPS (UPS), FedEx (FDX) and Expeditors International (EXPD). Hartford wrote in a research note last month that he'd seen no ""material evidence (yet) of freight volume weakness amid rising global trade tensions.""Some analysts, like Tigress' Ivan Feinseth, expressed optimism that strength in corporate earnings would offset any trade damage. Others wonder how much a trade war will hurt corporate travel for the likes of global carriers like American Airlines (AAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL), and cargo demand broadly. Delta Air earnings are due Thursday.""We still expect demand to grow, but those expectations are dampened with each new tariff introduced,"" Alexandre de Juniac, CEO of the International Air Transport Association, said of air cargo demand in a statement this week.

17,DAL,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) on Tuesday said it was sticking with its second-quarter forecast for many of the things investors are worried about — unit revenue, earnings per share and margins. Meanwhile Deutsche Bank downgraded Delta, United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) on global trade tensions, cutting price targets on other airline stocks.

Airlines are struggling to keep profit afloat as jet-fuel costs surge.Delta Air Lines on Tuesday said it expects second-quarter earnings per share of $1.65-$1.75, the same as its outlook last month but lower than the $1.80-$2 forecast in April. Analysts expect Delta to turn in Q2 EPS of $1.75, according to Zacks Investment Research.As for unit revenue, the much-watched gauge of passenger sales in relation to an airline's flight capacity: Delta kept the forecast for that key metric the same as well. It expects a 4%-5% uptick for the second quarter, on strong demand in both its leisure and business seating options. The company said that demand helped counterbalance a roughly 50% jump in fuel prices.Pretax margins for the second quarter are expected to come in at 13%-14%, Delta said. That's also in line with the forecast the company gave last month.Deutsche Bank cut its second-quarter earnings-per-share outlook to $1.75, from $1.95.Delta on Tuesday forecast Q2 capacity, or its overall available seats and flight coverage, to rise around 3.5%. That forecast was at the midpoint of the 3%-4% increase it projected in June.At that time, Delta said it expected to decide how to handle its flight capacity for the fall ""over the next month."" Delta said that decision would be made ""through the lens of strong demand and volatile fuel."" It was unclear if any action had been taken.During its first-quarter earnings call in April, Delta said it planned to pack its planes with more premium, higher-priced airfares this year. It also said it planned to ""recapture"" ever-more-expensive fuel costs with higher revenue.Delta, American and United, Linenberg said, are the most exposed to the friction between the U.S. and other parts of the world, given their vast, international networks and corporate clientele. Deutsche Bank estimated that the three carriers accounted for around 65%-70% of U.S. business travelers.He said that he favored more ""domestic-oriented"" carriers, such as Southwest Airlines (LUV), Spirit Airlines (SAVE), Alaska Air Group (ALK) and JetBlue (JBLU). Still, Linenberg lowered his price targets on those carriers amid the macroeconomic and geopolitical tension.""While we believe these stocks are likely to outperform over the next six months, we are mindful of the second order effects of a growing trade dispute, which would likely mean that all US airline stocks are at risk of collateral damage,"" he wrote.Shares of Delta slipped 2.3% in the stock market today, hitting their lowest levels in nearly five months.American Airlines stock fell 1.6%, while United lost 1.1%. Shares of Southwest Airlines, which has tapered its capacity growth for this year, edged down 2 cents after briefly reclaiming its 50-day line.

19,DAL,"Rising fuel costs could bring ""a significant shakeout"" in the airline industry in the months ahead, Ryanair (RYAAY) CEO Michael O'Leary said, potentially affecting one of the biggest discount-airfare competitors to Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) over the Atlantic.XThe speed of that shakeout, he told Bloomberg Television, will determine future profitability. Among the ""key issues"" for the next 12 months, he said, was the fate of low-cost, long-haul carrier Norwegian Air Shuttle.Norwegian is among the carriers that early last year threatened to push profits lower for the big three U.S. carriers in the trans-Atlantic market. Norwegian is currently offering one-way flights, scheduled in December, from Oakland, Calif., to London for as little as $144.90.O'Leary said Norwegian was ""hugely loss-making last year with oil at $40 a barrel."" And he said that the carrier's fortunes could worsen dramatically at $80 a barrel. Norwegian told Bloomberg that O'Leary's remarks had ""no root in reality.""Some airlines may find themselves in trouble as soon as this winter, he said, adding that the loss of Norwegian as a competitor could allow others to raise airfare more easily. A rescue of some kind by British Airways parent IAG would be less to his liking, as it might only slow capacity growth.IAG has taken close to a 5% stake in Norwegian. The company has tried twice, unsuccessfully, to take over Norwegian. IAG reportedly plans to make a third attempt.O'Leary said his carrier was ""well-hedged"" on fuel prices for the next 12 months, and was 90% hedged at around $59 a barrel.Shares of Ryanair jumped 4.9% in the stock market today, rebounding above their 200-day line. Delta was up 2%, surfacing above its 50-day line. American rose 2.1%, while United gained 2.4%. Sales have rebounded internationally for the big three recently.

For the year ahead, Ryanair said it was on the ""pessimistic side of cautious.""The carrier said it sees full-year net income of 1.25 billion to 1.35 billion euros, less than the 1.45 billion euros for last year.Ryanair said it sees non-fuel unit costs up 6%, following pay increases to pilots and other staff. Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth, in a research note, called that ""the biggest surprise.""The carrier has also had to come to the negotiating table after struggling with a shortage of pilots.""We expect above-average EU capacity growth to continue into (fiscal 2019), which will have a downward effect on fares,"" the carrier said in an earnings release on Monday.But Ryanair expects some upward pressure on airfare later in the year ""as significantly higher oil prices impact margins, especially those EU airlines (that) continue to expand despite having no prospect of achieving profitability.""Syth, in a research note earlier this month, indicated optimism about the carrier.""We remain constructive on Ryanair's competitive positioning and earnings potential, particularly in a rising fuel price environment that should place increasing pressure on weaker competitors,"" she said.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:United Airlines Expansion Plan That Caused Stock Meltdown Gets SupportStock Upgrades: Delta Airlines Shows Rising Relative StrengthAirline Industry News And Stocks To Watch

20,DAL,"Southwest (LUV) on Tuesday launched cheap airfare deals, with select one-way flights costing as little as $49, a biannual offering from the carrier that comes a day after it forecast weaker ticket sales following an accident in April.XThe 72-hour cheap airfare bonanza is good for flights between Aug. 12 and Dec. 12. One-way tickets generally start at $49, $79, $99 and $129. A one-way flight from El Paso, Texas, to Los Angeles, for instance, starts at $49. Eighty-nine dollars can get you a one-way ticket from Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., to Havana, Cuba.The discounts for discount flights, however, don't apply to flights on Friday and Sunday. And the fares are only valid on nonstop flights.

21,DAL,"In January, when United Airlines (UAL) announced a three-year expansion into middle America's smaller cities, Wall Street spiraled into despair. Analysts worried the carrier's plans were too aggressive. The plans, they said, would run up against rising fuel and labor costs, gutting margins along the way.XThe stock still hasn't recovered. But now, one analyst says that expansion won't decimate the industry after all.That analyst, Barclays' Brandon Oglenski, argued market concerns about United Airlines' plans, to offer more connecting flights from its airport hubs in Denver, Chicago and Houston, ""seem overstated."" And he said the data shows a ""very tangible need"" for airline expansion in smaller, connecting cities.""Our analysis shows connecting markets have significant 'pent-up' demand, suggesting United's growth is unlikely to be materially dilutive to the industry,"" he said in a research note Monday. The analysis thus shows a ""favorable outlook for depressed airline stocks,"" he said.He added that United Airlines' plans ""should help the carrier gain 'natural' share of higher yielding and likely higher margin traffic."" Delta Air Lines (DAL) and American Airlines (AAL), he said, control a bigger share of connecting flights.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOglenski's assessment echoes what United executives have said in defense of their expansion. United Airlines has said the move will help the airline regain what it says is its ""natural"" market share — territory it gave up to rivals following its merger with Continental in 2010. Management has also argued that the carrier can charge more for flight tickets in smaller cities, where competition isn't as intense as in bigger, crowded airports.Management has also argued that expanding in one type of market won't wreck the airlines in all markets.""All capacity is not created equal,"" United President Scott Kirby said at a conference in March, referring to an airline's supply of available seats and flight coverage.United finished 2.1% higher in the stock market today, Delta Air Lines edged up 0.5%, and American Airlines climbed 1.7%.Oglenski said that over the past eight years, domestic U.S. passenger demand for air travel has risen around 27% overall. Yields, or how much money a carrier can get out of a passenger for flying, were up 7.5% over that time.However, in smaller connecting cities only, in which a flight connects to a hub airport, demand was up less than 4%. But yields surged 23%.""While we understand connecting markets necessarily create higher costs to serve for the network airlines (given need for smaller aircraft and two departures),"" Oglenski said, ""it appears United's strategy to reduce domestic capacity in the past decade has at least added to demand constraints in small markets.""Whenever airlines expand, investors get flashbacks of the aggressive competition that came with it decades ago. Scores of airlines went bankrupt after overexpanding and discounting fares too heavily in attempt to lure customers.But the Barclays note marks the latest favorable treatment for the carrier. United eased Wall Street's worries in April with a solid earnings report and signs it was pulling back on its expansion plans.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:This May Pose 'Material Risk' To Airline Profits; American, Allegiant Face ScrutinyStock Upgrades: Delta Air Lines Shows Rising Relative StrengthAmerican Hit By Fuel Costs, Southwest Demand Hurt By Accident

22,DAL,"The U.S. exit from the Iran nuclear deal could pose a ""material risk"" to profits at airlines, while Boeing (BA) and Airbus (EADSY) could see more demand for newer, more fuel-efficient jets, according to an analyst.XMajor U.S. carriers like Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) already face rising fuel costs, as prices rebound from the oil crash in 2014. Delta's fuel costs jumped 20% in the first quarter. For American, they rose 26% over that time.In a research note on Tuesday, Canaccord Genuity's Ken Herbert said that if crude prices rise too fast airlines could spend less on ""older aircraft (negative for the aftermarket) and be positive for the demand for new, fuel efficient aircraft, unless the overall impact on airline profitability was substantial.""Fuel and labor are the airlines' two biggest costs. Withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and the reimposing of sanctions, announced by President Trump on Tuesday, will likely constrain Iran's oil exports, tweaking global oil prices higher.On Wednesday, U.S. crude prices jumped 3.1% to $71.17 a barrel, and Brent crude surged 3% to $77.12, with both hitting the highest levels since November 2014.Delta fell 1.4% in the stock market today, as shares make their way through a consolidation.

He said the return of tougher sanctions would not have a ""material negative impact"" on Boeing's backlog.""The risk for Boeing and Airbus is if fuel prices rise too fast, or too much, that it materially impacts airline profitability, which could be a natural headwind for order activity or backlog strength,"" he added.

Revenue came in at $9.032 billion, just beating analyst expectations for $9.013 billion. United's unit revenue, which gauges sales by way of an airline's overall flight coverage, rose 2.7%, in line with prior company forecasts.United said that it expected full-year non-fuel unit costs, excluding third-party business expenses, fuel and profit sharing, to be flat to down 1% during the full year.United's plan to add more flights to smaller U.S. cities over the next three years has also raised worries that rivals might retaliate by slashing fares, drawing passengers but thinning profits. The airline narrowed its guidance on 2018 capacity — or an airline's supply of seats and flights — and now sees it rising 4.5%-5.5%. In January, United said it expected capacity growth of 4%-6%.The carrier sees full-year earnings per share of $7.00-$8.50, narrowing an earlier forecast due to ""increased confidence in the outlook for the remainder of the year."" Wall Street expected $7.83. For the second quarter, United forecast a unit revenue increase of 1%-3%. The carrier also sees second-quarter capacity increasing 4%-5%. United expects second-quarter adjusted pretax margins of 9%-11%. The company expects unit costs, excluding third-party business expenses, fuel and profit sharing, to be flat to up 1% in Q2.Shares jumped 3% late in the stock market today, after ending the regular session virtually flat at 67.34.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseStill, Wall Street could stir up drama during the company's earnings conference call, set for Wednesday.After the company's third-quarter earnings call, its stock fell around 12%, with some investors not satisfied with how prepared the carrier was for this year. After United's fourth-quarter call, when it announced the expansion, the stock fell around 11%.Delta Air Lines (DAL), which reported earnings last week, closed up 0.5% and added another 0.5% late. American Airlines (AAL) finished 1.4% lower but rallied 1% late. Southwest (LUV) fell 1.1%, after a Dallas-bound plane suffered an engine problem that forced an emergency landing and left one person dead.Strong international demand helped Delta, American and United during the quarter. But investors are likely to zero in on how airlines can keep costs lean as fuel gets more expensive, Cowen analysts said in a research note.Cowen said it expected unit revenue, a key efficiency gauge that measures airline revenue by its overall flight capacity, to be lower in the second quarter vs. the first. Holiday timing as well as extra seat and flight availability will likely push the metric lower, the firm said.Another concern on Wall Street is United's plan to add more flights to smaller U.S. cities over the next three years. That expansion, announced in January, tanked United's stock, as investors worried that other airlines might retaliate by slashing fares, which attracts passengers but brings thinner profits.Delta, during its first-quarter earnings call on Thursday, said that fuel costs would be the ""wild card"" for 2018, adding that the growth rate of nonfuel unit costs also was ""unacceptably high.""But the carrier plans to offer more premium seats on flights during the year, helping to offset some of that cost growth.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Southwest Outlook Hits Airlines, But Is United The 'Direct' Culprit?United Airlines, American To Wall Street: You Don't Get What We're DoingVirgin Atlantic Follows Delta, United, American With New Economy ClassAirline Industry News And Stocks To Watch

24,DAL,"American Airlines (AAL) on Thursday cut its full-year profit forecast due to higher jet-fuel costs, while Southwest Airlines (LUV) served up a weak sales outlook following an engine blowout on a flight this month that left one passenger dead.Meanwhile, Spirit Airlines (SAVE) reported first-quarter earnings per share that beat analyst expectations. But revenue came up short.Even as higher fuel costs threaten industry profits, travel demand for American and rivals Delta Air Lines (DAL) and United Airlines (UAL) has remained solid. American on Thursday said it expects second-quarter 2018 unit revenue to rise 1.5%-3.5% year over year, citing ""expected continued strength in demand for both business and leisure travel.""However, due to higher fuel prices, the carrier lowered its adjusted full-year earnings-per-share forecast to $5-$6 a share, lower than an earlier outlook for $5.50-$6.50. Analysts had expected $5.74.Shares were down 6.4% at 42.37 in the stock market today but tumbled as much as 10.2% earlier. Delta and United lost 2.8%.For the first quarter, American said unit revenue, or an airline's sales when looked at in relation to its overall flight capacity, rose 3.5%, hitting the midpoint of its own forecasts for a 3%-4% gain. American saw the key industry metric pick up across all its regions, singling out Latin America as a particular area of strength.Earnings surged 23% to 75 cents per share in Q1, beating estimates by a penny, as revenue climbed 6% to $10.4 billion, compared to views for $10.412 billion. But American said that fuel costs jumped 26% during the quarter.Southwest said it expected second-quarter unit revenue to fall 1%-3%, adding that roughly ""one to two points of this estimated decrease is attributable to recent softness in bookings following the Flight 1380 accident.""That accident occurred on April 17 when the left engine of a Boeing (BA) 737 — the workhorse jets that make up Southwest's fleet — ripped open on a flight en route to Dallas from New York. Shrapnel from the explosion shattered a window on the plane, partially pulling a passenger out of the plane. The passenger, Jennifer Riordan, was later pronounced dead at a hospital after the plane made an emergency landing in Philadelphia.The National Transportation Safety Board said the engine, made by a General Electric (GE) joint venture, had shown signs of metal fatigue after a fan blade had broken off from it. The carrier canceled some 40 flights on Sunday for inspections.""It remains a somber time for the Southwest Family following the Flight 1380 accident, and our thoughts and prayers continue to be with the Riordan family, and all of our customers on the flight,"" CEO Gary Kelly said in a statement today.""We continue to cooperate with the National Transportation Safety Board's thorough investigation to understand the cause of the accident,"" the statement continued.But the carrier, which has built its reputation on low fares, could face more scrutiny from analysts and investigators in the wake of the accident. The accident also follows a ""60 Minutes"" report that raised questions about Allegiant Air's (ALGT) safety record.The accident's effect on Southwest's booked flights was harsher than some analysts anticipated.""Our initial thought would be that the 1-2 pts is much more of an impact than we would have expected particularly in the context of Allegiant, whose bookings returned to normal after several days,"" Stifel analyst Joseph DeNardi said in a research note.Southwest's first-quarter earnings per share rose 23% to 75 cents, matching Zacks estimates, although other consensus forecasts came in at 74 cents. Revenue rose nearly 2% to $4.94 billion, just shy of estimates for $5.018 billion.Shares tumbled 1% to 53.30 on Thursday.Southwest last month lowered its first-quarter unit revenue forecast, citing in part, ""the competitive fare environment that continues to pressure passenger revenue yields"". Cowen analysts said they thought the pressure could have been a result of United's planned expansion into smaller cities over the next three years.Meanwhile, ultra low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines' EPS slipped to 44 cents, beating views by a cent, while revenue climbed 19% to $704.14 million, missing estimates for $705 million.Shares tumbled 5.9% to 35.40.Earlier this month, Delta and United sailed through their first-quarter earnings calls, with both companies lifting industry stocks on solid global demand, helped by pricier seats at the front of the cabin. However, as oil costs rise, Delta noted that fuel would be a ""wild card"" in its 2018 profit forecast.But after two earnings calls in which United's plans — or apparent lack thereof — alarmed investors, the carrier last week focused on its bullish global revenue outlook. Analysts suggested the investor goodwill toward United was as much about what it didn't say during the call as what it said.""For good reasons many were nervous about UAL's call, but it was solid and measured,"" Wolfe Research analyst Hunter Keay said in a research note on Friday. ""UAL mainly talked about itself and not others, which is what good companies do, and gave people no reasons to panic about the space.""Similarly, Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth, in a note last week, said United had benefited from a ""lack of controversy"" and a ""lack of aggressive pricing commentary.""Wall Street has been worried that United's plans to expand its flight coverage in the U.S. would prompt other carriers to expand as well, starting a fare-matching war that would damage profits. United's willingness to match discount carriers on their own lower ticket prices has also dismayed investors.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Southwest Airlines Traffic Caps Wild Week For Delta Air, Other Airline StocksUnited Airlines, American To Wall Street: You Don't Get What We're DoingAirline Industry News And Stocks To Watch

25,DAL,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) said Thursday that fuel costs, which jumped 20% in the first quarter, are a source of earnings uncertainty. But it remained bullish on international demand, and said that it planned to add a lot of premium, higher-priced seats to flights this year — a move that could shore up profits as costs rise.Q1 earnings fell 4% to 74 cents a share, beating Zacks Investment Research views by a penny, while revenue climbed 8% to $9.76 billion, missing forecasts for $9.88 billion. Unit revenue grew 5%, in line with Delta's own view.For Q2, Delta predicts EPS of $1.80-$2, in line with Zacks consensus for $1.92, with unit revenue up 3%-5% and capacity up 3%-4%.When asked during a conference call with analysts if Delta is still on target for its 2018 EPS guidance of $6.70, CEO Ed Bastian said it was, but that fuel will be the ""wild card.""Oil prices in the $70-per-barrel range were still manageable and could create more disciplined operations elsewhere, Delta said, adding that non-fuel unit costs are also seeing an ""unacceptably high"" rate of growth.More premium seats are a part of Delta's ""backbone"" for growth, President Glen Hauenstein said, adding that the carrier would be adding a lot more of those seats to flights this year.""We will have double digit increases throughout the year in terms of premium seats in the marketplace,"" he said during the call.The premiums on those higher-end fare classes, he said, ranged from 10% to as much as double the average coach fare, depending on the type.""So that's really a key driver for us, and I think I think one of the reasons we were able to post what I would consider superior revenue numbers for the first quarter,"" he said.Delta shares were up 2.9% at 52.98 in the stock market today. American Airlines (AAL) rose 2.6%, United Airlines (UAL), which reports results next week, added 1.9%, and Southwest (LUV) gained 2.7%.

Such a move could strengthen a rival to the U.S. carriers on the international stage.IAG said it had taken a 4.61% stake in Norwegian. That investment, IAG said, ""is intended to establish a position from which to initiate discussions with Norwegian, including the possibility of a full offer for Norwegian."" But it said no discussions have taken place and that there was no guarantee of a deal.When asked about that possible deal during Delta's earnings call, management did not comment on the potential impact.Low-cost, long-haul carriers that fly between the U.S. and Europe have reshaped competition over the Atlantic. But Delta said unit revenue in its trans-Atlantic routes jumped 12% in Q1. International unit revenue overall was helped by solid business demand and demand for its roomier Comfort Plus seating option.On Tuesday, American raised the low end of its unit revenue guidance. It now expects a 3%-4% increase, up from an earlier view for a 2%-4% gain.And late Monday, United forecast a 2.7% gain in Q1 unit revenue, helped, as with Delta, by a pickup in international travel demand.

26,DAL,"As Delta Air Lines (DAL) coasts into first-quarter earnings season on brisk international demand, investors remain anxious about what United Airlines' (UAL) expansion into smaller U.S. cities means for the industry in the months ahead.XStrong demand globally helped lift the forecast and also likely pushed American Airlines (AAL) and United to ratchet up their own forecasts Tuesday and late Monday, respectively.But American is leading a sell-off in the sector Tuesday after giving Q1 guidance that was less bullish than its peers and seeing its earnings forecast cut by Wall Street.Last week, Delta Air Lines briefly gave airline stocks some relief from Wall Street's trade-war agita when the carrier said that Q1 unit revenue, a much-fixated-upon gauge of an airline's efficiency, would come in at the upper end of its expectations.Analysts expect Delta's earnings per share to fall 5% to 73 cents. Revenue is expected to increase 8% to $9.88 billion. Delta expects unit revenue to increase around 5%.""Unfortunately for Delta, we expect any optimism to be somewhat muted given the fears of a trade war between the world's two largest economies,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note on Tuesday, but added that the U.S.-China tension shouldn't affect near-term travel.The earnings will also follow a string of nasty winter storms that prompted flight cancellations in the northeast. The airline industry is also battling rising jet-fuel costs.Cowen analysts, however, note that United's plans to add more connecting flights between its airport hubs and smaller cities, where it can charge more, begins ""in earnest"" in Q2. Those additions, which will take place over this year, next year and 2020, are part of United's efforts to reclaim what it has called its ""natural"" market share.But Wall Street worries that any such expansion will bring retaliation from rivals. And they worry the retaliation will force airlines to slash fares in order to draw travelers. That kind of competition threatens profits and usually drives airline stocks lower.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth, in a research note, said that cut appeared to largely be the result of ""forecasting errors"" from the carrier.Also Tuesday, American raised the low end of its Q1 unit revenue guidance and now expects a 3%-4% increase, up from an earlier view for a 2%-4% gain. Delta and United, however, guided to the high end of their respective ranges. Cowen also cut its 2019 EPS forecast for American to $6.50 from $6.85.American also said Tuesday that capacity, or an airline's overall flight coverage, would be up 2.5% for the full year on a schedule-over-schedule basis. But it said actual capacity growth would be slightly higher, due to flight cancellations prompted by the hurricanes that hit Florida and the Caribbean last year.""We suspect some of the selloff today is due to the market having priced in a bigger beat than what American guided to – and some seeing the improved guidance as not a beat at all,"" Joseph DeNardi said in a research note. ""In addition, higher oil prices today along with headlines from Saudi expressing its desire for $80/bbl oil is also a headwind.""Late Monday, United said it expected a roughly 2.7% gain in Q1 unit revenue, helped, as with Delta, by a pickup in international travel demand. That forecast was near the upper end of United's earlier expectations for an increase of 1%-3%.Shares of American sank 4.7% in the stock market today, settling at its lowest close since November.

27,DAL,"After two brutal quarters, United Airlines (UAL) got a break from Wall Street on Wednesday following an earnings call in which management talked up strong global demand during the first quarter even as higher oil prices test the industry's cost controls.XThose gains came after United's stock crashed in January, when it announced an expansion of its flights over the next three years, and in October, when its outlook on 2018 proved too vague for analysts and investors.Late Tuesday, the carrier beat Q1 estimates and predicted 2018 capacity growth of 4.5%-5.5% vs. January guidance of 4%-6% growth. In a research note, Stifel analyst Joseph DeNardi called the narrowed plans for expansion a ""surprise,"" and was possibly a result of higher oil prices.Even as jet-fuel prices rise — they surged 26% for United during the quarter — it was the rebound in the energy sector that fueled corporate-travel demand for the carrier, management said Wednesday. Houston, where many top oil and gas companies are headquartered, is also a major United hub.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseMeanwhile, the carrier said it could contain costs elsewhere — by tightening up the supply chain for aircraft parts, improving freight and maintenance programs, and purchasing aircraft off-lease.Pricier seats at the front of the flight cabin also helped results internationally, the company said. Performance in the trans-Atlantic market is expected to lead the way for the carrier in the months ahead.As for the rest of the cabin, United said it would begin selling its premium-economy-style Premium Plus seats later this year. The company said it would roll out a jet with Polaris — its business class with lie-flat seats — every 10 days through 2020.And as demand picks up, management said that flight cabins ""probably"" had fewer available basic economy seats — the carrier's low-cost but highly restrictive fare option.United also said that unit revenue was positive in its San Francisco hub, despite competition picking up on the West Coast.Shares took off in the stock market today, jumping 4.8% to 70.58. Delta Air Lines (DAL), which reported earnings last week, rallied 1.2%.  American Airlines (AAL) surged 4.4%, while and Southwest (LUV) gained 2.9%.That's despite crude futures hitting a new three-year high, rallying 2.9% to $68.47 a barrel on Wednesday.United's results come as the public's attention turns to airline safety.

The timing of Easter in March this year lifted unit revenue by 2.5 points.

36,DAL,"Boeing (BA) is reportedly considering development of two twin-aisle, midrange planes for what analysts have dubbed the ""797"" and is seeking proposals from engine makers.XThe aerospace giant still hasn't decided whether to go forward with what it calls a New Middle Market Airplane, or the NMA, as it tries to answer Airbus' (EADSY) A320neo. But details have emerged for two types of aircraft.One aircraft called the NMA-6X would seat 228 passengers and have a range of 5,000 nautical miles, while the other plane, the NMA-7X, would seat 267 in two classes, but the range would be 800 nautical miles shorter, sources told Air Current.Boeing is looking for an engine that would burn 25% less fuel per pound of thrust vs. the engines on the 757, according to the report, and gave engine makers CFM International, a General Electric (GE)-Safran joint venture, United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt and Whitney and the U.K.'s Rolls-Royce until June 27 to submit final proposals.Boeing shares edged down 0.45% at 329.82 on the stock market today, giving up gains amid a broad market reversal. GE rose 1.6%, United Tech fell 1% and Airbus' U.S.-listed shares lost 1%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseEngines are typically picked closer to the first order date. But sources told the Air Current that Boeing is making the engine decision well ahead of its possible launch.Boeing is having trouble with engine suppliers, who have struggled to keep up with rising production rates and addressing technical problems.Earlier this month, Rolls-Royce found another compressor flaw in its engine for some Boeing 787s, and Pratt and Whitney is struggling to boost production of its geared turbofan engine. GE is also in the midst of a massive restructuring.On June 20 Randy Tinseth, Boeing's VP of marketing, told IBD in Seattle that the current problems with engine makers won't affect the possibility of future deals. He called the issues a ""manageable situation.""Boeing has been shopping the midmarket airplane idea around to carriers for over a year. But few details have emerged about the new plane, which analysts are dubbing the ""797.""Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg last year confirmed that the new plane could seat roughly 250 passengers and have a range of 5,000 nautical miles. If the plane gets the green light for production, it wouldn't enter service until 2025.Tinseth wouldn't give more details about what airlines wanted from the new plane but said after speaking to 50 customers ""we are now at the point where we pretty much understand what they want.""""Our steps moving forward — can we develop a production system that makes sense. And once we develop that production system will the business case come together,"" he said.At the National Press Club in Washington D.C., Wednesday, Delta Air Lines (DAL) CEO Ed Bastian reaffirmed earlier statements that Delta wants to be a launch customer if Boeing goes ahead with the new plane to replace aging 767s and 757s that are set to retire in the next decade.""We have had discussion about being a potential launch customer but it would be premature to make any comment along those lines,"" he said. ""But we think Boeing is interested in getting a feel of the market.""Bastian wouldn't go into specifics about what the carrier wants from a ""797"" but he said he wants range and capacity at a low price point for customers.""Don't want an overload. Sometimes you build an aircraft with too much capability and too much range and that's when it becomes more expensive and you're suboptimal.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch

37,DAL,"United Airlines (UAL) has halted its service for pets that travel in the cargo section of planes following a series of mishandled animals aboard flights, including a Kansas-bound German shepherd that was accidentally flown to Japan and a French bulldog that died after it was placed in an overhead bin.X""We are conducting a thorough and systematic review of our program for pets that travel in the cargo compartment to make improvements that will ensure the best possible experience for our customers and their pets,"" United spokesman Charles Hobart said in an emailed statement. ""To achieve this outcome, we will partner with independent experts in pet safety, comfort and travel.""His statement added that the carrier would not accept any new bookings for PetSafe, the carrier's program for pets that travel in the cargo section, as the review proceeds.

The flight was diverted to Akron, Ohio, where the dog was supposed to be flown.The carrier also faces growing pressure after the death of the French bulldog, which occurred after a flight attendant ordered it placed in an overhead bin. The incident prompted two senators — Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., and Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev. — to introduce a bill that would bar airlines from storing animals in overhead bins. It also caused the Transportation Department and the Federal Aviation Administration to launch investigations.Transportation Department data show that 18 animals died while being handled by United Airlines last year, more than any other carrier reporting to the agency.Shares of United edged up 0.5% on the stock market today. Delta Air Lines (DAL) rose 1%, American Airlines (AAL) added 1.3% and Southwest (LUV) gained 0.15%.United this month also began requiring more documentation from passengers who wanted to board with emotional support animals. That decision followed a jump in passengers traveling with such animals and related problems with them aboard flights. Delta Air Lines made similar changes.United's decisions over its pet policies and employees come nearly a year after it faced outrage after security dragged a passenger from his seat.

Micron tumbled as a Chinese court barred some sales in the country.The electric-car maker managed to top a long-delayed production goal of 5,000 Model 3 sedans in the final week of June. But Tesla skipped a brake test to make the deadline. Overall Q2 vehicle deliveries missed estimates. Tesla bears cited those points in doubting the electric-vehicle maker can maintain and expand its end-of-June pace. Tesla stock popped Monday morning on the Model 3 news but reversed to close lower, then continued to tumble, losing 10% for the week.General Motors (GM) grew new vehicle sales 5% in the second quarter, while Ford Motor (F), Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), Toyota Motor (TM), Honda Motor (HMC) and Nissan (NSANY) all topped estimates for U.S. auto sales in June. A strong June capped stronger-than-expected industrywide sales in the first half of 2018, as SUVs and trucks continue to boom. A solid labor market has kept buyers in the car market, despite rising gas prices and interest rates. The annualized pace of new vehicle sales reached 17.5 million in June after dipping to 16.9 million in May, according to Autodata.Auto stocks are struggling as Trump threatens global auto tariffs, raising supply costs, and they're likely to spur retaliation.

But China slapped new duties on U.S.-made cars Friday following Trump's decision to impose tariffs on high-tech China goods.Biogen (BIIB) and Tokyo-based Eisai announced late Thursday that Phase II tests on their Alzheimer's drug slowed progression of the disease. The drug now known as BAN2401 slowed progression of Alzheimer's in 856 patients with mild dementia over a period of 18 months. Drugmakers have struggled to find treatments for the crippling disease, with many failures along the way. But the potential benefit to a drugmaker and patients is huge. Biogen stock skyrocketed Friday.Micron Technology (MU) says a Chinese court ruled against the memory-chip maker in a patent-infringement case without giving it a chance to present its defense. The injunction covers certain DRAM modules and solid-state drives, representing slightly more than 1% of Micron's annualized revenue. Micron stock tumbled 5.5% on Tuesday, while investors saw the court ruling as part of China's retaliation to Trump tariff threats. Shares rose modestly Thursday.Dell will go public as part of a $21.7 billion deal to acquire its Dell Technologies (DVMT) tracking stock. The move also reduces the likelihood near-term of a merger with virtualization-software maker VMware. VMware declared an $11 billion special cash dividend, with Dell getting roughly $9 billion to help close the DVMT transaction. VMware and Dell also announced a new governance agreement. Dell owns 81% of VMware. VMware stock rose sharply.Crude oil futures eclipsed $75 a barrel Tuesday morning for the first time since 2014.

Domestic crude production held at 10.9 million barrels per day for a third straight week. President Trump continued his attacks on OPEC, tweeting that the cartel should help lower gasoline prices as the U.S. supplies military defense for many member countries.The U.S. added 213,000 jobs in June, more than expected. April and May hiring also were revised higher. Annual wage growth of 2.7% was a bit less than expected, easing Fed rate hike fears.

Fed contacts indicated that tit-for-tat tariffs and escalating trade threats were starting to impact business confidence and investment plans. Several policymakers raised concern about the narrowing of the gap between short-term and long-term Treasury yields, given that an inversion — longer rates falling below shorter ones — historically precedes a recession. Still, the Fed hiked its key rate a quarter-point for the second time in 2018 at the June meeting. Members also issued projections indicating a likelihood of two more rate hikes this year.The Washington Post reported that a federal investigation into Facebook's sharing of data with political consultancy Cambridge Analytica has broadened to focus on the tech giant's actions and statements.

43,DAL,"U.K. airline Virgin Atlantic will offer a new basic-economy-like seating class starting this spring, along with two other sections in the main cabin, mimicking efforts by partner Delta Air Lines (DAL) as well as U.S. rivals like American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL).X The move comes as competition on flights over the Atlantic to and from Europe escalated last year, as more low-cost, long-haul carriers like Norwegian Air Shuttle and Iceland's WOW air chipped away at territory long dominated by legacy airlines.Virgin Atlantic's economy class will now be split up into Economy Light, Economy Delight and Economy Classic, and the carrier is overhauling its fleet to install up to 36 Economy Delight seats on every flight.Virgin also will add 12 new widebody Airbus (EADSY) A350-1000 jets, which went into service last month and can seat as many as 440 passengers, to its fleet starting in the spring of 2019. The new jets will have ""a brand-new Economy cabin designed with Virgin Atlantic's customers in mind.""The remake of the carrier's flight cabin, which it said is the biggest change to its economy seating in more than a decade, is part of a 300 million-pound investment.""We know that one size doesn't fit all, and from spring our customers can afford to be choosy and still travel in the UK's leading economy cabin,"" Virgin Atlantic CEO Craig Kreeger said in a statement.Virgin's move also contrasts with some of its European rivals, which have launched their own low-cost subsidiaries to attract passengers seeking cheap travel abroad rather than segment mainline cabins.One such airline, Level, created by British Airways parent International Airlines Group, offers flights to cities like Oakland and Los Angeles. Air France has launched an airline called Joon, which intends to attract digitally-savvy millennials and plans to offer flights to Brazil.Shares of Delta closed up 2.1% on the stock market today, but hit resistance at their 50-day average.

Economy Light allows no refunds or changes. Meals, drinks and snacks are still included.That new fare, Virgin Atlantic said, would make ""long haul travel affordable and accessible for millennials, and customers jetting off on city breaks."" Virgin announced the new fares on Wednesday.As for the other two new sections on Virgin Atlantic flights, Economy Delight will give passengers priority check-in and boarding, advanced seat assignments and 34 inches of legroom. Economy Classic now offers a free seat assignment. Both those fares include meals, drinks, snacks and one checked bag, allow free seat selection at any time and can be upgraded with miles.In the U.S., the three big carriers have characterized Basic Economy as a defensive move of sorts, and one intended to steer passengers toward higher-cost types of seating.American this month said it would introduce its low-cost, high-restriction Basic Economy fares on some trans-Atlantic flights in April. The airline has also brought its Premium Economy service to international flights.Delta, which sells Basic Economy tickets on more than half its flights to Europe, said this week that it would expand its Basic Economy service in Mexico.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:United Airlines' Employee Lottery On 'Pause' After Fierce BacklashDelta's 750 Flight Cancellations Threaten Revenue As Georgia Threatens ProfitAirline Industry News And Stocks To Watch

45,DAL,"Management from United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) essentially urged Wall Street to relax Tuesday, arguing that massive stock sell-offs from the past year reflected a misunderstanding of how the industry works today.X Still, United, Delta Air Lines (DAL) and Hawaiian Airlines parent Hawaiian Holdings (HA) managed to give airline investors some of what they typically want from the industry on Tuesday, with all three raising their unit revenue forecasts for the first quarter.The remarks from United and American, along with the new forecast from Delta, came at the J.P. Morgan Aviation, Transportation and Industrials Conference. They also follow several months in which shares of those carriers were jolted downward over concerns that the industry might relapse into their old habits of overexpanding and cutting prices too aggressively — things that wear on airlines' profits and have forced many of them to go bankrupt in years past.United's shares sustained double-digit drops in October, after the carrier appeared unprepared to answer questions about 2018, and again in January, after its plans to add flights to smaller cities raised fears of another fare war.United expects to boost its total flight capacity, or an airline's overall available seats and flight coverage, by around 4%-6% this year and at a similar rate next year and 2020. The move, United said in January, would help it strengthen flight connectivity to smaller cities where passengers are likelier to pay more to fly. But management sought to clarify that on Tuesday.""All capacity is not created equal,"" Kirby said. ""Growing in a hub and growing connectivity in a hub is dramatically different than point-to-point growth.""United raised its Q1 unit-revenue forecast to a 1%-3% gain, up from flat to up 2%, as the carrier draws more money from passengers buying tickets closer to flight departures in the U.S. and sees ""healthy bookings"" for flights over the Atlantic. Results in the Pacific have gotten better, helped by United's premium fare classes, and the carrier sees ""positive trends"" in Latin America.Ultracheap Basic Economy flight tickets will be available in Latin America and on flights over the Atlantic later this year, with a premium economy fare class expected in the fourth quarter internationally. Kirby said United is also ""working on ways"" to add new premium economy service on domestic flights.United also sees Q1 capacity coming in up 3.5%-4%, trimmed from an earlier outlook for 3.5%-4.5%.""If there is even a hint about United reducing their 2018 capacity growth, it would be a key positive driver for the stocks,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note before the conference.Shares closed up 0.8% at 72.60 in the stock market today.CEO Doug Parker displayed a chart that showed a series of hits the carrier's stock has been dealt since earlier last year, due to pricing concerns, bad news out of rivals' earnings calls, and United's new plans to grow, announced in January.""Every one of these times, to us, felt like overreaction,"" he said.Instead, investors ought to worry about things like expanding to new markets that didn't touch one of the carrier's airport hubs, adding new hubs, and large orders for aircraft that weren't primarily for replacement.""These things aren't going to happen again,"" Parker said.Shares edged down 0.5% at 56.23 but remain in a buy zone.Delta raised its Q1 unit-revenue forecast to a 4%-5% increase, up from an earlier forecast of 2.5%-4.5%, with leisure and business travel improving. But the high end of Delta's earnings-per-share and margin forecasts got cut due to accounting changes. The carrier kept its expected capacity growth at around 3%.The company also sees a 3%-4% unit-cost increase in Q1, potentially more than the 2%-4% forecast in January, due in part to ""weather-related expenses."" Delta in recent weeks has had to cancel scores of flights due to winter storms on the East Coast. Shares rose 0.8%.Hawaiian shares gapped up 3.3% after the carrier hiked its Q1 outlook for unit revenue. The carrier sees the metric rising 3%-5%, an improvement from its original forecast of down 0.5% to up 2.5%.Southwest (LUV) stock rose 1%, and JetBlue (JBLU) gained 1.4%.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Virgin Atlantic Follows Delta, United, American With New Economy ClassAirline Industry News And Stocks To WatchGE Snags Huge SpiceJet Deal As India Delivers Blow To United Tech's Jet Unit

46,DAL,"Here is your Investing Action Plan for Tuesday — what you need know as an investor for the coming day.X Sports retail chain Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) and China Lodging Group (HTHT) report fourth-quarter earnings. Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) present at the J.P. Morgan Aviation, Transportation and Industrials Conference.Wall Street will also be watching for Consumer Price Index data, a key measure of inflation.Dick's Sporting Goods' fourth-quarter earnings will follow the retailer's decision to stop selling assault-style rifles and raise the minimum age for gun purchases to 21 in the wake of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. Kroger (KR) and Walmart (WMT) have also raised their minimum gun-purchase age to 21.American Outdoor Brands (AOBC), the company formerly known as Smith & Wesson Holding, said the decision would have a minimal effect on sales. A former business analyst recently told USA Today that the same was true for Dick's, arguing that its customers go there for apparel and other gear related to team sports rather than firearms.Meanwhile, Dick's has been investing more in e-commerce, but has remained concerned about aggressive competitive discounting from rival retailers.Wall Street expects Dick's fourth-quarter earnings per share to fall 9% to $1.20, with revenue up 10% to $2.732 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research. Same-store sales are expected to fall 1.2%, according to Consensus Metrix.Dick's rose 2% to 32.56 in the stock market today. Hibbett Sports (HIBB), which reports on Friday, was down 1.75%. Foot Locker (FL), which this month forecast lackluster sales for the first quarter, rose 1.1%.Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and United Airlines are set to present at the J.P. Morgan Aviation, Transportation and Industrials Conference. The conference follows United's announcement in January that it would be growing capacity — or an airline's supply of seats and flights — this year, next year and 2020. That decision, combined with the carrier's promise to keep matching fares from low-cost rivals, revived Wall Street's anxieties of a protracted airfare battle.For now, though, some analysts expect that the financial forecasts the airlines are likely to issue during the conference will be good news for airline stocks.""We expect the airlines to update 1Q18 investor guidance, and suspect the updates will be positive given relatively modest industry capacity growth in 1Q18, declining jet fuel costs, and continued global economic improvement,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note.She added: ""If there is even a hint about United reducing their 2018 capacity growth, it would be a key positive driver for the stocks.""Delta edged up 0.1%, while United Air climbed 0.6%.American cleared a 55.70 cup-with-handle base on Friday, but volume was well below normal. Shares rose 0.8% to 56.60, also in light trade. Meanwhile, the relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is at a very short-term high but hasn't made headway since late 2016.Delta and United are in consolidations.China Lodging Group, a hotel operator in China, reports fourth-quarter results amid solid travel demand in the nation, whose economy and middle class have grown over the years. The company as of Sept. 30 operated nearly 3,700 hotels in 375 cities, with much of its business geared toward economy and midtier hotels.Estimates were unavailable from Zacks.Shares found support at their 50-day line Monday, rallying to close up 0.5% at 154.50.The stock is near a 161 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. But China Lodging is in a fourth-stage base. Late-stage bases can work, but they are more likely to fail than first- or second-stage bases.Consumer Price Index data are set to be released by the Labor Department at 8:30 a.m. ET. Consensus is for a 0.2% monthly gain and a 2.2% increase year over year. Core inflation, which strips out food and energy, is seen posting a 1.9% annual gain.Wall Street in recent weeks has grown more concerned about potentially higher prices and whether the rebounding U.S. economy can handle them.The Fed has a 2% inflation target.

47,DAL,"United Airlines (UAL) on Monday said it was ""pressing the pause button"" on a lottery-like program that was set to replace its quarterly bonus program, a move that angered many employees.X ""Our intention was to introduce a better, more exciting program, but we misjudged how these changes would be received by many of you,"" President Scott Kirby said in a message to employees.""So, we are pressing the pause button on these changes to review your feedback and consider the right way to move ahead,"" the message continued. ""We will be reaching out to work groups across the company, and the changes we make will better reflect your feedback.""The conflict began out in the open last week, after the Chicago Business Journal reported that United was eliminating the performance bonuses eligible employees had been receiving each quarter and replacing them with a program called core4 Score Rewards.Every quarter, that new program would offer a single grand prize of $100,000 to a single employee, along with 10 Mercedes C-Class sedans, big vacation packages and cash bonuses of between $2,000 and $5,000.""Awful idea,"" ""insulting,"" ""not cool"" were among the reactions from United employees — part of some 500 comments posted to United's employee website that were reviewed by Inc.Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

In order to qualify for the lottery, employees had to have perfect attendance during the quarter.""I can't imagine driving the Mercedes into the employee lot while everyone around me that worked just as hard, or harder got nothing,"" one employee said, according to Inc. ""I would feel like such a jerk. It's quite telling about the people who thought this up.

In January, United shares tanked after the carrier said it would expand flight coverage over the next few years – a move intended to help the carrier regain relevance in small cities but which raised fears of a new airfare war.After a passenger was dragged from a United Express flight in April, the incident led to a settlement, congressional scrutiny and a debate about airlines' boarding practices.Meanwhile, as the East Coast battled a winter storm carrying some harsh winds, a United flight on Friday traveling to Washington Dulles International Airport in Virginia from Charlottesville, Va., also went through severe turbulence that also upset passengers.""Pretty much everyone on the plane threw up,"" according to a pilot's report.

51,DAL,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) has canceled roughly 750 flights heading to and from the Northeast ahead of a harsh winter storm bearing down on the region, the company said on Friday, and the CEO said the airline was ""troubled"" by blowback from Georgia lawmakers after its decision to distance itself from the National Rifle Association.X The cancellations, which threaten Delta's unit revenue, came a day after Georgia lawmakers passed a tax bill stripped of a jet-fuel tax exemption that could have padded profits for the Atlanta-based carrier.Gov. Nathan Deal appears likely to sign the bill. However, he said he would push for a jet-fuel tax exemption separately, according to MarketWatch.Delta, along with other companies, has cut ties with the gun-advocacy group following a shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., that left 17 people dead.On Saturday, Delta canceled a one-time group travel discount for the NRA's annual meeting and asked that the group remove the carrier's name and logo from its website.

American Airlines (AAL) narrowed its early loss to 2.9% as lowered full-year earnings guidance diluted strong unit revenue growth and a narrow earnings beat for the first quarter.  Southwest Airlines (LUV) dumped 3.8% following mixed first-quarter results.

Transportation powered the beat. Core orders, minus transportation were down 0.1% for the month, and below forecasts for a 0.6% increase.First-time unemployment claims slowed to 209,000 in the week ended April 21, the Labor Department estimated. That was down from an already low 233,000 claims in the prior week, falling to what was reportedly the lowest level in 48 years, and undercutting economist views for a slight decrease to 230,000 new filings.RELATED:Nasdaq Jumps As Facebook, PayPal Climb; This Retailer Poised For Gap Up Open Dow Outperforms Thanks To Boeing; Nasdaq Recovers But Growth Stocks Hit HardApple Faces 'Gloom and Doom' Ahead Of EarningsWhy Winning Stocks Are Strong Price Performers Before Big Price MovesBitcoin, Other Cryptocurrencies Slide After Wall Provider HackedThese 4 Apparel Stocks Look Fashionable As They Outperform Market

The changes take hold March 1 and follow a surge in customers bringing emotional support animals onto flights.X Those measures — the announcements of which blend corporate speak with mentions of snakes, hedgehogs and tiny marsupials known as sugar gliders — are being put in place for safety purposes and lack of regulations, those companies said.American Airlines (AAL) has said it is reviewing its policies. Southwest (LUV), following an incident Wednesday in which a dog bit a young girl, said it is ""constantly evaluating"" its policies, but did not say directly whether it was giving its support-animal policies more scrutiny than normal.Here's how the companies are dealing.Delta in January said as of March 1, customers traveling with an emotional support animal will need to submit a signed veterinary health form and/or an up-to-date immunization record, a letter signed by a medical professional and a form verifying the animal's training. Customers need to send that documentation to Delta at least 48 hours in advance of their flight.Delta said it had seen an 84% increase in ""animal incidents"" since 2016. Those incidents included biting, urination and defecation. They also included a man who suffered 28 stitches' worth of facial injuries, according to his lawyer, after the man was attacked by an emotional support dog aboard a flight in June.""Customers have attempted to fly with comfort turkeys, gliding possums known as sugar gliders, snakes, spiders and more,"" the carrier said in a release last month.""Ignoring the true intent of existing rules governing the transport of service and support animals can be a disservice to customers who have real and documented needs,"" that release continued.Starting March 1, United passengers with an emotional support animal will need to provide health and vaccination forms signed by the animal's veterinarian.United passengers will also need confirmation from the veterinarian that the animal isn't a threat, and confirmation that the animal has been trained to behave well in public spaces. That's in addition to an existing requirement that passengers with such animals provide 48 hours' notice and a letter from a mental health professional.While that announcement came shortly after a United passenger was barred from bringing aboard a large peacock, Charles Hobart, a United representative, said the carrier had begun reviewing their policy around the end of the summer. Delta's announcement, he said, helped the company decide ""to move forward at a quicker pace"" with the policy change.The carrier last year flew about 76,000 emotional support animals, an increase of roughly 77% vs. 2016, he said. The increase in incidents, he said, was ""comparable"" to that seen at Delta.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersAmerican Airlines has said it is reviewing its policy on emotional support animals. It was unclear when a decision might be made on the matter or how likely a change would be.""Within the past few weeks we've (taken) a closer look at it after other carriers have announced plans to do something similar,"" said Matt Miller, a spokesman for American, in an interview early this month.Passengers who travel on American currently need to provide a letter from a licensed doctor showing that the passenger has a recognized emotional disability and needs the animal during and after the flight.Between 2016 and 2017, American saw a more than 40% increase of customers who transported support or service animals.Southwest passengers who want to travel with an emotional support animal need documentation that's less than a year old, from a licensed mental-health or medical professional, saying that the passenger needs the animal and has a mental or emotional disability recognized in the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.That medical professional also needs to include the date and type of their license and the area where it was issued.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Airline Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsThese Fightin' Words From United Just Ignited Another Airline MeltdownAmerican Airlines Backs Growth Plans, Outlook Despite Price War Fears

55,DAL,"FedEx (FDX) was accused of having a ""secret deal"" with the NRA and the firearms industry in an article posted on the left-wing Think Progress website which said it obtained a confidential, internal document.X The article claims FedEx allows 86 firearms manufacturers and dealers to use two-day shipping, despite its own policy of requiring firearms to be delivered overnight, providing customers a lower-cost option and improving the company's competitiveness against rival UPS (UPS).When asked about the article and the leaked document, FedEx did not deny it, saying the company ""handles all regulated commodities in accordance with the laws and regulations applicable to all common carriers.""""Any internal list that shows customer names is confidential and not authorized for public disclosure because FedEx protects the privacy rights of our customers,"" said FedEx in a statement provided to IBD.FedEx's relationship with the gun industry has come under additional scrutiny this week, after it distanced itself from the NRA's views on gun laws but maintained its shipping discounts for NRA members.Meanwhile, companies like Delta Air Lines (DAL), Hertz Global (HTZ) and Metlife (MET) have cut business ties with the gun lobbying group, following last month's mass shooting at a Florida high school that left 17 dead.In a separate statement, FedEx said rival UPS (UPS) also offers shipping discounts to NRA members, though UPS has denied that.""To be clear, FedEx and UPS are saying the same thing about the NRA: UPS provides discounted shipping rates to the NRA, which uses UPS for shipping,"" said Patrick Fitzgerald, FedEx's senior vice president of integrated marketing and communications. ""FedEx provides discounted shipping rates to independent small businesses and other members of the NRA through our alliance marketing program — rates that are consistent with those offered to more than 1 million members of hundreds of other associations.""He added that both FedEx and UPS are ""common carriers"" under federal law, meaning they are obligated to provide service to customers who do business legally and comply with the company's terms and conditions.FedEx shares closed down 1.1% at 243.70 on the stock market today.

The USPS does allow handguns such as relics, museum exhibits, air guns and certain handgun parts to be shipped. In addition it allows handguns to be shipped to qualified persons, such as armed forces officers and law enforcement.Meanwhile, UPS has said it has not been either a sponsor of the NRA or offered a special discount program to members. The NRA online store lists UPS and USPS as shippers of NRA-branded merchandise.""UPS is a common carrier. If the shipper, in this case the NRA, is engaged in lawful conduct, has an item that is legal to ship, and agrees to the company's terms and conditions regarding the shipment, UPS will transport their shipment from origin to destination.

""Recent events demonstrate the need for additional action on the part of responsible gun retailers.""Kroger's decision comes after Dick's and Walmart announced on Wednesday that they would both increase the purchasing age of firearms to 21. Dick's said it would stop selling assault rifles altogether, which Walmart has not done since 2015. In addition to increasing the age to purchase guns and ammunition, Walmart said it would stop the sale of items ""resembling assault-style rifles,"" such as airsoft guns and toys.""We take seriously our obligation to be a responsible seller of firearms,"" Walmart said in a statement posted on its website Wednesday evening. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based chain said it requires ""customers to pass a background check before purchasing any firearm.""Dick's said it would stop selling assault rifles like the one used in the Parkland, Florida high school massacre on Feb. 14. Walmart stopped selling them in 2015, citing slow sales.The decision by America's largest retailer is the latest by companies re-evaluating their relationship with the firearms industry. Last week, MetLife (MET), Symantec (SYMC), and Enterprise said they would no longer offer discounts to members of the National Rifle Association.

57,DAL,"Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) announced Wednesday that it would stop selling assault-style rifles and high-capacity magazines in its stores and pushed for gun control measures from Congress, the strongest stance yet from a company in the wake of the Parkland shooting earlier this month.X The sporting goods company also said it won't sell guns to anyone under 21, regardless of state laws that allow gun sales to 18-year-olds.Dick's is the latest company to take action after the killing of 17 people at the Florida school.Delta Air Lines (DAL), rental car firm Hertz (HTZ), and the insurer MetLife (MET)  cut ties with the National Rifle Association amid a backlash for offering members discounts. United Airlines (UAL) said it will no longer offer a discounted rate to the NRA's annual meeting.Yet despite the growing pressure, FedEx (FDX) said it will continue to honor its discount for NRA members.Dick's shares closed up 0.7% at 32.02 on the stock market today.

58,DAL,"Some of the nation's biggest airlines and financial institutions — including Delta Air Lines (DAL) and Bank of America (BAC) — over the weekend became the latest corporations to rethink their relationship with the gun industry after a shooting at a Parkland, Fla., high school that left 17 dead.X In doing so, those companies join Symantec (SYMC), Hertz (HTZ), MetLife (MET) and others who have said they would end the discounts they offer to members of the National Rifle Association or otherwise re-evaluate their ties with the gun industry.The NRA, in a statement on Saturday, called the moves ""a shameful display of political and civic cowardice."" The companies' decisions follow a growing backlash, much of it led by students, against the gun lobby and lawmakers that have been reluctant to pass tougher firearm restrictions in the wake of the shooting, which took place on Feb. 14 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.Delta Air Lines on Saturday said it would end discounted rates through its group travel program. Similarly, United Airlines (UAL) on Saturday said it would no longer offer a discounted rate to the NRA's annual meeting Both airlines said they were asking to have their information removed from the NRA website.But in response to Delta's move, Georgia's senate blocked a bill that would've provided the airline a tax break on jet fuel.Bank of America, meanwhile, said in a statement to Axios over the weekend that it would ""examine what we can do to help end the tragedy of mass shootings"" and ""engage the limited number of clients we have that manufacture assault weapons for nonmilitary use to understand what they can contribute to this shared responsibility.""And the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that Blackstone Group (BX) had asked outside fund managers to provide information about any ownership they have in companies that sell or manufacture guns.And State Street (STT) also said it would be ""engaging with weapons manufacturers and distributors"" to learn more about promoting ""safe and responsible use of their products,"" according to Reuters. The company is a big shareholder in American Outdoor Brands (AOBC), formerly known as Smith & Wesson Holdings, and Sturm Ruger (RGR).The NRA has more than 5 million members. How the decisions from the companies, many of which control a huge part of their overall markets, might affect business is unclear.""The loss of a discount will neither scare nor distract one single NRA member from our mission to stand and defend the individual freedoms that have always made America the greatest nation in the world,"" the group's statement said.Shares of firearm companies plunged after President Trump's election. Trump campaigned on a platform of lax gun restrictions. Wall Street was betting the absence of any regulatory threat would create less urgency to buy guns. Gun sales fell sharply in 2017.Sturm Ruger, during its Q4 earnings call last week, briefly commented on the Florida shooting.""Although this call is intended to focus on our business, like all Americans, we also struggle with the shock and sadness of these horrible events,"" Sturm Ruger said. ""We will continue to stand by our model as arms makers for responsible citizens but we are people too and are impacted when tragedies like this occur in our communities.""Sturm Ruger fell 2.1% on the stock market today. American Outdoor Brands slid 2.9% to its worst close in three years.

61,DAL,"Roadie — a startup that gets everyday folks to deliver packages while on their way to wherever they're already driving — has notched a lot of oddball same-day delivery jobs that Amazon (AMZN) doesn't do. A glass aquarium from Fountain Valley to Long Beach, Calif. A set of keys to someone locked out of her house in Georgia at 2 a.m. A box of trial evidence from San Francisco to Napa in time for a panicked lawyer's court date.Around 80%-85% of its shipments are same-day affairs, fueled partly by individuals with curious packages, but mostly by bigger businesses. And Roadie, which provides Kroger (KR) grocery delivery in select areas and brings lost luggage to Delta Air Lines (DAL) customers in about 40 markets, is not alone.Roadie rivals Instacart and Deliv have separately joined forces with Walmart (WMT), Costco (COST), Kroger, Macy's (M) and Best Buy (BBY) on same-day shipping. Target (TGT) even went so far as to acquire Shipt for $550 million. The bull's-eye is ""becoming the first retailer to offer same-day delivery nationwide,"" said Target CEO Brian Cornell last month at retail conference Shoptalk.The driving force behind this latest retail trend, as ever, is Amazon. Its Prime same-day delivery service follows a free-shipping perk that is now a de facto requirement for online shopping. But after scrambling to catch up to Amazon on free shipping, these old brick-and-mortar titans are rushing to stay ahead of the e-commerce giant on same-day delivery. And this next online battleground might actually tilt in their favor, some analysts say.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSpeedy delivery doesn't come cheap. Customers could pay anywhere from $5.99 to $9.99 per shipment for the pleasure. But demand continues to mount, which makes it ""absolutely essential"" for retailers in order to compete in this ""instant-gratification economy,"" said Retail Metrics head Ken Perkins, who thinks one-hour delivery might be the next goal. ""People want to see a package on their door when they return from work.""As President Trump continues tweeting his rage at Amazon on a near-daily basis over its use of the U.S. Postal Service, it's the Shipts and Instacarts and Delivs (not to mention the Postmates and DoorDashes in food delivery) that are harvesting this ripe market. And they may not even emerge as the biggest winners. Instead, logistics giants like UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX) have the scale and infrastructure to capture at least 80% of the future same-day delivery market, a 2017 McKinsey report noted.To a physical store, looking to a web-based firm to hurry along online orders might seem like hastening one's own demise.But the McKinsey report called same-day a ""$200 billion opportunity for retailers in Europe and North America over the next decade."" And it pinpointed brick-and-mortar stores as potentially recapturing turf from online pure plays.The firm said that only traditional retailers ""have the dense network of physical stores to support same-day order fulfillment and delivery.""Perhaps surprisingly, that dinosaur of retail — shopping malls! — is also poised to benefit from the interest in same-day delivery.Daphne Carmeli, CEO of delivery startup Deliv, had an aha! moment when she realized that this could offer shopping centers a ""line of sight ... into e-commerce revenue"" that they wouldn't otherwise have.If you live in Palo Alto, Calif., and place an order on Macys.com, for example, that purchase is likely to be shipped out from a nonlocal distribution center in, say, Atlanta. In that scenario, only Macy's and UPS make money off that transaction.But if you place that online order through Deliv, and the nearby Stanford Shopping Center fulfills that order (and a few dozen others) from its own in-house Macy's, then the mall owner gets some of that revenue, because of the way that leases are structured.Malls ""make money on real estate and rent,"" said Carmeli, adding, ""the more sales the actual Macy's makes, the more the actual mall operator makes.""Which is why malls are willing to carve out parts of their own budgets to hire runners to fulfill Deliv orders. Deliv has partnered exclusively with — and has strategic investments from — major operators Simon Property Group (SPG), Westfield, General Growth Properties (GGP) and Macerich.Luckily for Deliv and its rivals, the technology to make same-day drop-offs happens to have come a long way since the early dot-com days. Deliv's Carmeli, whose company serves 1,400 cities across 35 U.S. markets, was once told her idea was the ""stupidest idea ever.""""Do you remember Webvan? Do you remember Kozmo? Do you remember all the hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars that were deployed to build up these companies that ended up exploding in colossal fashion?"" she recalls being asked.Deliv, like many of its peers, avoids being blown up by using modern-age technology to orchestrate an algorithmic symphony of scheduled pickups and drop-offs from nearly 150 retailers — including Macy's, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), Sam's Club and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Express — straight to people's homes.Retailers nowadays have a better grip on inventory visibility, says Carmeli. And smartphones make it easy to crowdsource drivers.Her predecessors, like Leonardo da Vinci dreaming up helicopters in the early 1500s, tried to make same-day work on a mass scale before the right equipment existed.Boston Retail Partners analyst Scott Langdoc knows that serious pain. As a former C-suite exec at ""mini-Webvan"" delivery company PDQuick at the start of the new millennium, he says that Google Maps would have made all the difference.""If I had the tools that are available today, starting with Google Maps but fast-forwarding to the (artificial intelligence and machine learning) tools that are available today, it's amazing to think what I could've done at my scale or what Webvan or Kozmo could've done at their scale,"" he said.Like many of its peers of the time, PDQuick didn't survive. It was bought out and went back to its roots as a scaled-down SoCal neighborhood delivery service, Pink Dot.""What we'd intended to do before the 2001 implosion was basically do what Shipt did, which was to generalize the delivery and logistics capability for any retail platform so we could bring in inventory. A retailer brought in drivers and you would be able, based on location, to provide that capability,"" said Langdoc.""Fast forward 15 years, that is what Shipt is; that is what Instacart is.""That doesn't mean that same-day delivery is not without major challenges. It's expensive, for one. And as grocery delivery emerges as the next massive battleground, the stakes are being raised beyond mere speedy delivery of things like T-shirts, to more delicate items like yogurt and tomatoes.Even first movers are encountering issues.""It's not free and you can lose an awful lot of money trying to do it for free,"" said Moody's analyst Charlie O'Shea. ""Amazon will approach $10 billion in absorbed delivery costs this year. There aren't a lot of companies that have the ability to absorb that, either from a financial flexibility perspective or shareholder patience.""That has bestowed upon Amazon a ""fairly significant advantage,"" he said.Still, other companies have advantages too. If any physical retailer could conceivably take on same-day delivery in-house, it's Walmart, say experts.So far, Walmart's grocery-delivery pilot employs its own trucks in just one of six test markets, Denver. It relies on Deliv in San Jose and on Uber in Dallas, Orlando, Phoenix and Tampa.The Bentonville, Ark.-based mega-retailer recently declared that over 40% of American households across more than 100 cities will have access to its online grocery delivery service by year-end. That effort is expected to add thousands more to its already 18,000-strong force of personal shoppers.On Tuesday, Walmart said it enlisted courier Postmates to deliver online grocery orders starting in Charlotte, N.C., before rolling out to other cities.""We know one thing's for sure: that (customers) want a delivery option and so we're committed to that,"" Walmart spokesperson Molly Blakeman told Investor's Business Daily in late January. The company filed to trademark grocery delivery-related ""Wam! by Walmart"" earlier in the year, which Blakeman confirmed is associated with active, ongoing projects.Still, even as analysts agree that same-day shipping, including grocery delivery, has to be an option for shoppers now, some question if the effort is worth it.""In this arms race to provide faster delivery, are you providing too many resources to a very small niche product, or a small niche customer base?"" asked Moody's O'Shea.There are more households in America that make less than $30,000 a year than more than $100,000, he said. So the idea of same-day, for most products, isn't hugely compelling at current price points.""I would not say that the demand is minimal, it just has a definite ceiling — at least as far as the pricing stays where it is,"" echoed Euromonitor analyst Tim Barrett.And if you're wondering whether same-day delivery could ever scale up and reach rural settings, the answer is: ""No way,"" he said, laughing.""Simply put, that's not going to happen,"" said Barrett. ""We have seen traditional grocery stores struggle to sustain enough traffic to justify real estate and actual brick and mortar, let alone expensive delivery, let alone even more expensive same-day delivery.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Amazon Vs.

68,DAL,"Boeing (BA) on Tuesday announced more than $900 million in service orders with Asian airlines and other companies at the Singapore Airshow, while the jet maker was reportedly competing with Airbus (EADSY) for a massive order from the Indian airline Vistara.X The jostling comes as the aviation industry tries to tap a rapidly growing and competitive travel market in Asia and more carriers weigh options for additional long-haul flights. Those moves could pit other carriers against the likes of global airlines like Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) internationally.Demand for Asia-Pacific carriers jumped 9.4% last year, as the economy expands and travelers enjoy a broader array of route options, the International Air Transport Association said last week. The region makes up a third of Airbus' new business, the company said.Vistara, an affiliate of Singapore Airlines, was negotiating with the two jet makers to buy up to $8.5 billion worth of new planes — an order likely to consist of 50 narrow-body, short-haul jets and as many as 10 wide-body jets, sources told Bloomberg.The new jets, according to the report, would allow Vistara to offer flights to areas like New York and London.For the narrow-body planes, Bloomberg said, Vistara would likely be deciding between the Airbus A321neo and Boeing's 737 Max — the companies' more fuel-efficient, single-aisle workhorses — and Boeing's 787 Dreamliner and the Airbus A330neo for the wide-body planes.Airbus, at the airshow on Tuesday, also said it was looking ""very, very closely"" at whether it should boost production rates of its single-aisle A320s as air-travel demand jumps in nations like China and India.Shares of Boeing were up 3.7% on the stock market today, and Airbus rose 3.3%.

Broadcom is shifting its headquarters to the U.S. from Singapore, but the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States cited concerns about its ties to China, including firms like Huawei. The interagency body also was worried that the U.S. would lose its leadership position in 5G wireless technology if Qualcomm was acquired by the notoriously low-R&D Broadcom. Analysts say Broadcom is likely to remain acquisitive, but will pursue smaller chip firms. A day after abandoning its pursuit of Qualcomm, Broadcom reported fiscal first-quarter sales and earnings that beat Wall Street's targets, but gave in-line revenue guidance for the current quarter amid a sharp decline in wireless chip sales.The digital media and marketing software firm earned an adjusted $1.55 a share, up 65% year over year, on sales of $2.08 billion, up 24%, in its fiscal first quarter ended March 2.

70,DAL,"The International Trade Commission is expected to weigh in Friday on Boeing's (BA) trade dispute with Bombardier, as reports point to a likely win for the U.S. aerospace giant.X The ITC will decide on whether to approve the Commerce Department's recommendation to hit the Canadian company's C Series jet with a near-300% duty on sales to American carriers.Boeing has claimed Bombardier was able to sell the aircraft at ""absurdly low prices"" in the U.S. after receiving $3 billion in government subsidies. Bombardier has said Boeing's case has no merit and that its actual intent is to force Bombardier out of the 100-seat market as it looks to acquire a competing maker of small jets.Despite this, a Canadian government source told Reuters Thursday that Bombardier is likely to lose the case, saying ""It is not a multilateral or independent or unbiased tribunal. It's an American tribunal.""Shares of Boeing rallied 2.5% Thursday to close at 343.11. U.S.-listed shares of Airbus (EADSY), which has taken a majority stake in the C Series line, fell 3%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.The dispute began in April last year after Boeing complained about a Delta Air Lines (DAL) order for 75 C Series jets.Boeing has claimed Bombardier sold each 108-133-seat  CS100 for just $19.6 million, arguing they actually cost $33.2 million to make.In September, the Commerce Department proposed a tariff of 219.6% on the Canadian jets, then added an additional 79.8% tariff the following month.In response, Bombardier struck a deal with Boeing's rival Airbus, which saw the European firm take a 50.1% stake in the C Series line for no cash outlay. The aviation giant also plans to open an assembly line in Alabama to build C Series planes for the U.S. market. Bombardier says that will create more than 2,000 permanent U.S. jobs.The trade dispute has spilled over to Boeing's customers.In December, Delta Air Lines snubbed Boeing by placing a massive midsize jet order with Airbus. The airline had been in talks with Boeing about buying around 100 of its 737 Max 10 jets, but opted instead to buy 100 A321neos, worth $12.7 billion at list prices, though airlines typically get steep discounts for major deals.The ruling could also affect sales of Boeing military hardware in the U.K., as 4,200 Bombardier jobs in Northern Ireland could be at risk over the decision.""This is not the behavior we expect from Boeing and it could indeed jeopardize our future relationship with them,"" British Defense Secretary Michael Fallon said last year. The U.K. has a Boeing P-8 maritime surveillance plane on order, along with a fleet of new Apache attack helicopters.In addition, British Prime Minister Theresa May said that she was ""bitterly disappointed"" by the decision to impose tariffs after she had personally asked for President Trump's help in the dispute.Canadian officials also threatened to cancel a planned purchase of 18 Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet jets due to the decision, with officials claiming the C Series supported 23,000 jobs in the U.S. and that the jet's engine is made by United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney unit.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsAirline Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

""It is also a victory for U.S. airlines and the U.S. traveling public. The C Series is the most innovative and efficient new aircraft in a generation. Its development and production represent thousands of jobs in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.""And the firm reiterated its commitment to open up a U.S. assembly line in Alabama to build C Series planes in partnership with Boeing's archrival Airbus (EADSY).""With this matter behind us, we are moving full speed ahead with finalizing our partnership with Airbus,"" the statement added. ""Integration planning is going well and we look forward to delivering the C Series to the U.S. market so that U.S. airlines and the U.S. flying public can enjoy the many benefits of this remarkable aircraft.""The decision bucked expectations, with a Canadian government source telling Reuters Thursday it expected Bombardier to lose the case, saying ""It is not a multilateral or independent or unbiased tribunal. It's an American tribunal.""Shares of Boeing rose 11 cents 343.22 on the stock market today. U.S.-listed shares of Airbus, which has taken a majority stake in the C Series line, rose 3.3%. Bombardier's shares, which trade over the counter in the U.S., leapt 15.2% to 2.88.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.Boeing continued to defend its position after the hearing, despite the overwhelming nature of the ruling.""We are disappointed that the International Trade Commission did not recognize the harm that Boeing has suffered from the billions of dollars in illegal government subsidies that the Department of Commerce found Bombardier received and used to dump aircraft in the U.S. small single-aisle airplane market,"" a Boeing spokeswoman said. ""Those violations have harmed the U.S. aerospace industry, and we are feeling the effects of those unfair business practices in the market every day.""The firm said it will be reviewing the the Commission's more detailed opinions in the coming days, and will continue to document any perceived harm to its business and its U.S. supply chain from what it defines as ""illegal subsidies.""""We will not stand by as Bombardier's illegal business practices continue to harm American workers and the aerospace industry they support,"" the spokeswoman added. ""Global trade only works if everyone adheres to the rules we have all agreed to. That's a belief we will continue to defend.""The dispute began in April last year after Boeing complained about a Delta Air Lines (DAL) order for 75 C Series jets.Boeing has claimed Bombardier sold each 108-133-seat  CS100 for just $19.6 million, arguing they actually cost $33.2 million to make.In September, the Commerce Department proposed a tariff of 219.6% on the Canadian jets, then added an additional 79.8% tariff the following month.In response, Bombardier struck a deal with Boeing's rival Airbus, which saw the European firm take a 50.1% stake in the C Series line for no cash outlay. The aviation giant also plans to open an assembly line in Alabama to build C Series planes for the U.S. market. Bombardier says that will create more than 2,000 permanent U.S. jobs.The trade dispute has spilled over to Boeing's customers.In December, Delta Air Lines snubbed Boeing by placing a massive midsize jet order with Airbus. The airline had been in talks with Boeing about buying around 100 of its 737 Max 10 jets, but opted instead to buy 100 A321neos, worth $12.7 billion at list prices, though airlines typically get steep discounts for major deals.The ruling could also affect sales of Boeing military hardware in the U.K., as 4,200 Bombardier jobs in Northern Ireland could be at risk over the decision.""This is not the behavior we expect from Boeing and it could indeed jeopardize our future relationship with them,"" British Defense Secretary Michael Fallon said last year. The U.K. has a Boeing P-8 maritime surveillance plane on order, along with a fleet of new Apache attack helicopters.In addition, British Prime Minister Theresa May said that she was ""bitterly disappointed"" by the decision to impose tariffs after she had personally asked for President Trump's help in the dispute.Canadian officials also threatened to cancel a planned purchase of 18 Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet jets due to the decision, with officials claiming the C Series supported 23,000 jobs in the U.S. and that the jet's engine is made by United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney unit.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsAirline Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

72,DAL,"Airline stocks are sinking Wednesday, in a repeat of last October's dive, after United Airlines (UAL) vowed to keep matching fares from low-cost rivals, renewing fears of a price war that could hit earnings across the industry.X The carrier appears unlikely to back off anytime soon, forecasting greater expansion this year, next year and in 2020, even as it sees tighter cost management and stronger earnings per share over that time.""The best way to compete with a low-cost carrier is to match their prices,"" United President Scott Kirby said on a conference call late Tuesday. ""Half our revenue approximately comes from customers that are mostly shopping on price, and we cannot ignore half of our revenue and we can't let low cost carriers have price advantages in our hubs.""He added: ""No one chooses to fly on an ultra-low-cost carrier if they can get the same price on United Airlines — nobody — at least if they know what they're buying.""United expects capacity to rise 4%-6% this year, with similar increases coming in 2019 and 2020, as it tries to dig into domestic strongholds, push flight connectivity and regain relevance, the carrier said during a presentation after its fourth-quarter earnings.Prior to the presentation, analysts had already been worried that United's flight-capacity growth might balloon at a bigger rate than its rivals. The company's overall strategic plan, and whether United would stay committed to financial targets attached to it for this year, was the source of a major Wall Street breakdown on Oct. 19 after United gave only vague answers as to how it was approaching 2018. Management's handling of analyst questions about 2018 tanked United's stock by 12% that day and briefly raised questions of whether a shake-out at the top was ahead.In a rerun of that meltdown, shares of United collapsed 11.4% to 69.05 on the stock market today, dipping below their 200-day average. Delta Air Lines (DAL), which reported Q4 results earlier this month, fell 5.2%. American Airlines (AAL) and Southwest (LUV), which report next week, tumbled 6% and 4.7%, respectively. Ultra-low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines (SAVE) sank 6.9%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.An expansion is likely to revive investor fears that United's rivals will expand in retaliation, and cut ticket prices to fill those extra seats. Still, CEO Oscar Munoz said during the presentation: ""It's about margins this year and forward.""The forecast followed plans announced this month by both United and American to pour more flights into smaller cities. During the presentation Tuesday, United's Kirby outlined a strategy to redouble its efforts to connect more flights to smaller, higher-yielding destinations via its hubs in Chicago, Denver and Houston — mid-continent areas he said were in ""ideal"" locations geographically.Still, United forecast non-fuel unit costs to come in at flat to down 1% this year. But the carrier said increased regional flying, tech investments and higher labor costs posed difficulties to containing those expenses. The carrier expects those costs to come in ""flat or better"" next year and in 2020. And the company is targeting 2018 earnings per share of $6.50-$8.50, a figure that will swell to $11-$13 a share in 2020. Analysts expect EPS of $6.63 this year.United forecast Q1 unit revenue in a range of flat to up 2% — better than the 0.2% increase it put up for Q4, which was largely in line with the company's expectations. That important industry statistic tries to gauge how efficiently an airline is operating by measuring revenue as it relates to an airline's overall available seats and flights.United also forecast Q1 non-fuel unit cost growth of flat to up 1%, better than the 1.5% growth in the Q4, which rose largely due to higher labor costs. Capacity growth was seen coming in at 3.5%-4.5%.For Q4, earnings per share of $1.40 topped estimates for $1.34, while revenue of $9.4 billion just beat views for $9.43 billion. Pretax margins were 6.7%.Since October, United's shares have rebounded as strong travel demand gives airlines room to charge more for tickets, and as United showed signs of clamping down on cost growth.And much of the worry about this year comes as unit revenue – largely the only financial metric Wall Street has cared about in recent years – solidifies with higher prices and demand. And the big three legacy carriers' struggles internationally, particularly in Europe and in Asia, appear to be easing as economies abroad start to tick higher.Delta, in reporting Q4 results earlier this month, said unit revenue in the Pacific region turned up positive for the first time in four and a half years. Management said it was ""bullish"" on international results this year also due to what it expects to be an easier foreign exchange situation.American in November launched daily nonstop service from Los Angeles to Beijing; United this month said it would remove charges on passengers' second checked bag on flights from North America to China and Hong Kong. United is also offering round trip fares from the U.S. to China for as low as below $500 this month and next to celebrate Chinese New Year.And in the U.S., Delta said it expected more people will want to fly due to the GOP's tax cuts signed into law last month.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:United Airlines Weighs These Options As Boeing Eyes New Midsize JetTax Cuts Leave These Airline Winners, Losers; United Lifts Key OutlookMeet The 'Editor' That Tells You What Your New Product NeedsAirline Industry News And Stocks To Watch

81,DAL,"While United Airlines' (UAL) ambitious expansion plans have raised anxieties over a coming airfare war, American Airlines (AAL) CEO Doug Parker said his company had no plans to change its own growth goals this year — ""based on what we know now.""X He also said United's plans won't change American's earnings guidance for this year, despite concerns that lower fares and more competing flights will erode profits.""Look, we'll see where people grow, we'll see where people decide to compete,"" he said during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call. ""We will obviously respond where we think it makes sense, but it's always going to be around our core strategic assets.""But he said that the carrier would grow in a way that was unlikely to cause new skirmishes on fares, and that fares were ""too low for oil prices this high. Over time, you'll see it adjust.""American plans to expand flight capacity by 2.5% this year, and 3% when factoring in cancellations resulting from hurricanes in Florida and the Caribbean last year. Still, that's lower than United's plans for 4%-6% growth this year and a similar rate for next year and 2020.But analysts pressed Parker on why they should trust American's longer-term profit and growth targets, which include a minimal fleet expansion and 2018 earnings per share of $5.50-$6.50.He responded by saying ""we're not going to opine on other airlines' capacity plans,"" but that American plans to expand in areas where it has a competitive advantage.The growth, he said, would come from 1) new service to smaller cities like Panama City, Fla., and South Bend, Ind., 2) adding more frequent flights to existing cities like Stillwater, Okla., and 3) connecting those cities to new hubs.While he acknowledged that service to new markets means other carriers may lose ""a little share,"" he maintained it won't start a fare war or ""some sort of enormous competitive response."" He later added: ""Sometimes, you can get overreactions to a number.""In spite of his efforts to add nuance to American's expansion plans, shares closed down 3.2% at 53.05 on the stock market today, piling on to Wednesday's 6% dive. United fell 4.3% after plunging 11.4%, and Delta Air Lines (DAL), which reported earnings earlier this month, lost 3.5% after dropping 5% yesterday.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Meanwhile, travel demand and unit revenue — an important measure of an airline's operating efficiency — continue to rebound for American. The carrier forecast unit revenue growth of 2%-4%, reflecting expected continued improvement in demand for both business and leisure travel. But that forecast would mark a slowdown from the 5.6% unit-revenue gain in the fourth quarter.""Customers are responding positively to the options American offers, from international First Class to Basic Economy,"" said American Airlines President Robert Isom in a statement. ""We are far ahead of our U.S. competitors in offering Premium Economy on our international flights, which comes just as we begin to prepare for the busy summer travel season.""During the call, management said the ""premium"" section of its cabins did much of the heavy lifting in helping unit revenue to rebound internationally, as more passengers seek more comfort on longer flights over the Atlantic and Pacific. American's results over the Atlantic, where low-cost, long-haul rivals have proliferated, got better due to premium offerings and matching fares more precisely.American earned 95 cents a share in the fourth quarter, better than expectations for 92 cents. Revenue came in at $10.6 billion, compared to estimates for $10.58 billion. Operating expenses climbed 9.8%, due to a 23.5% jump in fuel costs and a 7% increase in salaries and benefits.Also Thursday, Southwest Airlines' (LUV) earnings per share of 77 cents and revenue of $5.27 billion also topped estimates. CEO Gary Kelly said ""our goal remains to achieve positive unit revenue growth in 2018, year-over-year.""The carrier said it expects 2018 capacity growth to be in the low 5% range, according to a Raymond James research note.

The smallest 787 can fly up to around 8,500 miles; the A321neo is a single-aisle jet with a range of up to 4,600 miles.Boeing's project — to potentially release a new midsize aircraft in the mid-2020s — could become ""well defined"" later this year, Laderman said, according to Reuters. He added that it was too early to weigh options for the Bombardier (BDRBF) CSeries and other smaller planes. Airbus has taken a majority stake in Bombardier's CSeries, which faces punitive U.S. tariffs.United Airlines rose 1.4% to 77.97 in the stock market today, working on a cup-with-handle base with a 79.10 buy point. Boeing dipped 0.7%. Airbus fell 1.3%. Bombardier sank 0.4%.Laderman's remarks follow plans from United and American Airlines (AAL), both announced this month, to extend their reach into smaller cities. They also come as United prepares to report fourth-quarter earnings after the market close on Tuesday.The carrier will hold what it described as an ""investor event"" at 4:30 ET after the results are released to, in part, ""provide an update on the company's overall strategic plan and issue 2018 guidance.""That overall strategic plan, and whether United would stay committed to financial targets attached to it for this year, was the source of a major Wall Street breakdown in October after United gave only vague answers as to how it was approaching 2018.Delta Air Lines (DAL) last month decided to buy 100 A321neo jets, with deliveries set to begin in 2020 — a move considered a snub to Boeing. Delta had been in talks to buy around 100 midsize, shorter-range, single-aisle 737 Max 10 jets, whose seating capacity reaches into the low 200s.Southwest Airlines (LUV) this month said it would exercise an option to order 40 short-range Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft — 15 next year and 25 in 2020.

The cybersecurity firm and forecast April quarter profit and revenue above expectations.  Some analysts say Palo Alto has been gaining share in the security firewall market vs. rivals, although shifts in corporate spending to cloud computing infrastructure remains a concern. Management reiterated plans to introduce a broader security platform in 2018 that provides access to third-party technology. Palo Alto, with $2.4 billion in cash, could step up acquisitions.

General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) reported 6.9% drops year over year, worse than feared. Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) sales slid 1.4%, beating views. But Toyota (TM) grew sales nearly 5%.

Disney in December agreed to buy Fox's Sky stake, film studio and other assets. Shares in Comcast, Disney and Rupert Murdoch's Fox fell on bidding war fears. Some analysts questioned Comcast's interest in a satellite TV firm, given falling subscribers at AT&T (T)-owned DirecTV and Dish Network (DISH). If Comcast buys a controlling stake in Sky, analysts say buying a wireless firm such as T-Mobile US (TMUS) would be less likely near-term.Square (SQ) topped adjusted Q4 earnings views and forecast full-year 2018 profit in line with expectations as it invests in new products and expands overseas. Square in November began testing a Bitcoin exchange so that Square Cash app users could buy and sell the cryptocurrency. Square said Bitcoin had an ""immaterial"" impact on Q4 results, but noted that it's holding a ""small amount"" of the cryptocurrency on its balance sheet to help future transactions using its Square Cash app. Square shares rose modestly, just below a buy point.Workday (WDAY) reported Q4 adjusted profit and revenue that topped views.

86,DAL,"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday that he still sees evidence of modest slack in the labor market, meaning the economy still has room to grow without rising inflation pressures.X ""Nothing (in the data) suggests to me that wage inflation is at a point of acceleration,"" Powell said.Powell's remarks were at least somewhat soothing to Wall Street, coming after the main takeaway from his Tuesday appearance before a House panel was that the economy will grow at a faster pace this year than Fed policymakers had anticipated when they penciled in three rate hikes by the end of 2018.Meanwhile, the Commerce Department reported early Thursday that the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, rose a tame 1.5% from a year ago in January, as expected.Although the Institute of Supply Management reported that national factory activity in February grew at its fastest pace since 2004 and jobless claims hit a 48-year low, Powell's less-hawkish testimony left Treasury yields little changed in early afternoon trading. Treasury yields dipped by the close as the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite sold off on the stock market today as President Trump vowed to impose a 25% steel tariff, raising trade war fears.Inflation has been undershooting expectations for years, so it may seem odd that markets are so focused on the threat now. Yet there's good reason to think that 2018 will be the year when price pressures begin to surface, at least to a moderate extent.That's not to say inflation is about to spike. The war for retail dominance between Amazon.com (AMZN) and Walmart (WMT), the transparency in pricing afforded by the internet and disruptive business models like Airbnb are a legitimate game-changer. A push by the FDA to expedite generic drug approvals is likely to continue to help keep a lid on prescription prices.While such disinflationary fundamentals aren't going away, a host of forces are lining up this year that have potential to finally push inflation up to the Fed's 2% goal.The combination of the $1.5 trillion tax cut and $300 billion spending package is expected to shift an economy that had already picked up speed into still-higher gear.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersStepping on the fiscal accelerator in the ninth year of an economic expansion amid solid growth is an experiment that's never been tried, and it's likely to add to upward cyclical pressure to inflation that tends to emerge when demand for labor and resources rises.With economic optimism on the rise and more dollars in their pocket, consumers may be, on the margins, more receptive to price hikes. Companies that have recently announced price increases include Amazon, which hiked fees for monthly Prime members; Disney (DIS), which raised theme park ticket prices for single-day guests; and Wendy's (WEN), which said on its latest earnings call that it raised prices by 1% in January to offset higher wages and commodity costs.Whether or not the tax cuts really deserve the credit, companies such as Walmart, CVS Health (CVS), Starbucks (SBUX) and Wells Fargo (WFC) gave a nod to the tax legislation when they subsequently announced pay hikes.Wage growth looks like it will take another step up from the Goldilocks-like 2.5% gain in average hourly wages that prevailed for most of 2017.IBD'S TAKE: Stock market volatility has returned, so it's more important than ever to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. Fed policymakers often talk about full employment, the lowest that unemployment can go before inflation starts to accelerate. No one knows exactly where it is and some economists, citing the experience of Japan, have doubts about the theory. Still, some economists expect unemployment to get as low as 3.5% this year, and new Fed chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that 3.5%, in his view, is the lowest imaginable rate of full employment, though he think it might be quite a bit higher.Some industries, such as trucking, are seeing above-average wage gains because the job market for hiring and retaining drivers is especially competitive. Those extra wages tend to get passed along. While transportation makes up a relatively small fraction of a retailer's costs, those extra costs, along with higher retail wages, could affect the end consumer — even if it only results in less discounting.Most inflation tends to be services inflation, so even flat prices for goods would be inflationary.Fed policymakers have said for much of the past year that transitory factors may have only temporarily lowered inflation. One such factor was Verizon (VZ) changing its cell-phone service pricing to provide unlimited data. Because that change began to lower inflation data in March 2017, that temporary factor will drop out of the picture this coming March,Crude oil prices, at about $61.50 per barrel, are about $7 higher than a year ago, boosting the price of gasoline. While the Fed's core gauge of inflation excludes energy prices, higher energy prices can get passed along to consumers. Delta Air Lines (DAL) is among a number of airlines that have tried to pass along higher fuel costs to customers through price hikes recently. So far, those hikes haven't taken hold, but stayed tuned.The U.S. dollar is more than 10% cheaper than it was a year ago, relative to a basket of other currencies from advanced economies. That raises the price of industrial commodities and a range of imported goods. At the least, a rising dollar is no longer working to hold down inflation in the U.S. by making foreign goods cheaper in dollar terms. A weakening dollar, at least at the margins, adds to inflation pressures. Import prices rose for German cars, French cheese and Italian wine, though it's not clear the extent to which end consumers will face higher prices, since consumers have the option of buying nonimports.President Trump has until mid-April to make up his mind over whether to impose tariffs on steel imports, as recommended the Commerce Department. Investors in U.S. Steel (X) appear to be betting that Trump will pull the trigger. Higher steel prices would add costs to cars made in the U.S., though it's not clear how automakers will respond when it comes to auto prices.Another question is how foreign governments will retaliate if the U.S. enacts punitive trade measures that they believe are unwarranted under World Trade Organization rules.The possibility of a trade war that then forfeits some of the disinflationary effects of globalization is among the biggest wild cards in the inflation outlook.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED INInflation And The Fed Rate-Hike Outlook: What You Need To KnowWhat Is Inflation, And Why Does It Matter To The Fed — And You?Amazon Vs.

89,DAL,"The House re-approved the $1.5 trillion Trump tax cuts Wednesday after the Senate OK'd the measure in the morning with a 51-48 vote. The bill now heads to President Trump's desk. The House had to revisit Tuesday's vote due to procedural issues.X Now the focus on Wall Street is figuring out just how big of a bonanza the new 21% corporate tax rate will be for corporate America and how much of a boost to earnings investors should expect.On Monday, Goldman Sachs said that Wells Fargo (WFC) stands to gain the most among the biggest U.S. banks from the tax package, with a 17% earnings boost. Beyond the corporate rate cut, the legislation also limits the deductibility of FDIC premiums and limits the ability of companies to deduct past losses, which would hit Citigroup the hardest. After Wells Fargo, Goldman sees PNC Financial Services (PNC) and Bank of America (BAC) as the biggest winners, with expected earnings increases of 15% and 14%.BofA Merrill Lynch analyst Kenneth Bruce upgraded credit-card issuers Capital One Financial (COF), Discover Financial Services (DFS) and Synchrony Financial (SYF) to neutral from buy on Monday and reiterated a buy rating on American Express (AXP), saying tax legislation wasn't fully priced in to the stocks. Bruce sees a 15%-25% boost to EPS, with Discover and Synchrony near the top of the range and Capital One and AmEx both poised for a 17% EPS increase.Delta Air Lines (DAL) CEO Ed Bastian told analysts last week that a 21% corporate tax rate would cut its tax bill by $800 million a year, the Financial Times reported. The tax legislation would boost Delta's 2018 earnings by $1 per share above current guidance of $5.35 to $5.70 per share. That amounts to roughly an 18% EPS bump. Beyond the lower corporate rate, airlines will benefit from being able to immediately deduct the cost of aircraft purchases. Data from IBD's parent corporation, William O'Neil & Co., show that Alaska Air Group (ALK) has the highest effective tax rate, 38%, among U.S. airlines.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.""Companies with businesses that are primarily domestic-focused tend to have higher tax rates on average. Similarly, small-cap stocks, which are generally more U.S.-centric, could see strong earnings revisions,"" wrote William O'Neil chief investment strategist Randy Watts and senior equity analyst Romeo Alvarez. Among S&P 500 sectors, ""Energy currently has the highest corporate tax rate and would see major relief.""The data show Marathon Oil (MRO) with a 49.9% effective tax rate and ConocoPhillips (COP) paying a 46.9% rate.Energy stocks were big winners Thursday. Conoco Philips jumped 3%, nearly breaking out to a buy zone on the stock market today. Marathon Oil was among the many energy stocks moving toward entry points. Diamondback Energy (FANG) did blast out into buy range in strong volume.CVS Health (CVS) has a 38.9% effective tax rate, tops among consumer staples companies, according to William O'Neil data. Aetna (AET), another high-tax company, is being acquired by CVS as it braces for the entry of Amazon.com into the retail prescription business. CEO Larry Merlo said recently that CVS would take some of its tax windfall and reinvest it in reconfiguring its stores to provide more health services.RELATED:6 Big Rule Changes For Individuals In The New Tax BillTrump Tax Package Seen Boosting These Players In Info TechHere's How Much Trump Tax Cuts Will Boost Profits At These Banking GiantsFederal Reserve Gives Trump Tax Cuts A Green LightFive Reasons Why JPMorgan, Citigroup, Other Financials Are Seizing Market Leadership

92,DAL,"American Express (AXP) on Thursday reported fourth-quarter results that topped views, but the credit-card giant said it would suspend its share buybacks for the first half of this year due to a big, one-time hit it took to profits due to the GOP's new tax legislation.The plans to halt those repurchases, which have helped boost AmEx's per-share profits, come as other big financial companies weather the short-term storm the tax bill has dumped on their profits, even though analysts and investors anticipate longer-term benefits from the law and an improving economy. Rival credit-card company Capital One Financial (COF) last month said it would chop its buyback program nearly in half due to a charge similar to the one absorbed by AmEx.""The upfront charge triggered by the Tax Act reduced our capital ratios and, as a result, while we will be continuing our quarterly dividends at the current level, we plan to suspend our share buyback program for the first half of 2018 in order to rebuild our capital,"" American Express said in a statement on Thursday.AmEx said that the $2.6 billion charge was based on its ""current estimate"" of taxes on foreign earnings and the reduced value of its deferred tax assets and liabilities, whose value will get cut along with the cut in the corporate tax rate to 21%. Companies can take on those assets in the event of a loss and use them to ease their tax burden.Earlier this month, American Express said its Q4 earnings would be reduced by around $2.4 billion due to the temporary disarray caused by the tax bill.""The new law makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code and it will take time to interpret the changes,"" the company said in a regulatory filing on Jan. 3, and it forecast ""significant impacts"" to ""future periods"" beyond 2017. American Express also said its full-year EPS would come up short of its forecast for $5.80-$5.90.American Express on Thursday said it expected an effective U.S. tax rate of roughly 22% this year, before discrete items. And the company forecast earnings per share this year of $6.90-$7.30, above Zacks estimates for $6.83.For the fourth quarter, the company reported EPS of $1.58, above views for $1.54, as revenue rose 10% to $8.839 billion, topping estimates for $8.72 billion.Shares fell 2.6% to 97.40 after-hours in the stock market today after closing down 0.9%. Shares hit a record 102.38 on Tuesday. Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA), which both report earnings on Feb. 1, closed up 0.9% and 0.7%, respectively. American Express and Visa are both Dow industrial components.As with other businesses, AmEx on Thursday said it believed the tax reform would be good for it and the U.S. economy. The company said it expected to invest as much as $200 million more this year than initially planned for ""customer-facing growth initiatives.""Nomura-Instinet analyst Bill Carcache this month wrote that AmEx's one-time charge could dent a key capital ratio for the company, temporarily threatening the share buyback program that has boosted its earnings. He wrote that a suspension of the buybacks in the first half of this year ""appears likely,"" but that it could replenish the capital within a couple of quarters if it did so.What's more, Zacks analysts say, AmEx's rewards expenses rose through much of last year, due in part to efforts to make its platinum cards more attractive and push its co-branded card with Delta Air Lines (DAL).Still, Zacks was looking for AmEx's sales to rebound from the loss in 2016 of Costco Wholesale (COST), one of its largest card customers. And the firm cites the company's attempts to cut costs and prospects abroad.The earnings from the credit-card companies will follow results from the nation's largest banks, some of which issue credit cards on the Visa and Mastercard networks. The banks' results can sometimes offer a look at what might be in store for the credit-card companies.Mizuho payments analyst Thomas McCrohan said results from JPMorgan (JPM), which showed a pickup in credit card sales volumes, had ""positive implications"" for Visa.In a separate note, he also said that Citigroup's results could be viewed as ""in line to slightly positive for Mastercard given it is Citigroup's primary card network.""He added that ""these results also have implications for Visa since Citigroup is the issuing bank for the Costco (COST) portfolio, which Visa recently won.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Goldman Sachs Weighs In On Cryptocurrencies As Trading Lags PeersInvestment Pros Like These U.S. Stocks In 2018Breakout Watch: This 2015 IPO Is Testing A New Buy Zone

93,DAL,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) snubbed Boeing (BA) and picked its European rival Airbus (EADSY) for a massive midsize jet order in a deal announced Thursday.X The airline, which had been in talks with Boeing about buying around 100 of its 737 Max 10 jets, will instead buy 100 A321neos, worth $12.7 billion at list prices though airlines typically get steep discounts for major deals.Deliveries of the Airbus planes will begin in 2020, Delta said in a statement. The deal also includes a purchase of United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney geared turbofan engines.The Airbus order comes after a spat over narrow-body C Series passenger jets from Canada's Bombardier. Under pressure from Boeing, which claimed the C Series received unfair state aid, the U.S. levied a sky-high tariff on the plane, which Delta is buying. The carrier has since vowed not to pay the tariff.Boeing shares were up 0.7% to 293.88 on the stock market today. Airbus tumbled 4.1% as CEO Tom Enders could be ousted over corruption probes. Delta rose 3%, reclaiming a recent buy point as the carrier also raised unit revenue guidance. United Tech dipped 0.4%, still in buy range.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.Losing the Delta deal could push Boeing to making a decision on whether to build a midmarket plane, which analysts have dubbed the 797, to compete against A321neo.The A321neo has taken significant market share from Boeing, as it has allowed airlines to open new routes that aren't accessible with smaller planes and aren't profitable with larger ones.Earlier this year, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg confirmed that the new plane could seat roughly 250 passengers and have a range of 5,000 nautical miles.Boeing has talked to United Airlines (UAL), Air Lease (AL) and other potential customers. At the Dubai Airshow last month, Boeing said it talked to state-run Saudi Arabian Airlines about a midmarket plane.RELATED: This Boeing Move Shows That It's Getting Serious About The '797' JetDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry News

94,DAL,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) said it had canceled nearly 400 flights on Monday and nearly 1,000 on Sunday after a fire left Atlanta's massive Hartsfield-Jackson airport — the carrier's hub — without power and thousands of passengers stranded in near-darkness. But airline stocks saw little turbulence Monday.X Power was restored close to midnight, after the airport spent nearly half the day Sunday without it. TSA lines were open early Monday morning, according to the airport's Twitter feed.But as of 10 a.m. ET, the trains at the airport, among the busiest in the U.S., were not operating, Delta said. Customers with paper boarding passes from Sunday would need to reprint them.The outage, caused by an electrical fire at a Georgia Power electrical facility, comes after Delta this spring had to cancel some 4,000 flights due to severe thunderstorms in Atlanta and harsh weather in the Northeast. The exact cause of the fire was still being determined.Shares fell just 3 cents to 56.07 in the stock market today. Southwest Airlines (LUV) and American Airlines (AAL), which also canceled dozens of flights in the blackout's wake, rose 1.6% and 0.8%, respectivelyThe outage also follows Delta's Investor Day last week, which nudged the carrier's stock into a buy zone and left some analysts feeling more optimistic about the airline.The financial impact from the cancellations isn't yet clear. Delta, in conjunction with its Investor Day event, forecast Q4 unit revenue to come in at the high end of its initial forecast. It also said it was targeting 10%-15% earnings-per-share growth next year.United Airlines (UAL) rose 1.3%. Spirit Airlines (SAVE) jumped 3.9%. Spirit Airlines, which is approaching its 200-day moving average, will move its listing from the Nasdaq to the NYSE starting Dec. 28.RELATED:Big Changes Are Coming To Airbus C Suite Amid Corruption ProbesDelta Air Lines Shows Improved Relative Strength; Still Shy Of BenchmarkIt's Official: Boeing Loses Massive Delta Air Lines Order To Airbus

Shares are up over 30% from a 246.59 flat-base entry.Elsewhere in the Dow, Microsoft (MSFT) reversed from early losses to rise 0.1%, as the software maker trades within the 5% buy range that runs up to 90.62. The stock broke out on Dec. 15 above an 86.30 flat-base buy point.FANG stock Netflix moved up nearly 2% in early trade after Barclays initiated the stock with an overweight rating and a 245 price target — a 15% premium to Wednesday's closing price. Shares were at an all-time high, more than 5% above a 204.48 flat-base entry and extended. The stock has been a standout performer this year, rising over 12% in 2018.Among companies reporting earnings, homebuilder KB Home (KBH) jumped nearly 9% to new highs after reporting solid results late Wednesday. Shares are up over 50% from a 24.47 cup-shaped base buy point.Airlines were taking off early Thursday, driven higher by Delta Air Lines' (DAL) strong earnings results. The airline also raised its 2018 profit guidance amid strong demand. Shares soared as much as 3% before trimming gains to nearly 1%. Shares are back in buy range from a 54.16 cup-with-handle entry.

96,DAL,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) on Thursday reported fourth-quarter earnings that easily topped views and dramatically raised its 2018 profit guidance, adding to indications of more robust demand across the industry.X The results follow earlier signs from American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) that their pricing power has improved.In Q4, Delta's earnings per share climbed 17% to 96 cents, beating estimates for 88 cents, as revenue increased 8% to $10.245 billion, topping views for $10.16 billion. Passenger unit revenue grew 4.2% vs. Delta's forecast for an increase around 4%.The results exclude a one-time charge of $150 million from the inclusion of foreign earnings and revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, following tax reform.Delta now sees 2018 EPS at $6.35-$6.70, up from a prior view of $5.35-$5.70 and well above the consensus for $5.75, on total revenue growth of 4%-6%. Its corporate tax rate should hit 22%-24%.For Q1, Delta sees EPS of 60-80 cents, below consensus for 82 cents, on unit revenue growth of 2.5%-4.5%, with capacity up about 3%.""We enter 2018 with significant momentum and every entity delivering positive passenger unit revenue for the first time in five years, driven by a robust demand environment and improving business fares,"" said Delta President Glen Hauenstein in a statement.CFO Paul Jacobson said Delta will focus this year on getting unit cost trajectory back in line with Delta's long-term 0%-2% target, with Q1 expected to be the peak of nonfuel expense growth.Delta shares surged 4.8% to 58.52 on the stock market today, rising above buy range. American climbed 4.9% to 56.42, clearing a 53.84 buy point, though its relative strength line still lags. United rallied 4.6% after jumping 6.7% Wednesday, and Southwest Airlines (LUV) added 3%, extended beyond buy range once again.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.Fourth-quarter forecasts this week from American and United have signaled that ticket prices, from their standpoint, have improved, meaning they've been able to charge passengers more or discount less. American also said that close-in demand domestically had been higher than anticipated.But higher fuel costs could hurt margins this year. Costs have become more of a focus for analysts in recent months — after pay raises and fuel pushed expenses higher last year — and they may keep a tighter lens on how well airlines can manage their nonfuel expenses.But recent tax cuts are helping the airlines' customers, especially big corporations, and Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts said earlier this week that Delta, United and American should see more business and international travel.More domestic-focused carriers like Southwest, however, will likely be outperformed by the big three legacy airlines, the analysts added.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Airline Industry News And Stocks To WatchThese Numbers Show How Much China, Asia Mean To BoeingStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

98,DAL,"Major stock indexes were spooked in the early going Wednesday on news China thinks U.S. debt is less attractive than other asset classes at the moment. That fueled speculation that the world's second-largest economy could start to slow down bond purchases.But the Nasdaq composite recovered, down 0.3% in late afternoon trading, after a 0.7% intraday drop. The S&P 500 gave back 0.2% and the Dow Jones industrial average eased 0.1%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking close to Tuesday's levels in the stock market today.After jumping 7 basis points Tuesday to 2.55%, the 10-year Treasury yield got close to 2.60% Wednesday but was back near 2.55% in late trading.Financials led the IBD 50 higher as Essent Group (ESNT), Leaderboard name SVB Financial (SIVB) and Grupo Supervielle (SUPV) showed gains of around 2%.Department store operators were among the top performers. Airlines also did well.Delta Air Lines (DAL) jumped 2.5% to 55.50 ahead of its earnings report Thursday before the open. A recent breakout over a 54.16 buy point didn't make much headway, but Delta continues to hold comfortably above the entry.In earnings news, Lennar (LEN) reversed higher after an inauspicious start , rising 2% to 68.18. An earnings miss made early headlines, causing shares to drop 1.4% intraday, but Wall Street changed its tune, perhaps focusing on a nice sales beat instead. In late October, Lennar announced plans to acquire CalAtlantic (CAA) for just over $9 billion.Meanwhile, enterprise software name Workday (WDAY) surged 3% to 113.40, helped by positive comments from Morgan Stanley. On a daily chart, some might interpret Workday's latest pattern as a cup-with-handle, but that's not the case because the handle is too short. Still, Workday's price action is bullish as it cleared the 110 level.Elsewhere, Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) gapped out of a cup-shaped base with a 405.15 buy point, rising nearly 7% to 423.97, after the company announced bullish Q4 preliminary results. It now sees sales of $892 million, well above the consensus estimate of $845 million.No doubt growth investors are seeing plenty of bullish chart patterns out there, but it's important to recognize if the stock is still in the early stages of a run or the later stages. Breakouts from late-stage bases can work but are generally more prone to fail. Some examples of later-stage bases out there now include TAL Education (TAL), Arista Networks (ANET) and Nvidia (NVDA).U.S. crude oil futures settled at $63.57 a barrel, up 1%, after weekly U.S. inventory data showed a larger-than-expected decline in stockpiles.RELATED:Here's What Berkshire's Warren Buffett Thinks About CryptocurrenciesOil Prices Stay Up As U.S. Crude Production, Inventories DropRobot Surgeon Breaks Out; Two Top Financials Hit New Highs

99,DAL,"Third-quarter earnings season in October was not exactly gentle on the airlines. But investors have, perhaps, been a little easier on Delta Air Lines (DAL), which reports Q4 results on Thursday — just weeks after the legacy carrier laid out some ambitious goals to push profit higher and contain costs this year.X The GOP's tax-cut package, ticket prices and, naturally, those targets seem likely to be focal points for investors. On Tuesday, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said the tax cuts are likely to boost business travel, helping Delta, United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL).As for Q4 itself, Wall Street expects Delta to report earnings per share of 90 cents, up 10%, on revenue of $10.16 billion, a 7% increase, according to Zacks Investment Research. That top-line gain would mark the biggest increase since Q3 2014.Delta last week said it expected a roughly 4% increase in passenger unit revenue during the quarter, which would be its best showing all year in the key metric. The company expects adjusted operating margin of around 11%.After United flat-out terrified investors in October following a murky 2018 financial forecast and shares of American and others retreated on a mixture of worries about too much expansion and rising costs, Delta has remained ""the go-to legacy airline,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Rajeev Lalwani said in a research note last week.He cited the carrier's 2018 profit and the cost targets it outlined last month at its investor day — EPS of $5.30-$5.70 and unit cost growth of flat to up 2% along with the potential lift from the GOP's tax reform — as reasons to like the airline.Many investors on Thursday will likely be seeking more insight into how Delta might use the savings from that law, and how it might affect travel demand. Cowen analyst Helane Becker said she expected Delta to raise its earnings-per-share forecast this year to as much as $6-$6.35 due to the tax reform. Lalwani added that the possible benefits of tax cuts could pad the carrier's industry-leading free cash flow.Analysts will also be watching for Delta's diagnosis of airfares and demand, amid expectations for a pickup in U.S. travel that would increase ticket prices and boost profits.And Wall Street will be watching for signals that Delta can keep a tight lid on costs. Unit costs for airlines rose last year — due largely to labor deals, more expensive fuel and higher airport fees — and raised concerns that they could hurt margins this year. However, Lalwani said cost issues were ""already known by the market,"" and Becker said nonfuel unit-cost growth was easing and that airlines appeared to be getting better at handling those costs.Delta shares remain in buy range after breaking out from a cup-with-handle base last month from a 54.16 entry. But the Relative Strength line, which wasn't strong at the breakout, has weakened as the stock has failed to make much headway while the broader market marches to new highs. The RS line tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Any brighter outlook from Delta, however, would follow a fourth quarter in which the carrier had to cancel some 1,400 flights following an outage at its Atlanta hub, denting its pretax income by an amount expected to be somewhere between $25 million and $50 million. The company will take a one-time charge of $150 million to $200 million from the tax cuts, which have had the effect of lowering the value of some assets on large corporations' books.Still, the carrier said it expected to see positive unit revenue in all its markets globally, after discounting from low-cost, long-haul European carriers, a stronger dollar and economic difficulties weighed on those results in years past.Delta also has tried to broaden its international coverage through joint ventures. It agreed to form one last month with Canada's WestJet — and management could offer more details on that front.Moreover, Delta has been the ""most rational"" in competing with ultra-low-cost carriers, JPMorgan's investment thesis on the company says. Dirt-cheap fares from Spirit Airlines (SAVE) and others have, at times, tempted the bigger carriers into matching them on price, whittling away profits and aggravating investors.""Delta is often cited as the peer leader in terms of capital allocation and execution, and we believe investors will continue to take notice,"" JPMorgan analyst Jamie Baker wrote.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Delta Falls After Raising Q4 Cost Forecasts, Curbing Capacity GrowthThis No. 1-Ranked Leisure Stock May Be Planning A New BreakoutAirline Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

Delta Air Lines fueled a big boost in airlines, while Lennar and KB Home showed that builders remain a leading group. Many big retailers rallied on solid holiday sales. Intel and many chip-equipment stocks struggled.Alphabet (GOOGL)-unit Google and Amazon.com (AMZN) battled for the spotlight at the CES tech show in Las Vegas. Google Assistant will be built into a wide range of consumer devices, including TVs, headphones and third party home speakers. It will also roll out in cars featuring Android Auto software. But Amazon's Echo devices remain the connected-home market leader, with estimated 70% share. Amazon said it has created a new division called Alexa Voice Services. Kohler strutted out a smart mirror that uses Alexa and plays music. Reports resurfaced at CES that Amazon could begin testing ads on Alexa.Autonomous vehicles also were in the CES spotlight. Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) announced a pact with ride-hailing service Uber, as well as expanding ties with Volkswagen (VLKAY) and Baidu (BIDU). Nvidia, citing customer feedback, said self-driving cars will begin to be deployed on a wide scale in 2020. Uber rival Lyft also was active, disclosing partnerships. Intel said that two million vehicles from BMW, Nissan (NSANY), and VW will leverage Mobileye technology to build high-definition maps for autonomous vehicles. Intel bought Mobileye last year for about $15 billion.Intel (INTC) CEO Brian Krzanich in a CES keynote speech addressed the chip security flaw that rattled investors in early January. Krzanich framed the chip problem as an industrywide issue and said progress has been made in patching the vulnerabilities.  Meanwhile, Microsoft reported a setback in its efforts to fix the security issues. It suspended issuing patches to guard against the threats after users of PCs with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) chips complained that the software updates froze their computers.Banking giants JPMorgan Chase, PNC Financial Services (PNC) and Wells Fargo (WFC) topped fourth-quarter earnings views, though Wells' revenue was below estimates. JPMorgan reported a big drop in trading revenue, including a huge loss on a single equity trade for a client.

Penney (JCP) in the prior week. Shares of Target, Kohl's and J.C. Penney enjoyed double-digit weekly gains while Macy's leapt nearly 10%. But Five Below (FIVE), American Eagle (AEO), Urban Outfitters (URBN) and Express (EXPR) added to a string of generally weak holiday reports from specialty and apparel retailers. Long-ailing Sears Holdings (SHLD) said it'll close more than 100 additional locations as its holiday sales were weak.Wal-Mart (WMT) will raise its base wage to $11 an hour and offer a bonus of up to $1,000 for employees, as more employers hike wages following the Trump tax cuts and labor markets continue to tighten.

MoneyGram (MGI) rallied, at least briefly, after announcing a pilot program to test using Ripple, another digital currency and network, to transfer funds.Commercial jet deliveries rose to 763 last year from 748 in 2016, as Boeing (BA) ramped up production of the 737 and started deliveries of its new 737 MAX. Total 737 deliveries climbed to 529 from 490 in 2016. Deliveries of the 787 Dreamliner dipped to 136 from 137. Boeing had 912 net orders for the year, valued at $134.8 billion at list prices, from 71 customers.

Boeing shares shot up to fresh record highs.The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index climbed into solidly optimistic territory, hitting a 10-month high of 55.1 in January and close to the decade-high 56.3 in February 2017. Readings over 50 are positive. Among the subindexes, Americans' views of their personal financial outlook hit a 14-year high amid tax cuts and loftier stock prices. Yet views of government policies soured, as disaffection from Democrats and independents swamped Republicans' giddiness.Lennar (LEN) reported a surprise earnings decline, but only due to a shift in the timing of a transaction to take advantage of tax cuts in 2018. Revenue rose 12%, double expectations, amid a strong economy, tight supply and a fast recovery from recent hurricanes. Lennar, which is set to become the nation's largest homebuilder when its CalAtlantic acquisition closes next month, said its order backlog rose 23% to $3.6 billion.

Lennar and KB Home shares soared.SpaceX said that its Falcon 9 rocket ""did everything correctly"" on Sunday, when a spy satellite made by Northrop Grumman (NOC) was reportedly lost after launch. The launch had been delayed from November so SpaceX could analyze protective nose cone data from another launch. Northrop declined to comment, citing the classified nature of the Zuma mission. Higher-than-usual secrecy surrounds the Zuma satellite and little is known about it except it was made for government customer and was supposed to be launched into low Earth orbit. Meanwhile, SpaceX delayed a planned test of Falcon Heavy — the most powerful rocket since the Apollo program's Saturn V.Reports surfaced that disk drive company Seagate Technology (STX) made an early investment in a cryptocurrency called Ripple that had recently soared in value.

Shares of the natural foods grocer rose nearly 5%, clearing a buy point.Akamai Technologies (AKAM) is exploring strategic alternatives including a sale, Bloomberg reported citing unnamed sources. The networking and cloud solutions provider has been under pressure from hedge fund Elliott Management, which owns a 6.5%, to maximize shareholder value. Shares spiked on the news, but then turned lower. Some of Akamai's biggest customers, including Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN), are bypassing the company with a DIY route.

102,DAL,"Shares of Delta Air Lines (DAL) burst higher Thursday, as the carrier kicked off its Investor Day with a solid 2018 forecast and a fourth-quarter outlook that included more bullish expectations for unit revenue but weaker margins.X Delta on Thursday also officially announced that it would buy 100 A321neos from Airbus (EADSY), a snub to Boeing (BA), with whom relations have cooled.Shares of Delta jumped 3% to 55.25 in the stock market today, once again clearing a cup-with-handle buy point of 54.16. American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) climbed 0.2% and 0.4%, respectively, both closing off session highs.Expectations were high ahead of the Investor Day, and Wall Street's main take-aways could revolve around what the carrier has in store for next year as costs for jet fuel and labor rise and some of the nation's biggest airports undergo renovations.Delta said in a presentation that it was targeting 2018 earnings per share of $5.35-$5.70, higher than Zacks estimates for $5.41. The carrier also said it was ""addressing nonfuel unit costs"" — which became a source of investor angst during third-quarter earnings season — aiming for nonfuel unit costs of flat to up 2% next year.Delta expects unit revenue — which measures an airline's operating efficiency by gauging sales from passengers as they relate to an airline's flight capacity — to be up around 4% in the fourth quarter.That was more aggressive than an outlook given in October for a 2%-4% increase. Delta said the fourth quarter was ""producing strong revenue trends with positive unit revenue in all geographic entities."" JetBlue (JBLU) on Tuesday also raised its Q4 unit revenue outlook. United and Southwest Airlines (LUV) raised their Q4 unit revenue forecasts last week.JetBlue, which briefly hit a buy point on Tuesday before reversing sharply lower, fell 1.4%. Southwest Airlines advanced 1.1%, hitting a new high and becoming further extended from a recent breakout.""Traditionally, the airlines use investor days to discuss significant cost and revenue initiatives,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note on Monday. ""At this point, Delta has been there, done that. Delta continues to need to prove their margins can improve from current levels.""However, the company said that fourth-quarter operating margins were on track to come in at around 11%, compared to an earlier  forecast for 11%-13%, with higher fuel prices dragging the figure lower.Delta expects Q4 flight capacity to be up 2.5%-3% vs. earlier expectations for a roughly 2% increase. That reflects Delta's coverage of Virgin Atlantic flights in the trans-Atlantic market.And the carrier expects Q4 nonfuel unit costs to increase 5%-5.5%. Those higher costs were pushed higher by ""continued investment in our people and product combined with accelerated depreciation of aircraft retirements.""Delta last week said it had agreed to enter into a joint venture with Canadian low-cost carrier WestJet, a move that strengthens Delta's international service.RELATED:United, American, Delta Rule Air Travel, But Higher Costs LoomAirline Industry News And Stocks To Watch

104,DAL,"JetBlue (JBLU) on Tuesday raised its fourth-quarter unit revenue outlook, and the carrier said the financial fallout from this summer's string of hurricanes wouldn't be as bad for the quarter as once expected.X The stronger outlook follows similar forecasts last week from United Airlines (UAL) and Southwest (LUV), as travel demand remains solid and gives airlines more leeway to charge more. Delta Air Lines' (DAL) stock also got a lift last week after the airline reported November traffic figures.JetBlue said it expected fourth-quarter unit revenue, which tallies sales in relation to overall capacity of available seats and flight coverage, to come within a range of down 0.5% to up 1.5%. The carrier initially expected Q4 unit revenue to be anywhere from flat to down 3%.The company said it expected the impact from the hurricanes — in particular Irma and Maria — to take 0.5% off fourth-quarter unit revenue. But that's better than prior expectations for one to two percentage points.Shares of JetBlue closed down 2.7% at 21.59 in the stock market today, reversing an earlier gain of 1.7%, but still near a 22.46 buy point from a cup-with-handle base. Delta fell 1.4% to 53.62, back below a 54.16 buy point of a cup-with-handle base, and American Airlines (AAL) dropped 1.6% to 50.47, further below a 53.84 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. Southwest rose 0.2%, extended above buy range.United lost 1.4% but is above its 50-day line as it tries to recover from the 12% drop suffered after management was unable to answer analysts' questions about 2018 financial forecasts, casting doubt on its ability to hit longer-term financial targets.IBD'S TAKE: This summer, Wall Street fretted about the effect airfare discounting would have on airlines' profits. This fall, Wall Street hit them over rising costs. For more, read this story. For November, JetBlue's passenger traffic increased 2.8%, while its flight capacity increased by 4.3%.JetBlue on Thursday said it would add service to Worcester, Mass., by offering daily flights between that city and JFK International Airport starting in May. Introductory fares, which were available last week, started at $29 one way.The move helps to strengthen JetBlue's position in Massachusetts, where it already flies a lot of planes in and out of Boston.RELATED:

"
112,DAL,"A price war that threatens to upend the airline industry likely began this spring, after thousands of Spirit Airlines (SAVE) passengers in May learned their flights were canceled. The low-cost airline blamed pilots, who were entangled in a pay dispute, for engaging in a ""pervasive illegal work slowdown"" — an account the pilots disputed.X Customers were furious, and a fight broke out at a Spirit counter in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. People were arrested. After passengers booked elsewhere, Spirit cut fares to try to lure them back. As it scrambled to contain the damage, United Airlines (UAL) swooped in, matching some of Spirit's prices in several of the legacy carrier's biggest, most prized airport hubs.United, American Airlines (AAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL) in years past might not have always seen no-frills, bargain-hunting customers as their own. But flush with cash, they now look to tighten their grip on the skies above the U.S. and drive out ultra-low-cost challengers, potentially limiting competition further in an industry that has already seen dramatic consolidation.The shift has prompted analysts to question if passengers have any reason left to fly airlines like Spirit if the legacy network airlines are copying their strategy — either with bare-bones, high-restriction ""basic economy"" seats or fares that cost as little as dinner and a drink or two.""I don't know that the basic fact has changed: that low costs tend to win in the airline industry,"" said Seth Kaplan, managing partner at Airline Weekly. ""But this is maybe the most interesting moment in history to test that, now that the big three airlines are so successful and now that they have such good balance sheets.""IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review them.
"
113,DAL,"Following 40 bankruptcy-riddled years, the airline industry has consolidated into four airlines that control about 80% of the U.S. market: United, American, Delta and Southwest (LUV). Such market sway has helped improve earnings, and the big airlines have vowed not to let ultra-low-cost carriers (ULCCs) beat them on price.The carriers' path to greater market dominance will be tested in the year ahead. Costs are rising for everything from employee pay to fuel prices to the landing fees that will fund airports' efforts to add parking and transportation and renovate terminals to look more sleek or at least less depressing.The higher expenses to run an airline will threaten profits and the willingness to match bargain fares of the ultra-low-cost carriers, who face some of the same cost pressures.""If your costs are going up, it's not sustainable that you keep lowering your fares,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said of United's discounting onslaught, adding: ""I don't know that I would say (United) would back off first. I would just say that you will see fares trend higher in general.""In years past, the U.S. legacy carriers and the discounters viewed the passengers they pursued as existing in more clearly separated markets, Kaplan says. An airline like Spirit saw itself attracting a more price-sensitive bunch who might otherwise spend their money on, say, going to the movies rather than another airline, he says.Ultra-low-cost carriers generally operate with lower structural costs than their larger rivals do, meaning they can offer super-low fares more easily. Spirit tends to skimp more on seat space, allowing the carrier to cram in more seats and spread costs across more passengers. ULCCs also tend to fly point to point, without guaranteed connections, cutting down on the time — and money — spent on the ground waiting for connecting passengers.As the big three carriers rolled out basic economy, their vast networks offered an advantage on connections, even if the fare class didn't guarantee that, say, a family of four can sit together.With Spirit, you can still sit together. But when United tried to match ULCCs on fares last summer, Spirit had to back off from plans to raise fares to stay competitive with the giants. Spirit stock tanked 18% in a single day in July.""Clearly, the ULCC model is being questioned by the Street,"" Wolfe Research analyst Hunter Keay wrote in a research note following that dive.Shares of the network carriers weren't faring much better. When a bigger, higher-expense rival like United tries to emulate Spirit, United either loses more money than Spirit or makes less money.In particular, plans by low-cost Frontier Airlines to push into Denver were seen by United as a shift away from its point-to-point model and toward a more costly and complex hub-and-spoke model. In hub and spoke, passengers are routed to big airports and then put on connecting flights.""I've believed for many years that the ultra-low-cost-carrier business model can't work when a network carrier decides to compete on price,"" United President Scott Kirby said in July. ""This is the first public validation that one of the ULCCs has thrown in the towel on the point-to-point business model.""Frontier denied it was changing the way it flies. But ULCCs face tough questions about their future.Asked at a conference in September whether ULCCs were doomed when a major carrier cuts prices, Spirit CFO Ted Christie replied ""absolutely not."" He said ""rumors of the death of the ULCC model are clearly overstated"" and that people like low fares.New concerns over industry costs have since recast the debate. In October, United management unnerved investors by making cagey responses to questions about the airline's 2018 outlook.The carrier said that health care costs, pensions and airport fees were rising. But it offered no specifics, saying only that it was ""in the middle"" of mapping out 2018 costs and taking a ""very different approach"" to them.The remarks signaled that expectations set last year may be softening. Those targets included keeping nonfuel unit cost growth under 1%, producing $4.8 billion in ""earnings improvement"" by 2020, and lopping roughly $1 billion off the carrier's capital expenditures this year.Worries grew about United's ability to catch up with Delta on margins. Investors laid into United's stock, sinking it 12% in one day.""Making it worse was poor commentary on the (third-quarter earnings) call where UAL wouldn't address, even qualitatively, 2018 (unit costs),"" Wolfe Research's Keay said in a research note. ""In fact, we felt warned on it.""A week later, Alaska Air Group (ALK) shares tanked as Wall Street worried over its ability to manage costs as it brings Virgin America under its wing.  Concerns included its efforts to resolve a pilot shortage with higher pay amid rising competition.Then American got hit. Shares tumbled after it forecast greater capacity growth and higher-than-expected costs in 2018, with pay raises, benefit hikes and increased maintenance costs weighing.Southwest forecast higher-than-expected costs in the fourth quarter due to ad spending, tech expenses and costs related to getting the OK to fly to Hawaii.The prevalence of cost fears distracted Wall Street from the only industry statistic it generally cares about: unit revenue, which tries to gauge an airline's efficiency by measuring sales in relation to an airline's available supply of seats and flights. That metric, actually, has been OK.The market had a ""sobering recollection that airlines also have cost structures,"" JPMorgan analyst Jamie Baker observed wryly in a research note. He pointed out that management isn't typically ready to talk about unit costs and capacity for the year ahead in October. But he said ""we still wish that most had been better prepared.""Now it was Spirit's turn to gloat.""Consolidation didn't really improve the cost structure"" of legacy airlines, Spirit CEO Bob Fornaro said in October. ""It improved the networks, but the costs are going higher.""Spirit hasn't been spared these cost concerns. Costs are certain to rise if management can strike a deal with its employees. The big three airlines all agreed to pay hikes for employees last year.But some ULCCs have support in high places, and are getting new planes that will enable them to compete even harder.Investor Bill Franke, whose Indigo Partners owns Frontier and other ULCCs, agreed on Nov. 15 to buy 430 new Airbus (EADSY) jets for his carriers, including Frontier, in a deal valued at $49.5 billion at list prices.Frontier will get 100 A320neo jets and 34 A321neos. The narrow-body planes are increasingly popular with airlines, as their range and fuel efficiency have opened more direct routes that previously weren't economical.At a press conference after the pact was announced, Franke, who helped transform Spirit into a ULCC, argued that adding loyalty programs, amenities and other things that raise an airline's costs opens up ""a path to hell,"" according to Bloomberg.""We're firm believers in the ultra-low-cost model,"" Franke told reporters at the Dubai Airshow, where the order — Airbus' largest ever — was announced. ""At the end of the day, in a competitive environment, the lower the cost, the lower the fares, is a winning strategy.""But the big airlines also appear to be firm believers in offering passengers a low-fare option, and American Airlines CEO Doug Parker sees an endgame on the horizon. He said in October that the industry was in the ""final stages of a maturation process,"" in which ULCCs, seeking new markets, run into trouble moving into the nation's big airport hubs.RELATED:New Flights Signal Spirit Airlines Is Still Taking Fight To United, RivalsAmerican Signals Higher '18 Capacity; Another Carrier Warns On CostsAirline Stocks To Watch And Industry News

Adobe Systems (ADBE) had strong earnings and guidance while Oracle (ORCL) missed on cloud revenue and cloud guidance.X The Nasdaq rose 1.4%, the Dow industrials 1.3% and the S&P 500 index 0.9%, all hitting record highs Friday as the GOP finalized its tax legislation with apparently enough support to pass. The Federal Reserve offered few surprises. Media stocks were in focus with Disney buying most of 21st Century Fox and the GOP-led FCC rolling back net neutrality.Bitcoin futures on the Cboe (CBOE) got off to a strong start, trading at their best levels on Friday amid typically volatile moves for the cryptocurrency. Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen said that Bitcoin played a very small role in the payments landscape, but that it was ""not a stable store of value"" and ""highly speculative."" Her remarks add to the chorus of banking officials weighing in on the much-hyped cryptocurrency. They echo those of Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and others who believe Bitcoin, which can gain or lose thousands of dollars in a day, can't be depended on to retain consistent value.CME Group (CME) will launch its Bitcoin futures on Dec. 18.The megadeal is a reality: Disney is buying Fox's entertainment assets for an enterprise value of $66.1 billion. It includes 20th Century Fox's movie and TV studios, National Geographic, FX, 22 Fox regional sports networks, and certain international assets. Disney CEO Bob Iger, who is extending his contract past 2019 to 2021 because of the merger, expressed enthusiasm about the deal's ability to boost the media giant's direct-to-consumer strategy and spread the ESPN brand internationally. It's not clear how regulators feel about the transaction, and Disney has promised a $2.5 billion breakup fee. Fox will keep its broadcast, news as well sports networks FS1, FS2 and Big Ten Network. Disney and Fox shares soared.Separately, Disney should expect a windfall from its latest entrant to the ""Star Wars"" franchise, ""The Last Jedi,"" which has already garnered largely positive reviews from critics and early viewers. Some analysts are expecting around $200 million from the film domestically. The film opened to the public on Thursday evening, with an estimated $45 million in ticket salesThe Republican-led Federal Communications Commission voted to repeal utilitylike oversight on internet service providers, delivering regulatory reversal sought by Comcast, AT&T, Verizon Communications and other ISPs. FCC chairman Ajit Pai  said the new rules will ""return regulatory parity to the internet economy."" He said some giant internet companies engage in anti-consumer behavior, while ISPs have been unfairly targeted by regulators. State regulators, Comcast and others said Congress should step in and pass internet legislation. One analyst put the chances of that at less than 30%.The Federal Reserve raised rates at its final meeting of the year, as expected. Policymakers also still expect to raise interest rates three times next year and didn't seem concerned about Trump tax cuts overheating the economy. Economic data backed a Goldilocks scenario. November retail sales were much stronger than expected, core consumer inflation cooled.Several biotechs popped on news stemming from the American Society of Hematology conference last week in Atlanta, while clinical trial data from others fell short. Bluebird Bio (BLUE) soared Monday after it reported improvement in patients using its LentiGlobin therapy to treat sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. Fellow CAR-T player Juno Therapeutics (JUNO), though, retreated nearly 22% in two days despite strong data in patients with a form of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Investors wanted more data, analysts said. On Tuesday, GlycoMimetics (GLYC) rocketed on data from its drug in acute myeloid leukemia, but Global Blood Therapeutics (GBT) sank following its presentation of its sickle cell disease drug. Spark Therapeutics (ONCE) crashed on its hemophilia A drug data, suggesting a later approval than a rival treatment from Biomarin (BMRN).

116,DAL,"Spirit Airlines (SAVE) on Thursday said it would begin expanding service in New Orleans, adding flights between that city and a handful of airports along the East Coast and the central U.S. — including major airports for United Airlines (UAL) and JetBlue (JBLU).XThe ultra-low-cost carrier's advance follows concerns earlier this year about whether Spirit could withstand a more concerted effort by United to match the carrier on some airfares in the legacy carrier's major airports. However, fears of a downward spiral eased last month after Spirit signaled firmer ticket pricing, and some analysts say the carrier stands to benefit from more travel among millennials.Spirit on Thursday said it would add new nonstop flights between Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport and Boston — a big market for JetBlue — as well as Newark/New York — a United hub — and Tampa and Minneapolis/St. Paul. Those flights start this week.Spirit on Thursday was also set to begin making daily, nonstop flights from Hartford and Pittsburgh to Tampa and Fort Myers. The discounter, which announced those flights on Tuesday, also said at that time it would offer new service to Palm Beach from Chicago.On Wednesday, Spirit announced that it would expand its flight network to Columbus, Ohio — offering service between John Glenn Columbus International Airport and a variety of destinations, including New Orleans, Las Vegas and several cities in Florida.The flights from Columbus, where Ohio State University is located, start in February and March. Their timing is intended to line up with the Spring Break travel season.""Given the millennial generation is spending more of its disposable income on leisure travel, Spirit is in a solid position to capitalize on this generational shift,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note last month.""In addition,"" she added, ""as a growing number of price sensitive young millennials enter the workforce, Spirit could be an attractive option given larger carriers will have difficulty matching low fares.""Spirit rose 0.5% to 34.95 in the stock market today. United fell 0.9% and JetBlue rose 0.2%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.Analysts in general cheered Spirit's third-quarter results and outlook last month.""SAVE didn't spend a lot of time complaining about other airlines, a nice change of pace, and for the most part kept the focus on itself,"" Wolfe Research analyst Hunter Keay said in a research note late last month. ""That implies they have control over their own fate.""He added that the carrier had signaled optimism on close-in airfare prices, holiday demand, and cost management.

118,DAL,"American Airlines (AAL) on Thursday said it would be ""disappointed"" if unit revenue next year was outpaced by an oft-used measurement for costs, but shares of the airline sank after it signaled that its 2018 flight capacity would escalate from the growth expected this year.XInvestors also digested a forecast for higher costs from Southwest Airlines (LUV), a day after Alaska Airlines (ALK) predicted rising expenses. But they gave Spirit Airlines (SAVE) a boost after the discount carrier signaled it had stopped some of the bleeding after rivals tried to match it on airfares.The forecasts come as analysts increasingly pick over executives' remarks for clues as to how the industry will navigate 2018. When United Airlines (UAL) management last week provided next to no clarity on how it would meet long-term financial goals and keep costs in line next year as it expands service, Wall Street deep-sixed the stock, sinking it 12%.While other analysts have argued that United's problems are uniquely its own, Stifel analyst Joseph DeNardi said in a research note last week that ""we believe more clarity regarding 2018 industry growth will be a primary catalyst for airline stocks"" for the rest of 2017.American management on Thursday said that it was still developing its 2018 operating plans, with a formal flight capacity to come when it reports fourth-quarter results. But on a schedule-over-schedule basis, it said it expects capacity — or available seats on flights and how far and often they get flown — to be up roughly 2.5% next year, another focal point for some analysts.That would be higher than the roughly 1% expected for this year, raising the prospect that other airlines might add flights to match American and cut fares to compete.The carrier also said it expected adjusted unit costs to rise around 2% next year, with higher salaries and benefits — as well as costs related to maintenance, rents and landing fees — likely contributing the increase.Few other specifics were given about how American will navigate 2018. But management repeated during the call some iteration of ""we know who we are"" or ""we're running our own show.""""We're not going to define ourselves against what others are doing,"" CEO Doug Parker said.Shares plunged 4.7% to closed at 48.63 on the stock market today, reversing an earlier gain to 53.19. The stock is working its way through a cup-with-handle base with a 53.84 buy point. Delta Air Lines (DAL) fell 2.5%, and United Airlines rose 0.1%.Still, Parker touted American Air's ""measured rollout"" of Basic Economy after United's more aggressive expansion of the fare class made it temporarily uncompetitive. American said demand for Premium Economy seats remains high, and about half of its customers are buying main cabin seats when given the option between that and Basic Economy.American's earnings followed a travel advisory the NAACP issued this week warning African American passengers against traveling with the carrier. In its announcement, the NAACP cited several incidents that it said ""suggest a corporate culture of racial insensitivity and possible racial bias on the part of American Airlines.""Parker said the carrier was eager to learn from any missteps, and that it expected to work with the NAACP on the issue in the ""very near term."" Asked if the advisory had an impact on bookings, Parker said: ""We haven't seen anything, but that is not the point.""The carrier sees Q4 unit revenue increasing 2.5% to 4.5%, and said the demand environment ""remains robust."" Unit revenue measures sales an airline gets in relation to how many available seats it has and how far and often it flies them.Earnings per share of $1.42 topped Zacks estimates for $1.39. Revenue of $10.878 billion missed views for $10.884 billion.Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria caused more than 8,000 cancellations and reduced pretax earnings by $75 million.""We are playing the long game at American to create value in an industry that has been fundamentally transformed,"" said Chairman and CEO Doug Parker in a statement.Shares of Spirit jumped 6.9% to close at 36.08 on Thursday after the low-fare, high-fee carrier forecast a unit revenue decline of 4%-6%, better than the 6.3% drop in the third quarter due to ""aggressive competitive pricing action in many of our markets.""But for the fourth quarter, the carrier cited ""continued improvement"" in revenue management. It said there was still a leftover impact from Hurricane Harvey, but not one from Irma, and that it had temporarily cut service in its Caribbean locations.Spirit canceled over 1,650 flights related to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, costing $40 million in revenue, along with revenue overhang from the flight cancellations related to what it alleged was a ""pilot work action"" earlier this year.This summer, a price-cutting battle between Spirit and United raised Wall Street questions over whether the ultra-low-cost carrier model was broken and whether United could balance cheaper fares with the costs of operations.""Contrary to some rhetoric of late, the Spirit model continues to produce excellent returns,"" CCO Matt Klein said on Spirit's earnings call on Thursday.American CEO Parker may have added to that rhetoric indirectly on Thursday, saying that the industry, after bankruptcies and consolidation, was in the ""final stages of a maturation process."" And he said that ultra-low-cost carriers, in search of new markets, have run into trouble as they move into the nation's big airport hubs. The remarks echoed those of United President Scott Kirby in July.Third-quarter EPS of 94 cents beat estimates for 90 cents; revenue of $687.2 million squeaked past estimates for $687 million.IBD'S TAKE: As an investor, you may wonder why buy points are important. The chart action of these top stocks offers an answer.Southwest said fourth-quarter adjusted unit costs would be ""higher than previously expected"" in large part because of a ""shift in advertising spend"" in the quarter, costs related to the carrier's planned expansion to Hawaii, and technology investments.The cost forecast was ""probably higher than investors were expecting,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note.EPS of 88 cents topped forecasts by a penny, while revenue of $5.27 billion came in just shy of expectations for $5.297 billion. Unit revenue fell 0.5%, due to the introduction of a new reservation system. Disruption from natural disasters cost $100 million and forced 5,000 flight cancellations.The carrier sees Q4 unit revenue being ""up slightly"" to up 1.5%.Shares sank 3.6% to 55.11 after earlier advancing to 58.72. Southwest is pulling back from a cup-with-handle base entry of 59.67 .RELATED:United Airlines Dives On Disastrous Earnings Call; Rival Carriers FallDelta Air Lines Sees Turnaround In Crucial, Highly Competitive Market

122,DAL,"American Airlines (AAL) on Wednesday joined United Airlines (UAL) in raising its fourth-quarter unit revenue, citing better prices across its global network and more flights booked closer to departure times.X The figures, reported ahead of Delta Air Lines' (DAL) fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday, indicate that the airlines have had more leeway in charging passengers more to fly, amid solid demand and rising fuel costs, which airlines pass onto travelers.American said it expected total unit revenue to rise 5%-6%, better than an earlier forecast for a 2.5%-4.5% bump. The carrier also said it expected Q4 adjusted pretax margin to come in at roughly 6.5%-7%, compared to an earlier view for 4.5%-6.5%.Unit costs, excluding fuel and special items, were expected to rise roughly 4%, American said, largely due to pay raises to employees and other expenses. But the forecast was lower than its previous outlook, due to a higher than expected completion factor — or total flights completed.American shares sparked 3.3% higher to close at 53.78 in the stock market today, stopping just short of a 53.84 buy point. Delta rose 3.1% to 55.86 and was still within range of a 54.16 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. United, which gave its Q4 forecast late Tuesday, jumped 6.7%. Southwest (LUV) gained 0.9%, and Hawaiian Holdings (HA) added 2.9% after sinking 6.3% Tuesday.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.American said it expected to record around $315 million in pretax special items in Q4, including costs related to merger integration and fleet restructuring, as well as the $1,000 bonuses given to employees following the tax cuts that Trump has signed into law.Southwest on Tuesday said it was sticking with its Q4 unit revenue forecast, but the stock was also downgraded yesterday by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which said GOP tax cuts would boost business travel at Delta, United and American but leave Southwest will little benefit.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Airline Industry News And Stocks To WatchLooking For Breakout Stocks Like Nvidia?

123,DAL,"Southwest Airlines (LUV) has a good earnings and balance-sheet profile, but its focus on domestic traffic means Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) will benefit more from a boost in business travel sparked by tax cuts, analysts said.X Meanwhile, United boosted its outlook for Q4 passenger unit revenue and now sees it coming in about flat from a year ago, driven by stronger yields and better close-in demand. Last month, the carrier predicted it would be down 2% to flat.Bank of America Merrill Lynch downgraded Southwest to neutral along with Alaska Air (ALK), while JetBlue (JBLU) was cut to underperform. American was upgraded to buy; Delta and United were maintained at buy.""We believe Southwest is the highest quality airline in the group with a very conservative balance sheet and low earnings volatility,"" BofA Merrill Lynch said. ""However, we expect business travel and international markets to outperform Southwest's largely domestic-oriented system in 2018.""Southwest shares closed down 2.5% at 62.38 on the stock market today for a fifth straight decline but still extended from a 59.99 buy point. Delta dipped 0.9% to 54.17, still within range of a 54.16 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. United ended virtually flat but jumped 3% late, and American lost 0.1%.JetBlue, which on Tuesday also said it would add service between Florida and the Caribbean, rallied 0.9%, and Alaska fell 2%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.Late Tuesday, United also said December traffic grew 2.7% and capacity increased 3.7%, while load factor declined by 0.8 percentage point to 82.3%.Earlier in the day, Southwest said it still expects unit revenue to increase 1%-2%. The airline said that passenger traffic in December rose 2.6%, while its flight capacity rose 1.8% and load factor was up 0.7 percentage point to 83.3%.The monthly traffic figures come as Delta prepares to report fourth-quarter results on Thursday. Delta's financials have kept analysts relatively happy, but Wall Street appears likely to be more focused on cost containment this year after industry expenses rose in 2017.Southwest, which reports fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 25, last week said it would give employees a $1,000 cash bonus ""to celebrate the recent passage of the tax reform legislation.""The company also said it would exercise an option to order 40 Boeing (BA) 737 MAX 8 aircraft — 15 next year and 25 in 2020. It deferred 23 737 MAX 7 orders. Southwest at the time said its capacity growth plans for 2018 remained unchanged.American Airlines and JetBlue last week also said they would give their employees $1,000 following the tax cuts, which President Trump signed into law last month.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Airline Industry News And Stocks To WatchLooking For Breakout Stocks Like Nvidia?

124,DAL,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) on Wednesday forecast higher fourth-quarter costs, partly a reflection of the power outage at the carrier's Atlanta hub in December that forced some 1,400 flight cancellations, and the carrier left its margin and unit revenue outlook unchanged despite signs of strong demand.X The carrier said nonfuel unit costs, including profit-sharing, likely rose 5.5% vs. a year earlier, up from a forecast for a 5%-5.5% increase given last month. Delta cited the outage, ""continued investment in our people and product combined with accelerated depreciation of aircraft retirements"" as reasons for the higher costs.Delta said it expected to take a $25-$50 million hit to pretax income during the fourth quarter due to flight disruptions that resulted from the outage.The company said it still expects passenger unit revenue to increase around 4% in the fourth quarter, with operating margin holding at around 11% as higher fuel prices continue to weigh against strong sales trends.Fuel costs should continue to rise for Delta and other carriers. U.S. crude futures rose to $61.63 a barrel on Wednesday, their highest close since December 2014.Delta also said, as previously indicated, that it expected to book a one-time charge of $150-$200 million in the fourth quarter due to the tax cuts that President Trump signed into law last month.Analysts generally expect tax cuts to benefit the airlines, but the lower corporate rate will bring down the value of a company's deferred tax assets, or assets that companies can use to lessen their tax burden when they suffer a loss. Banks like Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) have forecast multibillion-dollar hits to profits as a result of the tax cuts' effect on those assets.Shares of Delta slipped 1.85% to 55.69 in the stock market today, but the stock was still in buy range of a 54.16 entry of a cup-with-handle base.American Airlines (AAL) slid 1.25%. In a letter to employees on Tuesday, American Airlines said it would give $1,000 to non-officer employees — a $130 million reward in total — in the first quarter due to the tax cuts. Southwest Airlines (LUV) retreated 2.1%. Southwest Airlines on Tuesday also said it would give $1,000 bonuses to employees this month, and it also stepped up its fleet investments with Boeing (BA).United Airlines (UAL) sank 0.65%.American Air, Southwest, United Air and other carriers should report December traffic figures in the coming days.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.Delta also cut its Q4 forecast for flight capacity — a measure of an airline's overall flight coverage — to 2.3% growth, down from a range of 2.5%-3.0% given in December. For December, passenger traffic dipped 0.4%, while capacity rose 0.9% and load factor fell 1.1 percentage points to 84.2%.The monthly figures come as the airline industry gears up for Q4 earnings season and some three weeks after a bullish investor day, when it forecast earnings-per-share growth of 10%-15% this year. But cost management could be more of a focus for Delta and investors in 2018, after the carrier put more money toward its fleet and hiked employee wages last year.Meanwhile, in the wake of the Atlanta outage, the carrier said on Tuesday that it was ""keeping a close eye on"" a winter storm brewing off the southeast coast of the U.S. that could drift further north.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Congress OKs Trump Tax Cuts; These Companies Are Celebrating The MostBig Changes Are Coming To Airbus C Suite Amid Corruption ProbesIt's Official: Boeing Loses Massive Delta Air Lines Order To Airbus

125,DAL,"The Geared Turbofan jet engine from United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney unit may transform from a drag on earnings to a significant profit driver over the next decade, according to one analyst.X United Tech invested roughly $15 billion in its next-gen Geared Turbofan (GTF), which allows different engine components to operate at different speeds, improving fuel efficiency while producing less noise and exhaust. Hopes were high as Pratt & Whitney sought to dethrone General Electric's (GE) Leap engine.But manufacturing issues and delays dogged the GTF, testing the patience of shareholders as well as customers like Qatar Airways and Airbus (EADSY). Delta Air Lines (DAL) also has ordered the engines for its 100 A321neo aircraft, set for delivery in early 2020. In October, United Tech backed its target of 350-400 GTF deliveries for 2017 as it resolves production problems.In a note to clients Wednesday, RBC Capital Markets analyst Matthew McConnell wrote that initial ""engine teething issues"" seem to have been fixed, paving the path for a successful ramp-up in GTF production and deliveries.""We believe the long-term growth opportunity at Pratt & Whitney is underappreciated, not just as the GTF ramps up and engine kinks are fully derisked, but also given the rich aftermarket opportunity from its large installed base of V2500s, competitive take-aways on key upcoming business jet platforms, and Pratt's sole-source position on all three Air Force mega programs,"" McConnell said.The Connecticut-based United Tech, a Dow Jones industrial average components, competes with fellow Dow stock GE and Rolls-Royce in the aerospace and defense markets, supplying engines to massive Pentagon programs like Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35.McConnell expects 2018 to mark the final year of margin headwinds in Pratt that have weighed on United Tech shares. The business could generate double-digit operating profit growth over the next 10 years, driving free cash flow of $10 per share by 2020, he estimated.However, he cautioned it is ""too early to declare victory"" on the GTF ramp-up, from 138 in 2016 to 700-plus in 2018. United Tech fell short of its target for 200 GTF deliveries in 2016, he added, and more challenges could result in ""further penalties and potentially order cancellations,"" weighing on investor sentiment.Shares of United Tech closed up 0.3% at 130.45 on the stock market today, after rallying 1.5% Wednesday on the RBC note, which also upgraded the stock to outperform. The stock is out of proper buy range after breaking out from a 123.38 cup-with-handle entry. GE rose 2.1%, Airbus jumped 2.5%, while Delta ended flat.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? IBD's Leaderboard  is a curated list of potential stock market winners.In his Wednesday note, McConnell also described United Tech's Rockwell Collins (COL) acquisition as a key free cash flow driver.""Rockwell Collins has among the stronger underlying outlooks of its commercial aerospace peers, driven by significant new content wins on next-generation platforms that position it well for the next five years,"" he said, while noting that the ""pricey"" $30 billion buy will likely deliver a return on investment in roughly five years.But the deal reportedly raised concerns from Airbus that it would keep United Tech from fixing the problems that delayed aircraft deliveries.MORE YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Dow Jones Industrial Average And Dow Stocks: News And AnalysisCES 2018 News: The World's Largest Consumer Tech ShowQ4 Earnings Preview: Who Joins Facebook On List Of Stocks Expecting 50%-Plus Growth?

W.W.

131,DAL,"Apple (AAPL) gained ground and was on the verge of climbing back above a 156.75 buy point as the iPhone giant helped bump the major indexes higher in afternoon trading Wednesday.XApple had broken out of an 11-week flat base at 156.75 on Aug. 2 following a solid fiscal third quarter. (EPS rose 18% and revenue 7%, the biggest top-line increase in seven quarters.) The stock is now forming a new flat base with a 165.04 buy point.At 2:30 p.m. EDT, the Nasdaq composite edged less than 0.1% higher but still held on to last week's gain of more than 1.4%. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average were both up less than 0.1%.Breadth remains positive in the equities market, with winners topping losers by a roughly 4-3 margin in the NYSE and by approximately 100 issues on the Nasdaq.The Nasdaq 100 also rose 0.1%. The Russell 2000 was virtually flat, but the S&P SmallCap 600 was off nearly 0.3%. Volume is running mildly lower vs. the same time Tuesday on both main exchanges.Apple had not gained a lot of ground, rising 5.2% after its Aug. 2 breakout at 156.75, before falling back to the proper entry and sinking below the 50-day moving average. While the rise back above the 156.75 is not an ideal entry right now, an investor with a big cushion in the iPhone maker could decide to add a small amount of shares to the existing position if the stock retakes the 50-day line in robust or increasing turnover.Apple's earnings had dropped 10% in the fiscal year ended in September 2016 on an 8% slump in revenue. However, Apple has been staging a classic turnaround in fundamentals lately. In the past three quarters, the iMac maker's earnings rose 2%, 11% and 18% vs. year-ago levels, following a three-quarter slump. And in Q4 (ended in September), earnings are seen increasing 12% to $1.87 a share, which would mark a third quarter in a row of mild double-digit gains. It's slated to report Q4 results on Nov. 2 after the market close.For fiscal year 2019, the Street sees earnings accelerating 23% to $11.04 a share.When Apple reports earnings this month, keep an eye out for a potential increase in either its dividend or stock-buyback plans. The current annualized yield is 1.6%, still trailing the S&P 500 (currently near 1.9%), but Apple's payout growth rate is estimated at 24% annually.On IBD Stock Checkup, Apple has seen its Composite Rating rise from 51 at the start of 2017 to 69. By itself, that's not a great number, and growth investors will want to seek those companies with a minimum Composite grade of 95 or higher (on a scale of 1 to 99) in order to find the fastest movers among the market's leadership. However, Apple's Relative Price Strength Rating has improved to a decent 78, up from 59 on Jan. 1.Apple has risen as much as 39% after breaking out of a first-stage cup with handle on Jan. 6-9 at 118.12. That cup with handle, which formed from October to early January, was part of a long bottoming-base pattern that typically forms among stocks that suffer a deep decline as fundamentals soften; then it bottoms out and gets prepared for a potential new stock run to 52-week highs.Fellow Nasdaq component Alphabet (GOOGL), which has launched a major advertising campaign for its new smart speaker called Google Home Mini, rose more than 1% and breached the 1,000 level for the first time since July 24. That gain places the megacap internet search giant in a good position to potentially break out from a new flat base with a 1,006.29 buy point.Alphabet's earnings have risen 27%, 7%, 28%, and 27% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters. The Street expects Q3 profit to rise 15% to $8.32 a share.Alphabet, whose market value of $694 billion trails only Apple ($808 billion) within the Nasdaq, is also seen growing the top line at an impressive clip: up 21% to $27.16 billion in the just-ended third quarter and up 20% in Q4 to $31.22 billion.Elsewhere, Delta Air Lines (DAL) ramped up 1% to 53.26 in fast turnover and added more work to the right side of a new base. The Atlanta-based air transport giant reported a 6% rise in third-quarter revenue to $11.06 billion, matching the biggest increase in 12 quarters. Earnings slipped 8% to $1.57 a share but were still mildly above the consensus forecast.Airlines were among the day's best industry groups, joining steel, steel alloys, metal distributors, diversified medical and internet content firms.In the IBD 50, Nvidia (NVDA) gained 1% to 190.84 and has now stretched its gain from a 174.66 buy point in a flat base to more than 9%.The fast-growing maker of GPUs (graphics processing units) and chip sets for new industries, including deep learning and self-driving cars, is No. 9 in the IBD 50. Earnings in the October-ending fiscal third quarter are seen growing 13% to 94 cents a share, on top of an 89% leap in the year-ago quarter.Nvidia is also making gains since its addition to IBD's Swing Trader service.In other financial markets, oil continued to rally. WTI near-term futures gained nearly 0.7% to $51.26 a barrel. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond eased a bit to 2.34%, but is still up sharply from its Sept. 7 near-term low of 2.05%. Fed funds futures currently see a 90% chance that the Federal Reserve will boost short-term interest rates by a quarter point at its Dec. 12-13 meeting.The Fed is slated to release minutes from its October meeting on interest rates at 2 p.m. EDT.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 has showcased companies that are the new powerhouses of the U.S. and global economy. Institutional investors seek to find firms with exceptional earnings and sales growth, an outstanding product or service, and the highest pretax margins and return on equity in their industries. As seen in a graph on Page B4 of the IBD Weekly, the price-weighted IBD 50 shows a total return of 750% from April 11, 2003 to Dec. 31, 2016 — equal to an average annual gain of 16.9%.

133,DAL,"Cheaper flights to Hawaii may be coming soon, as Southwest Airlines (LUV) confirms it will finally fly to the Pacific islands with help from the latest Boeing (BA) 737 jets.XSouthwest has long hinted at — and passengers have long hoped for — such a move. The airline, which recently became the first in North America to fly the 737 Max 8, linked its decision to this new and upgraded Boeing model.""For us, it's the perfect fit for Hawaii,"" Chief Revenue Officer Andrew Watterson told Bloomberg. ""The Max has got 14% better range and 14% better fuel burn"" than the model it succeeded.The discount carrier plans to kick off services to Hawaii within the next two years, initially from California.Flights to Hawaii can be logistically challenging, but the 737 Max 8's flying range of about 3,500 nautical miles is enough to comfortably cover most flights from the West Coast to Hawaii.For Southwest, an advanced new reservation system is also making the flights there possible. It expects to lower fares to Hawaii, one of the most popular destinations for travel within the United States. Regulatory approvals are pending.Southwest shares closed up 0.4% at 58.81 on the stock market today, eyeing a 59.67 entry off a first-stage, cup-with-handle base. Hawaiian Airlines (HA) dived as much as 6% on the news, before trimming losses to 2.5%. Boeing added 0.2% and is now extended 7% from a mid-September breakout from a second-stage flat base.IBD'S TAKE: As investors fret over airlines' pricing and expansion plans, Tesla CEO Elon Musk is looking way beyond. Here's a look at how SpaceX could upend the airline and aerospace industries. Airline stocks are on the mend after getting pummeled over the course of the third quarter. Investors had cooled on the industry group amid intense pricing wars, higher fuel costs and the shock of a string of hurricanes.However, Delta Air Lines (DAL) beat Q3 EPS and revenue estimates Wednesday, while signaling that it expects improvement in the key trans-Atlantic market in the months to come. Delta shares changed little Thursday, just 4% below a 55.85 buy point off a cup base.American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) nudged 0.3% and 1.1% lower respectively, but both industry stalwarts on Tuesday forecast better-than-expected unit revenue and margins for Q3.

"
134,DAL,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) on Wednesday said that the trans-Atlantic market would see the biggest quarter-to-quarter improvement in Q4, as business travel strengthens on Europe's emergence from a recession.XThat forecast comes even as low-cost, long-haul carriers in Europe have proliferated in the airspace above the Atlantic Ocean. Competition from those carriers has added a layer of stress for Delta, American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL), which have tried to shore up sales by adding a wider variety of high-end and low-end seating classes to their cabins.But the resilience in Delta's international business overall, management said on Wednesday's conference call to discuss the carrier's strong Q3 results and Q4 outlook, has been a bit of a ""surprise"" and a key aspect in driving positive unit revenue.Management said domestic performance would see the second-highest level of improvement. President Glen Hauenstein noted that the carrier hadn't seen any ""material decline"" in traffic to and from Las Vegas following last week's mass shooting which killed at least 58 people.""That was a surprise, and I hope it's not a sad commentary on the human state that we're getting used to this,"" he said.The company expects the Pacific region to see the third-best level of sequential improvement in the fourth quarter, followed by the Latin America region, where a string of hurricanes and an earthquake have ravaged the Caribbean and Mexico.Delta forecast Q4 passenger unit revenue — a key industry metric that looks at revenue as it relates to an airline's total flight coverage — to rise 2%-4%, with operating margins of 11%-13%. Wall Street expected Delta to forecast a roughly 1.5% unit-revenue gain for Q4, according to a Cowen research note last week. Meanwhile, CEO Ed Bastian vowed not to pay import duties on Bombardier's C Series jets, of which Delta has agreed to buy 75 worth $5 billion at list prices, after the U.S. imposed a 300% tariff amid claims the Canadian companies received illegal state aid. The airline may delay delivery of the jets, which are due to next year.Delta reported Q3 EPS of $1.57, down 8%, on revenue of $11.1 billion, up 5.5% — topping Zacks estimates for $1.54 and $11.037 billion.However, the carrier said non-fuel unit costs for the full year would be up roughly 4% as a result of a new profit-sharing plan, a depreciation of narrow-body jets and of flight cancellations resulting from bad weather. Management called that rate ""not sustainable"" but said that moving away from its cap on growth would help.""Capacity will play a part,"" CFO Paul Jacobson said on the call. ""We made a decision to cap capacity at 1% this year to improve revenue performance. But this also put pressure on costs. Returning to a more normalized growth rate next year will further benefit our CASM.""Shares of Delta closed up 0.7% at 53.07 on the stock market today, making its way toward a 55.85 buy point of a cup base. American Airlines (AAL) dipped 0.4% to 52.83 and United Airlines (UAL) eased 0.5% to 67.40. On Tuesday, American rose 4.8%, nearing a 54.58 buy point of a cup base, while United Airlines jumped 4.7% as both carriers said Q3 unit revenue would be better than expected.Southwest (LUV) gained 0.9% to 58.55. That stock is forming a base with a 64.49 buy point.JetBlue (JBLU) shares climbed 1.5% to 20.53 despite estimating that hurricanes reduced revenue by $44 million in Q3 and $70 million-$90 million in Q4, with adjusted EPS seeing a hit of 6-7 cents in Q3 and 10-13 cents in Q4.IBD'S TAKE: As investors fret over airlines' pricing and expansion plans, Elon Musk is looking way, way beyond. Here's a look at how SpaceX could upend companies like Boeing and the airlines. In recent months, many airline stocks have either threatened to undercut their postelection gains or actually undercut them. In recent days, however, those stocks have rebounded.Wall Street this summer has worried that an airfare discount battle between United, Spirit Airlines (SAVE) and Frontier Airlines in some of United's big airport hubs would swallow the rest of the industry. Those fears were followed by hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria along with earthquakes in Mexico, which forced thousands of flight cancellations and prompted airlines to pull back on their financial forecasts.However, guidance this week and last from the big three airlines has indicated to analysts that airlines have kept airfare prices high enough to appease Wall Street.American, in an investor update on Tuesday, cited ""stronger than anticipated yield performance"" on airfares in raising its outlook for unit revenue.In a research note on Tuesday about United, Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth said that ""Houston appears to have recovered a bit faster from Hurricane Harvey than United had originally anticipated"" and that ""drags from the (ultralow-cost carrier) pricing competition and lower demand in Guam appears to have stabilized (not better, but not worse).""Still, Southwest on Tuesday began a 72-hour sale of reduced-price tickets, some of which are advertised for as low as $49 one way. JetBlue, meanwhile, has announced a one-day sale for one-way fares as low as $31.Further out, Delta's recent decision to increase profit-sharing for its employees — by moving them all to a single, higher-paying plan from the existing two — could temper earnings.""Although we acknowledge the slight cost increase, part of our thesis on an improved airline industry rests on culture improvement and employee engagement in driving better operational outcomes,"" Barclays analyst Brandon Oglenski said in a research note. ""With Delta's recent changes, we suspect the carrier has the most generous payout of the large airlines, begging the question whether others will follow.""Delta, on the call, said that it had always intended to have a single profit-sharing plan and that it would be good for employees.RELATED:Delta Air Lines Earnings: 3 Things To WatchAmerican, United Airlines Jump On Strong Q3 Unit Revenue; Delta On TapHere's Why Delta, JetBlue And Other Airlines Are Surging TodayUnited, American Both Wage Fare War, But Analyst Sours On One Airline

All three major indexes — the tech-heavy Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average — traded quietly higher.XAmong the Dow Jones Industrial components, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) moved up 1.5% after being upgraded from hold to buy at Jefferies & Co. The medical products maker is forming a flat base with a 137.18 potential entry.Meanwhile, Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) followed up on Tuesday's breakout with a 1% advance. Shares remain within the 5% buy range from a 82.09 flat-base entry. Cisco Systems (CSCO) edged slightly higher as it etches a handle onto its cup-shaped base. Its potential buy point is 34.20 — a dime above the high on Sept. 26.Among companies reporting earnings, Delta Air Lines (DAL) reported strong Q3 results, launching shares over 2% higher in opening trade. But that gain had been trimmed to just 0.2%. The airline carrier is forging a cup base with a potential buy point at 55.85. Fellow airline American Airlines (AAL) reversed lower, falling 0.8%, as it approaches its own cup-base 54.58 entry.Leading payment processor PayPal (PYPL) jumped 2% higher after seeing an analyst upgrade from Morgan Stanley. The analyst raised its rating from equal-weight to overweight with a price target of 76 — a 15% premium to Tuesday's closing price. Shares of the IBD 50 member are over 50% from a 55.24 flat-base buy point.Among leading growth stocks, electric automaker Tesla (TSLA) continues to swing around its 50-day line, falling back below it today with its 1% decline.Within the S&P 500, apparel makers were on the decline.

The stock still in the 5% buy range from a 39.35 buy point.On the downside, Electronic Arts (EA) faltered 0.6% as it battles for support at its 50-day line. A flat-base breakout on July 26 hasn't led to any gains, and the stock has paused long enough to create a new flat base — one that sports a 122.89 entry.RELATED:Delta Air Lines Beats Q3 Forecasts, Gives Strong Q4 OutlookDow Jones Industrial Average And Dow Stocks: News And AnalysisBig Bank Earnings This Week: What To Watch5 Bank Stocks Not To Overlook As Giants Report: Investing Action Plan
"
136,DAL,"Here's Your Investing Action Plan: what you need to know for Wednesday and beyond.Earnings season gets underway in earnest with reports from Delta Air Lines (DAL) on Wednesday and banking giants such as Citigroup (C) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) later this week.XFor the third quarter as whole, S&P 500 earnings are expected to grow 2% from the same period last year on a 5% revenue gain, according to Zacks Investment Research. That follows double-digit profit growth in the first two quarters of 2017.The technology sector should earnings up nearly 10% as revenue grows 7%. While flagship names Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB) will step up to the dock as November dawns, smaller names like Barracuda Networks (CUDA), out Tuesday night, are on tap this week.Estimates for the financial sector have notably worsened over the last two months, as last quarter's back-to-back hurricanes weigh on corporate profits, especially on insurers and reinsurers such as Travelers (TRV), American International Group (AIG), Chubb (CB) and Everest Re (RE).Insurers, who account for a quarter of the finance sector's total earnings, are expected to see earnings decline 25% vs. a year ago, contributing to a dip in Q3 earnings for the broad financial sector, according to Zacks.But both Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase are estimated to grow adjusted profits and sales in the September quarter when they report Thursday.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.The impact of the storms on insurers may already be priced in, with AIG moving back toward a buy point of 67.57 after bottoming in early September and Progressive (PGR) crossing a 49.11 buy point off a flat base.Transporters and air carriers are also likely to see a hurricane-related knock on profit growth, but Delta Air Lines added 1.9% on the stock market today as the stock moves toward a 55.85 buy point ahead of the carrier's report on Wednesday.Analysts call for Delta earnings to shrink 9% to $1.54 as revenue rises 5% to $11.04 billion, Zacks said. Delta already has reported strong preliminary Q3 unit revenue figures, with United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) following suit on Tuesday.Finally, small-cap companies, which are not part of the S&P 500, should see earnings growth return in Q3. For the S&P 600 index as a whole, earnings are expected to be up 11% vs. a year ago on 5% higher revenue, snapping a run of earnings declines in three of the last four quarters.Small-cap stocks also have been leading in recent months.The finance, technology and energy sectors are likely to drive small-cap growth. Without the finance sector's contribution, small caps' Q3 earnings would drop 0.3%.RELATED:American, United Airlines Jump On Strong Q3 Unit Revenue; Delta On TapWal-Mart Sees 40% Online Sales Jump, Sets $20 Billion BuybackMove Over Techs, There's A New Sector Leader On Wall StreetNvidia Shares Jump As It Debuts Computer For Self-Driving Cars

XMeanwhile, the S&P 500 moved up 0.2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was at its break-even mark. All three indexes made record highs. Volume was tracking significantly higher across both exchanges vs. the same time Monday.Among the Dow Jones Industrial components, Wal-Mart remained in its 5% buy range from an 82.09 flat-base entry in afternoon trade Tuesday. The discount retailer jumped over 5% after announcing a $20 billion buyback, while standing behind its fiscal-year 2018 guidance. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based company also said it would look to further cut costs as competition with e-commerce behemoth Amazon.com (AMZN) intensifies.Amazon shares traded 0.6% lower.On the downside, Intel (INTC) declined over 1%. The stock is still in buy range from a 38.55 flat-base entry after a breakout on Oct. 2. The 5% buy zone tops out at 40.48,Airline stocks flew higher in the stock market today. American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) forecast better-than-expected Q3 unit revenue and margins early Tuesday, sparking advances of 4.8% and 5.5%, respectively. American is building the right side of a cup-shaped entry with a 54.58 entry. United remains stuck under long-term 200-day line.Meanwhile, Delta Air Lines (DAL) will report its Q3 results on Wednesday before the market open.

Analysts expect the airline's third-quarter earnings to decline to $1.54 per share on revenue of $11.4 billion.FANG stocks were under pressure in afternoon trade Tuesday with Netflix (NFLX) setting the pace to the downside, falling 1%. Shares are still in buy range after last week's breakout above a 190.05 cup-with-handle buy point. Facebook (FB) declined 0.6% as it continues to work on a flat base with a 175.59 entry.Leading growth stock Nvidia (NVDA) leapt higher after the graphics-chip maker unveiled new self-driving taxi hardware, and a partnership to launch an autonomous delivery truck fleet in 2018. Shares — which had been up as much 4% earlier Tuesday — were up almost 2%. Shares notched a fresh record high, and were up about 8% from a 174.66 flat-base entry.Fellow leading chip stocks Applied Materials (AMAT) and Broadcom (AVGO) were on the decline. Applied reversed from new highs, falling 1.1%, but is still about 9% above a 47.69 cup-with-handle buy point. Broadcom was turned away from its 50-day line, dropping nearly 1%. Shares continue to etch a flat base that shows a 259.46 potential buy point. A potential flaw is the stock's lagging relative strength line that indicates significant underperformance of the general market.Within the IBD 50, Leaderboard member Grubhub (GRUB) moved up 1.8%. The food delivery service has been stuck under its 50-day line since Oct. 5.On the downside, China-based Sina (SINA) extended a losing streak to five trading sessions, declining another 3% in heavy trading Tuesday.

"
138,DAL,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) reports third-quarter earnings on Wednesday, kicking off the sector's results ahead of United Airlines (UAL), American Airlines (AAL) and others. Here are three things to watch.XWall Street more-or-less knows what it's getting for Delta Air Lines' third quarter, helped by the carrier's release of monthly traffic figures. So, as with all earnings seasons, investors will be turning to what Delta sees for the fourth quarter.On that front, Wall Street expects Delta to forecast around a 1.5% increase in fourth-quarter unit revenue, or sales an airline gets from travelers in relation to its overall flight capacity.""With continued low fuel prices and intense competition, the U.S. market is likely to remain competitive, which could cap fares from moving higher,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note last week.Intense competition, of course, is good news for passengers because it means they're likelier to get a better bargain on airfare. But investors hate it, because lower airfares hurt sales and profits.Much of the recent intense competition is the result of a push over the past few months by United Airlines to drive ultra-low-cost carriers like Spirit Airlines (SAVE) from some of the nation's busiest airports. American Airlines has remained committed to competing aggressively with the discounters.  Analysts have debated whether other carriers could get sucked in, as well.A 1.5% increase in fourth-quarter unit revenue would be slightly weaker than the carrier's Oct. 3 estimate of a roughly 2% gain for the third quarter. The Q3 forecast was hurt by Hurricane Irma. But when factoring out the storm, the quarter was regarded by some analysts as OK, lifting shares of other airlines in the process.Wolfe Research analyst Hunter Keay said Delta's forecast last week indicated that ""pricing held in pretty well in September and it isn't unreasonable to expect it's continuing into (Q4), too.""Delta, at a Cowen airline conference last month, suggested that trying to compete on sub-$40 fares might not always jibe with its vision for being the world's best global carrier. But a backslide into discounting is never too far away.""American will tell you and Delta will tell you we're not going to match Spirit fares, but we're going to match United fares,"" Becker said in an interview with IBD last month.As for the third quarter, Wall Street expects the carrier to report EPS of $1.54, down 9%, according to Zacks Investment Research. Revenue is seen increasing 5% to $11.037 billion.Shares of Delta dipped 0.5% to 51.74 in the stock market today. Delta is forming a cup base with a 55.85 buy point.American Airlines lost 1.4% to 50.60. American is forming a cup base with a 54.58 potential entry. Southwest Airlines (LUV) retreated 1.3% to 57.66 as it works its way through a cup pattern with a 64.49 potential buy point. United Airlines dipped 0.8% after retaking its 50-day line at the end of last month. All four airline stocks have rallied in recent weeks following corrections.IBD'S TAKE: As investors fret over airlines' pricing and expansion plans, Elon Musk is looking way, way beyond. Here's a look at how SpaceX could upend companies like Boeing (BA) and the airlines.  Delta's fourth-quarter international business could outperform its domestic results, Becker said. A stronger overseas forecast from Delta could ease investor concerns even as the legacy airlines dig in in the U.S.The improvement abroad would follow some steep competition earlier this year between U.S. carriers and the low-cost, long-haul carriers of the Atlantic.""The Atlantic market appears to have absorbed the growth, while other legacy carriers have adjusted their capacity for the new norm,"" Becker said in a research note.Better results in Brazil appear likely to improve the carrier's fortunes in Latin America, while the crowded Pacific market could still remain weak.Delta has targeted yearly adjusted unit-cost growth of under 2%. However, the carrier last month said that on Oct. 1, it would bring its staff under a single profit-sharing plan — one currently in place for the carrier's pilots.Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth said the adjustment could hurt earnings next year. Questions about the profit-sharing plan's impact on the bottom line could come up during Delta's earnings call.RELATED:Here's Why Delta, JetBlue And Other Airlines Are Surging TodaySouthwest Airlines Cuts Revenue Guidance In Wake Of Hurricanes, EarthquakeUnited, American Both Wage Fare War, But Analyst Sours On One AirlineThese Airlines Look Like The Biggest Losers In The Latest Price War

141,DAL,"United Airlines (UAL) late Thursday raised its fourth-quarter unit revenue outlook and OK'd a new $3 billion share buyback program. That followed a better unit revenue forecast from Southwest Airlines (LUV) earlier in the day.X United said it expected fourth-quarter passenger unit revenue to be flat to down 2%, compared to an earlier forecast for 1%-3% drop. Unit revenue is a key industry metric that tries to gauge an airline's operating efficiency by looking at its revenue as it relates to overall flight capacity.For November, United said that traffic and capacity both rose 5.1%. United said that it had the fewest cancellations of any month in the company's history.The carrier said it expected to wrap up a $2 billion buyback offering from July 2016 by the end of this month.""We continue to invest in our employees, our customer experience and the growth of our business,"" CFO Andrew Levy said in a statement. ""Returning cash to our shareholders reflects the strength of our balance sheet and the confidence we have in our future.""United rose nearly 2% after hours in the stock market today, aiding its recovery from a deep slide that came after the carrier in October gave a murky financial forecast for next year that flat-out terrified investors. United closed the regular session up 2.15% to 63.53. Southwest Airlines (LUV) also hiked its fourth-quarter unit revenue guidance, based on solid November traffic results.The carrier now expects a unit revenue pickup of 1%-2% in the much-watched industry metric. Thursday's forecast compares to an earlier outlook for a range of ""up slightly to up 1.5 percent.""Traffic during November rose 3.4%, while capacity climbed 2.5%.""The increase in unit revenue appears to be both demand and yield based,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said, referring to the airline's ability to get more money out of passengers when they fly. ""We suspect the remainder of the industry will also raise 4Q17 unit revenue guidance, but note rising jet fuel costs might put modest pressure on the EPS accretion from the improved revenue environment.""Shares rose 3.1% to 63.02, now slightly extended from a 59.67 buy point of a cup-with-handle base.Delta Air Lines (DAL), whose stock jumped on Monday after it reported November traffic figures, advanced 2.1% to 53.41. That stock is in a cup-with-handle base with a potential buy point of 54.16, one of several notable big caps nearing buy points.American Airlines (AAL), which is also making its way through a cup-with-handle base with a 53.84 entry, climbed 2.6% to 50.88.Airline stocks have been a moving target for the latter half of this year, with Wall Street punishing Spirit Airlines (SAVE) on fears of steeper fare discounting over the summer, then punishing United and others over concerns about their ability to control rising costs. Some analysts have indicated that Southwest might be best-positioned if Wall Street began to focus more on costs.IBD'S TAKE: For more on what fare cuts and higher costs mean for the airline business, read this story.Hawaiian Airlines parent Hawaiian Holdings (HA) on Tuesday also raised its fourth-quarter unit revenue outlook, which Cowen attributed to the bankruptcy filing of Island Air in October. But shares tumbled after the carrier signaled tougher competition on fare prices in the first quarter of next year.Southwest plans to start offering service to Hawaii next year. United Airlines in June said it would expand service to Hawaii, starting this month.Hawaiian is also considering whether to launch a no-frills basic economy fare similar to the one available on Delta, American and United, according to CNBC.Hawaiian popped 4.55% on Thursday to 41.40.RELATED:After WOW Offers $100 Iceland Flight, American Opens Reykjavik RouteAmerican Signals Higher '18 Capacity; Another Carrier Warns On CostsUnited Airlines Dives On Disastrous Earnings Call; Rival Carriers Fall

Chip stocks were strong even with Intel (INTC) disclosing a big flaw in many processors. Facebook (FB) and Netflix (NFLX) were among many breakouts, but often with some issues. Tesla (TSLA) struggled to get Model 3 out the factory gate while other auto stocks rallied despite U.S. auto sales capping their first annual decline since the financial crisis. Bitcoin had a relatively calm week of solid gains as rival cryptocurrencies surged ahead. Economic data were solid but shouldn't spook the Federal Reserve.X The Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 index and Dow industrials rose sharply to start 2018, with oil, steel and chip groups among the big winners, while utilities sold off. Facebook, Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) were among those breaking out, but many were in low volume or had other notable flaws. Crude futures rose to a three-year high. The Treasury yield spread continued to narrow.Intel (INTC) fell as low as 42.69 after a security issue was revealed on its PC and server processors but rallied to close down 3.1% at 44.74.  The security issue could allow hackers to gather sensitive data from the memory of computing devices, but not modify, delete or corrupt data through the exploit, Intel said. The chipmaker said it has developed and is rapidly issuing software patches and firmware updates to correct the problem. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) saw its shares rally because its processors reportedly are not vulnerable to the same security exploit.Bitcoin prices rose to above $16,000 on Friday, capping a solid weekly gain in what was a relatively calm period for the fast-moving cryptocurrency. Alternative digital currencies Ripple and Ethereum surged to new highs. Founders Fund, co-founded by early Facebook investor Peter Thiel, invested $15 million-$20 million in Bitcoin — an investment worth hundreds of millions now, according to the Wall Street Journal reported. The Journal also reported that Merrill Lynch barred its financial advisors from making trades for clients in Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) or proposing any Bitcoin related investments. Russia is looking at creating its own cryptocurrency after President Vladimir Putin meet with Vitalik Buterin, the Russia-born founder of Ethereum, to figure out how to regulate them. China is reportedly looking to regulate power usage for Bitcoin mining after closing exchanges last year to reduce spreading financial risks.Nearly all automakers saw U.S. vehicle sales fall in December despite heavy incentives and a year-end sales push, but Ford Motor (F) and General Motors (GM) topped estimates, with Ford eking out a 0.9% gain. For 2017, U.S. auto sales fell 1.8% to 17.2 million vehicles, according to Autodata, marking the first decline in eight years. Both analysts and carmakers see a drop below 17 million in 2018. Despite weak auto sales, auto stocks continue to perform well, as investors expect the momentum in higher-margin SUV and truck sales to continue. GM rose 7.4% for the week, Ford 5.7% and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) 22%.Tesla continues to struggle with production on its Model 3 sedans, with overall vehicle output stagnant in recent quarters.

Tesla shares rose 1.7% but are still near seven-month lows.Shares of BlackBerry (BB) jumped 24% to their best levels since June 2013 in large part as the one-time smartphone leader signed a deal with Chinese internet giant Baidu (BIDU) to work together on automotive software for self-driving vehicles.A Goldilocks jobs report for December quieted talk that labor markets are at risk of overheating. Payrolls rose a moderate 148,000, well below the 190,000 expected, as the jobless rate held at 4.1% and average hourly wage gains remained stuck at 2.5%. The data may help Federal Reserve policymakers follow a slow pace of interest rate hikes, at least for now. Yet other indications suggest the economy ended the year with a strong head of steam. Holiday sales were strong. And the ISM manufacturing index unexpectedly rose 1.5 points to 59.7, signaling accelerating factory growth. The new orders gauge vaulted to a 15-year high of 69.4, up from a robust 64.0 the prior month.Macy's (M) Nov.-Dec. same-store sales unexpectedly rose 1.1% — the first holiday gain in three years — and J.C. Penney (JCP) comps up 2.4%. But amid more Macy's store closures, shares of both stocks nevertheless tumbled. Elsewhere, Costco Wholesale (COST) core same-store sales popped 8.8% and Zumiez (ZUMZ) comps jumped 7.9%, both topping views. Victoria's Secret parent L Brands (LB) fell short of comp forecasts and cut its earnings target. Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI) said holiday same-store sales increased 3.9% and implied Q4 EPS would edge past views.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) narrowly beat Q1 expectations with $1.28 EPS on $30.7 billion in revenue. U.S. retail pharmacy sales grew 8.9% as comps rose 4.7%. The drugstore chain lifted the bottom end of full-year EPS guidance.

Shares dipped 1.4% on Thursday but rose for the week. CVS Health (CVS) said Q4 EPS would come in at the low end of its $1.88-$1.92 forecast, but said tax cuts would boost cash flow. Shares jumped 8.2% for the week.Delta Air Lines (DAL) tweaked its Q4 cost forecast higher, partly due to the massive outage last month in its Atlanta hub, and held to its Q4 unit-revenue and margin outlook. Delta expects a one-time hit of $150 million-$200 million in the fourth quarter due to Trump's tax bill. American Airlines (AAL), Southwest Airlines (LUV) and JetBlue (JBLU) said they'd give employees $1,000 each following the tax cuts. Southwest also said it would invest in modernizing its Boeing (BA) fleet.Winning high rollers reportedly weighed on December casino revenue, which came in light at 14.6% growth vs. Bloomberg views for 20% gains. But Macau gross gaming revenue still got a 19.1% bump for the year, in line with consensus per Reuters and the first annual gain since 2013. Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and Las Vegas Sands (LVS) fell more than 2% for the week, while MGM Resorts International (MGM), which is more Vegas-centric, climbed 1.5%.MoneyGram International (MGI) fell 6.8% for the week after the U.S. government rejected a takeover by Alibaba (BABA) affiliate Ant Financial, on national security grounds.Dominion Energy (D) agreed to buy Scana (SCG) battered by a failed nuclear project, for $7.9 billion or $14.6 billion including assumed debt.Constellation Brands (STX) unexpectedly reported a slim per-share profit rise and set a $3 billion stock buyback. But the Corona beer distributor unexpectedly missed sales. Shares fell Friday after briefly breaking out of a base in late 2017 but closed above their 50-day line.Streaming video platform Roku (ROKU) is extending its reach to smart speakers, TV sound bars and other home audio systems. It announced the Roku Connect home entertainment network, which it will show off at the CES consumer electronics trade show.Netflix reached new highs after the internet television network said its bet on big-budget movie ""Bright"" has paid off.

144,DAL,"Discount carrier Frontier Airlines is set to get a whole bunch of new jets that could give it more options as it skirmishes with United Airlines (UAL) over cheap fares.XBoeing (BA) rival Airbus (EADSY) on Wednesday announced a deal to sell 430 jets to Frontier Airlines and three other partner airlines of Bill Franke's Indigo Partners, a big investor in discount airlines, in a deal valued at as much as $49.5 billion.The memorandum-of-understanding agreement, which Airbus said was its ""largest single announcement ever,"" was announced at the Dubai Airshow. It would hand Frontier 100 A320neo jets — a narrow-body jet that usually seats around 150 people — and 34 A321neos, which typically seat around 185 people.The remaining A320s and A321s would go to other ultra discounters when the agreements with each are finalized: Wizz Air in Hungary, JetSmart in Chile, and Volaris in Mexico.""This significant commitment for 430 additional aircraft underscores our optimistic view of the growth potential of our family of low-cost airlines, as well as our confidence in the A320neo Family as a platform for that growth,"" Franke, managing partner of Indigo, said in a statement on Wednesday.United Airlines closed up 0.5% on the stock market today, Delta Air Lines (DAL) rose 0.9%, while American Airlines (AAL) climbed 3%, and Southwest (LUV) added 1.6%. Ultra low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines (SAVE) rallied 2.7%, and Alaska Air (ALK) jumped 4.5%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.The deal comes as new types of jets give budget carriers more ways to make their business models work.Frontier, a carrier known for the ""National-Geographic""-esque portraits of animals on its tail fins, this year has made more of a push into Denver, a big, profitable United hub. United, which has tried to match Frontier and Spirit on some fares in its biggest markets, this summer said Frontier's move amounted to a tacit admission that cracks were forming in the ultra-low-cost model.United President Scott Kirby, during the carrier's second-quarter earnings call, said that in moving into a hub, Frontier was taking on the much more complicated duties of handling connecting flights. He added the battle was one that ""I guarantee United will win.""But Airbus' fuel-efficient A321 jets have made low-cost long-haul flights more viable. Such flights have become particularly common between Europe and the U.S. The cheaper airfares offered by the likes of Norwegian Air and WOW air have chipped away at the stronghold Delta, American and United had built up over the Atlantic.JetBlue (JBLU), which has been considering whether offer flights to Europe, has added A321neos to its fleet and has an option to take delivery of the Airbus A321LR — an alternate version of the A321neo.On its website, Airbus says the A321LR is ""ideally suited to transatlantic routes, and enables airlines to tap into new long-haul markets that were not previously accessible with current single-aisle aircraft.""RELATED:Boeing Reportedly Mulls 767 Passenger-Jet Reboot As '797' LoomsWill Delta Air Lines' Spat With Boeing Weigh On Massive Plane Order?American Signals Higher '18 Capacity; Another Carrier Warns On CostsUnited Airlines Dives On Disastrous Earnings Call; Rival Carriers Fall

145,DAL,"American Airlines (AAL) on Tuesday said it will add seasonal service between Dallas and Iceland, while ultra-low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines (SAVE) announced new service from Richmond, Va., to Orlando and Fort Lauderdale, Fla.XThe announcements come as American and legacy rivals Delta Air Lines (DAL) and United Airlines (UAL) look for ways to compete against budget long-haul carriers in Europe, and as Spirit positions itself for Spring Break.American said that it would begin offering its seasonal service from its Dallas-Fort Worth hub to Iceland's Reykjavik-Keflavik airport on June 7. Tickets go on sale on Nov. 20. The move would pit American against WOW air, a low-cost, long-haul carrier in Iceland that also offers flights between those two airports.Reykjavik, American noted, has become ""a very popular leisure destination"" and complements its ""continued growth from Dallas-Fort Worth, including Rome and Amsterdam.""WOW Air in August said it would add flights from four Midwestern U.S. cities to Reykjavik starting this coming spring for as low as $99.99 one way.During its third-quarter earnings call last month, American said that unit revenue in the trans-Atlantic market, where competition from European discounters is intense, rose during the third quarter. Better pricing and ""easing comps from past terror events"" in 2016 helped with the improvement.Still, management said that they expected to see more of the same in the region for the fourth quarter, with discounting from expanding low-cost carriers still ""aggressive."" However, the company said premium-cabin fare offerings, and the carrier's Premium Economy fare class, would help prop up results.Delta last month said also said that its trans-Atlantic business would show a bigger quarter-to-quarter improvement than any other segment in Q4. The carrier cited stronger business travel and Europe's rebound from a recession as reasons.Shares of American were up 0.15% in the stock market today, while Delta edged  0.1% higher, and United dipped 1.1%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now?

147,DAL,"In 2011, Delta Air Lines (DAL) brought both Boeing (BA) and Airbus (EADSY) sales representatives into its headquarters in Atlanta to hear pitches for why it should order Boeing's narrow-body, midrange 737-900 or Airbus' A321 to replace similar-size jets in its fleet. After months of negotiations, according to ""Glory Lost and Found,"" a book containing an account of the talks, Delta's decision came down to a single thing: toilets.XAt the last minute, Boeing told Delta it would throw in new, space-saving toilets, according to the book. The lavatories were slim enough to allow room for a few extra seats in the cabin, which meant a few more passengers and a perhaps bit more profit.As Delta reportedly weighs a new purchase that pits Boeing and Airbus against one another, Boeing might need a better pitch than, you know, ""Wait, we have skinnier toilets!"" The airline is mulling an order for up to 100 aircraft, worth as much as $12.7 billion, with an option to buy 100 more, according to Bloomberg.Delta, which is in advanced discussions over the matter, will likely decide by the end of this year whether it will choose to order smaller, single-aisle A320s from Airbus or 737s from Boeing, the report said.But Delta's decision will come as things grow more tense between the carrier and Boeing. The U.S. Commerce Department has decided to impose preliminary tariffs of around 300% on Canadian jet-maker Bombardier's C Series planes, a medium-range narrow-body jet with 100-plus seats that Delta has ordered. The tariffs followed complaints from Boeing that Bombardier gets support from Canada's government that makes competition unfair.""Delta can use what happened with the C Series as a way to say to Boeing, if you want to get back in our good graces, you might have to give us even a better deal than we would have required before,"" said Seth Kaplan, managing partner at Airline Weekly and a co-author of ""Glory Lost and Found,"" a book about Delta.The airline industry's merger wave has intensified competitions. The string of mergers that created Delta, United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) as they exist today resulted in mixed fleets under the same carrier, with each megadeal combining an airline that had a big Boeing narrow-body fleet with an airline that had a big Airbus narrow-body fleet, Kaplan noted.Instead of sticking to exclusive pacts, the sense among the airline industry today is that airlines can get a better deal if they let Boeing and Airbus fight it out.Shares of Boeing closed 0.8% higher on the stock market today, while Airbus retreated 0.8%, and Delta dropped 1.3%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.As the companies jockey for an edge, the spat over the C Series is still fresh. Delta management, on its third-quarter earnings call last month, said ""we will not pay any tariffs"" on the jets, which the carrier said it would still take.Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg, meanwhile, when asked about the matter, said on its earnings call that ""Delta is a very important customer to us.""He added: ""We want to continue to work with them and support them for the future. So these are not actions that are targeted at customers or countries. These are matters of fair trade. We are happy to compete. We just want everybody to play by the same rules.""Airbus' recent decision to take a majority stake in the C Series business, giving that company a fresh product line to market, has added a new wrinkle to the dispute.Cowen analysts, in a research note dated Tuesday, called Airbus' position in the Bombardier C Series a ""win-win"" for both companies.While it said the move represents a ""validation of the 100-150 seat market,"" it also said the market size for the jet was ""unclear, and it will face stiff competition from Boeing & Embraer.""But they added: ""We don't anticipate Delta will pay tariffs on the aircraft because Boeing currently does not have a competitive product.""It's unclear right now whether Boeing benefits from Airbus' move, which removes an independent competitor from the game. But for now, Airbus has a lot more planes and Delta a few more misgivings about Boeing.""I think Boeing understands it's just time to move past that,"" Kaplan said.RELATED:Boeing Reportedly Mulls 767 Passenger-Jet Reboot As '797' LoomsThis Is How Boeing Could Get Squeezed By Airbus, BombardierDelta Air Lines Sees Turnaround In Crucial, Highly Competitive Market
"
148,DAL,"Boeing (BA) is reportedly considering rebooting production of twin-aisle 767 passenger jets to satisfy possible demand from United Airlines (UAL) and other carriers, as it weighs whether to launch a similar jet by the middle of next decade.XThe aerospace giant stopped making the midsize 767 for passengers three years ago, though it makes a military refueling aircraft based on the 767 as well as cargo variants used by package delivery companies like FedEx (FDX).But now Boeing is looking how it might revive production of the 767-300ER, which can fit roughly 200 passengers, as airlines look at ways to refresh their fleets, sources told the Wall Street Journal.United told the Journal that it's seeking more information about ""several widebody aircraft, including the 767,"" as it looks to replace its older versions of that model.Talk of rebooting a 767 passenger jet comes as Boeing weighs a new midsize jet, which some have called the ""797,"" which would help stem market share losses to the increasingly popular Airbus (EADSY) A321.Over the summer, however, Boeing launched the 737 Max 10, its largest narrow-body plane, as a stopgap measure ahead of an anticipated 797. The Max 10 can seat 188-204 in typical two-class configurations but has a maximum capacity of 230.Shares of Boeing rose 0.9% to 264.07 on the stock market today. U.S.-listed shares of Airbus were down 0.5%. United edged up 0.45%.IBD'S TAKE: As an investor, you may wonder why buy points are important. The chart action of these top stocks offers an answer.Meanwhile, the airlines still continue to find use for the 767, an aircraft first put into use in the early 1980s. Delta Air Lines' (DAL) planned nonstop year-round service from Indianapolis to Paris, which begins in May, will use a 767-300ER.The carrier announced those plans in May. United, in July, said it would use the 767 for expanded service between New York and Newark to Rome.RELATED:American Signals Higher '18 Capacity; Another Carrier Warns On CostsUnited Airlines Dives On Disastrous Earnings Call; Rival Carriers FallThis Is How Boeing Could Get Squeezed By Airbus, BombardierBoeing Reportedly Used Faulty Kobe Steel; FAA Inspecting Airbus Engines

Since Google left the Chinese market seven years ago, Baidu leads internet search in China with over 3 billion searches/day but is facing rising competition.Qihoo 360 is one growing threat in search, while Tencent is threatening Baidu's digital ad business. Baidu has been spending a lot of capital this year, trying to match Tencent's WeChat app, which has become the go-to platform for services like deliveries, payments, and gaming. That capital investment has eaten into Baidu's earnings. Still, despite these headwinds Baidu stock performance has gained over 60% year-to-date.Alibaba

154,DAL,"Airbus' (EADSY) stake in Bombardier's C Series jet business could leave Boeing (BA) in a precarious situation longer term, unless the U.S. aerospace giant pursues a middle-of-the-market plane, according to analysts.XLate Monday, Bombardier announced that it agreed to sell a 50.01% stake in its struggling narrow-body unit and touted its deal with Airbus as ""highly complementary"" as the C Series seats 100-150 passengers vs. Airbus' 150-240 seat options for its narrow-body planes.But in the future, the deal could lead to bigger C Series jets and smaller versions of Airbus' larger jets, said Jeff Windau, senior equity analyst at Edward Jones.""The C Series has potential to expand into a next-generation plane,"" he said in an interview. ""So you could see C Series move up and Airbus try to push down and right now Boeing doesn't have that middle of the market option.""Boeing has been mulling midmarket plane, which analysts have dubbed the ""797,"" that would seat roughly 250 passengers but has yet to commit to it.Boeing shares finished 0.4% lower at 258.62 on the stock market today, easing back into buy range, while U.S.-listed shares of Airbus jumped 4.5%.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.The deal comes after the U.S. Commerce Department recently recommended a 300% tariff be imposed on each Bombardier C Series jet delivered to the U.S. after Boeing accused the Canadian company of receiving $3 billion in government subsidies, giving it an unfair competitive advantage.""This looks like a questionable deal between two heavily state-subsidized competitors to skirt the recent findings of the U.S. government. Our position remains that everyone should play by the same rules for free and fair trade to work,"" Boeing tweeted in response to the C Series announcement.While Boeing is the big loser under the deal, airlines will likely get better deals as Airbus will now likely have more leverage in supplier negotiations, Windau said.But Delta Air Lines (DAL) Chief Operating Officer Gil West said the delivery scheduled of its C Series jets is still ""something of a question mark.""During its earnings call last week, Delta said it ""would not pay those tariffs"" imposed on the C Series by the Commerce Department.Competition in the narrow-body market is also increasing outside Europe and North America with China and Russia both set to unveil new jets the narrow-body space as soon as 2019.But the deal will likely hit China's homegrown narrow-body offering as local companies won't be able to compete with Airbus' global services reach.Bombardier discussed a potential sale of part of its C Series program with the Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China and other Chinese state-owned firms, before its Airbus deal, sources told Bloomberg.Instead, the Chinese company will have a harder time selling its C919, which has yet to get a major international customer.RELATED: Boeing's Latest Buyout May Offer Clues To Possible New '797' PlaneDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry News

155,DAL,"Analysts spent much of United Airlines' (UAL) third-quarter earnings call Thursday morning asking about the carrier's plans to shore up profit, costs, capacity and margins in 2018 and beyond. And much of the time United executives on those fronts were unable to provide specifics.That sent United Air's stock crashing, amid doubts about the carrier's ability to deliver on goals outlined at its investor day last year and management's ability to turn the company around as its margins lag those of Delta Air Lines (DAL).""Is This a Catalyst for Management Change?"" read a research note from Stifel analyst Joseph DeNardi after the call. ""That's the #1 question we've received today, which is both surprising and not surprising.""United late Wednesday forecast weaker fourth-quarter unit revenue — a much-watched measure of sales in relation to an airline's flight capacity — rising unit costs and expanding capacity.XCEO Oscar Munoz on Wednesday said several times during the call that United was ""in the middle"" of assembling a clearer forecast. He urged patience, and stressed that relative to rivals, United's management was still new.""We're just getting our mojo working,"" he said.Mojo aside, investors mashed the ""sell"" button on Thursday. United shares collapsed 12.1% to 59.78 in the stock market today, tumbling through their 50-day moving average. Delta lost 1.1% and  American Airlines (AAL) 1%. Southwest Airlines (LUV) dipped 0.3%. Delta, American and Southwest have all been building the right side of cup bases.At its investor day last year, United said it planned to reduce capital expenditures by roughly $1 billion in 2017 and 2018. The airline also laid out long-term plans to produce $4.8 billion in ""earnings improvement"" by 2020, via a combination of stronger revenue management, better flight connectivity, and expanding ""segmentation,"" or different types of fare classes that offer different degrees of amenities.United faces higher costs related to employee benefits next year, among other things, and has been actively trying to chase Spirit Airlines (SAVE) and other low-cost carriers, which are offering fares are low as $10, out of its major hubs.Analysts over the summer worried whether United, which has tried to match Spirit on fares, could absorb the impact of the discounting and whether other airlines might get sucked into the fare war. But in recent weeks they grew more optimistic that fare discounting, which chips away at sales and profits, had eased.""United's unit revenue outlook confirms that prices are firming,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said, ""but United's forecast is not as optimistic as Delta's and may also not be as optimistic as American's when they provide it next week.""Delta reported solid Q3 earnings and guidance last week.Over the past six to eight weeks, United management said that not much has changed in the way United or the ultra-discounters were approaching the way they do battle.Late Wednesday, United forecast a fourth-quarter unit-revenue decline of 1%-3%. United said it sees flat unit revenue for October and November, with December declining due to what President Scott Kirby said were the ""vagaries of the calendar,"" with much of the holiday return traffic pushed into January.United sees Q4 adjusted pretax margin coming in at 3%-5%, below consensus. The carrier forecast unit costs to increase 2.5%-3.5% in the fourth quarter, also a letdown for analysts. United also sees roughly 3.5% fourth-quarter capacity growth.""Further, with fourth-quarter capacity expansion remaining elevated (as the schedule data has indicated), we expect investors will be skeptical that management's plan to improve relative profitability is gaining momentum,"" Barclays analyst Brandon Oglenski said in a research note released before the call.Spirit Airlines retreated 3.3%.RELATED:United Airlines, AmEx, United Rentals Beat Views; Alcoa MissesDelta Air Lines Sees Turnaround In Crucial, Highly Competitive MarketAirline Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

158,DAL,"Shares of American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) led carriers higher after both forecast third-quarter unit revenue and margins that were better than prior expectations.The forecasts mark a rebound for American, United and Delta Air Lines (DAL), which during the third quarter saw their stocks fall following steep fare competition, higher fuel prices and hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. Delta Air reports third-quarter earnings on Wednesday.But investor sentiment began to improve last week, when Delta's Q3 outlook for the key metric held up, in analysts' views, when factoring out the impact of Irma. The guidance lifted the carrier and its rivals and signified to some analysts that Delta was better able to shore up prices.American on Tuesday indicated that it had been better able to keep airfares high as well — a practice that dismays travelers but boosts airlines' top and bottom lines.American said third-quarter unit revenue was up roughly 0.5%-1.5%, better than an earlier outlook for flat to up 1%. In raising its outlook, the carrier cited ""stronger than anticipated yield performance,"" referring to an airline's ability to charge customers more money.The carrier said it expected adjusted pretax margin of 9%-11%, better than its previous outlook for 8.5%-10.5%.Shares popped 4.8% to 53.03. The stock is forming a base with a 54.58 buy point.United, meanwhile, said it expected third-quarter passenger unit revenue, which measures sales from passengers in relation to an airline's flight capacity, to be down 3.5% to 4%. But that was better than earlier expectations for a 3%-5% decrease.United said it expected adjusted pretax margin of 10%-10.5%, up from an earlier outlook of 8%-10%.Shares surged 4.7% to 67.72 in the stock market today, coming closer to their 200-day line, which remains above the stock's 50-day line.IBD'S TAKE: As investors fret over airlines' pricing and expansion plans, Elon Musk is looking way, way beyond. Here's a look at how SpaceX could upend companies like Boeing (BA) and the airlines. Delta rose 1.9% to 53.10.

161,DAL,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) jumped on Tuesday after the carrier forecast third-quarter unit revenue that, when factoring out Hurricane Irma, was better than feared.XThe forecast appeared to offer some relief to other airlines — including American Airlines (AAL), JetBlue (JBLU) and Spirit Airlines (SAVE) — that send a lot of planes to and from Florida and other areas in the storm's path.""Excluding the hurricane, overall guidance is positive and likely speaks to stabilizing pricing trends for Delta,"" Cowen said in a research note.Delta said it expects Q3 passenger unit revenue to rise roughly 2%. Technically, that's down from the forecast of a 2%-3% increase that the carrier gave early last month, but that prior guidance came before hurricanes Irma and Maria hit. When factoring out the effects from Irma, the Q3 forecast offered Tuesday would be for a 3% increase.Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth also noted that the would-be 3% increase also fell within Delta's original Q3 unit revenue forecast of a 2.5%-4.5% increase. She noted that international trends in the trans-Atlantic also continued to be better than expected.Shares of Delta jumped 6.6% to a month-high of 51.25 in the stock market today, retaking their 50- and 200-day average. JetBlue leapt 7.1%, American added 5.8% and Spirit Airlines popped 7.1%. United Airlines (UAL) surged 6.1%, and Southwest (LUV) climbed 4.5%.IBD'S TAKE: As investors fret over airlines' pricing and expansion plans, Elon Musk is looking way, way beyond. Here's a look at how SpaceX could upend companies like Boeing (BA) and the airlines.  Still, Delta said Irma resulted in 2,200 flight cancellations — in Florida, Georgia, the Caribbean and the company's hub in Atlanta — pushing up unit costs. Delta estimated that the storm cost it around $120 million in pretax income, and the carrier cut its Q3 operating margin forecast to 15.5%-16.5% from earlier expectations of 16.5%-17.5%.For the month of September, traffic rose 0.3% as capacity grew 0.6%. Load factor fell 0.2 percentage points to 84.4%.A combination of higher fuel prices, natural disasters and worries of a widening discounting black hole have hurt airline stocks and their financial forecasts this summer. Analysts and investors seem likely to focus on airfare pricing — and whether airlines can squeeze it back up — when the industry's earnings season rolls around this month.While United and American have indicated that they won't take ultralow fares from the likes of Spirit lying down, Delta has suggested they might try to stay above the fray.During a conference last month, the company said its ultimate goal was to be the world leader in connecting global air traffic and offering the most expansive flight coverage available.""So if that means that we can't have a product that caters to a consumer that wants to (fly for) $39, that's OK,"" Delta management said.RELATED:Southwest Airlines Cuts Revenue Guidance In Wake Of Hurricanes, EarthquakeUnited, American Both Wage Fare War, But Analyst Sours On One AirlineThese Airlines Look Like The Biggest Losers In The Latest Price War

164,DAL,"Just as Elon Musk's Tesla (TSLA) is disrupting the auto industry, his SpaceX venture could upset a commercial air travel industry currently dominated by Boeing (BA), Airbus (EADSY), Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL).XLate Thursday, Musk announced plans to build a new megarocket that could travel to Mars, the moon and in Earth orbit. But the so-called BFR, short for ""Big F***ing Rocket,"" would also be able to take travelers anywhere on the planet in ""under an hour"" for the same cost as a plane ticket, he said.Making his presentation Friday at the International Aeronautical Congress in Australia, Musk said the BFR would take passengers into low Earth orbit before offloading them on landing pads, similar to the floating drones the company uses to land its reusable Falcon 9 rockets. That could cut travel time from London to Dubai from 7 hours to just 29 minutes.The BFR would be 122 meters tall, about double the height of the Falcon 9, and could have up to six times the number of engines as the Falcon 9. While still in the theoretical stage, Musk said he wants to start building the BFR in the next six to nine months.Boeing shares fell 6 cents to 254.21 on the stock market today but still in buy range after breaking out of a flat base with a 246.59 buy point two weeks ago. Airbus' U.S.-listed shares rose 0.9%, American Air was flat, United lost 0.5%, and Delta slipped 0.2%.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.But SpaceX isn't the only one looking at faster commercial travel.NASA is working with Lockheed Martin's (LMT) secretive Skunk Works division on a supersonic jet that reduces the sonic boom so it could fly over crowded cities.In addition, the military is working on hypersonic weapons that fly over five times the speed of sound, and the propulsion technology could have applications for commercial passenger flight, but those are a few decades away.Still the technology would only cut travel time from the U.S. to Tokyo to three hours vs. over 12 hours on a current commercial flight.Meanwhile, both Lockheed and SpaceX have their sights set on Mars as a new space race heats up.RELATED:The Air Force's Skepticism On Reusable Rockets Is Fading QuicklySpaceX Once Sued The Air Force; Here's What Top Brass Thinks Now

166,DAL,"Southwest Airlines (LUV) on Thursday cut its third-quarter unit revenue outlook in the wake of hurricanes that have sheared through Texas and Florida and left Puerto Rico without electricity and the earthquakes that have devastated large parts of Mexico.XThe forecast comes as the impact from the storms continues to add up for the airlines. United Airlines (UAL) (IBD) this month lowered its Q3 unit revenue outlook due to the impact of Hurricane Harvey. American Airlines (AAL) followed, cutting its unit revenue forecast after Hurricane Irma forced 40 airports to close in Florida and the Caribbean, including the carrier's Miami hub.It also comes as airlines across the globe suffered from flight delays due to a ""network issue"" at a flight booking system run by Amadeus IT Group, according to Bloomberg.Southwest on Thursday said it expects third-quarter operating unit revenue, or an airline's revenue in relation to its overall flight capacity, to be flat to down 1%, compared with a forecast of down 1% to ""slightly up"" given earlier this month. Before that, the carrier expected a 1% gain in the key metric.The carrier said it had canceled roughly 5,000 flights through Sept. 27 due to the natural disasters. And it said it expects the disasters to cost around $100 million.The company now sees third-quarter operating unit up, excluding fuel, oil and other items, to rise in the 3%-4% range.Southwest also cited the ""current industry revenue environment"" in cutting its unit revenue guidance. Lower fares, combined with higher fuel costs, have prompted the industry to temper its outlook for unit revenue for the third quarter. United, in particular, has been engaged in an airfare battle with Spirit Airlines (SAVE) at some of United's largest hubs.IBD'S TAKE: With airline earnings season set to begin next month, buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Investors may have already priced in the impact of recent natural disasters. Southwest rose 0.5% to 56.17 in the stock market today, while United advanced 0.4%. Delta Air Lines (DAL) climbed 1.2%, American Airlines 1.4% and Spirit 0.1%.RELATED:United, American Both Wage Fare War, But Analyst Sours On One AirlineUnited To Scale Back Basic Economy Amid Price War With Low-Cost RivalsThese Airlines Look Like The Biggest Losers In The Latest Price WarDelta Cuts Revenue, Margin Targets As Airline Competition Heats UpAirline Industry News And Stocks To Watch

Passenger unit revenue fell 3.7%. About 8,300 flights were canceled in Q3 due to hurricanes, reducing pre-tax income by $185 million.Outlook: Q4 passenger unit revenue to fall 1%-3%, with October and November unit revenue roughly flat, followed by a decline in December due to holiday timing. Adjusted pretax margin is seen at 3%-5%.Stock: United edged up 0.4% late. Shares closed up 0.7% at 67.99 on the stock market today, still far from an 83.14 buy point. American Airlines (AAL) dipped 0.1% to 52.03, still near a 54.58 buy point. Delta Air Lines (DAL) edged up 0.2% to 52.86, closing in on cup-base 55.85 buy point. Southwest (LUV) gained 0.2% to 58.83, forming a cup with handle with a 59.67 buy point.United in June began cutting fares in some of its major hubs in an attempt to drive out Spirit Airlines (SAVE) and budget carrier Frontier Airlines. American has also vowed to keep matching discounters on fares. But airlines have signaled recently that unit revenue and pricing during Q3 wouldn't be as bad as once expected.Delta, which reported earnings last week, indicated further improvement on that front, with United and American raising their Q3 unit-revenue forecasts. And Spirit on Monday raised its Q3 unit-revenue forecast to a decrease of roughly 6.5%, better than earlier expectations of a 7.0%-8.5% drop. The carrier cited ""improving ticket and non-ticket yields"" and better-than-expected load factor.Wolfe Research analyst Hunter Keay said in a research note dated Monday that United and Spirit are near ""some sort of an equilibrium"" but warned that industry airfares were likely ""too fragile"" to begin expecting a massive recovery.Estimates: Third-quarter EPS of $1.47, up 19%. Revenue is seen gaining 7% to $8.316 billion.Results: EPS of $1.50 on revenue of $8.44 billion. Provisions for losses jumped 53% to $769 million, largely reflecting ""continued strong growth in the loan portfolio and an expected increase in the lending write-off and delinquency rates.""Expenses rose 6%, due in part to higher rewards expenses ""primarily related to product enhancements and an increase in Card Member spending.""Outlook: Full-year EPS guidance raised to $5.80-$5.90, above consensus for $5.73, up from a prior view for $5.60-$5.80.American Express also said that its board had appointed Stephen Squeri as its new CEO and voted him board chairman. Those moves take hold on Feb. 1. CEO Kenneth Chenault will retire.Stock: AmEx dipped 0.4% late. Shares closed up 0.4% at 92.08. Visa (V) ticked up 0.2%, and Mastercard (MA) added 0.2%.

Eleven states have alleged that the company giant harmed competition by barring businesses who take AmEx from steering customers toward cards with lower merchant fees.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Estimates: Wall Street expects the equipment-rental company's Q3 EPS to increase 16% to $3.00, with revenue up 13% to $1.709 billion.Results: EPS of $3.25 on revenue of $1.77 billion. Rental revenue grew 16% to $1.54 billion. Time utilization increased 160 basis points year-over-year to 71.9%.Outlook: Full-year revenue now seen at $6.525 billion-$6.625 billion, up from a prior view of $6.25 billion-$6.40 billion.""Our U.S. end markets are driving robust demand for our fleet, and Canada is continuing to rebound,"" CEO Michael Kneeland said in a statement.

169,DAL,"United Airlines (UAL) CEO Oscar Munoz offered an apology Tuesday afternoon, reversing his defiant tone a day earlier, amid a spiraling PR nightmare that saw Chinese social media users accuse the airline of racism.A video of Chicago police dragging an elderly man off a flight headed to Louisville on Sunday was the top trending item on the Chinese microblogging site Weibo (WB) with some users saying the man was discriminated against for being Asian and others calling for a boycott of the airline.""The truly horrific event that occurred on this flight has elicited many responses from all of us: outrage, anger, disappointment,"" Munoz said in a statement. ""I share all of those sentiments, and one above all: my deepest apologies for what happened. Like you, I continue to be disturbed by what happened on this flight and I deeply apologize to the customer forcibly removed and to all the customers aboard. No one should ever be mistreated this way.""I want you to know that we take full responsibility and we will work to make it right.""Munoz also vowed ""to fix what's broken so this never happens again,"" saying United will conduct a review of crew movement, passenger incentives on oversold flights, and partnerships with airport authorities and law enforcement. The results are due by April 30.United shares fell as much as 4.4% on the stock market today, but closed down just 1.1% at 70.71, near session highs. United stock actually rose on Monday as the furor initially broke, but investors are debating whether the issue could have lasting financial implications.Munoz sounded conciliatory in a statement Monday, calling the event ""upsetting"" and apologizing for ""having to re-accommodate"" the customers. But in a memo to employees later that day, Munoz was more defiant, saying the airline had ""followed established procedures"" and called the passenger ""disruptive and belligerent.""One of police officers involved was placed on administrative leave following the incident for not observing standard procedures.This is United's second PR disaster in as many months. In March, two teenage girls were turned away at the gate for wearing leggings while flying under a special friends-and-family ticket that comes with a dress code.Late Monday, United said March passenger traffic rose 3% on a 3.4% increase in capacity. It expects first-quarter passenger unit revenue to be ""approximately flat.American Airlines (AAL) reported a 1.2% drop in march traffic early Tuesday and raised its forecast for Q1 total unit revenue growth to 2%-4%, up from a prior outlook for 1.5%-3.5%. Shares rallied 3.8%, closing just below their 50-day line.Delta Air Lines (DAL) will report Q1 results Wednesday, following its own rough weekend when it cancelled 3,000 flights due to bad weather.

"
170,DAL,"As Delta Air Lines (DAL) prepares to report first-quarter earnings on Wednesday, its second quarter has started off with real, actual headwinds.The carrier over the past several days has had to cancel more than 3,000 flights after powerful thunderstorms last Wednesday swept through Atlanta, Delta's biggest hub airport, and bad weather hit the Northeast.Along with that weather, which the carrier described as ""convective activity and storm cells, mixed with tornadic conditions,"" rest and work guidelines have limited the availability of flight crews, forcing more delays and cancellations.What's more, as Wall Street pressures Delta and rivals to pull back on expanding service — constraining available seats to push up airfares and unit revenue — Delta said last week said that customer ""call volumes remain high and Spring Break travel means reaccommodation opportunities are limited.""Anyway, nobody's happy, and the difficulties come as Delta's Q2 outlook will likely be a big focus when the company reports Q1 results. Analysts expect Q1 earnings per share to slide 44% to 74 cents, as rising fuel and labor costs cut into profits. Revenue is seen edging down to $9.19 billion.Raymond James said Monday in a research note that the storms could take roughly one percentage point off Delta's Q2 unit revenue.""Storms at times tend to boost (passenger unit revenue) because the resulting capacity (ASM) decline is greater than the lost revenue,"" Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth said in Monday's research note.""However,"" she continued, ""this is when impacted passengers can be re-booked easily, which is typically when the airline can be proactive about repositioning aircraft and crew ahead of severe weather or there is sufficient slack in the system.""The possible dent to the second quarter follows Delta's decision last week to cut its Q1 outlook for unit revenue, a measure of sales in relation to capacity, to a roughly 0.5% decline. The company said ticket prices on flights booked closer to departure weren't as strong as they'd expected.In March, Delta said it expected the metric to be flat. Earlier, the company said the metric could actually come in positive, something Wall Street has wanted for around two years.Shares of Delta closed down 0.4% at 44.97 in the stock market today, while American Airlines (AAL) rallied 1.2% and United Airlines (UAL) gained 0.9%. Southwest Airlines (LUV) dipped 0.6%.IBD'S TAKE: Even as airline stocks come off a postelection rally and try to temper investor expectations, global travel demand remained solid in February, the International Air Transport Association said last week. Still, Delta has said it expects to be in a position to improve margins in the back half of the year as unit revenue improves. The company in January said it expected ""the margin pressure to peak"" during Q1.And, as Cowen analyst Helane Becker noted, Q3 should be an easier year-over-year comparison. In Q3 of last year, the company's results were hurt due to a massive technology outage that also prompted scores of flight cancellations.RELATED:'Fly The Friendly Skies' United To Review Forced Removal Of PassengerDelta, American, United Go Guns Blazing Into Battle Of The AtlanticDelta, American Eye Trans-Pacific Market As Trans-Atlantic Rivals Grow

177,DAL,"United Airlines (UAL), which resurrected its ""fly the friendly skies"" slogan a few years ago, said it would review Sunday's forcible removal of a passenger, who was taken to a hospital for injuries, while the police officer involved was put on leave for violating standard procedure.The Associated Press reported earlier that airline staff had chosen four passengers to get off the flight, which United said was overbooked. Three agreed to leave Flight 3411, headed to Louisville from Chicago, but the fourth didn't.Video surfaced Sunday showing police grabbing the passenger, wrestling him from his seat and dragging him by his wrists down the aisle after he didn't want to leave the flight. The man can be seen screaming as he was removed, then turning motionless and silent, followed by exclamations from passengers.One of the officers involved didn't follow standard procedure and was placed on leave, Chicago's aviation department told the AP. The passenger, who was described by Chicago police as ""a 69-year-old Asian male,"" was taken to a hospital after his head hit an armrest, according to a statement obtained by NBC News. Another passenger told the AP that the man who was dragged off the plane said he is a doctor and needed to see patients the next day.""This is an upsetting event to all of us here at United,"" CEO Oscar Munoz said in an emailed statement. ""I apologize for having to re-accommodate these customers. Our team is moving with a sense of urgency to work with the authorities and conduct our own detailed review of what happened. We are also reaching out to this passenger to talk directly with him to address and resolve this situation.""@United overbook #flight3411 and decided to force random passengers off the plane.

""We apologize for the overbook situation.""""We followed the right procedures,"" a United spokesman told the Associated Press. ""That plane had to depart. We wanted to get our customers to their destinations, and when one gentleman refused to get off the aircraft, we had to call the Chicago Police Department.""United, in the statement to Business Insider, referred further inquiries about the passenger to authorities.Even as people online expressed disgust with how the situation was handled, Wall Street's reaction was muted. Shares closed up 0.9% in the stock market today. Delta Air Lines (DAL), which reports first-quarter earnings on Wednesday as it works out its own booking issues, slipped 0.4%. American Airlines (AAL) climbed 1.2%. Southwest (LUV) edged down 0.6%.United last month drew ridicule after it kept two teenage girls who were wearing leggings from a flight. The two girls were boarding with passes that give free boarding to United employees or their family. The company said the leggings ran afoul of its attire standards for such passengers, which the company says represent it when they board.IBD'S TAKE: Even as airline stocks come off a postelection rally and try to temper investor expectations, global travel demand remained solid in February, the International Air Transport Association said last week. After the close Monday, United said it expects Q1 passenger unit revenue to be ""approximately flat,"" compared to a forecast last month for a range of down 1% to up 1%. United said that passenger traffic for March rose 3%, with capacity up 3.4%.Meanwhile, Hawaiian Airlines parent Hawaiian Holdings (HA) boosted its first-quarter unit-revenue outlook to a 6.5%-8% increase, up from an earlier forecast of a 4%-7% bump.The company also hiked its unit-cost outlook for the quarter, to a 6%-8% increase, to reflect a new pilot contract and new accounting standards.""With the pilot contract now in place, the focus for the company will shift to execution,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note.

179,DAL,"Southwest (LUV) on Friday stuck with its first-quarter unit outlook predicting a drop in revenue, but said that key metric and booking trends ""remain strong"" heading into the second quarter.The results come as Delta Air Lines (DAL) prepares to kick off the first-quarter earnings season for the airline industry on Wednesday.The airlines' outlook for the second quarter seems likely to be a focus for investors, after Delta, American Airlines (AAL) and Southwest trimmed their first-quarter unit-revenue forecasts after initial high hopes following the election. Stifel last month said demand remained healthy but was perhaps not as strong as initially expected.Southwest on Friday said it continues to expect unit revenue, a measure of an airline's sales as they relate to its available seats and overall flight coverage, to fall 2%-3%.The carrier said March traffic rose 3.9%, while flight capacity grew by 4.5% and load factor dipped to 84.1% from 84.6% a year earlier.IBD'S TAKE: Even as airline investors worry about the industry's ability to manage airfares and capacity, as well as the impact of President Trump's attempted travel ban, the International Air Transport Association says global travel demand largely held up in February. Investors largely shrugged off the news. Southwest shares closed up 2.2% on the stock market today. Shares are currently in a flat base.

180,DAL,"Lower fares and a stronger economy have helped bolster air travel in February, the International Air Transport Association said Thursday, adding that President Trump's efforts to restrict travel to the U.S. hadn't yet significantly affected passenger traffic.Passenger traffic globally rose 4.8% in February, the IATA said. Global capacity — a measure of an airline's available seats and flight coverage — rose 2.7% in February.The IATA estimated that fare prices had dropped by more than 10% over the past year.""The strong demand momentum from January has continued, supported by lower fares and a healthier economic backdrop,"" IATA Chief Executive Alexandre de Juniac said in a prepared statement. ""Although we remain concerned over the impact of any travel restrictions or closing of borders, we have not seen the attempted U.S. ban on travel from six countries translate into an identifiable traffic trend.""The figures from the IATA, a trade group that represents more than 260 airlines worldwide, come as international air travel grows more competitive and complicated for Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL).Trump, citing national security reasons, has tried twice to suspend travel from several predominantly Muslim nations, with his most recent attempt halted in federal court. The travel ban has raised concerns about the effect on air-travel demand.The U.S. also has barred passengers from bringing aboard larger electronic devices on U.S.-bound flights coming in from 10 airports in the Middle East across eight countries. Further, the State Department has ordered stricter vetting protocols of visa applicants. Plus, the Trump administration could make visitors to the U.S. disclose social media passwords, cellphone contacts and ideological views, the Wall Street Journal reported.IBD'S TAKE: While the U.S. airlines don't fly to the countries that have targeted by the ban, their code-share partners could be affected, analysts have said. Last month, the travel analysis firm ForwardKeys said international bookings to the U.S. fell 6.5% in the days after Trump's first attempt. Meanwhile, the U.K.'s eventual divorce from the European Union could complicate air travel, and competition low-cost, long-haul carriers from the region could dent profits for Delta, American and United. Delta and American have also recently turned their sights to Asia, where travel demand is expected to boom in the years to come.The IATA has criticized the travel and electronics restrictions, as well as rising protectionist sentiment in the West. It has also urged more collaboration in rolling out security measures.""It's intolerable that governments continue to add to the uncertainties facing the air transport industry by failing to engage airline operational know-how on issues that can damage public confidence,"" de Juniac said Thursday. ""The introduction of restrictions on the carry-on of large electronic devices was a missed opportunity and the result was a measure that cannot stand-up to the scrutiny of public confidence in the long term.""Delta was up 0.4% to close at 45.26 on the stock market today, while American climbed 1% to 41.72 and United tacked on 0.2% to 70.22.

181,DAL,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) trimmed its first-quarter unit-revenue forecast Tuesday, saying the rebound in prices of U.S. flights booked closer to departure was ""more modest than initially anticipated.""The more muted outlook follows other moves in recent weeks by Delta, American Airlines (AAL) and Southwest (LUV) to temper Wall Street's expectations after travel demand rose postelection, airlines tightened up operations, and Berkshire Hathaway's (BRKB) Warren Buffett got behind the industry.In an investor update, Delta said that passenger unit revenue, or sales from passengers as they relate to overall flight capacity, likely fell around 0.5% in Q1. The company last month said it expected the metric to come in flat for Q1, worse than an earlier projection for as much as a 2% increase.The carrier expects capacity to have declined 0.5% for the quarter, compared with an earlier capacity forecast for flat to down 1%.Delta also forecast operating margin of 10% to 11%, in line with earlier guidance. The company said it expected the effects of higher fuel costs to hit their peak for the year during the first quarter. Delta has said it would be able to improve margins later on in the year.Delta closed down 2.6% on the stock market today. American dropped 3.7%, United Airlines (UAL) lost 2.2%, and Southwest eased 1.7%.IBD'S TAKE: Along with low-cost carriers in the U.S., Delta, American and United face growing competition from budget carriers in Europe. Travel demand is seen as still solid, but maybe not as intense as once expected. Thousands of flights were also canceled last month due to Winter Storm Stella.In a separate report out Tuesday, Delta said that passenger unit revenue for March rose 0.5%, its first positive monthly showing since November 2015. Passenger traffic rose 2.3% during the month, and capacity grew 1%.The March passenger unit revenue figure was shy of investors' expectations for a 1% to 3% gain, according to a research note from Raymond James out Tuesday.""U.S. airline shares are also under pressure as Delta's results likely indicate that March did not see a material improvement from trends in February,"" Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth said in that research note.Delta's passenger unit revenue was flat in February and fell 2.5% in January.RELATED:Delta, American Eye Trans-Pacific Market As Trans-Atlantic Rivals GrowLufthansa, AirAsia Escalate Low-Cost Challenge To Delta, AmericanWhat The New Travel Ban Means For Airlines, Travel Demand

183,DAL,"Earnings for Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL), American Airlines (AAL) and their lower-cost rivals are likely to suffer for at least the rest of the year in the wake of hurricanes Harvey and Irma, higher fuel costs and airlines' attempts to hack away at fare prices in some big markets, an analyst forecast on Wednesday.XRaymond James analyst Savanthi Syth cut her third- and fourth-quarter earnings-per-share forecasts for the big national airlines, following other analysts' concerns about how attempts by United and American to match budget carriers on flight prices will filter through to the bottom line.United has cut ticket prices in some of its hubs, like Houston and Denver, in an attempt to ward off the discount carriers. United CFO Andrew Levy, at a conference this month, said ""We are matching fares that are in the marketplace, and we will continue to compete aggressively"" in some of its hub locations.And American's CEO recently said his company would ""absolutely, positively"" match budget carriers on price.Syth downgraded United to a ""market perform 3"" rating, from ""outperform 2,"" saying the carrier's attempts to improve its profitability relative to Delta and American could take longer than expected.She also noted that around 40% of United's domestic supply of seats ""is exposed to overlap"" with ultra-low-cost carriers like Spirit Airlines (SAVE) and Frontier Airlines.""It is uncertain if the new pricing strategy at United is a result of taking a longer-term view in its response to (ultra-low-cost carriers) or too much capacity growth by United in these highly competitive markets,"" Syth wrote. ""Regardless, it is no way to close a margin gap, in our opinion.""However, she said that among the network airlines, competitive trends ""remain the most favorable"" for United, and that the carrier could improve its prospects by throttling back discounting and growth in big markets. Better international sales could also help balance out domestic weakness for United, which is more exposed to travel abroad than its big rivals.While she downgraded United, she upgraded American to outperform, citing in part the carrier's offerings in corporate and premium seating. Customers traveling internationally appear to be taking to its ""Premium Economy"" seats, while investments in its business class have shown some signs of working.She also said American's domestic expansion plans were more restrained than its legacy rivals for the second half of the year. American expects to have its cheaper basic economy fare class available across its domestic network by the end of 2017.Shares of United were up 0.9% on the stock market today but are nearly 30% below a high reached three months ago. American climbed 2.3%, Delta added 0.3%, and Spirit gained 0.2%.IBD'S TAKE: Ready to invest but don't know where to start? An easy-to-follow routine from IBD can help you grow and protect your money over the long term.JPMorgan on Friday downgraded American, United and Spirit and said markets might not be prepared for ""the magnitude of Q4 disappointment we anticipate."" Cowen & Co. has estimated that the fare war between United and Spirit will extend into the middle of next year.With the industry days away from beginning the final quarter of the year, the more downbeat forecasts are a stark contrast to the optimism heading into 2017, when higher demand and tighter pricing and capacity were seen shoring up airlines' results.RELATED:These Airlines Look Like The Biggest Losers In The Latest Price WarUnited To Scale Back Basic Economy Amid Price War With Low-Cost RivalsDelta Cuts Revenue, Margin Targets As Airline Competition Heats UpAirline Industry News And Stocks To Watch

191,DAL,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) and United Airlines (UAL) rival Emirates may consider offering its own electronic devices for passengers, after the Trump administration banned gadgets bigger than smartphones from Mideast and North African carriers flying to the U.S.The restrictions, which took hold this weekend, affect flights originating from 10 airports in the Middle East across eight countries, amid speculation that the electronics restrictions were intended to steer passengers away from Persian Gulf carriers and help the U.S. network airlines, rather than for security purposes.Delta, United and American Airlines (AAL) have claimed that Gulf carriers like Emirates, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways have an easier time competing in the U.S. because they get subsidies from their governments, something the Gulf carriers deny.In an interview broadcast Monday, Emirates President Tim Clark told Bloomberg that ""for a state to cross over into the commercial world and start taking sides on these particular issues makes no sense to me.""He added that limiting such restrictions to the eight countries was ""a worry"" and that if a security threat indeed existed, the protocols should be applied universally.For now, carrying out the new electronics restrictions had gone relatively smoothly for the carrier, but Clark noted ""difficulties at U.S. entry points"" and that it's still early to clearly gauge the impact.""There is a degree of adjustment going on — I can't tell you really whether that is of any great significance — probably until the middle of next month when people are making plans to visit the United States during the course of the summer months,"" he told Bloomberg.

194,DAL,"Here's your Investing Action Plan for Wednesday: what you need to know as an investor for the coming day.United Airlines (UAL) stock recovered some ground from its PR disaster after CEO Oscar Munoz apologized for an incident that sparked accusations of racism. But shares of Ryanair (RYAAY) and Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes (GOL) are flashing buy signals with Southwest Airlines (LUV) and JetBlue (JBLU) not far behind. Meanwhile, Delta Air Lines (DAL) will report Q1 results, the first airline and the first big company to issue financials this earnings season.U.S.-listed shares of Brazilian airline Gol jumped 7.1% to close at 32.90 on the stock market today, clearing a 31.92 buy point. The stock has been helped by the trading debut of Azul Linhas Aereas Brasileiras (AZUL), Brazil's third-largest airline by passengers, which climbed 7.2% to 21.50 after pricing American depository shares at about 20.06 Monday and raising $571.2 million. Irish budget carrier Ryanair rallied 2.45% to finish at 87.76, topping an 86.05 entry.U.S. discount airline Southwest rose 1.4% to 55.06, making its way toward a 59.78 entry, and JetBlue gained 1.4% to end at 21.54, closing in on a 23.25 buy point.For all its PR woes, United shares are 8% below a 76.90 buy point. But the backlash it sparked in China may now make finding a Chinese partner difficult as rivals team up with locals in the lucrative market.

196,DAL,"American Airlines (AAL), the world's largest carrier, is in advanced talks to acquire a stake in China Southern Airlines (ZNH), according to people familiar with the matter.The negotiations focus on an investment of about $200 million by Fort Worth, Texas-based American in China Southern's Hong Kong-listed shares, said the people, asking not to be identified as talks are confidential. The sale will likely take place via a private placement, one of the people said. China Southern has a market value of about $10 billion.Under the discussions, American would nominate to the Chinese company's board an observer — a representative without voting rights, the people said. Details of a deal are subject to change and a transaction could still fall through.China Southern representatives couldn't immediately comment when reached after regular business hours. A spokesman for American Airlines declined to comment.An investment in China Southern would allow American to strengthen its presence in a market that the International Air Transport Association predicts will surpass the U.S. to become the world's biggest in terms of passenger numbers by 2024. Delta Air Lines (DAL) acquired a minority stake in China Eastern Airlines (CEA). in 2015.A sale of a stake in China Southern would represent the Chinese government's efforts to diversify ownership of state-controlled enterprises. Authorities have urged firms in industries including power, energy, defense and aviation to take measures this year to broaden ownership.China Southern is the last of the nation's top three airlines to bring in a non-mainland Chinese strategic investor. Cathay Pacific Airways owns about 18% of flagship Air China. Besides Delta, Shanghai-based China Eastern also counts online travel services provider Ctrip.com International (CTRP) among its shareholders.American connects 350 destinations in 50 countries, mostly in North America, the Caribbean, South America and Europe. It has flights from major U.S. cities to Beijing and Shanghai.

197,DAL,"Delta Air Lines' (DAL) has maintained a ""disciplined,"" ""investor-focused"" plan for flight capacity, an analyst said Thursday. United Airlines? Maybe less so.That analyst, Duane Pfennigwerth at Evercore ISI, upgraded Delta to outperform, citing the carrier's plans to cap its increase of available seats and flight coverage to 1% until unit revenue turns ""solidly positive.""""Airlines have no control over big inputs like demand, fuel (and weather),"" he wrote in a research note. ""The one variable they do control is capacity. Higher reliability supports more dynamic planning.""He also said Delta had a ""higher sense of urgency on margins"" and more forgiving year-over-year unit-revenue comparisons than rivals for the second half of this year. Delta has said it would likely be able to grow margins during the back half of this year, after recent labor agreements with employees constrained them.Meanwhile, United Airlines (UAL) is ""abandoning its commitment to shareholders to keep its capacity growth below GDP,"" Pfennigwerth wrote. He downgraded United's stock to in-line from outperform.United Airlines shares fell 0.9% to 67.56 on the stock market today, off session lows of 66.44. Delta Air climbed 0.5%. Both stocks rebounded from four-month lows Wednesday intraday.Southwest Airlines (LUV) fell 0.3% and American Airlines (AAL) rose 0.1%. Southwest is trying to hold above its 50-day line after retaking that support area on Wednesday. American Air rebounded from a 200-day line test on Wednesday.After airlines late last year began to shore up unit revenue, concerns from analysts have resurfaced this year that airlines might try to re-accelerate capacity growth, potentially adding new flights to different areas in attempt to take market share. More flights gives consumers more options, but it means more competition for airlines.""While there may be numerous practical company specific reasons to increase domestic capacity growth plans by 200 b.p. following softer industry revenue trends YTD,"" Pfennigwerth wrote Thursday, ""it appears completely tone deaf to long term investors' primary concerns.""United at a conference Wednesday raised its full-year capacity outlook, hiking domestic capacity to 3.5%-4.5% growth from a range of 1.5%-2.5%. The carrier said it expects global capacity growth of 2.5%-3.5%, up from 1%-2%.United last month said it planned to add service to 31 destinations in the U.S. and Europe over the spring and summer, including by widening its domestic network to include smaller cities. The carrier also plans to add a seasonal flight between San Francisco and Munich starting on May 24.IBD'S TAKE: United has looked toward smaller cities as a way to relieve competitive strain in primary hubs and the market abroad. But over the Atlantic, the big three U.S. carriers have been searching for ways to ward off a newer breed of low-cost, long-haul carrier.The upgrade to Delta and downgrade to United come during a full week for the airline industry. Thousands of cancellations have resulted from Winter Storm Stella in the northeast, sinking shares of U.S. airlines earlier in the week. Then, on Wednesday, some airlines presented at the JPMorgan Aviation, Transportation & Industrials Conference.Later on Wednesday, a federal judge in Hawaii temporarily halted the parts of President Trump's new executive order that barred all refugees from coming into the U.S. and blocked the entry of anyone without a green card or visa from six predominantly Muslim nations deemed a terrorism risk. The order was set to go into effect on Thursday. Analysts have worried such restrictions will hurt travel demand.Trump, during a rally in Nashville on Wednesday evening, vowed to defend the ban, saying the government would take the case to the Supreme Court if necessary.""And let me tell you something, I think we ought to go back to the first one and go all the way, which is what I wanted to do in the first place,"" he said.The administration's first attempt at a travel ban in January caused chaos at airports. It died days later after getting as far as a federal appeals court, which upheld a lower court's ruling suspending the immigration restrictions.""The illogic of the Government's contentions is palpable,"" the Wednesday decision said. ""The notion that one can demonstrate animus toward any group of people only by targeting all of them at once is fundamentally flawed.""RELATED:Southwest Joins Delta, American In Cutting Unit Revenue ForecastBuffett's Berkshire Piles On Shares Of Apple, Airlines, Cuts Wal-Mart

198,DAL,"British Airways parent International Airlines Group will launch a low-cost, long-haul airline that will offer flights from Barcelona to the U.S. West Coast and elsewhere starting in June, making it the latest such carrier that Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) will face over the Atlantic Ocean.IAG's new airline, called Level, would begin one-way fares at $149, and offer flights to Los Angeles, the San Francisco area, Buenos Aires and Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic two or three times per week. Tickets became available on Friday.The trans-Atlantic market has long been a big moneymaking part of the world for Delta, American and United. But carriers like Norwegian Air Shuttle and Iceland's WOW Air now offer cheap flights from the U.S. to Europe, and even JetBlue (JBLU) has eyed the Atlantic.While other European peers like Lufthansa have also created low-cost businesses, the big three U.S. network carriers have decided not to pursue a similar strategy. Instead, Delta, American and United plan to compete with low-cost rivals through a variety of seating classes, from higher-end fares to, potentially, so-called ""basic economy,"" a bare-bones fare class that the carriers are rolling out across the U.S.Delta has said it wants its basic economy class available globally by 2018.IBD'S TAKE: New entrants to the trans-Atlantic battle will likely make the region less profitable for the big three U.S. network carriers. For more on their prospects competing with low-cost, long-haul airlines, read this story. Level flights will begin on two Airbus (EADSY) A330 jets, and IAG said the new carrier ""will look to expand its flights from other European cities.""Those aircraft will have 293 economy seats and 21 premium economy seats. Premium economy passengers can check their luggage and bring aboard a bag for free. Meals, seat selection and in-flight movies will also be complimentary.""Customers travelling in economy can chose what they want to buy based on a menu of choices: checked luggage (in addition to a free cabin bag), meals, seat selection and the latest movie releases,"" IAG said in an email sent to IBD.The company also said that as an introductory offer, economy travelers would have free access to in-flight entertainment.IAG's announcement comes as the big three airlines manage the day-to-day fluctuations of supply, demand — and other issues — in the U.S.Earlier this week, Winter Storm Stella forced thousands of flight cancellations. United, after last month announcing plans to bulk up service to a variety of smaller cities across the U.S., hiked its capacity guidance for the year and got an analyst downgrade. Then, President Trump's travel ban was blocked by two federal judges.Also Friday, Imperial Capital also cut its price targets on American and United, citing competition with rivals.RELATED:What The New Travel Ban Means For Airlines, Travel DemandAirline Stocks Tumble On Fears Capacity May Creep Back UpUnited, American, Southwest Rise As DOT Suspends Obama Fare Transparency Rules

203,DAL,"United Airlines (UAL) on Wednesday hiked its full-year outlook for carrying capacity, while Alaska Air Group (ALK) announced another set of new flights from the West Coast.The less-than-ideal forecasts came a day after airline stocks sank on a wave of flight cancellations due to Winter Storm Stella, and a day before President Trump's new temporary travel ban takes hold.United, in a slide presentation at the JPMorgan Aviation, Transportation & Industrials Conference, said it expects full-year growth in capacity — an airline's available seats and flight coverage — of 2.5%-3.5%. That's up from a prior outlook of 1%-2% growth.United's extra flight coverage comes as Alaska Airlines on Wednesday said it would add six new routes from San Diego — part of a broader plan to establish a stronghold on the West Coast. Alaska Air Group, which recently bought Virgin America, said last week that it would add 13 new flight routes from the Bay Area.Investors over much of the past two years have wanted airlines to temper their plans to increase capacity after cheap oil made it easier to expand and compete. That expansion prompted concerns that the industry was adding flights and cutting fares too aggressively.In the fourth quarter, Wall Street got what it wanted. Consumer confidence and travel demand picked up after the election. Even Berkshire Hathaway (BKRB), where Warren Buffett was perhaps convinced that the airlines could operate with the discipline of other large industries, got behind the business. But there have been concerns recently that capacity could creep back up, now that demand and fundamentals have improved.Still, United on Wednesday said it expected positive passenger-unit revenue in Q2 and sees unit costs to be lower for the year than initially expected.During United's Q1 earnings call in January, President Scott Kirby said that, assuming the market holds up the way it has, ""I think we're going to be at positive (passenger-unit revenue) either this quarter, or certainly next quarter.""The company on Wednesday said the first quarter ""has played out largely as expected.""Airline shares reversed higher, with United closing up 2.4% at 68.17 on the stock market today after falling earlier to 64.32, puncturing the bottom of a flat base. Delta Air Lines (DAL) climbed 2%, American Airlines (AAL) rose 2.1%, and Southwest (LUV) gained 2.7%. Alaska added 0.9%.Delta, in its own conference presentation Wednesday, said that rising postelection demand in the U.S. had spilled over into 2017. And it said that business yields — or a measure of an airline's ability to charge business travelers more for airfare — had improved ""but remain well below historical levels.""American's presentation touted the carrier's ""unprecedented investment in product,"" saying it expected capital expenditures to surpass Delta and United this year. The company said that with the addition of new jets and the retirement of old ones, it expected to have ""the youngest fleet of the major airlines"" by the end of the year.IBD'S TAKE: Along with the stress of matching rivals on when they add flights or cut fares, the major U.S. airlines also have to contend with low-cost carriers that have set their sights on the trans-Atlantic. Meanwhile, Spirit Airlines (SAVE) said in a regulatory filing that it expected Q1 unit revenue to fall 4%-5%, more than its prior view for a 2.5% dip. The shift in timing for the Easter holiday to April this year is affecting March travel plans. Delta, American and Southwest also have cut unit revenue forecasts for Q1.But Spirit, like United, said it expected unit revenue to turn positive in Q2.Spirit rose 2.6% on Wednesday.Wednesday's stock gains in the sector followed two days of steep losses as Winter Storm Stella hit the Northeast and forced thousands of flight cancellations, pressuring the Dow Jones Transportation Average.CFRA analyst Jim Corridore said that the financial impact of the storm would be lighter than others and the airlines were well-prepared as the storm approached. He also said that oil prices had fallen over the past week and could keep falling, potentially easing the cost burden for the airlines in the months ahead.""We think U.S. airlines were well positioned ahead of Winter Storm Stella, cancelling flights to ensure equipment does not get stranded and operations can quickly scale up once the storm passes,"" he wrote in a research note, later adding that ""storms are part of the airline business.""RELATED:Southwest Joins Delta, American In Cutting Unit Revenue Forecast

204,DAL,"Shares of Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL), United Airlines (UAL) and Southwest (LUV) got decked Tuesday as Winter Storm Stella buried the Northeast, a day after cancellations piled up in anticipation of the storm.American said it and its regional partners had canceled more than 1,675 flights Tuesday and 400 flights for Wednesday. Delta had canceled more than 900 flights. Southwest had canceled more than 1,300 flights from Monday through Wednesday, the carrier said on Monday. About 6,800 flights have been canceled so far today, according to FlightAware.com.Delta expects operations to resume on Tuesday evening, albeit with a reduced schedule. Flights ""should return to relative normalcy"" on Wednesday, the carrier said, but added that its schedule depended on whether New York's mass transit system has resumed service and other facilities were in decent enough shape.Meanwhile, American said all Tuesday flights in New York and Boston have been canceled, but it would resume normal operations at airports in those cities on Wednesday at noon Eastern Time. American also said that any restoration of service depends on the weather, the roads and the state of public transportation.Shares of American closed down 2.7% in the stock market today, setting a four-month low after losing 3.5% Monday. Delta lost 2.3%, also hitting a four-month low, on top of Monday's 1.2% loss. Southwest fell 3%, undercutting its 50-day line, after retreating 2.5% Monday. United, which has a hub in Newark, N.J., tumbled 4.7%, worse than Monday's 3.4% sell-off. JetBlue (JBLU), which has a hub at JFK airport, dropped 1%. The Dow Jones Transportation Average dipped 1.4%.IBD'S TAKE: The flight cancellations announced this week come as President Trump's new travel ban is set to take hold on Thursday. Airline stocks have risen on postelection demand and Trump's promises to lighten regulations on the industry. Here's a look at what the travel ban means for travel demand. The cancellations also raise further questions about airlines' unit revenue. Southwest, Delta and American have all cut their first-quarter forecasts for the metric, which measures revenue in relation to flight capacity, after offering a more upbeat outlook over the past few months.In reporting February traffic results, American pulled back from its unit-revenue outlook in part due to its year-to-date completion factor — that is, the rate at which an airline completes its scheduled flights — which added to the carrier's capacity.Southwest, in lowering its unit-revenue forecast, also cited a higher completion factor, an abnormal amount of rain in California that hit passenger traffic, and weaker close-in bookings.""Our view is that the demand environment remains very healthy, but perhaps it is somewhat softer than airlines were expecting based on the acceleration post election,"" Stifel analyst Joseph DeNardi said in a research note last week.RELATED:Buffett's Berkshire Piles On Shares Of Apple, Airlines, Cuts Wal-MartThis Is Why Airline Stocks Are Big Market Losers Today

205,DAL,"Southwest Airlines (LUV) lowered its first-quarter unit revenue outlook Friday, after Delta Air Lines (DAL) and American Airlines (AAL) trimmed their guidance for the key metric earlier this week.After upbeat forecasts on unit revenue from the industry late last year and early this year, carriers now appear to be dialing back those expectations, amid worries the capacity discipline that lead to improvements over the last few years may be slipping.Southwest now sees Q1 unit revenue falling 2%-3%, down from an earlier prediction for no change to a 1% dip.The discount airline cited a better-than-expected February completion rate, which boosts capacity, and the loss of traffic from heavy rainfall in California.
"
206,DAL,"But Southwest also noted ""unexpected softness in close-in demand"" in the latter part of February, referring to last-minute bookings, though it has rebounded in March.Shares closed down 0.85% to 55.88 on the stock market today, erasing most of its intraday loss. Delta rose 1.4% and American climbed 1.3%, both reversing higher from modest losses. United Airlines (UAL), which kept its Q1 unit revenue view unchanged, fell 0.3%.Meanwhile JetBlue soared 5.1%. The carrier said February traffic rose 0.1% as capacity climbed 0.7%. JetBlue sees first-quarter unit revenue down 4%-5%, citing a big impact from the shift of the Easter holiday to April this year from March.On Thursday, American said it now sees Q1 total unit revenue growing 1.5%-3.5%, down from an earlier forecast for growth of 2.5%-4.5%, citing an improved rate of flight cancellations vs. a year ago that pushed capacity up. American still sees an adjusted pretax margin of 3%-5% in Q1.On Monday, Delta said it sees flat Q1 unit revenue vs. an prior forecast for no change to a 2% increase, sparking a sell-off in airline stocks. It also trimmed its Q1 operating margin forecast to 10%-11% from 11%-13%.The company said unit revenue saw ""a more moderate pace of improvement in February than initially anticipated.""

207,DAL,"Emirates, one of the Middle Eastern airlines that sparked a war with Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) by flying to more U.S. and European cities, is now worried that low-cost carriers flying to international destinations will take away customers.Norwegian Air Shuttle has rattled the lucrative trans-Atlantic market with one-way fares as low as $69 from New York to London, and others like Iceland's WOW Air have forced network carriers Air France-KLM and Lufthansa to launch low-cost units of their own.""At the back end of '90s I did a paper on long-haul low-cost,"" Emirates President Tim Clark said at a conference in Berlin Thursday, according to Bloomberg. ""Everyone laughed at me, but what I predicted then has finally started to happen. We have players in all arenas — Europe, America, Asia. It's a gathering storm.""That could provide schadenfreude fodder for Delta, United and American, who saw trans-Atlantic revenue suffer a few years ago at the hands of Emirates, Qatar Air and Etihad Airways as they went on buying sprees of long-haul Boeing (BA) and Airbus (EADSY) planes.The U.S. companies also have been pressuring the U.S. government to renegotiate Open Skies Agreements with the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, claiming Persian Gulf airlines have received unfair subsidies to fuel their exponential growth in recent years.Despite the backlash, Clark also said Thursday that Emirates will go ahead with a new flight to Newark, N.J.Shares of Delta closed down 0.9% on the stock market today. United fell 1.2%, and American dropped 3.5% after cutting its Q1 unit revenue guidance.Unlike their European peers, the big U.S. carriers have decided not to set up separate low-cost businesses in favor of dividing airplane cabins into more segments, including ones meant to appeal to no-frill travelers.U.S. airlines also have vowed to compete aggressively, including on price, amid the growth of international options.""We don't intend to cede our position across the Atlantic to anybody,"" American Airlines Chief Marketing Officer Andrew Nocella told analysts in January.The airline will shrink trans-Atlantic capacity during Q1 but plans to increase it again in Q3, when summer travel makes flights more lucrative.But on Thursday, American said it now sees Q1 total unit revenue growing 1.5%-3.5%, down from an earlier forecast for growth of 2.5%-4.5%, citing an improved rate of flight cancellations vs. a year ago that pushed capacity up. American still sees an adjusted pretax margin of 3%-5% in Q1.The news follows Delta's announcement on Monday, when it cut its Q1 operating margin and unit revenue forecasts, sparking a sell-off in airlines stocks.

208,DAL,"President Trump's new temporary travel ban eventually could affect 20 countries, posing a steeper risk to travel demand and, in turn, carriers like Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) as well as companies like Disney (DIS) whose theme parks rely of tourism.In addition to the restrictions on refugees and people from Iran, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, the latest order contains a uniform screening provision and suspends a visa interview waiver program, possibly slowing the issuance of visas and requiring more extensive reviews of people entering the U.S. — including tourists, potentially. The new travel ban takes hold on March 16.""Anything, really, is possible here,"" Royce Murray, policy director at the American Immigration Council, told Investor's Business Daily. ""I think we'll have to see what implementation looks like.""She added that ""an enormous infusion of resources"" would be needed to conduct additional interviews if the uniform-screening rule ends up subjecting all travelers to the same vetting procedures.The executive order does call for an immediate expansion of the program for Consular Fellows, who evaluate visa and passport applications and interview applicants, in part by potentially ""substantially increasing"" head count or extending their service.But analysts who follow the airline industry have also worried that the administration's attempt to suspend visa interview waivers could make travel more inconvenient, including for people who regularly fly back and forth to the U.S. Separately, conferences and other events could be moved to other countries to avoid hassles surrounding the visa process for foreign attendees, and the ban could affect the U.S.' reputation as a place worth visiting.""We will lose not just the people that might come from these six identified countries,"" said William Stock, an immigration lawyer in Philadelphia and president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. ""We'll lose people who have plenty of money from Europe who say 'Well I'm not gonna go spend money at Disney in Florida. I'm going to go to another vacation place because I don't want to spend my money in a country that's so discriminatory.'""Helane Becker, an airline analyst at Cowen & Co., agreed that the ban is likely to deter some tourists, and noted possible spillover effects on companies here.""While the U.S. airlines don't fly from those countries, their code share partners do and it does impact travel,"" she said in an email.Since the second ban was announced, shares of Delta have lost 4.6%, American 5.8% and United 2.7%, though that also coincided with Delta cutting its Q1 unit revenue forecast.The Homeland Security Department has said it will review identity and security information that all countries provide to the U.S. for visa and immigration purposes and will give them 50 days to answer requests to update or improve information they provide.Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly told CNN there were ""probably 13 or 14 countries"" in addition to the six largely Muslim countries ""that have questionable vetting procedures.""Kelly did not say what countries might be affected but said not all of them are Muslim and not all are in the Middle East.The industry group Airlines For America — whose members include United, American, JetBlue (JBLU) and Hawaiian Holdings' (HA) Hawaiian Airlines — said that its airlines ""did not see any significant operational impact"" during the time the first executive order was in effect.""We appreciate the Administration's clear guidance on the scope of the executive order, and establishment of a timeline for implementation to avoid significant impact to our air travel system and the customers we serve,"" an Airlines For America representative said via email.Middle Eastern airline Emirates, however, saw a 35% drop in the pace of bookings after the initial travel ban, President Tim Clark said on Thursday, adding that while bookings have recovered a bit they are still below levels seen before the ban.The International Air Transport Association, a trade association that represents more than 260 airlines accounting for more than 80% of the world's air traffic, said in a statement that it ""advocates for borders that are open to people and trade.""However, it said it also ""recognizes that states have the right and duty to protect their citizens by enforcing their borders"" and urged advance notice and clear guidance in rolling out new travel rules.IBD'S TAKE: Even as Trump's attempts to restrict immigration have occasionally dinged airline stocks, analysts generally like the industry's prospects under his administration. Trump met with the airline executives last month, vowing to cut regulations and improve infrastructure, although the travel ban was not discussed during that meeting.  International bookings to the U.S. fell 6.5% between Jan. 28, the day after Trump signed the first order restricting immigrant and refugee entry, and Feb. 4, the day the Homeland Security Department suspended the ban, according to data published Monday from travel analysis firm ForwardKeys.Bookings through the middle of February pushed slightly higher, then fell amid expectations the administration would take a second stab at a travel ban. As of Feb. 25, forward bookings for international arrivals in the U.S. were 0.4% slower than those bookings at the same time a year ago.Those difficulties come as the European Parliament approved a resolution demanding the European Commission require visas for Americans planning to travel to Europe, amid friction stemming from the U.S. government's decision not to give visa-free access to several European countries.""I think we also have to remember all of these provisions are a two-way street,"" Stock, of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said. ""If Americans are comfortable with their information being shared with foreign governments, that's the only way we're going to be able to insist on those countries sharing information with the United States.""RELATED:Buffett's Berkshire Piles On Shares Of Apple, Airlines, Cuts Wal-MartAirline Stocks Tumble On Fears Capacity May Creep Back UpDelta, American, United Go Guns Blazing Into Battle Of The Atlantic

209,DAL,"Oil lingered near $51 a barrel as OPEC's optimistic outlook for crude demand was overshadowed by the specter of booming output from Texas to Tripoli.Futures meandered within a narrow 66-cent range after jumping the most in two weeks on Tuesday. Daily demand for OPEC crude next year will be about 200,000 barrels higher than the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries predicted just a month ago. In addition, output caps adopted by most OPEC nations and allied producers are trimming a worldwide glut, the group said on Wednesday. Some investors remain skeptical that the surfeit of oil is shrinking as much as OPEC claims.""There's still a lot of questions around what 2018 is shaping up to be like in terms of demand and supply,"" John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund, said by telephone. OPEC continues to ""keep working this market over with their rhetoric, even though the supply dynamic doesn't seem to be supporting their positions.""Oil has advanced more than 3% this week on speculation OPEC, Russia and other parties to the historic 2016 production accord may extend the deal beyond its March expiration. Saudi Arabia warned it will cut the amount of crude available for sale next month while OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo signaled the group is looking to expand the number of nations participating in the deal.West Texas Intermediate for November delivery was unchanged at $50.92 a barrel at 10:36 a.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was about 7% below the 100-day average.Brent for December settlement slid 14 cents to $56.47 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark crude traded at a premium of $5.29 to December WTI.The gasoline crack spread, a rough measure of the profit from refining crude into gasoline, jumped as much as 4.4% to $16.62 a barrel. Delta Air Lines' (DAL) refinery in Pennsylvania was said to be shutting some units down after a fire on Wednesday, according to a person familiar with operations.OPEC will need to supply 33.1 million barrels a day next year, about 350,000 more than it pumped last month, the group said in a report on Wednesday.A Bloomberg survey showed that U.S distillate stockpiles probably declined by 1.93 million last week. At the Cushing, Oklahoma, pipeline hub, inventories likely increased by 1.8 million barrels, according to a separate forecast compiled by Bloomberg.The industry-funded American Petroleum Institute will release its inventory data on Wednesday, while the Energy Information Administration is scheduled to disclose its tallies on Thursday.Pierre Andurand's hedge fund trailed the oil-price rally last month, posting a 2.4% gain compared with the almost 10 percent boost for Brent crude, according to people familiar with the performance.Canadian oil-sands producers enjoying the strongest market for heavy crude since 2008 will soon face a renewed glut. Suncor Energy (SU) expects its Fort Hills oil-sands mine to begin producing by year end. The startup will roughly coincide with the completion of planned maintenance at the Kearl mine owned by Exxon Mobil's (XOM) Imperial Oil subsidiary.

SPDR S&P Retail (XRT) lost 1.5% and was seeking support at its 50-day line.Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) sank 5%, sliding further below its 50-day line. The volatile ETF, which offers exposure to the price movement of Bitcoin, is 40% off its recent high but still up more than 400% this year.While many U.S. diversified stock funds are extended from recent buy points, two niche plays that hold American Airlines (AAL), Delta Air Lines (DAL) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) may be getting close to potential breakouts.U.S. Global Jets (JETS) is shaping the right side of a shallow cup-shaped base. The ideal buy point would be 32.93, or a dime above the left-side high, unless shares pause to form a handle. In that case, the buy point would become the high of the handle, plus 10 cents. JETS soared 11% after a May breakout from a cup with handle to the start of the current base in mid-July.The ETF's shares gapped up 2% Tuesday, boosted by component stock American Airlines and United Continental (UAL), which surged 5% each. The carriers' Q3 unit revenue forecasts were better than expected.JETS, which launched in April 2015, has attracted $115.4 million in assets. It tracks the U.S. Global Jet Index and offers exposure to airline operators and manufacturers around the world. Its top holdings as of Oct. 9 were Delta Air Lines, American, United and Southwest Airlines (LUV), at roughly 12% apiece. U.S. companies accounted for 80% of total assets.A 12.5% year-to-date return through Oct. 9 trails the S&P 500's 15.4% gain, according to Morningstar Direct.

211,DAL,"As carriers like United Airlines (UAL) and Spirit Airlines (SAVE) engage in a price war, forecasts for unit revenue improvement in the fourth quarter now look too optimistic, according to JPMorgan analysts.XThe firm downgraded the two airlines, along with American Airlines (AAL), to neutral from over weight. JPMorgan also slashed price targets on United to 68 from 84, on American to 53 from 61, on Spirit to 37 from 45 and on Delta Air Lines (DAL) to 67 from 71.Bottom lines will take big hits too, and JPMorgan sees United earning just 64 cents a share in Q4 and Spirit earning just 34 cents a share, according to Benzinga. That compares to consensus EPS estimates of $1.34 for United and 57 cents for Spirit.Airlines have the ability to boost pricing domestically, but that isn't happening yet, JPMorgan noted, adding that higher fuel costs are also weighing on results.Shares of United closed down 2.4% at 59.80 on the stock market today. Spirit fell 3.3% to 33.69, American dipped 0.4% to 46.00, and Delta finished virtually unchanged at 48.25.Meanwhile, Southwest Airlines (LUV), which was upgraded to overweight and had its price target hiked to 66 from 60, rose 0.7% to 54.72, with JPMorgan saying the discount carrier has a better valuation and risk-reward profile than its rivals. Alaska Air (ALK) and JetBlue (JBLU) also received price target hikes.IBD'S TAKE: Ready to invest but don't know where to start? An easy to follow routine from IBD can help you grow and protect your money over the long term.The major airlines have lowered Q3 unit revenue forecasts in recent weeks, with hurricanes Harvey and Irma adding to the downward pressure.

And we don't like the effect it has on short-term earnings,"" CFO Andrew Levy said at a conference.

Other data earlier in the week also pointed to an economy that seems to finally be breaking out of its eight-year run of slow growth, though some of the strength may reflect a boost from hurricane recovery efforts.

"
214,DAL,"United Airlines (UAL) cut its passenger unit revenue and margin outlook for the third quarter, as Hurricane Harvey contributed to challenges during the period, but the carrier said later on Wednesday that a price war with low-cost rivals is also having an impact.XPassenger unit revenue, or PRASM, is now expected to decline 3%-5% vs. prior guidance for a 1% fall to 1% rise. Pretax margin is now seen at 8%-10%, down from 12.5%-14.5%. United sees capacity growth falling to 3%-3.5%, down from around 4%.Harvey caused operations to halt at George Bush Intercontinental Airport for four days, causing over 7,400 flights to be canceled, said the company. United also cited geopolitical tensions in the Korean Peninsula, pricing issues and higher fuel costs as weighing on the quarter.Chief Financial Officer Andrew Levy said at a Cowen & Co. conference in Boston that United will continue offering low fares to compete in key markets, despite the short-term pain.""We don't like where the fare structures are right now. And we don't like the effect it has on short-term earnings,"" he said, according to Bloomberg. ""It is painful, difficult, but we're going to see it through.""United is also scaling back its ""basic economy"" fares, which were meant to compete with low-cost carriers head-on, in some markets.Southwest Airlines (LUV) also scaled back its guidance, saying Q3 unit revenue will be down 1% to ""slightly up""  vs. prior guidance for a 1% gain. CFO Tammy Romo largely blamed the ""current competitive pricing environment.""Shares fell 1.6% in the stock market today, paring earlier losses sharply. Rivals reversed earlier losses, as Delta Air Lines (DAL) rallied 3%, American Airlines (AAL) rose 1.1%, and Southwest gained 1.4%.IBD'S TAKE: Ready to invest but don't know where to start? An easy to follow routine from IBD can help you grow and protect your money over the long term.United's move follows Delta's announcement on Tuesday to cut its passenger unit revenue and operating margin forecast for the third quarter, citing higher fuel costs and a slower-than-expected rebound in certain fares.Meanwhile, United also ordered 45 Airbus A350s, upping its order size by 10 jetliners. According to Bloomberg, the deal is a conversion of a prior order for a larger variety of Airbus A350 widebody jets.RELATED:Delta Cuts Revenue, Margin Targets As Airline Competition Heats UpAirline Industry News And Stocks To WatchStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

"
217,DAL,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) on Tuesday cut its passenger unit revenue and operating margin outlook for the third quarter, citing higher fuel prices and a ""slower than anticipated"" rebound in its domestic pricing power on flights booked closer to their departure.XDelta's forecast for unit revenue, which measures an airline's sales by its overall capacity to fly people from place to place, comes some two months after several carriers signaled a weaker showing for the key metric and more fare discounting in some parts of the U.S. this quarter. More competition is one reason: JetBlue (JBLU) said last month that it would double flights into Atlanta, Delta's main hub. Iceland's WOW carrier said in August that it will expand super-discount trans-Atlantic flights to more U.S. cities.It also comes after Hurricane Harvey left much of Houston underwater and forced scores of flight cancellations, particularly for United Airlines (UAL) and Southwest (LUV). Meanwhile, Hurricane Irma, which grew into a Category 5 storm on Tuesday, was forecast to strike South Florida this weekend.Delta on Tuesday expects third-quarter unit revenue to be up 2%-3%, compared to an earlier outlook for 2.5%-4.5% growth. Operating margins for the third quarter are expected to be 16.5%-17.5%, lower than previous expectations for 18%-20%, the carrier said.Delta fell 3.5% in the stock market today, still in a sharp downtrend since peaking in early July. United stock lost 2.1% and American Airlines (AAL) dipped 3.1%. Southwest (LUV) retreated 2%. Spirit Airlines (SAVE) sank 4.5% and JetBlue 3.3%.As Harvey approached and then hammered Texas, more investors stepped into airline stocks, with many feeling they were oversold. Airline stocks likely were pressured Tuesday as Hurricane Irma increased to a Category 5 storm, headed for Florida.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Still, passenger traffic for the month of August jumped 6.9%, while capacity rose 2.7%.

218,DAL,"Harvey seems more powerful and potentially carries a bigger impact to the airlines than Hurricane Katrina did, a top airline analyst said Tuesday, as rain and flooding plunged Houston deeper into crisis.XKatrina scarred New Orleans for years, but that city isn't a hub market. When Hurricane Ike struck Houston in 2008, it cost Continental $50 million, said Cowen analyst Helane Becker in a research note. Superstorm Sandy in 2012 maybe more comparable for airlines due to its prolonged impact.United Airlines (UAL) seemed likeliest to bear the biggest financial impact from Harvey, which could cost the carrier at least $265 million, assuming airports reopen on Thursday, Becker wrote.""Given Houston is a major hub for United, they will likely be the most impacted by the storms,"" she said.Southwest (LUV) and Spirit Airlines (SAVE), which follow United in being most exposed to Houston, would take hits of $77 million and $11 million respectively, she said.Shares of United closed down 0.4% on the stock market today. Southwest eased 0.6%, and Spirit slipped 0.8%. Delta Air Lines (DAL) lost 0.7%, and American Airlines (AAL) fell 0.9%.IBD'S TAKE: Airlines' most recent round of earnings reports have left investors questioning the industry's operational discipline and the state of the ultra low-cost carrier business model. Even as Harvey closed in on Texas on Friday, airline shares rallied on Wall Street's belief that the sector had sold off too harshly in recent weeks.That slide intensified after the industry in July threw off signals that more price cuts could be on the horizon and that unit revenue, or an airline's sales in relation to its overall flight capacity, might not be as strong as once anticipated.Airlines typically factor in some degree of bad weather into their financial forecasts. But in Tuesday's note, Cowen's Becker said the storm could hang over people's traveling habits for some time.""We assume the airports in the area will be closed for seven days and expect relatively little chance to recoup the lost revenue as the impact to people in the region could be profound (justifiably difficult to go on vacation after your house was flooded or the roof torn off),"" she wrote.""In addition, we expect school closures, and it is possible future vacations will be canceled to make up the lost classroom time.""Hundreds of United and Southwest flights have been canceled due to the storm, which has caused reservoirs to swell and levees to breach and made canalways out of the Houston's streets. At least 10 people have died as a result of the storm.RELATED:Flooring, Home Improvement Shares Advance As Rain Estimate SpikesDelta, Southwest, Other Airline Stocks Extend Gains As Harvey Bears DownInsurance Stocks Tumble As Hurricane Harvey Impact MountsHow Much Will Gasoline Prices Jump?

220,DAL,"Flight cancellations piled up on Friday as Hurricane Harvey churned toward the Texas coast, yet airline stocks were rallying in afternoon trade.Southwest (LUV) had canceled at least 179 flights from today through Sunday, many going in and out of Texas, according to FlightAware.Shares, however, closed up 3.9% in the stock market today. American Airlines (AAL) jumped 5.4%, Delta Air Lines (DAL) added 3.3%, and United Airlines (UAL) picked up 3.1%.The gains in the airline sector follow an extended sell-off triggered by the industry's second-quarter earnings season last month.""The stocks have been so weak in the last month, they more than discount a weather event …,"" Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth said in an email. ""This is a bit of a recovery from oversold levels especially with the market moving up today.""More information on the storm's fallout could emerge in the coming weeks, when the airlines release monthly traffic figures. Airlines are also set to present at a Cowen & Co. conference on Sept. 6, and additional information could come then.But the airlines likely factored in some of the impact already.""Most of the airlines do, when they give guidance, assume at least one or two storms every quarter that would cause earnings to be affected by it,"" Cowen & Co. analyst Helane Becker said.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.During Q2 earnings reporting season, investors soured on disappointing unit-revenue forecasts and worries about a bigger fare war to come — things that could erode airlines' sales and profits.Spirit Airlines (SAVE) shares plummeted after the budget carrier cited deeper fare discounting in United's hubs. United also issued a ""guarantee"" that it could beat out Frontier, a low-cost carrier that has advanced into Denver, United's most profitable hub.A terrorist attack in Barcelona, more planned competition from JetBlue (JBLU) in Atlanta, and plans from Iceland low-cost, long-haul carrier WOW Air to expand in the Midwest have also depressed airline stocks.Stifel analyst Joseph DeNardi, in a research note on Thursday, said that characterizations of a fare war on par with the one seen in 2015 seemed like ""an overstatement.""""Based on our discussions with airlines, it would seem as if United's pricing action against Spirit is far more tactical and less strategic than what happened in 2015,"" he wrote.""For example, in 2015, there was a strategic decision at American to begin fare matching Spirit, which resulted in a step down in fare levels in many markets,"" he said. ""What's happening now seems to be United tightening up the way it is competing against Spirit and which fares it's choosing to match. We think that's an important difference as it should result in less of an impact on industry fares.""He also noted that the weakness in airline stocks could prompt more operational discipline from the industry next year.RELATED:As Texas Braces For Harvey, Investors Stock Up On These CompaniesAirline Industry News And Stocks To WatchWOW: Why Delta, American, United And Other Airline Stocks Are Sinking Yet AgainWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Dumps General Electric Stake, Trims AirlinesAs Airlines Brace For Fare War, Here's Why Delta's Margins May Survive

221,DAL,"Shares of Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) tripped up on Wednesday after Iceland long-haul discount carrier WOW Air announced it would add cheap flights from four Midwestern U.S. cities starting next year.WOW's plans — to begin flying to Reykjavik from Cleveland, Cincinnati, St. Louis and Detroit next April and May for as little as $99.99 one way — mark the latest escalation in low-cost competition over the Atlantic with the U.S. network carriers.""We like the region. We think there's opportunity there. We think it's underserved,"" WOW Air CEO Skuli Mogensen told USA Today's Today in the Sky blog.Icelandair, another Iceland-based airline, on Tuesday said it will begin offering flights from Cleveland to Keflavik, Iceland in May.In addition to potentially offering U.S. customers a cheaper way to get to Iceland, the carriers' moves also offer travelers a cheaper entry point into Europe from the nation.Delta Air retreated 2.35% near midday in the stock market today, while American fell 2.9% and United 2.75%. Shares of all three carriers, who have banked on their own basic economy fare class to compete with discount rivals, have already cut through support at their 200-day lines.The collapsing support for airline stocks also follows a terrorist attack in Barcelona last week, in which a van drove through a crowd of people and killed more than a dozen people. ISIS claimed responsibility for that attack.JetBlue (JBLU) last week also said it would double the number of flights it was offering in Atlanta, with one-way fares on those routes starting at $64. The carrier said those flights would bring ""competition and low fares to nation's busiest airport"" — two things that tend to irritate Wall Street.JetBlue sank 2% intraday Wednesday.Airlines coasted into 2017 on hopes that higher fuel costs and travel demand would keep a lid on overexpansion and fare cuts and pull unit revenues higher. But Spirit Airlines (SAVE) dragged the sector lower last month after warned of more aggressive fare discounts in some of United's big hubs.Spirit Airlines fell 2.7% to its lowest levels since late 2015.RELATED:Airlines See Weaker Q3 As Competition Mounts On FaresDelta's Guidance: 'Good Enough' Falls Short Of 'Whisper Number'United's Aggressive Growth Plan Assumes This About Rivals

Knowing when to buy, and when to sell are just as import. IBD's CAN SLIM-based investment program tutors you through the start up stages, and provides an arsenal of powerful tools as you progress.In the U.S., insurers were among the early winners, with Dow issue Travelers (TRV) and Progressive (PRG) rising more than 2% as Hurricane Irma softened to tropical storm status. The storm pushed north into Georgia and the southern U.S. leaving more than 6 million Floridians without electricity and large portions of the state wind-strafed and waterlogged, but with much less damage than the severe scenarios for which the markets had braced on Friday.Airlines rebounded: American Airlines Group (AAL) jetted ahead 5%, while Delta Air Lines (DAL) and United Continental Holdings (UAL) bobbed more than 3% each.Cruise line operators also felt some relief trade, with Carnival Cruise (CCL) and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) — both based in Miami — up more than 3% at the end of the day.  Norwegian announced it was sending on of its cruise ships on a relief mission to St. Thomas, to pick up 2,000 tourists stranded the by the storm. It had another fully stocked ship standing by in the Gulf of Mexico, ready to deliver supplies to either Key West or Tampa after the storm passed, according to the Miami Herald.Automakers turned in the Monday's strongest move among industry groups, led by Tesla (TSLA) which snapped more than 5% higher to finish within 2% of a 370.10 buy point in a cup-with-handle base. Tesla had reportedly release a software update to Florida Tesla owners on Saturday, extending slightly the battery charge range of vehicles as an assist to those evacuating ahead of the storm.Apple (AAPL) of course made its splash for the day, thundering ahead 1.7% in rising trade ahead of its annual product release event, scheduled for Tuesday. Apple shares remain in a buy range, above a 156.75 buy point.On the IBD 50 list, Laser maker Coherent (COHR) led, rising nearly 5% in light trade and retaking support at its 50-day moving average. A five-week advance has lifted the stock 18% from an early August low, and up the right side of a two-month cup base.Universal Display (OLED), maker of organic light emitting diodes purportedly used in the new iPhone Apple is expected to introduce on Tuesday, roared ahead more than 3% in strong trade. The move retook a double-bottom base buy point at 127.87, and left the stock in a buy range.RELATED:Insurers Rally As Irma Damage is Limited: 2 RV Makers Hit BuysGoldman: Three Reasons Why The Telecom Merger Party Is On HoldThese Three Leading Stocks May Be Ready To Reward Savvy InvestorsThe Big Picture: Daily, In Depth Market Analysis

"
226,DAL,"Shares of Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) dropped on Monday after Delta cut its first-quarter outlook and President Trump signed his second attempt at a travel ban.The new travel restrictions affect six largely Muslim nations — Iran, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen — and take hold on March 16. The revised order excludes Iraq, a nation seen as crucial to the fight against ISIS, but blocks travel to the U.S. from the other six nations for 90 days.The order issued Monday said that Iraq presents a ""special case"" and that the nation's relationship with the U.S. and its ""commitment to combat ISIS justify different treatment for Iraq.""The new order also suspends the entry of any refugee for 120 days but does not bar Syrian refugees indefinitely, as the first order did. The order also doesn't bar dual citizens and green-card and visa holders.The administration said the restrictions — both in the new order and the initial one signed on Jan. 27 that has since been left for dead in the federal courts — were necessary for security reasons and would give the U.S. time to make sure its vetting procedures for incoming travelers were sufficient.""This executive order provides a needed pause, so we can carefully review how we scrutinize people coming here from these countries of concern,"" Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Monday in prepared remarks.The new ban comes the same day as a report from travel research firm ForwardKeys that showed international bookings to the U.S. fell 6.5% from Jan. 28 to Feb. 4, the days between when the first travel ban was implemented and then suspended by the Department of Homeland Security.Confusion ensued as agencies tried to figure out how to implement the first travel ban, and protesters flooded airports.The U.S. airlines have no direct flights to the seven countries affected, Cowen said in a note at the end of January, but said alliance partners could be affected.While Cowen said it expected ""minimal"" financial impact from the ban issued in January, the firm expressed concern about the broader impact such restrictions would have on tourism.Meanwhile, the day-to-day focus on airlines' margins, costs and attempts to balance supply and demand continued on Monday. In a conference presentation, Delta cut its first-quarter operating margin forecast to 10%-11% and its outlook for passenger unit revenue to roughly flat. In January, the carrier said it expected 11%-13% operating margin for Q1 and for passenger unit revenue to be flat to up 2%.The company cited higher fuel and labor costs, following the recovery in oil prices and new contracts with employees, as reasons for the weaker outlook.Delta also said first-quarter unit revenue, a key industry metric that measures revenue by way of overall flight capacity, was on pace to come in at the low end of its forecast ""given a more moderate pace of improvement in February than initially anticipated."" Delta reported flat passenger unit revenue for February.However, Delta said unit revenue should improve throughout the year on the back of strong postelection demand and better business-travel trends, among other things. The carrier also stuck with its expectations for first-quarter capacity — or an airline's supply of seats and flight coverage — to be flat to down 1%.Delta Air Lines fell 2.55% to 48.65 in the stock market today, tumbling through its 50-day moving average. American Air and United lost 3.2%. Southwest (LUV) retreated 2.2%. Alaska Air Group (ALK) descended 2.4%.Trump's Jan. 27 executive order, which was blocked last month by a U.S. appeals court, indefinitely barred Syrian refugees from coming into the U.S. and placed a roughly four-month ban on all refugees. The order also blocked for three months anyone coming from seven predominantly Muslim nations: Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Libya, Somalia and Sudan.IBD'S TAKE: While Trump's travel ban has raised concerns about travel demand, he has vowed to roll back regulations for the airline industry, lifting shares of U.S. carriers. He has met with airline executives and, on Friday, his administration halted some Obama-era consumer-protection measures. Bookings from the seven countries affected by the first travel ban plunged 80% over that time and fell 23% from the Middle East and Africa overall, the ForwardKeys report said.Demand recovered after the travel ban was suspended, the report showed, but weakened near the end of last month as the administration signaled it would issue a revised travel ban.RELATED:Airline Stocks Tumble On Fears Capacity May Creep Back UpBuffett's Berkshire Piles On Shares Of Apple, Airlines, Cuts Wal-MartCan Delta, United, American Declare Mission Accomplished In 2017?

Homebuilders rallied on the lower yields, while steel stocks climbed on bullish earnings forecasts.The Federal Reserve gave financial markets what they wanted, hiking rates a quarter-point, as expected, but stuck to its plan for two more hikes this year and three next year. Policymakers' recent hawkish signals had markets bracing for a quicker ramp-up. The news was great for homebuilders like Lennar (LEN) and Toll Brothers (TOL), since it means that mortgage rates may stabilize for a time after their recent run-up, helping boost the spring selling season. Financials like Bank of America (BAC) and Goldman Sachs (GS), which had been pushing higher on hopes for faster rate hikes that can help lift net interest margins, took a breather after the Fed news.RELATED:Chip giant Intel (INTC) announced a deal to buy Mobileye (MBLY), a maker of advanced driver assistance systems, for $15.3 billion.

But the airlines got a potential break after federal judges halted key provisions in President Trump's travel ban. In between, United raised its full-year capacity outlook. That gives travelers more options, but the expansion carries risks of overestimating demand and a competitive response from rival airlines. United last month said it would add service to 31 new destinations to serve areas that connect to its airport hubs.

The first leg of the uptrend began in last summer and lasted through…

231,DAL,"Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) CEO Warren Buffett told CNBC Monday what he likes about Apple (AAPL) and hinted that his company may not make anymore big purchases in Delta Air Lines (DAL), Southwest Airlines (LUV), United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL).Berkshire's Apple position is now at 133 million shares, more than twice the 61.24 million shares disclosed in Buffett's annual shareholder letter released Saturday.""We bought a lot more Apple after year-end,"" said Buffett in the interview, praising Apple for having a ""sticky"" product that is ""enormously useful"" to people who use it.Notably, Buffett himself isn't an iPhone user. When asked about his technology investments, he whipped out a flip phone from his coat pocket.Berkshire's latest purchase also didn't coincide with a drop in Apple's stock, which has shot up since 2017 began. Berkshire previously bought shares in Q3 and Q4, when Apple was hit by fears of slowing smartphone sales.But Buffett said the new shares were purchased before the company's earnings report, which sparked a 13% rally. ""It's at a price different than I would buy it now,"" Buffett said.Apple shares were up 0.2% at 136.93 in the stock market today. Berkshire Hathaway's B shares edged up 0.2% to 170.59, still in buy range after breaking out earlier this month.Buffett also told CNBC that his stakes in airlines are ""about the same,"" and suggested they wouldn't go up much higher. His purchases of airline stocks in Q3 and Q4, after years of avoiding the sector, sparked speculation that Berkshire might even buy and airline outright.But with positions of more than 7% in Delta, Southwest, United and American, Buffett said he generally prefers to not boost stakes above 10%, saying ""It complicates life for us.""Still, he sounded rather optimistic on the sector, joking that airlines had ""a bad first century.""""They're kind of like the Chicago Cubs. Everybody has a bad century now and then,"" he said. ""And they got that century out of the way, I hope.""Delta Air and Southwest shares fell fractionally while United and American edged higher.RELATED:As Berkshire Buys Apple, Which Stocks Make 'Warren Buffett Screen'?5 Key Points From Warren Buffett's Letter, Berkshire Hathaway Earnings
"
232,DAL,"Last year at this time, Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) CEO and billionaire investor Warren Buffett, in his annual letter to shareholders, lamented the ""negative drumbeat"" of the election season, which he said had soured Americans' views of the nation's future. He argued such pessimism was ""dead wrong,"" that babies being born today were ""the luckiest crop in history,"" that GDP per capita had exploded over the past 80-odd years and that ""America's economic magic remains alive and well.""That sentiment, clearly, did not prevail on Election Day. President Trump, whose campaign portrayed a nation infected by porous borders, globalism and rust-belt decay, won. Hillary Clinton, whom Buffett supported, lost.The election seems to be likely topic in Buffett's 2016 letter to shareholders, which is set to be released on Saturday. So does the tectonic shift in the stock market, which has kicked into higher gear on stronger consumer sentiment and a rush toward banks like Goldman Sachs (GS), one of Buffett's holdings, and infrastructure-related plays.Among the beneficiaries of Trump's vowed infrastructure improvements and deregulation are carriers like Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL) and Southwest (LUV), which Buffett plowed money into last year after long being allergic to the industry. Many will likely be watching for any color Buffett provides on the airlines in the letter as well as his recent investment in Apple (AAPL).Buffett's lengthy annual shareholder letters — part financial statement, part fireside chat, part fiscal-year Thanksgiving — often contain Buffett's take on the state of the economy and the nation. Buffett wasn't shy about defending his tax record after Trump, during the campaign, said the investor ""took a massive deduction."" With other CEOs offering their own two cents about Trump, Buffett's take might resonate a bit more widely with the investment community.If nothing else, with Trump pushing for a modernization of U.S. infrastructure and pressing companies on their commitment to the American worker, Buffett, like others, may have already inadvertently done some Trump-proofing of his own. ""When you hear talk about America's crumbling infrastructure, rest assured that they're not talking about Berkshire,"" Buffett said in his shareholder letter last year. ""We invested $16 billion in property, plant and equipment last year, a full 86% of it deployed in the United States.""Berkshire Hathaway this month disclosed a much bigger investment in Apple, which has been among the Dow's leaders this year on stronger iPhone sales and the prospects of the iPhone 7 Plus.The stock had lagged through much of last year, and Berkshire may have seen a bargain in the company. The letter could provide more insight into Buffett's decision to buy into the world's most valuable publicly traded company.Buffett also owns shares of Visa (V) and IBM (IBM), which have also helped push the Dow higher in 2017.Apple rose 0.1% in the stock market today, while Visa climbed 0.3% and IBM dipped 0.2%.In his shareholder letter for 2007, Buffett had this to say about airlines: ""The worst sort of business is one that grows rapidly, requires significant capital to engender the growth, then earns little or no money. Think airlines. Here, a durable competitive advantage has proven elusive since the days of the Wright brothers. Indeed, if a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favor by shooting Orville down.""Last year, though, Buffett made an enthusiastic re-entry into the airline business, nearly 30 years after an investment in US Airways. Buffett lost nearly all of that investment but later made money on it, CNBC said. Look for any detail on why Buffett has changed his mind on the stocks.Buffett likes investments in companies that have a moat, or high barriers that prevent lots of competitors from entering into a given industry. In recent years, analysts say, the airlines have come to resemble such a high-moat industry.Bloomberg reported that Buffett was encouraged to invest in the airlines after a presentation last year from American Airlines (AAL) CEO Doug Parker, who said then that consolidation into a handful of big carriers had disciplined the industry, which for years has been riddled with bankruptcies.IBD'S TAKE: Airlines began to shore up unit revenue, a key industry metric, in the fourth quarter. But capacity and margins are likely to be concerns this year. Delta fell 2 cents to 50.46 on Friday. American rose 0.4% and United 0.7%. Southwest climbed 2.2%.Buffett's new stakes in the airlines have led to speculation that he could eventually buy a carrier.Morgan Stanley said Southwest would make the most sense, given its ""domestic focus, robust and sustainable (free cash flow), range of growth opportunities, defensible cost structure, and more tenured management team"". The big global network carriers, the firm argued, ""have more complex operations"".Others believe Buffet could be a major factor in shaping 2017 for the airlines.""Every year there is a surprise in the industry,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note this week. ""Last year it was the management change at United Airlines. This year, we believe a surprise may be that a major airline gets acquired, potentially by Berkshire, or goes private on its own.""But are airlines really the best way for a billionaire to spend his or her money?""Airlines are labor intensive and capital intensive, so they don't make the best (leveraged buyout) candidates,"" Becker added, ""but stranger things have happened.""RELATED:Soros Goes For Facebook, Appaloosa Cuts Apple; Airlines PopularDelta, American, United Go Guns Blazing Into Battle Of The Atlantic

But along with the Dow industrials, they are still close to record highs. Leading stocks, outside of several China names, are generally struggling but few are breaking down. So the market direction remains at uptrend under pressure. That means you don't have to rush into cash. But you should be extremely cautious about making purchases, and extra quick to take profits and cut losses.Netflix (NFLX), Microsoft (MSFT) and Wal-Mart (WMT) all fell below buy points on Thursday. Apple (AAPL) remained just in a buy zone. Apple is now a notable stock for Warren Buffett and his Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB), which saw its airline holdings such as Delta Air Lines (DAL) and American Airlines (AAL) crashing through key support.S&P 500 futures rose a fractional vs. fair value. Dow futures were essentially unchanged. Nasdaq 100 futures advanced nearly 0.3%.In Asian trading, Japan's Nikkei fell 1.2%, hitting a three-month low. Hong Kong's Hang Seng shed 1.1% and the Shanghai composite was flat. In European trading intraday, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 fell 1%, Germany's Dax 0.4% and France's CAC 1.1%.IBD'S TAKE: If you want to understand the state of the market, pay attention to the major averages and leading stocks. Read IBD's Stock Market Today columns throughout the market day, and the end-of-day The Big Picture (take a free trial) for timely market analysis and highlighted growth stocks breaking out of proper bases. Netflix: Netflix fell 2.3% to 166.09 on Thursday, closing just below a 166.97 flat-base buy point cleared on July 18. While Netflix is not that far below the entry level and holding above its 50-day moving average, the stock has now erased a 15% gain. You don't want to see stocks with 10%+ gains turn into losers.Microsoft: Microsoft retook a 72.99 flat-base entry on Monday following a rebound from the 50-day line. But shares slid 1.7% to 72.40 on Thursday.Wal-Mart: Wal-Mart fell below 1.6% to 79.70 after the discount giant's weak guidance offset better-than-expected Q2 results. That pushed Wal-Mart below its 80.57 entry from a cup base, though shares closed almost at session highs.Apple: Apple retreated 1.9% to 157.86, bringing its 156.75 flat-base buy point in sight. Apple has been a market leader this month, but even top stocks struggle in choppy markets. Warren Buffett's Berkshire slightly added to its Apple holdings in the second quarter, after amassing a big stake from the spring of 2016 to early this year.Netflix, Microsoft, Wal-Mart and Apple all rose a fraction before the open in the stock market today.Airlines: Apple was a relative bright spot for Buffett next to airline stocks. American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines all fell below their 200-day moving averages, joining United Airlines, as they fell 3%-5%. Buffett bought sizable stakes in those four big airlines in 2016, ending his long-standing distaste for the industry. Berkshire slightly trimmed its airline holdings in Q2.JetBlue (JBLU) announced that it was doubling flights to Atlanta, Delta's big hub, raising capacity concerns. JetBlue tumbled through its 200-day line as well.IBD's Transportation-Airline group was the worst performer on Thursday out of the 197 industries that IBD follows.RELATED:The Big Picture: Bears Crank Up The Pain, But Gold ETF RisesStocks Take A Beating As Nasdaq, S&P 500 Give Up SupportNasdaq Adds 8th Distribution Day: May The Odds Always Be In Your FavorThese 5 Techs Are Near Buy Points In This Classic Bullish PatternStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksS&P 500, Nasdaq Break Support: Four Steps You Should Take Now

237,DAL,"On Tuesday, the major averages fell in above-average volume. But the S&P 500 index closed above its 50-day moving average. Leading groups generally held up well. And leading stocks, from Apple (AAPL) to Wal-Mart (WMT) to FANG stocks Facebook (FB) and Netflix (NFLX) to biotech breakouts such as Celgene (CELG) and Biogen (BIIB), acted normally or outperformed amid a negative session.XS&P 500 futures rose 0.1% above fair value early Wednesday morning. Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.15%. Dow futures advanced 0.1%.The S&P 500 index fell 0.8% in Tuesday's stock market trading. The Nasdaq composite retreated 0.9% and the Dow industrials 1.1%. With volume higher than Friday's, the market added a distribution day, which is not good. But it was the first distribution day since mid-August. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 index and the Dow industrials found support at their 50-day lines after undercutting that key level intraday. The Nasdaq composite, on the heels of its best week in 2017, held above its 50-day throughout Tuesday's session.Investors should pay close attention to the action of the major averages but also that of leading stocks. And leading stocks show some strength. Apple fell 1.2% to 162.08 on Tuesday, but that's still comfortably above a 156.75 flat base buy point. Apple iPhone chipmaker Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) peeked out past a buy point Tuesday morning. Skyworks pulled back, but still finished with a solid 1.3% gain.Wal-Mart rose 1.8% to 79.80, rebounding above its 50-day line as the discounter tries to retake an 80.57 cup-base buy point.Facebook dipped 0.8% after a 3.4% pop last week, still only about 2% off a buy point from its newly formed flat base. Netflix dipped 0.1%, holding above its 50-day in its own flat base.Biotechs Celgene, Biogen and CAR-T drug specialist Bluebird Bio (BLUE) ceded some ground Tuesday after all surged last week. But they closed above their buy points from last week's breakouts.Most top industry groups fell less than 1%, including video game publishers, homebuilders and biotechs. Among the higher-rated groups losing more than 1%, most were finance-related.Financials were big losers on Tuesday. Banks were hit by Treasury yields and yield spreads falling to pre-election levels. Property insurers fell as Hurricane Irma grew in strength with Florida in its sights. Airline stocks were hit by Irma and Delta Air (DAL) cutting forecasts for unit revenue and profit margins in the current third quarter.Tuesday's action was better than first impressions, while the market is in a confirmed uptrend. But as stocks grind higher with choppy action, it's difficult for investors to make much headway. A top stock may rally to a buy point and then clear it, but then quickly pull back below that entry, even though the general trend is positive. So investors should be cautious but act decisively when making purchases, taking profits and cutting losses.RELATED:The Big Picture: 2 Signs The Market Can BounceStocks Falter, But Here Are 3 Reasons Why Apple Is FineWhich FANG Stock Will Be The First To Break Out?Facebook, Boeing Lead These 5 Top Stocks Near Buys In This Bullish PatternU.S. Markets Back To Work; These 2 Top Stocks Are Racing Toward BuysStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

239,DAL,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) may be able to deliver better margins than rivals in part because it got a jump on offering a greater variety of airfares, one analyst believes.XThe carrier is ""far ahead"" of competitors like United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) in what the industry calls cabin segmentation — or the practice of offering a wider array of fare classes that offer varying degrees of amenities, according to Brandon Oglenski at Barclays, which initiated coverage of the stock Thursday with an overweight rating and a 70 price target.Delta has made its discount fare class, Basic Economy, available across the U.S. and Canada and has begun offering it internationally. United and American trail the carrier in their rollout of that fewer-frills fare.As airlines place greater value on fare variety — from those that offer greater privacy and lie-flat beds to fares that are cheaper but come with later boarding and other restrictions — Oglenski said segmentation should help bring better margins for Delta than others.""These forms of segmentation help Delta satisfy a wider customer base, fulfilling each customer's needs more precisely and allowing Delta to respond to increasing competition from both mainline peers and low-cost carriers,"" he wrote.Barclays' assessment comes as the industry banks on segmentation to stay competitive and as higher labor costs threaten to weigh on industry margins.It also follows what some analysts saw as disappointing third-quarter forecasts for unit revenue, an important industry metric, as well as Spirit Airlines' (SAVE) warning of more intense ticket discounting in some of United's hubs.Shares of Delta were down 0.5% on the stock market today amid a broad market retreat, while American fell 1.6% and United lost 2.1%.IBD'S TAKE: Basic economy could also help the network carriers compete internationally, as more low-cost, long-haul carriers take to the skies over the Atlantic. Oglenski also said Delta's co-branded card partnership with American Express (AXP) could also help the carrier deliver better margins.Delta said that partnership produced $70 million in ""incremental value"" in the second quarter and was set to bring $300 million for the year. The carrier said it was on track to break its record for card acquisitions this year. Perks for some of those cards include Sky Club access and priority boarding.Meanwhile, United last month said that its partnership with Chase was one area where it was ""currently underperforming"" Delta and American.""To be balanced, we could highlight management's recent decision to reduce long-term margin targets (from 17%-19% to 16%-18%) and the company's large pension liability as reasons to be less enthusiastic about (Delta) shares,"" Oglenski said in the note.""However,"" he wrote, ""given Delta's leadership position in a sector we view as affording investors deep value, we are hard pressed not to have a large representation of DAL shares in the portfolio.""RELATED:Airlines See Weaker Q3 As Competition Mounts On FaresIs Airline Service Actually Showing Signs Of Improvement?

241,DAL,"Qatar Airways has dropped its plans to buy a stake in American Airlines (AAL), media outlets reported, with the Middle Eastern carrier saying the investment ""no longer meets our objectives.""X""Qatar Airways has taken the decision not to proceed with its proposed passive financial investment in American Airlines,"" Qatar Airways said in a statement sent to USA Today.""Further review of the proposed financial investment, taking into account the latest public disclosure of American Airlines, has demonstrated that the investment no longer meets our objectives. Qatar Airways will continue to investigate alternative investment opportunities in the United States of America and elsewhere that do meet our objectives,"" the carrier said.It was unclear what in that disclosure dissuaded Qatar Airways. A request for comment was not immediately returned.""We respect Qatar Airways' decision not to proceed with its proposed investment in American Airlines,"" American Airlines spokesman Matt Miller said in a statement. ""This in no way changes the course for American.""American shares were down 1.2% at 50.45 in the stock market today, still above buy range but finding support at their 50-day average. Delta Air Lines (DAL) dipped 0.1%, and United Airlines (UAL) lost 0.6%.In a regulatory filing in June, American first said it had received notice from Qatar Airways that the Gulf carrier was interested making a ""significant investment"" in American Airlines' stock on the open market. The filing said Qatar wanted to buy shares worth at least $808 million and, eventually, around 10% of American.But American signaled resistance in that filing, saying it remained committed to ensuring ""fair competition with Gulf carriers,"" which American, Delta and United claim get an unfair competitive advantage because they receive government subsidies. The Gulf carriers have denied those claims.""American Airlines continues to believe that the president and his administration will stand up to foreign governments to end massive carrier subsidies that threaten the U.S. aviation industry and that threaten American jobs,"" American said in the filing.Since then, American CEO Doug Parker called the Middle Eastern carrier's interest ""puzzling and strange,"" and the carrier last month said it was ending its code-sharing agreements with Qatar Airways and another Gulf carrier, Etihad Airways.The disclosure from American came after many of Qatar's neighbors cut ties with the nation, citing Qatar's alleged backing of the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamist organizations said to be terrorist groups. Qatar's relationship with Iran — a nation often at odds with Saudi Arabia — has also been said to be a reason. Flights between Qatar and those nations were suspended.Qatar's potential investment in American was seen as a defensive move, Wolfe Research analyst Hunter Keay said in a research note in June.""We'd guess Qatar fears further isolation from the U.S. following punitive measures taken by its Gulf neighbors, coming in the form of a cancellation of Open Skies with the U.S.,"" he wrote.""Buying Boeing airplanes and owning a minority stake of AAL intertwines Qatar with U.S. interests a bit more, making it theoretically more difficult for U.S. regulators to impose trade restrictions, we guess,"" he added.But he also said an investment from Qatar Airways was unlikely to happen. He cited the potential churn in American's stock, resistance from airline staff facing the threat of lower-paying, nonunion jobs, and the ""minimal utility"" that Qatar's network offers to American.RELATED:American Airlines Calls Qatar Airways Offer 'Puzzling And Strange'Airlines See Weaker Q3 As Competition Mounts On Fares

GE shares inched up 0.2% to 30.35. Caterpillar shares climbed 1% to 99.02.In the past few years, the bank helped Boeing sell its 787 Dreamliners to India, Poland and Ethiopia, and GE sell its trains to Pakistan. Caterpillar also relies on the bank to sell its heavy equipment overseas.A Boeing spokesperson told Bloomberg that without the bank, U.S. firms are at a ""significant competitive disadvantage"" vs. rivals overseas like Airbus (EADSY).The bank only authorized $5 billion in financing in fiscal 2016, down from $20 billion in 2014. It was started 80 years ago in response to the Great Depression and helps facilitate foreign companies' efforts to buy U.S. goods.Boeing is the largest beneficiary, with 40% of all authorizations in 2014 going to the aerospace giant, according to George Mason University's Mercatus Center analysts, who were quoted in a Bloomberg story.Democrats are the bank's biggest supporters and President Obama wanted to expand its lending limit from $140 billion to $160 billion. Trump had initially been opposed to the Ex-Im Bank but Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg may have swayed Trump as the two have had several talks after Trump blasted the costs of Boeing's Air Force One contract.Trump's support of the bank would go against Republican members in Congress who believe the bank is crony capitalism set to favor big companies with their hands in politics.Delta Air Lines' (DAL) former CEO Richard Anderson was an outspoken opponent of the bank during his time at the airline, arguing that the Ex-Im Bank helped subsidize orders to wealthy Middle Eastern carriers like Dubai's Emirates with U.S. taxpayer dollars.Airbus ticked up less than 0.3% to 17.52.

"
249,DAL,"American Airlines (AAL) reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that topped forecasts, but it sees unit revenue growth slowing sharply in the third quarter, as fare discounts appear to escalate across the sector.XThe outlook follows unit-revenue forecasts from rivals such as Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL) and Southwest Airlines (LUV) that generally underwhelmed Wall Street, after postelection demand and a more conservative approach to expansion elevated investors' hopes for stronger, more sustained gains in the key metric — a gauge of how efficiently an airline manages its operations.Perhaps most notably, on Thursday, Spirit Airlines (SAVE) crashed nearly 18% after the low-fare, high-fee carrier cut its unit revenue forecast to a 2%-4% decline, after forecasting an increase earlier, amid steeper fare discounting in Chicago, Denver, Houston and Newark — big hubs for United.And as American's results effectively closed out earnings season for the airlines, analysts parsed out what the forecasts meant for the industry and the ultra-low-cost model of flying in general.American expects unit revenue, which measures revenue in relation to an airline's capacity, to rise 0.5%-2.5%, with that figure accelerating in the fourth quarter.However, Cowen analyst Helane Becker said the fourth-quarter forecast ""is a bit premature especially given what its peer group has said about discounting in the domestic market.""For the second quarter, total unit revenue rose 5.7%, with capacity up 1.4%.Earnings per share of $1.92, up 8.5%, topping estimates for $1.87. Revenue rose 7.2% to $11.11 billion, compared to estimates for $11.09 billion.Operating expenses climbed 11% on rising fuel and employee benefit costs. American's recently said it wants the pay of its pilots and flight attendants to equal that of rival carriers.Shares rose 1% to 50.49 in the stock market today, after falling intraday to 48.73, below their 50-day moving average. Delta Air Lines rose 0.5%, United Airlines sank 0.3% and Southwest Airlines fell 1 cent. All four carriers still suffered their second straight week of significant losses.Still, American cited ""strong passenger demand and improving yields,"" or an airline's pricing power on airfare, particularly in the U.S., Central American, South American and Caribbean markets. Co-branded credit card agreements that took hold last year also helped push revenue higher in the quarter.Those credit-card agreements, which have become more competitive for the industry, have become more of a focus during earnings calls. Delta, during its earnings call, said its partnership with American Express (AXP) could bring $300 million in value this year. United, which has a partnership with Chase, said that was ""one of the areas where we are currently underperforming"".Branded fares — or fares that package certain types of amenities together — and offering a more diverse array of seating classes have also become more important. American, like Delta and United, is moving ahead with plans to segment cabin space.American has expanded its Basic Economy class into 78 markets and expects to roll it out across the rest of its domestic network by the end of September. About half of American's customers are buying up to Main Cabin when given the option between that and Basic Economy.The airline said adoption of the new Premium Economy class has been strong too, and most widebody aircraft will be retrofitted with the class for international customers by the end of 2018.The big U.S. network carriers have introduced basic economy in an attempt to more effectively compete with budget carriers like Spirit. Cowen analyst Helane Becker also noted that United appeared to be pricing ""aggressively"" for the peak summer travel period, and that it was unclear how long the discounting would go on.Scott Kirby, a former executive at American who is now president at United, has also not shied away from competing against — or trash-talking — the low-cost carriers.Last week, he said Frontier Airlines' push into Denver, United's most profitable hub, risked sinking fares in the short term. But long-term, he said it was ""the best news that I've heard in the last ten years.""And he added that ""I have believed, for many years, that the ULCC business model can't work when a network carrier decides to compete on price, particularly once we've been able to roll out Basic Economy.""He argued that the move from Frontier amounted to a hub-and-spoke approach more akin to what the big U.S. network carriers do — a much more complex operation. And he indicated the move was a concession of sorts that Frontier's business model had run out of steam.Frontier advancing into Denver, he said, was ""a battle I guarantee United will win.""Spirit and Allegiant (ALGT) have said that Basic Economy were not pushing fares lower, Stifel analyst Joseph DeNardi said in a research note. While he characterized Thursday's sell-off in airline stocks as an overreaction, he said the discount carrier would be ""a battleground stock for the foreseeable future"".Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth said the plunge in Spirit's stock created an opportunity to move into the stock.""While elevated capacity (and likely resulting pricing pressure) is a concern for U.S. airlines in general, we believe SAVE's underperformance reflects concern that the ULCC model is broken,"" she wrote in a research note. ""We emphatically disagree and expect Spirit's self-help initiatives and low-cost model to drive sustainable superior margins along with faster growth.""Cowen's Becker, meanwhile, urged caution.""Investors might be tempted to try and catch a falling knife,"" she said, ""but we believe a wait-and-see approach is prudent.""RELATED:Delta's Guidance: 'Good Enough' Falls Short Of 'Whisper Number'United's Aggressive Growth Plan Assumes This About RivalsThree Reasons Why Southwest, Spirit Air Are Plunging

250,DAL,"Weak unit-revenue forecasts, higher costs, an epic dispute with pilots: all seemed to be helping steer shares of Southwest (LUV) and Spirit Airlines (SAVE) into a nosedive Thursday after the carriers reported second-quarter earnings.XThe stock slide came even as Southwest's results beat expectations on the top and bottom lines, while Spirit topped earnings-per-share views and matched estimates for sales.Here are the main takeaways.Ultra-low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines called its Q2 results ""disappointing,"" with an ongoing dispute with pilots causing more than 850 flight cancellations during the quarter. Those cancellations, the company said, likely cost it nearly a percentage point of unit revenue, or around $45 million. Unit revenue rose 5.7% in Q2.Spirit and its pilots' union have been locked in a dispute over pay increases. That dispute boiled over in May, with video purportedly showing security attempting to restrain angry Spirit passengers at an airport in Florida following scores of flight cancellations that the carrier said were being caused by pilots who weren't taking assignments.The carrier at that time accused the pilots of staging ""a pervasive illegal work slowdown"" in an attempt to strongarm management into agreeing to their terms. The union said it and Spirit's pilots were ""not engaged in a job action.""Meanwhile, Southwest's second-quarter adjusted operating expenses spiked 10.6%, driven higher in large part by wage hikes to pilots and flight attendants that took hold in Q4.Labor costs should continue to come under scrutiny as pay gets more competitive. In April, American Airlines (AAL), which reports Friday, said it wants the pay of its pilots and flight attendants to equal that of rival carriers.Spirit offered a weak outlook for third-quarter unit revenue due to what it characterized as heightened competition, Stifel analyst Joseph DeNardi said in brief research note.However, the panic might be a bit much, DeNardi said.""While our estimates will likely come down as a result of the lower guidance, our initial thoughts would be that the magnitude of the sell-off is an overreaction,"" DeNardi said.Spirit shares sank 18% to 40.07 in the stock market today, hitting their lowest levels since September. Southwest was down 5%, but had dropped by as much as 10% earlier. Still, shares are now below the buy zone and had touched sell territory. American lost 2.1%, Delta Air Lines (DAL) fell 2% and had also touched sell range, and United Airlines (UAL) fell 3.1%.Southwest on May 9 launched a new reservation system, an undertaking that the carrier said was its largest technology project ever.However, despite ""virtually flawless"" execution, CEO Garry Kelly noted that ""a new system is always challenging for the users."" And the carrier said the shift to the new system would hurt Q3 unit revenue, which it expects to rise 1%. That forecast included a roughly 1 percentage-point drag resulting from the new reservation system.The carrier's Q3 unit revenue forecast might be below investor expectations, Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth said in a research note.She wrote that ""forward guidance is likely to disappoint with 3Q17 EPS estimates likely needing to be lowered. Surprisingly, the reservation system cutover is having a ~1 ppt drag on (unit revenue) in 2Q/3Q17.""Southwest said it didn't expect ""a significant unfavorable impact"" from the changeover to the new system after Q3.For the second quarter, unit revenue rose 1.5%, at the midpoint of an earlier outlook. Those results included ""less than 1 point of temporary pressure"" due to the rollout of the reservation system.RELATED:United's Aggressive Growth Plan Assumes This About RivalsDelta's Guidance: 'Good Enough' Falls Short Of 'Whisper Number'

251,DAL,"United Airlines (UAL) management on Wednesday appeared to encourage patience on the company's longer-term plans, which assume rivals will lower fares too, but it was unclear whether its disappointing third-quarter unit-revenue forecast was just a one-off blip or something more.XUnited late Tuesday forecast third-quarter unit revenue to come in at a range of down 1% to up 1%, as rival airlines hoist the key industry metric higher.That comes as the carrier on Tuesday said it expects capacity growth of 4% in the third quarter and kept its full-year outlook at 2.5%-3.5% growth. Meanwhile, Delta Air Lines (DAL) has said it plans to cap capacity growth at 1% this year, and American Airlines (AAL) sees full-year capacity growth of roughly 1.5%.""The outlook is likely to exacerbate concerns that United's somewhat aggressive capacity growth plans are hurting results,"" Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth said in a research note sent before the company's earnings call.On Wednesday, United said summer-season competition and calendar quirks factored into its Q3 unit-revenue forecast. But management said it didn't yet have a clear picture into Q4, when year-over-year comparisons become more difficult while calendar shifts on some holidays and Southwest's (LUV) retirement of older planes could benefit United.United President Scott Kirby told analysts that the airline's growth initiatives will take some time to pay off.United this year has announced plans to expand the flights it offers to many smaller cities, and Kirby noted that those moves won't boost unit revenue immediately.He also said the carrier's bare-bones basic economy fares will become more of a financial benefit once its rivals, who are currently selling more seats at higher prices, adopt the cheaper fares more broadly.Delta in April said it had completed the expansion of basic economy to all of the U.S. and Canada. American in January said it hoped to have basic economy available across domestic flights over this year and early next year.Wall Street seemed to give the rest of the airline sector a pass, for now, punishing United's stock, which sank 5.9% to 74.24 on the stock market today, while Delta pared early losses to just 0.3%. American fell 1%. Southwest also rebounded and was down just 0.3%.United, in a slide presentation on Wednesday, also raised its full-year capital-expenditures forecast to a range of $4.6 billion to $4.8 billion to reflect technology upgrades, aircraft purchases and other items. But the carrier said it expected capex to fall around $1 billion next year.The company said Wednesday that a big part of its spending this year was going toward automation in warehouses, and said there was a ""big opportunity"" to bring more technology into the business, from application development to technology that aids in disaster recovery.Management also defended the oversight of its margins, saying it has worked to close the margin gap between it and its network rivals over the past several quarters.Barclays analyst Brandon Oglenski said in a research note before the call that United's unit revenue and margin outlook watered down the carrier's more aggressive long-term goals. And he said the carrier would likely lag rivals in margins.But he said ""profit opportunity still looms large"" and that United shares ""still represent deep value within a broader industrial universe of equal or lesser returning companies.""In that research note, titled ""2Q17, Touch of Grey,"" referencing the Grateful Dead song, Oglenski said ""United will get by, maybe just a bit longer than prior plans.""RELATED:Delta's Guidance: 'Good Enough' Falls Short Of 'Whisper Number'This Is Why Airline Stocks Have A Tailwind Today

252,DAL,"United Airlines (UAL) on Tuesday forecast third-quarter passenger unit revenue in a range that could dip into negative territory, even as rivals like Delta Air Lines (DAL) and American Airlines (AAL) rein in the key industry metric.United said it expected third-quarter passenger unit revenue, which measures sales from passengers in relation to an airline's overall capacity to fly them places, of down 1% to up 1%.XShares sank 3.6% after-hours, after finishing 1.6% lower at 78.51 in afternoon trading on the stock market today. The stock was drifting from an 83.14 buy point in a base-on-base pattern.United also said it expected third-quarter capacity to be up around 4%, compared to a 4.2% increase in the second quarter. United said it expects Q3 pretax margin at 12.5%-14.5%, compared to 13.2% for the second quarter.The carrier's second-quarter earnings per share of $2.75 rose 5%, beating estimates for $2.65. Revenue rose 6.4% to $10 billion, just past estimates for $9.964 billion.United's earnings conference call is Wednesday.Delta Air Lines (DAL) lost 1.5% late, but is still in buying territory. American Airlines (AAL) fell 0.8%. Southwest (LUV) was flat.Unit revenue, or an airline's sales in relation to its flight capacity, has improved across the industry amid a rise in postelection travel demand and airlines' attempts to restrain capacity growth.The statistic, industrywide, had fallen for some two years after the 2014 oil crash. The resulting cheap fuel at that time made it easier for airlines to expand without denting profits, but the more crowded skies and competitive ticket-price slashing ended up hurting unit revenue, to the irritation of Wall Street.United is also trying to recover from the backlash it suffered after a video surfaced online of security dragging a passenger from a packed flight in April.The incident led to a settlement and policy changes from the carrier, including a compensation of as high as $10,000 for giving up one's seat and the creation of a customer help team to assist in offering alternatives to help customers get to their destination in the event flights are overfilled.The carrier said that it had implemented ""the majority of the ten changes announced at the end of April"". United said that it cut its overbookings during the quarter, and saw an 88% decrease in involuntary denied boardings in June — the kind that got them in trouble in April.""From investing in our products and our people, redoubling our focus on the customer experience, closing the margin gap with our peers and delivering strong returns to our investors, we have made important progress and moved United decisively forward,"" CEO Oscar Munoz said in a statement.That statement continued: ""No single quarter constitutes a trend and we still have much further to go before we fully realize the potential of this airline and exceed the expectations of our customers.""Delta shares retreated on Thursday after the company reported Q2 earnings, a reaction analysts attributed to earnings per share that missed forecasts and lofty expectations for third-quarter unit revenue.Some analysts also said before United's earnings that they expect its third-quarter unit revenue to slow as the carrier heads into tougher year-over-year comparisons and faces more competition over the Pacific.United in recent weeks has pointed to an ""unfavorable supply and demand dynamics"" in China and Hong Kong. Airlines in Asia have been adding flights, and those in China have piled on service over the Pacific, a threat to carriers in the U.S. and in Korea.The International Air Transport Association last year said that the Asia-Pacific region was set to generate more than half of new passengers over the coming two decades, with China on track to become the world's biggest aviation market around 2024.The big U.S. network carriers have tried to get ahead of those trends, while Asian airlines have tried to protect the top and bottom lines.Delta has an alliance with China Eastern and recently formed a joint venture with Korean Air intended to create a ""leading intra-Asian network."" The carrier plans to add a hub in Beijing. Those moves are intended to make it less dependent on Tokyo and drive profitability, management said during its Q2 earnings call last week.American, meanwhile, agreed to invest $200 million in China Southern Airlines (ZNH).For the increasingly competitive Pacific market, Delta last week said that better business demand made up for weaker leisure demand. Same for the Atlantic, it said, where business demand helped offset weaker pricing on leisure travel.The earnings also come as the big airlines see a bigger financial future in adding new types of fares that bundle different levels of services. Delta last week said those so-called branded fares were expected to bring in an incremental $1 billion in revenue through 2019.RELATED:This Is Why Airline Stocks Have A Tailwind TodayAmerican Airlines Calls Qatar Airways Offer 'Puzzling And Strange'

253,DAL,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) on Thursday said that margins this year are on pace to land at the low end of its forecast, as higher fuel and labor costs dented second-quarter results.But the company said that the the worst of its cost pressures — outside of fuel —were likely behind it. For Q3, Delta sees operating margins of 18%-20%, with the midpoint above Q2's 18.4%. But full-year margins are now seen at the bottom of its 16%-18% outlook.XStifel analyst Joseph DeNardi said that Delta's forecast for a roughly 4% increase in unit costs ""is limiting the margin expansion that management had expected"" in the second half of the year.Management also sees a spike in capacity, which could weigh on unit revenue. For Q3, capacity is seen up about 2%, double the pace of the 1% cap that Delta has set for the full year and a sharp acceleration from Q2's 0.4% uptick.Still, Q3 passenger-unit revenue, a key industry measure of an airline's ticket sales as it relates to overall flight coverage, is seen up 2.5%-4.5%.""All-in, we view the report and guidance as good enough and an indication that revenue and demand trends continue to improve,"" Stifel's DeNardi said in a research note released before a conference call with analysts.But ""good enough"" did not appear to be good enough for Wall Street. Shares of Delta fell 1.8% to 54.50 in the stock market today, extended after breaking out last month from a 50.28 entry point in a flat base.Analysts apparently expected more from Delta's unit revenue guidance, or passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM).""The shares are weak today on what we view as near-term noise,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note released after the company's earnings call. ""Clearly the 'whisper number' for 3Q17 PRASM was higher than the company's expected 2.5% to 4.5% range.""American Airlines (AAL) rose 1 cent to 53.81. United Airlines (UAL), which reports results Tuesday, slid 0.45% to 80.17. United has been heading toward an 83.14 buy point. Southwest (LUV), lost 0.1% to 62.02, still beyond buy range.In Q2, Delta earnings per share rose 12% to $1.64, just missing views for $1.65. Revenue rose 3% — the first such increase in two years — to $10.79 billion, below estimates for $10.8 billion. Unit costs rose 7.3% in the second quarter.But as the industry continues to chop up its cabin spaces into different seating classes and break out costs for services, Delta's management spent a good part of its earnings call emphasizing that they were in the ""early stages"" of unlocking the value of an increasingly diverse array of fares.So-called ""branded fare"" initiatives, or fares that package different amenities together, drove nearly 40% of Delta's increase in passenger revenue during the second quarter, the company said.And the practice of dividing up the cabin to serve different types of customers willing to pay for different degrees of service — known in the industry as segmentation — would help improve results in the second half of the year, the company said.As the carrier bulks up on larger, newer aircraft, management said the opportunity to offer more profitable premium services would grow.In Q3, Delta will also enjoy easier year-ago comparisons. Last year, a fire at a power switch turned into a colossal technology outage for Delta, costing it some $100 million in sales and more than 2,000 canceled flights.Barring a repeat, analysts said, the carrier was set to enjoy the heightened demand — and, in turn, pricing power for airfare — that it saw in Q2 as it heads into the heart of summer travel season.""In 3Q17, Delta faces one of the easiest comparisons among the U.S. airlines,"" Becker wrote in a research note last week.She also said ""at least 50% of all tickets sold for July and August were sold before oil prices started to trend lower, so they were priced at higher levels.""RELATED:Airlines, Tech Stocks Hit After Top Court Largely Reinstates Travel BanAmerican Airlines Calls Qatar Airways Offer 'Puzzling And Strange'
"
254,DAL,"American Airlines (AAL) on Wednesday hiked its second-quarter forecast for unit revenue and adjusted pretax margin, propelled in part by stronger travel demand in the U.S. and Latin America.XThe more optimistic outlook follows a similar one last week from Delta Air Lines (DAL), which cited ""commercial initiatives and an improving revenue environment."" United Airlines (UAL) after the close on Tuesday also offered a solid Q2 unit-revenue forecast.Airline stocks were active on the news from American and United, along with the strong overall market. American rose 4.2% to 53.80 in the stock market today. Delta, which reports second-quarter earnings on Thursday, climbed 2.2% to 55.48.United, which reports Tuesday, jumped 4.7% to 80.53, moving back above its 50-day line. United is in a short flat base just above a prior consolidation. The potential buy point is 83.14.Southwest (LUV) rose 0.4% to 62.08. Southwest reported June traffic figures earlier this week as well, sticking with its Q2 unit revenue targets.Separately, Panama-based Copa Holdings (CPA) rose 3.4% to 129.12, breaking out of a cup base with a 125.87 buy point.American said it expected second quarter unit revenue, or airline revenue as it relates to its overall seating capacity and flight coverage, to increase roughly 5%-6%. That's an improvement from an earlier forecast of a 3.5%-5.5%.The carrier said the brighter picture for unit revenue was helped largely by higher passenger yields — a measure of an airline's ability to charge passengers more for tickets — particularly in the U.S., Central and South America, and the Caribbean regions.American also said it expects adjusted pretax margin to be 13%-14%, better than an earlier view for 12%-14%. Unit costs excluding fuel and other items were expected to rise roughly 7% during the second quarter, largely because of salary and benefit hikes given to pilots, flight attendants and other staff.For the month of June, American's passenger traffic rose 0.8%. Capacity rose 1.1% and load factor fell 0.2 percentage points to 84.7 %.Demand for air travel has generally improved since the U.S. election in November, helping to push unit revenue higher. The major network carriers have also found more ways to break out costs, offering both ""basic economy"" seating classes to compete with low-cost carriers and more lucrative premium fare options.Alaska Air Group (ALK), the carrier that bought Virgin America in December, said on Wednesday that it expected second-quarter passenger unit revenue to rise around 3.5%. That figure factored in ""historical results"" for the two carriers from last year's Q2, which took place before the acquisition closed.Shares gained 3.3% to 94.63.RELATED:American Airlines Calls Qatar Airways Offer 'Puzzling And Strange'Is Airline Service Actually Showing Signs Of Improvement?

Earlier, the carrier said it expected a unit revenue increase of 1%-3%.That outlook follows Delta Air Lines' (DAL) announcement last week that its unit revenue had risen around 2.5%, at the higher end of its forecast range. Southwest (LUV) on Monday stuck with its original guidance for a unit revenue increase of 1%-2%.Unit revenue, which measures an airline's revenue in relation to its flight capacity, has improved as travel demand picks up and after higher fuel prices encouraged moderation in airlines' plans to add flights.For the month of June, United said that passenger traffic rose 3.4%, while capacity rose 5%.Shares rose 1% after hours in the stock market today. United Air closed down 1.7% to 76.92, back below its 50-day line. United is in flat-base pattern with a potential 83.14 buy point. That's just above or next to a prior consolidation.Delta and American rose modestly late after falling 1% and 2%, respectively, during the regular session. Southwest Airlines retreated 2.1% on Tuesday.United's monthly operational figures come ahead of Delta's second-quarter earnings, set for release on Thursday.

257,DAL,"Here is your Investing Action Plan for Thursday: what you need to know as an investor for the coming day.X Delta Air Lines (DAL) kicks off the airline industry's second-quarter earnings season, while Dow stock Visa (V) and archrival Mastercard (MA) are nearing buy points, following breakouts by other payment stocks, including an Apple (AAPL)-fueled move by PayPal (PYPL).Credit-card giants Visa and Mastercard are close to breakouts, following PayPal's breakout Wednesday and a move by Square (SQ) on Tuesday.Visa climbed 0.8% to 96.18 on Wednesday, approaching a 96.70 buy point from a flat base. The stock retook its 50-day line on Friday after testing support at the key measure a few days earlier.Mastercard was also nearing breakout territory in a flat base with a 126.29 buy point. Shares rose 0.85% to 125.28.Visa reports earnings on July 20, with Mastercard on tap July 27.PayPal rose 3.3% to 56.55 Wednesday , breaking out of a flat base with a 55.24 buy point after Apple (AAPL) enabled users in some countries to buy things on iTunes, the App Store, Apple Music and elsewhere using their PayPal accounts. It's unclear how large the Apple deal is. But it's the latest example of a payments rival agreeing to work with PayPal. PayPal also has alliances with Visa and Mastercard.Payments technology company Square rose 3% to 26.21, at the edge of the 5% buy zone. Shares broke out on Tuesday, surging 6.3% and clearing a 25.07 flat-base buy point as an analyst speculated that PayPal should buy Square.A sturdy economy and increased travel since the election have lifted the airline industry this year, even if airline stocks have waxed and waned over that time as Wall Street parses carriers' expansion plans and trends in demand growth.But in recent weeks, Delta suggested second-quarter unit revenue — the industry measure of an airline's operating efficiency that tends to move stocks — was on track to come in at the high end of its forecast range. Last week, the carrier confirmed those expectations, saying Q2 unit revenue had increased around 2.5%, in the upper range of an earlier forecast for a 1%-3% bump.Wall Street expects Delta to report second-quarter earnings per share of $1.65, up 12%, with revenue up 4% to $10.82 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.The unit revenue increase, Delta said, marked the first year-over-year quarterly unit revenue gain since the fourth quarter of 2014. In the roughly two years that followed, cheaper fuel cleared more room for profits. That tempted the airlines to add flights and reduce fares in a grab for airspace, hurting unit revenue before an oil-price rebound prompted more restraint.Delta last week also said that ""commercial initiatives and an improving revenue environment"" helped to make up for a barrage of thunderstorms in the Atlanta area that caused scores of flight cancellations.Delta shares rose 2.2% to 55.48 on Wednesday, buoyed by strong traffic and guidance from United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL).

259,DAL,"A surprise reversal in big-cap techs and a stunning sell-off in transport-related shares shook investors on Thursday amid the typical crush of quarterly results.XThe Dow transports got slammed 3.1% lower.Meanwhile, Alphabet (GOOGL) had another poor session, falling 1.3% to 952.50 and losing ground for a third straight day. A breakout from a flawed six-week double-bottom base proved to be a fake-out as the operator of the Google search engine and YouTube video channel closed just one session above its 994.09 entry.Such poor action, combined with failed support at the 50-day moving average (drawn in red on an IBD daily chart), justifies the new shareholder with selling shares to cut losses short. The 8% golden sell rule, though, has not yet triggered.The double bottom featured two lows and a middle peak of 993.99, which was not far at all from its 52-week high. However, the crucial flaw came in the length of the base itself; a double bottom must be a minimum seven weeks long. That's why the base was more accurately treated as a flat base with a 1,008.71 buy point.The Nasdaq composite slipped more than 0.6% while the S&P 500 edged less than 0.1% lower. On the Nasdaq, losing stocks beat winners by a 2-to-1 ratio. On the NYSE, the ratio was nearly 4-to-3.The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 0.4%, despite seeing four of its 30 components lose 1 point or more. Among those four, Apple (AAPL) made its sharpest sell-off in weeks, dropping as much as 4% intraday and undercutting its 50-day moving average. The iPhone giant managed, however, to close above the key medium-term support line.Despite Apple's decline, the stock remains in base-building mode with a potential new entry point at 156.75. Apple is also still up more than 27% since its Jan. 6-9 breakout from an early-stage cup-with-handle base, which marked the end of a long bottoming base pattern.Volume grew on both main exchanges, according to early data, signifying Thursday as a distribution day, or a session of unusually intense selling.Spirit Airlines (SAVE) plunged 18% to 40.05 in massive volume. The deep-discount no-frills airline operator from South Florida issued an early sell signal when the stock fell 7% below a recent cup-with-handle entry at 59.64.In other words, after Spirit's breakout on May 2-3 in low turnover, the stock quickly turned tail and fell 7% below the 59.64 proper entry to 55.46.Cutting losses short in all stocks is the key to preserving capital and maximizing gains in your biggest winners.American Airlines (AAL), Delta Air Lines (DAL) and United Continental (UAL) all fell in sympathy after Spirit showed a 3% bump-up in second-quarter profit to $1.14 a share, snapping a three-quarter slump in profit and edging the consensus view. Revenue rose 20% to $701.7 million.Among the four airline stocks, only American Air is currently finding buying support near the crucial 50-day moving average.In the transport sector, logistics, shipping and trucking companies joined the airlines in falling 3% or more. Railroad, hospital, specialty enterprise software, education, fiber optical gear, chipmaking and semiconductor equipment stocks also were among 22 groups among 197 tracked by IBD that dropped 2% or more.IBD's TAKE: Amid a long bull run, knowing defense-type sell signals can help you make a timely entry out of the leaders and retain most of your precious, hard-earned capital gains. One example is spotting a severe breach of the 50-day moving average, as noted in this Investor's Corner column.In other financial markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury bond rebounded to 2.31%, while WTI crude oil futures rallied 0.6% to $49.15 a barrel, the highest level since May 30 and a fourth straight up day. Gold futures have risen to $1,265 a troy ounce, the highest since June 14 on the Comex.RELATED:Investor's Corner: What Is The Golden Rule Of Selling?Is The Market Uptrend Still Healthy?

260,DAL,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) on Wednesday said second-quarter passenger unit revenue would come in at the high end of its outlook, adding that ""an improving revenue environment"" helped cushion the blow that the carrier took in April after severe thunderstorms over the Atlanta area forced thousands of flight cancellations.The carrier said passenger unit revenue, a key industry measure that gauges an airline's sales as they relate to its flight capacity, had risen roughly 2.5% during the quarter. Earlier, the company forecast a 1%-3% increase in passenger unit revenue.Delta in recent weeks has said that unit revenue was headed toward the upper end of its expectations, citing better conditions in business travel.The company said it expected a Q2 operating margin of 18%-19%.

262,DAL,"The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 index hit new highs as techs continued to reassert market leadership. Netflix (NFLX), Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Microsoft (MSFT) all hit record highs. Netflix soared on subscriber gains while Amazon will sell Kenmore appliances from Sears (SHLD), sending the latter sharply higher but hitting several retailers, including the Dow's Home Depot (HD). The Dow Jones industrial average also was hit by General Electric and banks, though blue-chip Visa (V) and American Express (AXP) continued the good news for payment stocks.XThe Nasdaq composite rose 1.2%, hitting record highs during the week, rising 10 straight sessions through Thursday. Netflix and other FANG stocks, such as Facebook and Amazon, contributed. The S&P 500 index climbed 0.5%, also hitting fresh highs during the week. Dow industrials fell 0.3%, weighed down by Goldman Sachs (GS), General Electric (GE) and Home Depot.Internet television network Netflix added 5.2 million net new subscribers in the June quarter vs. Wall Street's consensus estimate of 3.22 million. It also guided higher for the current quarter, with a forecast of 4.4 million net new subscribers, topping the consensus view for 3.97 million. Bulls pointed to its strong subscriber growth, while bears voiced caution about its ballooning video-content obligations, including original TV series like ""Stranger Things"" and ""Glow."" Netflix ended Q2 with 103.95 million subscribers worldwide, including 51.92 million in the U.S. and 52.03 million in foreign markets. Netflix's international streaming subscribers topped those in the U.S. for the first time in Q2.Netflix skyrocketed 17% to record highs for the week.Sears will sell Alexa-enabled Kenmore appliances via Amazon, sending its shares soaring on Thursday but the gave up most of that gains on Friday. But Whirlpool (WHR) and major sellers of appliances Home Depot, Lowe's (LOW) and Best Buy (BBY) were hit. Home improvement chains Home Depot and Lowe's had been seen as Amazon-proof, or at least Amazon-resistant. Best Buy, which has bounced back in recent years from Amazon's initial onslaught, was hurt earlier this month on news that Amazon is creating a Geek Squad rival.Amazon appears to be getting more government attention as its size and scope grow, with an FTC probe and antitrust rumblings.Software giant Microsoft earned 98 cents excluding items for the June fiscal fourth quarter, up 42% year over year and well above views for 71 cents. Revenue rose 9% to $24.7 billion after forecasts for $24.27 billion. Microsoft credited demand for cloud-computing services like Azure and Office 365 as well as its acquisition of LinkedIn. But the Dow component gave cautious guidance for the current quarter. Shares dipped Friday but remain in buy range.RELATED:Microsoft Crushes Earnings Estimates; Stock Dips On OutlookGeneral Electric fell 2.9% on Friday after saying full-year EPS is trending to the low end of its $1.60-$1.70 target, citing oil and gas weakness. GE reported smaller earnings and revenue declines for Q2, though some analysts cited some weakness below the headline figures. Fellow industrial conglomerate Honeywell International (HON) also beat on top and bottom lines, but guided full-year estimates slightly higher. Honeywell shares rose Friday, retaking a buy point.RELATED:General Electric Stock Dives On Earnings OutlookAmerican Express beat on the top and bottom lines, though provisions for losses jumped 26% due to loan-portfolio growth and a rise in the rate for lending write-offs. Visa earnings also topped, with strong cross-border travel – helped by the stronger dollar – and global payment volumes driving results, according to Mizuho analyst Thomas McCrohan. The company also hiked its full-year revenue growth outlook above views. Visa and American Express, both Dow components, rose 2.8% and 0.4%, respectively, with both still in buy range.TD Ameritrade (AMTD) stock broke out from a long consolidation on July 18 as the online broker beat on both the top and bottom lines, even as industry trading fees for stocks and ETFs have plunged this year. Charles Schwab (SCHW) that day matched views, with shares falling below a 42.71 buy point that they had cleared in late June. E-Trade (ETFC) shares gapped up to make a new 52-week high on Friday after the company scored an overall beat Thursday. Shares are now out of buy range.Chip-gear maker ASML (ASML) and wireless-communications chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) were the first major semiconductor industry players to report June-quarter earnings this year. ASML rose to record highs after posting better-than-expected sales and earnings during the second quarter.

Apple (AAPL) chip-supplier Skyworks (SWKS) reported better-than-expected fiscal Q3 sales and earnings and guided higher for the current period.Drug giants Novartis (NVS) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) reported better-than-expected earnings Tuesday. Dow component J&J reported adjusted income of $1.83 a share, topping views by 4 cents. But sales of $18.84 billion were light. Novartis' $1.22 a share, excluding various items on $12.24 billion in sales, topped analyst views.Both drug stocks rose during the week, but were both still in buy range as of Friday's close.Goldman Sachs' fixed-income trade revenue plunged 40% in Q2, the second straight quarter that the trading-heavy bank said it misread the market. Weaker trading and net-interest income also hurt Bank of America (BAC), though Fed rate hikes have helped the bank and it said it expected net-interest income to rise in Q3. Morgan Stanley (MS) reported that trading revenue fell, but less so than rivals. JPMorgan (JPM) and Citigroup (C) have also signaled caution amid slow loan growth and longer-term bond yields, which can indicate flagging confidence over the chances for long-term economic gains. Morgan Stanley cleared a buy point while Goldman undercut its 50-day and 200-day moving averages.Check Point Software (CHKP) reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings on Thursday, but gave weak guidance for the current Q3. Check Point tumbled 7.2% that day, falling below its 50-day moving average. Check Point on Wednesday briefly topped a buy point but closed below that trigger. So did four other cybersecurity stocks that day. Those stocks, along with Proofpoint (PFPT), retreated modestly on Check Point's warning.United Airlines (UAL) on Tuesday offered a disappointing third-quarter unit-revenue forecast as airline competition picks up heading further into the summer, sending its shares plunging 10.4%. Delta Air Lines (DAL) and American Airlines (AAL), which have remained bullish on the key metric, fell significantly as well. United said it could take at least several months out for plans — like expanded service to different parts of the U.S. and the rollout of cheaper ""basic economy"" fares — to pay off.The No. 1 U.S. health insurer's earnings per share rose 25.5%, topping forecasts. Revenue grew 8% to $50.05 billion, roughly in line, though it was the smallest gain in nine quarters.  UnitedHealth (UNH) has exited the ObamaCare exchanges, though it's a big player in Medicare and Medicaid coverage. The Optum services unit saw a 9.9% revenue rise. UnitedHealth now sees adjusted full-year profit of $9.75-$9.90 a share. Analysts had expected $9.81 before Q2's results.UnitedHealth rose 2.6%, with Republicans' health care struggles also influencing shares of insurers and hospitals.RELATED: UnitedHealth Raises Full-Year Target After Q2 Earnings Jump 25.5%Top U.S. rail companies topped quarterly forecasts, but CSX (CSX) said crude oil train shipments have fallen to zero and hinted that returns to shareholders may be more cautious.

264,DAL,"George Soros took stakes in Facebook (FB) and Dow component Goldman Sachs (GS) in the fourth quarter, while Appaloosa cut its stake in Apple (AAPL), and both followed Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BKRB) in appearing to find a bargain in airlines. Here's a look at how some big investors managed their portfolios in the last quarter of last year.Soros Fund Management bought 353,686 shares in Facebook and bulked up its stake in Alphabet (GOOGL) by nearly 60% to 20,200 shares, according to a regulatory filing out late Tuesday. Soros also increased his T-Mobile (TMUS) stake to 685,700 shares.Soros bought 62,100 shares in Goldman Sachs. Dan Loeb's Third Point last week disclosed that it had scooped up shares of Goldman, Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM).Bank stocks have risen on greater expectations of lighter regulations, higher interest rates and greater volatility, which Goldman's trading desk could benefit from in particular.Soros also took a 40,000-share stake in Delta Air Lines (DAL), but dropped United Airlines (UAL).Shares of Apple ended regular trading up 0.4% to 135.51 on the stock market today, after hitting a record high yesterday. Facebook fell 0.3% to 133.44, while Goldman Sachs rose 0.4% to 250.54. Delta climbed 2.6% to 51.17, American rose 2.1% to 47.54, and United gained 2.7% to 75.75.IBD'S TAKE: Even as big investors flocked to the airlines last year, Cowen analysts last month said shares of airlines could be ""due for a break"" after taking off in Q4. Meanwhile, Soros dropped Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Herbalife (HLF), Harley Davidson (HOG), PepsiCo (PEP) and JCPenney (JCP). He also dissolved his stake in Nordstrom (JWN)Soros also offloaded his position in consumer-care products giant Procter & Gamble (PG), which got a lift Tuesday after activist investor Trian took a more than $3 billion stake in the company.Hedge fund Appaloosa Management increased its stake in Facebook by 47% to 2.2 million shares. The fund also upped its holdings in Qualcomm (QCOM) and more than doubled its stake in Southwest (LUV). Appaloosa also took a 160,000-share stake in United Airlines.The fund loaded up on the health sector, taking new stakes in companies like Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Centene (CNC), McKesson (MCK) and Pfizer (PFE). It also took a new stake in JCPenney.Appaloosa cut its position in Apple by 350,000 shares, slashed its stake in Yahoo (YHOO) and rid itself of Bank of America and General Motors (GM).Along with boosting its stake in Apple, David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital dissolved its stake in Take-Two Interactive (TTWO), U.S. Steel (X) and Michael Kors (KORS).Like Buffett, Greenlight also took a stake in Monsanto (MON).But the moves by Soros and Appaloosa into airlines are notable in that they could signal other big investors are following Buffett, who announced Q3 stakes in the sector last year.Buffett, after years of avoiding the airlines, has come around to the industry. Airlines last year showed more signs of discipline, and the wave of consolidation over the past several years has kept the major airlines relatively insulated from new competition.""When we launched on the sector late last year, we found most investors generally in agreement that airlines represented deep value,"" Barclays analyst Brandon Oglenski wrote in a research note dated Tuesday.""The biggest question remains: when will the market and, more importantly, large long-term investors begin to care? We think tonight's Berkshire Hathaway 13F will go a long way to attract sector interest.""RELATED:Airline Stocks Tumble On Fears Capacity May Creep Back UpDelta, American, United Go Guns Blazing Into Battle Of The AtlanticJPMorgan Sets Fresh High, Goldman Hits Highest Since 2007 On Yellen

265,DAL,"Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) vastly increased its stake in Apple (AAPL) in the fourth quarter while slashing its positions in Wal-Mart (WMT) and Verizon (VZ), according to a regulatory filing on Tuesday.Berkshire boosted its stake in the iPhone maker to 57.4 million shares, up from 15.2 million in the prior quarter. Hedge-fund manager David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital also increased its stake in Apple by 11% to more than 5.8 million shares.After long steering clear of the industry, Buffett also continued to load up on shares of airlines, adding 23.8 million to his American Airlines (AAL) stake, 53.7 million to Delta Air Lines (DAL) and 24.4 million to United Airlines (UAL) as well as taking a new, 43.2 million-share stake in Southwest Airlines (LUV).He cut all but 928 shares worth of his stake in Verizon, and cut his stake in Wal-Mart from about 15 million shares to around 1.4 million shares.Apple is the top performing stock on the Dow Jones industrial average in 2017. Verizon is the Dow's worst performer in 2017 and over the last six months. Wal-Mart is the second worst-performer on the Dow in the past six months.Apple edged up 0.2% late, after setting a new all-time high in the stock market today. Shares dipped in Q4 but jumped early this month as strong iPhone sales last quarter eased some concerns about waning demand. American climbed 2.3% after hours, United rose 1.7%, Delta gained 1.9% and Southwest added 1.5%. Verizon dipped 0.2%, and Wal-Mart lost 0.1%. Berkshire's B shares were up 0.1% late, after closing up 0.7% at 166.95, near a buy point of 167.35.Berkshire also took a new, 8 million-share stake in agricultural giant Monsanto (MON), which is being bought by Bayer, and a new 167 million-share stake in Sirius XM (SIRI). Sirius jumped 3% after the bell, while Monsanto added 0.9%.Buffett dissolved his stake in Deere (DE), which has struggled as the impact of low crop prices filters through to farmers' spending on equipment.Meanwhile, Procter & Gamble (PG) climbed 2.9% on news that activist investor Trian had taken a stake of more than $3 billion in the consumer-care products giant. Procter & Gamble has been a middling Dow performer in 2017 as the company slashes costs and focuses on core brands.RELATED:What Will Berkshire Filing Show As Loeb Cuts Facebook, Apple Stakes?Apple, Nike, Visa Among Dow's Top 5 Gainers So Far This Year

266,DAL,"Billionaire investor Warren Buffett praised ""ambitious"" immigrants' contribution to the ""miraculous"" American story, rejected claims that stock buybacks are ""un-American"" and ripped Wall Street investment fees in his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) shareholders on Saturday. Meanwhile, Berkshire reported declining operating profit but big unrealized gains in last year's investments in Apple (AAPL), American Airlines (AAL) and other carriers paying off.The typically optimistic Buffett said that stocks are ""virtually certain"" to rise in years to come. And he hailed America, with an implicit rebuke of anti-immigrant sentiment.""One word sums up our country's achievements: miraculous. From a standing start 240 years ago ' a span of time less than triple my days on earth ' Americans have combined human ingenuity, a market system, a tide of talented and ambitious immigrants, and the rule of law to deliver abundance beyond any dreams of our forefathers.""As the subject of repurchases has come to a boil, some people have come close to calling them un-American ' characterizing them as corporate misdeeds that divert funds needed for productive endeavors. That simply isn't the case: Both American corporations and private investors are today awash in funds looking to be sensibly deployed. I'm not aware of any enticing project that in recent years has died for lack of capital. (Call us if you have a candidate.)He pointed out that many companies that Berkshire invests in, including Bank of America (BAC), have been buying back shares. ""We very much like this behavior because we believe the repurchased shares have in most cases been underpriced. ... When a company grows and outstanding shares shrink, good things happen for shareholders.""Buffett said that wealthy Americans have been suckered out of more than $100 billion over the past decade seeking ""superior investment advice.""""When trillions of dollars are managed by Wall Streeters charging high fees, it will usually be the managers who reap outsized profits, not the clients,"" he wrote. ""Both large and small investors should stick with low-cost index funds.""But Buffett had nothing but praise for Vanguard founder Jack Bogle, who popularized ultra-low fee index funds.""If a statue is ever erected to honor the person who has done the most for American investors, the hands-down choice should be Jack Bogle,"" Buffett wrote.Buffett didn't offer hints about his possible M&A plan and was mum about Kraft Heinz (KHC), which made a short-lived $143 merger bid for Unilever (UN) this month. Berkshire Hathaway and Brazil's 3G Capital own about 50% of Kraft Heinz.Net income rose 15% to $6.29 billion, boosted by a $1.1 billion gain from investments and derivatives. But operating profit fell 6% to $2,665 per Class A share, below analyst forecasts for $2716.60.Berkshire's equity portfolio was worth $122 billion at year-end vs. $102.5 billion on Sept. 30. Big holdings such as Wells Fargo (WFC) and American Express (AXP) were big year-end winners as financials rallied.Buffett also boosted its stakes in Apple, Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines, United Airlines (UAL) and Southwest Airlines (LUV).Berkshire acquired 61.2 million shares for $6.75 billion at an average prices of 110.17. That stake has risen by $1.6 billion as of Friday's close at 136.66. Berkshire holds a 44% gain in its Southwest stake, 35% in United and 21% in Delta Air.RELATED:What Would Warren Buffett Do?

267,DAL,"Executives from Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL), JetBlue (JBLU), Southwest (LUV) and others met with President Trump at the White House on Thursday.As the meeting began, Trump said he would work to cut ""burdensome regulations"" in their industry and said the current air-traffic control system is obsolete. The president also said he would have an announcement related to taxes in the next few weeks.Gulf-carrier competition, which for years has been a major sore point for the U.S. network carriers, was not discussed, apparently, despite widespread expectations it would be high on Thursday's agenda.When asked by CNBC after the meeting if the subject came up, Southwest CEO Gary Kelly said the focus of the meeting was ""solely"" on taxes, regulations and the need for infrastructure investments.However, Trump did allude to looming competition from abroad during introductory remarks at the meeting.""I know you're under pressure from a lot of foreign elements and foreign carriers — I've been hearing that a little bit,"" he said. ""At the same time, we want to make life good for them also. They come with big investments. In many cases, those investments are made by their governments.""Trump's executive order suspending immigration and refugees from seven largely Muslim nations deemed a security risk was not on the agenda, Bloomberg said. Airline stocks sank after that order was signed, on Jan. 27, amid concerns that it would hurt travel demand. Late Thursday, a U.S. appeals court upheld a lower court's suspension of the ban.Executives from Alaska Air Group (ALK), FedEx (FDX) and UPS (UPS) were also set to attend, Bloomberg said. American Airlines' (AAL) CEO, Doug Parker, did not attend due to an already-scheduled management conference taking place.Delta shares were up 2.6% on the stock market today, while American rose 2.75% and United advanced 1.8%. JetBlue added 3.5%, Southwest rose 3% and Alaska Air rallied 1.3%.IBD'S TAKE: Norwegian Air International is an Irish subsidiary of Norwegian Air Shuttle, whose low-cost trans-Atlantic flights already pose more competition to Delta, American and United. The big three are trying a variety of cheap and expensive seats to compete. Following the meeting, statements from the airlines also notably left out any mention of the Gulf carriers.JetBlue: ""Today we had an extremely encouraging conversation with the president about modernizing our air traffic control system to reduce frustrating flight delays and further improve aviation safety. Everyone agreed we need an infrastructure plan that will once again give the American public an aviation system we can be proud of.""United: ""We share the President's passion for the tremendous opportunity this country has and his commitment to protecting and creating American jobs. We look forward to working together with the President on the many initiatives and issues that will make America better and the U.S. aviation industry the best in the world. This includes modernizing our aviation infrastructure and cutting the red tape that gets in the way of our industry's ability to deliver the best experience for our employees and customers.""Delta: ""We had a positive discussion about many of the major issues facing U.S. travelers, airline employees and the aviation industry, which is a vital economic engine for America.""The big three U.S. airlines have repeatedly complained that three Persian Gulf-region carriers — Qatar Airways, Emirates and Etihad — benefit from government subsidies that give them more room to expand and compete in the U.S. The Gulf carriers, in turn, have repeatedly denied that claim.The subsidies, the U.S. airlines say, violate the Open Skies agreements that facilitate cross-border service.""If left unchecked we will continue to see the Gulf carriers expand in the U.S. market, causing further harm to hard working Americans,"" CEOs from Delta, American and United said in a letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. ""In fact, for every long-haul route lost or foregone as a result of subsidized Gulf carrier competition, more than 1,500 American jobs are lost.""But a battle could be heating up over those agreements. CEOs of JetBlue, Hawaiian Holdings' (HA) Hawaiian Airlines, FedEx Express and Atlas Air (AAWW), in a letter dated Tuesday, urged Tillerson to reject the big three's demands to clamp down U.S. access to the Gulf carriers. Their letter, which expressed support for maintaining global Open Skies arrangements, said those demands ""would jeopardize Open Skies and reduce competition in an already overly concentrated U.S. airline market.""U.S. carriers also argue that Norwegian Air International's recently approved service to the U.S. would allow the carrier to dodge labor and safety rules, Bloomberg said.Trump also said he wanted travelers ""to have the greatest customer service with an absolute minimum of delays, and with the greatest convenience all at the lowest possible cost.""Those remarks follow the bruising that airline stocks took for much of last year and 2015 after airlines dropped fare prices in some markets to lure passengers. That competition damaged unit revenue, an important industry metric that gauges how much money an airline makes compared to its supply of seats and flights.Meanwhile, American Airlines said earlier Thursday that passenger traffic for January fell 0.3%, while carrying capacity rose 1.2%. American backed its first-quarter forecast for a 2.5%-4.5% increase in unit revenue and adjusted pretax margin of 3%-5%.RELATED:Delta Air Lines Sees Market Share Pressure Over AtlanticJetBlue Trims Capacity, Delta Upgraded, Ryanair Warns On EuropeAlaska Air Beats Q4 Forecasts; Trump, Carriers To MeetAirline Stocks Tumble On Fears Capacity May Creep Back Up

268,DAL,"Alaska Air Group (ALK) on Wednesday topped fourth-quarter estimates and hiked its dividend, reporting for the first time since completing its acquisition of Virgin America.Estimates: Adjusted earnings per share down 4% to $1.40, with overall revenue up 5% to $1.444 billion. The West-Coast-centric carrier, in an investor update last month, said it expected unit revenue to be roughly flat from a year ago.Nonfuel unit costs were also expected to be roughly flat, potentially making the carrier unique in an industry facing higher expenses after striking new agreements with staff, Cowen & Co. noted.Results: Adjusted EPS, excluding costs related to its mid-December Virgin American takeover, rose to $1.56. Revenue climbed 11% to $1.52 billion. Q4 traffic swelled 13% on a 10.3% capacity increase, including Virgin. Unit revenue rose 0.3% but passenger unit revenue fell 0.9%. Operating costs excluding fuel and special item edged up 0.1%.Alaska Air also raised its quarterly dividend to 30 cents from 27.5 cents.Outlook: Q1 non-fuel unit costs to remain flat when factoring in earlier financials from Virgin America.Stock: Shares jumped more than 4% early to new highs but pared gains by the afternoon, closing up 3.3% at 97.19 on the stock market today. Southwest (LUV) fell 0.2%, JetBlue (JBLU) rose 2.3% and Spirit Airlines (SAVE) fell 2.55%.Late Wednesday, United Airlines (UAL) said January traffic rose 4% as capacity climbed 4.7%, though the carrier attributed 3 percentage points of capacity growth to year-ago weather disruptions.It still sees Q1 passenger unit revenue to range from a 1% dip to a 1% increase.IBD'S TAKE: Along with Gulf carriers, Delta, American and United are facing a growing threat over the Atlantic from low-cost, long-haul carriers.On Thursday, President Trump is set to meet with airline CEOs, although it was unclear who would attend. American Airlines (AAL) CEO Doug Parker won't attend due to the company's annual leadership conference.U.S. airlines, especially global carriers Delta Air Lines (DAL), American and United, have urged the government to take a tougher stance against Gulf rivals. U.S.-based airlines allege that those Gulf carriers have had an easier time competing in America because they receive subsidies from their governments.The Gulf carriers have denied that claim. The U.S. carriers say the practice of competing on their government's dime runs afoul of Open Skies agreements, which facilitate cross-border flights.Delta closed down 0.1% while American dipped 0.2% and United Airlines rose 0.6%.RELATED:Delta Air Lines Sees Market Share Pressure Over AtlanticAirline Stocks Tumble On Fears Capacity May Creep Back UpJetBlue Trims Capacity, Delta Upgraded, Ryanair Warns On Europe

269,DAL,"JetBlue (JBLU) on Monday trimmed its 2017 capacity guidance, while Delta Air Lines (DAL) and American Airlines (AAL) were upgraded on hopes of stronger demand, tighter operations and fewer regulations under the Trump administration.JetBlue now expects its full-year carrying capacity to grow 5.5%-7.5%, a 1-percentage-point cut from prior guidance given just a few weeks ago. But the move, Cowen analysts noted, wasn't a total surprise, as management during last month's fourth-quarter earnings call left open the possibility for leaner capacity.JetBlue also said it expects nonfuel unit costs to rise 1.5%-3.5% in 2017, up from its previous forecast for 1%-3% growth.Investors shrugged off the news. Shares closed flat at 19.50 on the stock market today. JetBlue tanked at the end of last month after the carrier said it expected a sharp drop in unit revenue for January, with Winter Storm Jonas last year and calendar shifts weighing on the metric, Cowen noted last month. The investment firm added that ""significant competitive capacity growth in Florida"" could cut deeper into the airline's margins.Unit revenue tallies revenue in relation to capacity. JetBlue said the metric was likely to improve in February, but March seems likely to be affected by the timing of the Easter holiday, which takes place in April, Cowen said.Meanwhile, Bernstein upgraded Delta to outperform and American to market perform, saying higher fuel and staff costs will help temper airlines' competitive urges, which can weigh on unit revenue and earnings.Bernstein analyst David Vernon cited Delta's ""continued progress in implementing new revenue management strategies"" and potential growth of branded fares, or fares that offer different degrees of amenities. He also said the carrier was among the ""least levered to oil price changes.""For American, Vernon said ""we do not see a negative catalyst in the short term and believe that favorable revenue trends in the medium term can begin to make the 2018 cost opportunity more tangible ... .""Shares of American and others fell hard last month after American hinted that it could re-accelerate its expansion plans following fears that airlines had already overestimated passenger demand through much of 2015 and last year.Delta finished 0.9% higher at 48.26 Monday, while American climbed 2.5% to 45.30. United Airlines (UAL) edged up 0.6% to 73.50. Bernstein also hiked its price targets on the three airlines.Analysts in recent days have expressed concern about the ways President Trump's immigration restrictions, issued last month through executive order, could affect travel demand.A federal judge in Seattle on Friday temporarily halted the order's ban on entry of refugees and people from seven predominantly Muslim nations. An appeals court is weighing the government's emergency request for a stay of that judge's order.Bernstein said it was conscious ""of border issues complicating international or domestic travel but hopeful that the industry can manage through these challenges.""The order caused interagency disarray and protests at airports.""The U.S. airlines have no direct exposure to the banned countries, (but) alliance partners could be impacted,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note last month. ""We expect there to be limited financial impact in the short term on the U.S. airlines. Long term we are more concerned about how the U.S. is perceived as a tourist destination.""IBD'S TAKE: The big three U.S. carriers faced questions about international travel demand even before Trump's immigration restrictions. New long-haul, low-cost carriers have taken to the Atlantic to give Delta, American and United a run for their money. Elsewhere internationally, Irish discount carrier Ryanair (RYAAY) expressed caution about airfare prices as Europe's economy limps along.""We are cautious into the balance of the year,"" CFO Neil Sorahan told Bloomberg. ""Any other shocks to the market, be it air traffic control strikes or terrorism, if we were to see any major events than clearly all bets would be off.""RELATED:Delta Air Lines Sees Market Share Pressure Over Atlantic

"
272,DAL,"The skies above the Atlantic Ocean appear to be the next front in the insurgency against higher airfares.Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) for years lorded over much of the trans-Atlantic market and have signaled they will mount a fierce defense. But even before President Trump's immigration restrictions last month threatened to hurt demand, the big three U.S. network carriers were facing a challenge in international travel.New fuel-efficient, narrow-body jets from the likes of Airbus (EADSY) have made it more feasible for other carriers to offer low-cost, long-haul flights. And Boeing (BA), which is scrambling to regain market share lost to Airbus in recent years, is developing similar aircraft, providing more options for expansionary carriers.All of this means competition will rise on the Atlantic, fares will sink, and the number of available flights will remain high — just as the industry rehabilitates from a cutthroat, two-year grab for airspace in the U.S.""It's still a very profitable entity for U.S. airlines, and I think it'll continue to be,"" Stifel analyst Joseph DeNardi said of the trans-Atlantic market. ""It'll probably just become less profitable.""The big three control about a third of the flights in the lucrative market, and DeNardi estimates Delta, American and United generate 10%-15% of their revenue from trans-Atlantic flights. But other airlines, especially European ones, could turn more toward the Atlantic as competition on the Continent from discounters and Gulf carriers chews up profits.Irish budget carrier Ryanair (RYAAY) has floated the possibility of eventually flying across the Atlantic. Air France-KLM last year said it planned to launch a discount airline that could fly to the U.S. The parent company of British Airways could soon also offer low-cost flights to the U.S. All these airlines would join Lufthansa, which already operates the low-cost carrier Eurowings.They must contend with challengers like Norwegian Air Shuttle, which boasts $69 one-way fares from New York to London, and can fly you from New York to Oslo and back for $350 this month. Iceland's WOW Air offers a round-trip flight from Boston to Berlin for less than $400.Now even a U.S. airline, JetBlue (JBLU), is considering flights to Europe. It should decide later this year as it starts to take delivery of Airbus A321s.While low-cost operations get more difficult the farther planes have to fly, jets like the A321 are more fuel-efficient and have fewer seats to fill, allowing for tighter operations overall and easier access to more parts of the world.""JetBlue ... doesn't have to become a widebody operator to serve Europe,"" said Seth Kaplan, managing partner at Airline Weekly.A long-range variant of the A321 will fly up to 4,000 nautical miles, which Airbus calls the longest range of any single-aisle jetliner. With that kind of reach, it could serve cities like Philadelphia and Milan, which require longer distances than the typical New York-to-London route that spans about 3,500 nautical miles.""It is ideally suited to trans-Atlantic routes and enables airlines to tap into new long-haul markets that were not previously accessible with current single-aisle aircraft,"" Airbus says on its website.Meanwhile, Boeing plans a new midsize plane that can travel up to 5,000 nautical miles, industry officials told CNN last month.U.S. airlines aren't completely at odds with European carriers. They get a share of revenue from European counterparts via alliances like SkyTeam, Oneworld and Star Alliance as well as joint venture agreements.But analysts say U.S. carriers prefer that the big European airlines do well in Europe so that their partnerships stay healthy — and so their European peers don't try their luck over the Atlantic.In the new Battle of the Atlantic, the big three are taking a hard line.""We are sensitive to anyone that's a competitive threat issue for us, and we will be aggressive about competing with all of them,"" said United President Scott Kirby last month, responding to an analyst's question about partner Air Canada's plans to add trans-Atlantic capacity. He declined to talk specifically about the Canadian carrier.During its call with analysts in January, American's management acknowledged pressure from low-cost carriers in the market. The airline is shrinking trans-Atlantic capacity during Q1 but plans to increase it again in Q3, when summer travel makes flights more lucrative.""We don't intend to cede our position across the Atlantic to anybody,"" said Chief Marketing Officer Andrew Nocella.To compete with low-cost rivals, the big three U.S. airlines are banking on more cabin ""segmentation"" — or dividing up a plane's seats into more classes of service, from no-frills ""basic economy"" to higher-end offerings.Delta offers a basic economy class and has said it wants to make it available across its network by 2018. United and American will offer basic economy in the U.S. this year. It's unclear whether they will offer the service on international flights, but the three tend to match one another's competitive moves.American's Nocella suggested the airline's segmentation would indeed go international as it strategizes with joint venture partners like British Airways. He called it American's plan to compete.""So we feel bullish about that. It's definitely going to be a really tough competitive environment, particularly I think over the next year, year and a half as we see these capacity inflows,"" Nocella said. ""But our position is good. London Heathrow is the best hub in Europe, and we feel good about it.""If nothing else, segmentation and the availability of basic economy help the network carriers better adapt to the changing tastes of passengers. At the same time, the strategy potentially robs discount carriers of the very thing that makes them unique and turns passengers on to fares that include more amenities, analysts say.""The one-size-fits-all product never made a lot of sense,"" Kaplan said. ""It was a legacy of pre-deregulation, of pre-1978, when airlines couldn't control their pricing and could only compete on service, and they had to compete for who had the least bad meal.""With basic economy's affordability — at least on U.S. flights — come some predictable annoyances. Although they sit in the main cabin, like other economy travelers, passengers can't pick their own seats. They face other restrictions on refunds, upgrades and what bags they can bring aboard, and they aren't guaranteed a seat next to the passengers they're traveling with.Once they're in the seat, though, the in-flight experience is similar to anything else in the main cabin. Snacks, drinks, Wi-Fi, entertainment: all largely still there.For the airlines, basic economy's advantage lies in its flexibility, analysts say. It's a type of fare, not a type of physical seat separate from others in the cabin. Thus, carriers can adjust more easily to demand and competition, as opposed to creating their own low-cost airline.Meanwhile, the airline-within-an-airline model that European carriers are employing runs the risk of cannibalizing the parent airline and making labor costs difficult to manage.Segmentation isn't just for cost-conscious travelers. It gives carriers more ways to attract passengers to pricier fares that offer better convenience and comfort, such as options like United's Polaris and Delta's Premium Select, which offer more room to recline or lie-flat seats. Even with standard economy fares, passengers can get a complimentary glass of wine on international flights.Last month, Delta President Glen Hauenstein said on a conference call that the airline might have trouble retaining market share over the Atlantic as low-cost carriers proliferate. But he said the company will try to ""preserve and accelerate"" margins and compete through higher-end cabin offerings like Premium Select.""If you think of retailing, you go to the car dealership because they had an ad that said you could get the Mustang you wanted,"" said Bob Mann, a former airline executive and current president of the R.W. Mann & Co. consultancy. ""You get there, you decide, well, you don't really want the V-6, because you're kind of a V-8 guy.""Low-cost carriers have taken note. Even Norwegian has a premium cabin, and WOW just announced a more upscale ""Big Seats"" product.But the bigger airlines offer more flights, which gives them room to accommodate passengers if a flight gets canceled or a passenger's schedule changes, Mann says. Low-cost rivals sometimes only offer one flight a day or less to a given destination.Delta, American and United are also more well-known than the smaller low-cost carriers, so brand recognition is another advantage. Plus, on a long-haul flight, little amenities and comforts tend to matter more.""The same thing that people will tolerate for two hours won't necessarily do it for eight,"" Kaplan said.

273,DAL,"Delta Air Lines' (DAL) passenger unit revenue for January fell 2.5%, the carrier said Thursday, while a slight uptick in carrying capacity outpaced an even slighter uptick in passenger traffic.Delta said the slide in unit revenue, or revenue in relation to an airline's supply of seats and the scope of its flight coverage, was in line with its prior expectations, attributing it to calendar shifts and comparisons from a year ago, when Winter Storm Jonas kept planes on the ground.Last month, Delta said that February and March would likely produce better unit revenue than in January and predicted overall Q1 unit revenue would be would be flat to up 2%, up from Q4's 2.7% decline.Passenger traffic for January rose 0.4%. Capacity rose 0.6%. Load factor dipped to 81.2% from 81.3%.Shares of Delta edged up 0.25% to 47.38 on the stock market today. American Airlines (AAL) dipped 0.1%, and United Airlines (UAL) added 0.9%. Southwest (LUV) ticked 0.25% higher, while JetBlue (JBLU) fell 1 cent.IBD'S TAKE: Even as airline shares reeled this week on concerns about the travel ban and more capacity, Cowen analysts said the sector's stocks were likely to take a breather regardless.At the end of last year, airlines were enjoying some much more positive investor sentiment after easing two-year-long concerns that they were adding too many flights and cutting fares as cheap oil made it less expensive, and more tempting, to grab market share.Investors were also hopeful that President Trump would offer a lighter hand on regulations and be more aggressive about infrastructure improvement — both of which would benefit airlines.However, last Friday, fresh concerns surfaced that airlines' capacity could creep up again. Then, concerns that Trump's travel ban could hurt demand roiled airline stocks on Monday and Tuesday.RELATED:United Q4 Beats, But Q1 Costs To Surge; CSX Q4 Mixed

Fed Chair Janet Yellen's somewhat hawkish tone didn't worry investors, but gave bond yields and bank stocks a boost.""Waiting too long to remove accommodation would be unwise,"" Fed chief Janet Yellen told Congress, a shift from her 2016 tone emphasizing downside risks to the economy. Yellen, along with other Fed officials speaking during the week, raised the odds of a near-term hike slightly. Markets don't expect a March move but see a 50-50 move by May and a strong likelihood by June.  Yellen warned against repealing financial regulations passed after the credit crisis.Meanwhile, retail sales and inflation data were stronger than expected, while small-business optimism hit a fresh 12-year high and the Philly Fed manufacturing index shot up to its strongest reading since 1984.RELATED:Worries over intensified wireless competition pressured phone company stocks after Verizon Communications (VZ) reintroduced unlimited data plans nearly six years after removing them.

Sprint cut its unlimited price to $50 a month or $90 for two users, including HD video. AT&T (T) opened unlimited wireless beyond DirecTV and U-verse customers.

278,DAL,"Shares of Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL) and other carriers as well as hotels, cruise operators, booking sites and even tech giants like Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) were hit after the Supreme Court allowed a limited version of President Trump's travel ban to take effect.The top court will review the ban when it reconvenes in October. Meanwhile, justices said the ban wouldn't affect citizens from Libya, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen ""who have a credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States,"" such as family members or students enrolled in American schools.The last time the ban was enforced, it made significant impacts on international air bookings, even though it was in effect for only a few days.Between Jan. 28, when Trump signed the ban, and Feb. 4, when Homeland Security suspended the ban, international bookings to the U.S. fell 6.5%, according to travel analysis firm ForwardKeys.

Delta Air Lines and Southwest also pared gains and were up 1% and 0.8%, respectively. United Airlines reversed lower to dip 0.2%.American received a notice from the Persian Gulf carrier ""indicating Qatar Airways' intention to make a significant investment in American Airlines"" of at least $808 million through the open market, according to a regulatory filing.The disclosure also stated that Qatar Airways' CEO had approached the head of American and the two have had a conversation about the intended purchase.Acquiring 4.75% or more of American Airlines' outstanding stock requires advance approval from the board, but the company said it has not received a request.

283,DAL,"Shares of Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL), United Airlines (UAL) fell Monday, in what appeared to be the latest fallout from President Trump's executive order temporarily closing off the nation to refugees and others from seven largely Muslim nations.Even as protesters flooded airports across the country over the weekend, some analysts began questioning the ways the ban could inconvenience the many international travelers who regularly fly to the U.S., potentially discouraging travel.""President Trump's Executive Order on Jan. 27 may hurt travel demand by making the visa application process more cumbersome, although the magnitude of the actual impact is unclear,"" Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth said in a research note.The order places an indefinite ban on refugees from Syria and a roughly four-month ban on all refugees. It also bars for around three months anyone from Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Libya, Somalia and Sudan.IBD'S TAKE: President Trump's immigration orders triggered airline turbulence. Here's why Trump's moves may derail the stock market rally, and his tax and infrastructure plans.The move also, Syth noted, suspends the Visa Interview Waiver Program, which allows some travelers from outside the U.S. to renew a visa without holding an in-person interview with a U.S. Consular officer.""Not only does this make it more cumbersome to obtain a U.S. visa, it sets up the possibility of retaliatory actions on U.S. travelers from these countries,"" Syth said. ""However, it is unclear how many current applicants are able to take advantage of the interview waiver and how many may be discouraged from traveling to the U.S. as a result.""Delta shares fell 4.1% in the stock market today, while American lost 4.4% and United 3.6%. All three global carriers tumbled below their 50-day moving averages.Southwest (LUV) and JetBlue (JBLU), which have fewer international flights, fell 0.7% and 1.5%, respectively.Trump on Saturday defended the executive order, saying it was ""not a Muslim ban"" and was ""working out very nicely. You see it at the airports, you see it all over.""But protests, and confusion over the order itself, escalated through Sunday.

Those systems were ""restored a few hours later"" and all systems resumed normal operations shortly after midnight on Monday, Delta said.Later Monday morning, the carrier said the outage caused takeoff delays and about 170 flight cancellations on Sunday and roughly 110 on Monday, with more possible.Syth said Delta was the least exposed to any fallout from the interview waiver program's suspension. American was the most exposed, she said, followed by United.The stock slide comes after airline shares fell Friday as American Air hinted that it could start expanding capacity again after appearing show to more restraint in recent months.Investors spent much of 2015 and last year hoping airlines would try to align their overall carrying capacity with passenger demand.

284,DAL,"American Airlines' (AAL) hint that it may increase domestic capacity sent stocks in the industry tumbling Friday, just as signs began appearing that airlines have finally ended a two-year glut in flights and seats that have weighed on earnings.In a research note, Stifel analyst Joseph DeNardi attributed the stock sell-off to ""commentary from management that it 'wouldn't be shocked if we slightly toned down international and add a little bit to domestic (capacity).'""He added: ""Following similar creep from Southwest yesterday, the messaging to investors is pretty poor (i.e. domestic RASM has finally turned positive - now let's start adding capacity). While we appreciate that perspective and understand it's based on reality given how 2015 played out, we'd be surprised if airlines make the same mistake again.""Early Friday, shares of American briefly rose to 50 on the stock market today, exactly matching a buy point from a handle in a short cup base. But the stock then quickly reversed lower, closing down 5.3% to 46.95 and finishing below its 50-day line for the first time in four months.Delta Air Lines (DAL) lost 2.4%, closing at its 50-day. United Airlines (UAL) fell 1.3%, and Southwest (LUV) lost 2.3% after soaring 9% Thursday to a record high. JetBlue (JBLU) sank 6.9% and Spirit Airlines (SAVE) tumbled 4.8%, diving below its 50-day.American's capacity comment overshadowed a generally positive Q4 report, which showed unit revenue turned positive for the first time in two years, beating its rivals to that much-anticipated milestone. The carrier also approved a $2 billion buyback.Earnings per share dropped 54% to 92 cents, in line with analysts' view, while revenue increased 2% to $9.79 billion, above forecasts for $9.74 billion.Traffic slipped 1.3%, capacity edged up 0.4%, and unit revenue rose 1.3%. Earlier this month, the carrier said it expected total unit revenue to be flat to up 2%.""Our product investments are showing up in our unit revenue performance,"" said Chairman and CEO Doug Parker in a statement, referring to Delta's Basic Economy and Premium Economy classes. ""We had the largest improvement in unit revenue among our competitors and as we look forward, we continue to see strong demand for air service, and improving yields.""Unit cost climbed 5.7%. Operating expenses grew 5.4% as salaries and benefits expense jumped 17.4% on new labor agreements.
"
285,DAL,"American also sees Q1 unit revenue up 2.5%-4.5%. Unit costs, excluding fuel and special items, are expected to jump about 9% in Q1, which will be the peak as maintenance and fleet crew pay hikes won't be lapped until the middle of Q3. Capacity is seen growing roughly 1% for 2017.The results come as most airlines improve unit revenue — which measures revenue as it relates to seat-and-flight capacity and is seen as a gauge of an airline's efficiency — aided by rising postelection travel demand and capacity cuts.IBD'S TAKE: Higher fuel prices can help airlines operate more conservatively and pass costs onto consumers, annoying passengers but helping financials. But rising fuel costs, along with pay-raises or other deals struck with staff, are also likely to keep margins thinner this year. Margins could become more of a focus as the year progresses. Delta this month said higher fuel and labor costs would pull at margins for the first half of this year, peaking in the current quarter. United also forecast higher costs.Southwest offered a strong unit-revenue forecast for the first quarter. But JetBlue forecast a January unit-revenue decline of 8%-9% due in part to Winter Storm Jonas.

Meanwhile, the ISM manufacturing index for June rose to the best in years while the ISM nonmanufacturing gauge showed still-strong expansion.For the second straight week, U.S. investors paid more attention to the European Central Bank than to the Federal Reserve. Both central banks released minutes from their June meetings.Economists interpreted the Fed minutes as indicating a bit more uncertainty about whether inflation will rebound and, thus, about the Fed's rate trajectory. Still, absent a surprise, the Fed seems likely to announce in September that it will gradually scale back its $4.5 trillion balance sheet, inflated with Treasury and mortgage bonds purchased in response to the financial crisis.The ECB's policy signals have been jarring because they represent a pretty dramatic, if gradual, potential change from the central bank's long-running asset-purchase program.ECB President Mario Draghi indicated last week that the eurozone monetary authority could begin scaling back its asset buys, which economists now expect to happen by early 2018. The ECB minutes from the June 7-8 meeting revealed that policymakers discussed dropping language from future meeting statements saying that they're prepared to reverse course and increases asset purchases if conditions demand.Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that the closely watched Model 3 has passed all regulatory inspections, signaling that production will start Friday and announcing a ""handover party"" on July 28 for the first 30 customers.

292,DAL,"The Transportation Department reported this week that customer complaints against airlines jumped 70% in April, when United Airlines (UAL) passenger David Dao was dragged from a flight and Delta Air Lines (DAL) canceled thousands of flights due to Atlanta storms.Also this week, a recent survey by the research company Clutch showed 53% of consumers said they were ""less likely to continue purchasing tickets from United.""But amid this moment of anti-airline populism, is there a case to be made that service has been improving?The day-to-day consumer frustration with airlines, often documented via smartphone, has eclipsed the industry's progress in airline service over the years, some industry watchers say.""On one hand, yeah, maybe the industry's less competitive,"" said Seth Kaplan, managing partner of Airline Weekly. ""But on the other hand, because the airlines are doing so well, they actually have the luxury to do some of these things that make people happy that they couldn't have done back when they were scratching and clawing for every penny.""A decade ago, he said, when the industry was plagued by bankruptcy, airlines were far more focused on savings. And around five years ago, the availability of free food, beer, wine and entertainment wasn't nearly as great as it is today, he said.While airlines have gotten away with bag fees, airlines' attempts to tack on costs or squeeze in savings elsewhere in years past — Kaplan recalls US Airways' move to charge for all drinks and United's attempts to charge for meals on some trans-Atlantic flights — have backfired and caused airlines to change course.""The idea that there's this inexorable race to the bottom in terms of customer service — I don't know that that's necessarily the case,"" he said.The latest example of a course correction is American Airlines' (AAL) decision this week to back off plans to constrain seating space on the carrier's new Boeing (BA) 737 Max jets, bucking an industry trend toward cramped cabins in the name of profit.Under plans disclosed last month, American would have cut seat space to 29 inches from 31 inches in three rows of those jets; the room on seats in the rest of the cabin would've shrunk to 30 inches from 31.""It is clear that today, airline customers feel increasingly frustrated by their experiences and less valued when they fly,"" the carrier said in an internal message, according to a CNN report on Tuesday. ""We can be leaders in helping to turn around that perception, and that includes reviewing decisions that have significant impact on the flying experience.""CEO Doug Parker, in a CNBC interview on Thursday, said that even as other airlines offer even less room for passengers, the decision to opt for more space in seats was the right one.""In this environment, we got a lot of pushback on that,"" he said. ""I can argue why that was the right decision. ... I sat in it, it felt like even something at 6-3 I could sit in. So all those things made sense. But in this world, it didn't make sense.""Other analysts don't buy the idea that airline consolidation has decreased competition. Stifel analyst Joseph DeNardi, in a research note last month, said that looking at the number of airlines going head-to-head per flight route was a better way of looking at competition than tracking average airfares.""What is clear is that the share of (capacity) being flown by multiple airlines has steadily increased in recent years while the number of 'monopoly' ASMs has steadily declined,"" he said in that note.What's more, Kaplan argues, the airline industry tends to draw more scrutiny, at least publicly, because of the nature of the business — a bunch of people packed together in a tube. Many people, he said, aren't happy with their cable company, but their anger is often confined to their homes.""There's no David Dao equivalent in the cable industry,"" he said.RELATED:This Kind Of Airline Competition Is Hitting Buffett's Portfolio

Widebody A330 and A350 jetliners saw 30 net bookings, down 46% from the year-ago period.While the vast majority of passenger jets sold are single-aisle planes, widebody or twin-aisle aircraft carry bigger margins for Airbus and Boeing as they typically fly lucrative long-haul international routes.

301,DAL,"What telecom stock would gain the most from a Sprint (S) merger with T-Mobile U.S. (TMUS)?That would be Verizon Communications (VZ), says Morgan Stanley's longtime industry analyst, Simon Flannery. He draws an analogy with consolidation in the U.S. airline industry.""We would expect Verizon's stock to benefit from any agreed merger between T-Mobile and Sprint, primarily on the hope that the industry could become more rational,"" said Flannery in a report. ""One only needs to look at the airline industry to see the benefit of consolidation, United Airlines (UAL) is up 71% in the past 12 months, American (AAL) is up 61% and Delta (DAL)is up 38%. The hope for investors would be that the pricing environment would improve, and carriers could return to monetizing data growth.""The industry's ""wireless war"" has taken a toll on Dow component Verizon stock. It's down 15% in 2017. Verizon still offers a high dividend, though, like AT&T (T). Verizon shares were up 0.8% Monday to 45.75. AT&T added 0.5% to 38.15. Meanwhile, T-Mobile dipped 0.4% to 63.15 and Sprint notched a 0.5% loss to 8.01.AT&T and Verizon reintroduced unlimited data plans in the first calendar quarter of this year to combat market-share gains by T-Mobile and Sprint.Sprint on June 13 launched an unlimited-data family plan targeting primarily Verizon's postpaid customers.In the first quarter, AT&T bled 348,000 postpaid phone customers while Verizon lost 289,000.

307,DAL,"Boeing (BA) still sees strong demand for its 777X despite concerns over widebody sales and prohibited travel measures out of the Middle East.Global demand for aircraft has shifted toward narrowbody jets like Boeing's 737, with Gulf carriers driving the bulk of demand for larger planes. But lower government revenue from depressed oil prices along with travel and electronic restrictions from Middle East countries could dampen passenger traffic. Also, U.S. carriers have been vocal opponents of Gulf carriers expanding routes to the U.S.X Shares of the Dow Jones industrial average stalwart fell 0.2% to 187.56 on the stock market today, falling as low as 184.53 and briefly undercutting a 185.81 buy point. Rival Airbus' (EADSY) U.S.-listed shares climbed 2.9% to 21.15, hitting a new record high.But Boeing's CEO Dennis Muilenburg isn't too concerned about carriers in the region.""In the Middle East we are still seeing double-digit passenger growth rates,"" Muilenburg said at the Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference Thursday. ""We  have a fair amount of 777X orders coming from Middle Eastern carriers.""The bulk of 777X orders come from the Middle East. Qatar Airways and Etihad are launch customers for the 777X, and Emirates has 150 on order.But Muilenburg also said Boeing is seeing ""a lot of Asia-Pacific demand.""In February, Boeing announced that Singapore Airlines committed to ordering 39 widebody aircraft, valued at $13.8 billion at list prices, 20 777-9s (a version of the 777X) and 19 787-10 Dreamliners, as well as options for six more of each model.Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific and Japan's All Nippon Airways were also early 777X customers.

308,DAL,"Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) fell Tuesday as markets weighed conflicting reports on how a laptop ban may be widened on U.S. flights.X Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said on ""Fox News Sunday"" that laptops may be banned from the main cabins on all flights into and out of the U.S., despite a lobbying effort from the airline industry, which sent executives from the top U.S. carriers to meet with him earlier this month.On Tuesday afternoon, Politico reported the U.S. won't ban the devices on flights to the U.S. from Europe, following a call between Kelly, European Home Affairs Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos, and EU Transport Commissioner Violeta Bulc.A few hours later, a Homeland Security Department spokesman reportedly said that Kelly told his European counterparts that the ban is is ""still on the table.""The U.S. has already banned electronic devices larger than smartphones from inbound flights on several Middle East-based airlines originating from several Middle Eastern and African airports.That restriction has hurt carriers like Emirates, which competes against Delta, United and American for lucrative trans-Atlantic traffic. Earlier this month, Emirates said it will reduce flights to several U.S. destinations, citing the device ban as well as tougher policies on security vetting and visas.Shares of Delta sold off 3% early, then halved their losses before closing down 3.4% at 49.06 on the stock market today. Other airlines followed similar patterns. United finished 2.5% lower, re-entering buy range after surging 4.2% last week on oil's latest sell-off. American fell 1.6%, still in buying territory. Southwest (LUV) and JetBlue (JBLU), which have been adding flights to Latin America, both fell 2% but also are still in buy ranges. More domestic-focused carrier Alaska Air Group (ALK) lost 0.9%, and Hawaiian Holdings (HA) dipped 0.4%.Another factor potentially weighing on airline stocks is news that European budget carrier Ryanair (RYAAY) is looking to accelerate its global fleet growth with more narrow-body Boeing (BA) planes.The proliferation of low-cost carriers and the expansion of existing ones has turned the trans-Atlantic market into a cutthroat competitive environment and eroded the market share that Delta, United and American once commanded.U.S.-listed shares of Ryanair rose 1.45% to 107.76 and are well into profit-taking sell territory after breaking out last month.RELATED:If Airplane Device Ban Expands, It Could Cost You This Much Virgin's Branson Was Asked About Starting A New Airline; He Said ThisThese Airline Stocks Close In On Buy Points As Buffett Boosts Stakes

310,DAL,"To the surprise of no one, air travelers like it more when police don't drag them off flights. The share of United Airlines (UAL) customers who said they'd consider flying with the carrier again plummeted to 22%, from 47%, in the 30 days after videos last month showed aviation security dragging a passenger from a United Express flight, YouGov BrandIndex has found.Those findings, published Wednesday, amounted to ""a significant and unusually fast drop,"" said the firm, which measures consumer perception. However, in Wednesday's findings it also said that two airlines ""seemed to benefit"" from the outrage the video drew: JetBlue (JBLU) and Southwest (LUV).The firm said that over the 30-day period ""purchase consideration"" for JetBlue among that carrier's customers rose to 30% from 24%; Southwest's rose to 57% from 53%. United's perception among its own customers has improved since May 9, a month after security dragged the passenger, David Dao, off a packed Louisville, Ky.-bound flight after he refused to give up his seat to accommodate crew members who were needed for another flight. The findings follow United's annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday. Such events can take on the feel of a raucous town hall, but no investor asked about the dragging incident, according to a Chicago Tribune report. While travelers' feelings toward United have suffered, actual ticket sales are another matter. CEO Oscar Munoz said at the shareholder meeting that he hadn't seen that the incident had an impact on bookings. Analysts have also said that the financial fallout would be minimal — consumers in the U.S. are largely relegated to United, Delta Air Lines (DAL) and American Airlines (AAL) when they choose to fly. Those carriers control about 80% of U.S. flights. Shares of United dipped 0.2% to 81.25 on the stock market today, while American climbed 1.5%, and Delta added 0.8%. Southwest edged down 0.4%, and JetBlue gained 0.6%. United Airlines is just extended from an entry point, while the other four carriers' stocks are still in buy range.IBD'S TAKE: More upbeat views on unit revenue and this week's sharp drop in oil prices have helped propel airlines stocks lately. American, Southwest and JetBlue are now in buy range. Meanwhile, United shares are up 13% since the dragging incident.

That makes in the third notable U.S. airline stock that is in buy range currently. United Airlines (UAL) edged up 0.1%, still in the buy zone, and Southwest Airlines (LUV) added 1.2% after breaking out Monday.American Airlines rose 1% and Delta edged up 0.2%. American and Delta aren't in buy range, but they are approaching possible entries in their own consolidations.Earlier this month, American hiked its Q2 unit-revenue outlook to 3.5% to 5.5% from an earlier view of 3% to 5%, while Delta said it expected Q2 unit revenue to come within the upper range of a forecast for a 1%-to-3% increase.""We believe the revenue environment continues to improve as we head into the peak summer season, which appears consistent with recent commentary by U.S. airlines, particularly in the domestic market,"" Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth said in a research note.IBD'S TAKE: Even as demand improves domestically, Delta, American and United face rising competition from low-cost, long-haul carriers over the Atlantic. JetBlue has tried to strengthen its positions in Boston and Fort Lauderdale while expanding its premium Mint service, which offers more convenience before and during boarding, as well as free Wi-Fi and lie-flat seats.But Wall Street has questioned whether airlines can ensure they wouldn't over-expand capacity — an airline's supply of available seats and flight coverage — and risk greater competition from rivals, while also keeping labor costs in check.RELATED:These Airline Stocks Close In On Buy Points As Buffett Boosts StakesThis Kind Of Airline Competition Is Hitting Buffett's Portfolio

313,DAL,"American Airlines Group (AAL) followed United Continental Holdings (UAL) in announcing no-frills tickets that limit carry-on bags to one fitting under a seat, bolstering efforts to compete with fast-growing fare discounters.The new basic-economy tickets will go on sale Feb. 10 in select domestic markets and the first flights will begin soon after, the Fort Worth, Texas-based airline said in a statement Wednesday. American didn't identify the initial 10 markets or provide specifics on the size of the price discount compared with other coach cabin fares.American, United and Delta Air Lines (DAL) are rolling out lower fares with scaled-back features to compete with low-cost carriers such as Spirit Airlines (SAVE), which appeal to travelers who select flights based primarily on ticket prices. While American plans to expand the offering based on customer interest, it won't be available on every flight, the carrier said.Fliers opting for American's basic economy fare can carry on only one bag that must fit under the seat in front of them. Passengers whose bag doesn't fit must pay a $25 checked bag fee at the gate, plus an extra $25 gate-service charge. Seat assignments will be made automatically when customers check in, although paid seat selections can be made 48 hours before the flight. Tickets are non-changeable.United, which announced its basic economy offering in November, will start offering the fares this quarter. Delta already sells similar low-fare offerings, although it allows purchasers to bring a roll-on bag into the cabin.

314,DAL,"United Airlines (UAL) topped Q4 forecasts Tuesday, while CSX (CSX) missed earnings estimates but beat on revenue.Estimates: Earnings per share of $1.73, down 32% from a year earlier, when lower fuel costs provided more padding for the airlines' profits. Revenue is expected to be essentially flat at $9.034 billion.Results: EPS of $1.78 on revenue of $9.05 billion. Unit revenue down 1.6%, worse than the midpoint of its projection for a 1.25%-1.75% drop.Outlook: Q1 unit revenue down 1% to up 1%. Q1 capacity to grow 1%-2%. Adjusted pre-tax margin 0.5%-2.5%. Q1 unit costs to rise 4.5%-5.5%. Full-year capacity to grow 1%-2%. Full-year unit costs up 3.5%-4.5%, with labor agreements made last year contributing 3-4 percentage points.Stock: Shares fell 1.8% late after closing down 0.8% on the stock market today. Delta Air Lines (DAL), which beat Q4 estimates last week, ended down 1.8% then dipped 0.1% late. American Airlines (AAL) lost 1.9% and was flat late, and Southwest (LUV) dropped 1.8% and eased 0.5% after hours.United has said unit revenue, or revenue as it relates to an airline's available seats on planes and how far they fly, would fall 1.25%-1.75% in Q4, better than prior guidance. As with prior quarters, investors will be zeroing in on whether United can improve Q1 unit revenue, a key metric that has fallen for the past two years as airlines competed for market share. Margins could also become more of a focus as fuel and labor costs rise.RELATED:Can Delta, United, American Declare Mission Accomplished In 2017?American Lifts Unit Revenue View; DOJ Backs Off Collusion CaseEstimates: EPS up 4% to 50 cents with revenue up 4% to $2.888 billion.Results: EPS of 49 cents on revenue of $3.037 billion.Stock: Shares dropped 4% late after finishing down 1.8%. Union Pacific (UNP), which reports Thursday, also closed 1.8% lower then dipped 0.4% late, and Kansas City Southern (KSU) edged up 0.45% ahead of its quarterly report Friday.Prices have rebounded for the commodities shipped by rail operators in recent months, but analysts have expressed concerns over waning auto demand.RELATED:CSX Begins Rail-Sector Earnings, Topping Q3 EPS, Revenue ViewsAverage Gain By The Top 25 Stocks In 'Income Investor' In 2016: Up 38%

316,DAL,"As soon as President Trump signed his executive order calling for two regulations to be eliminated for every new one enacted, the usual suspects started to complain.Union of Concerned Scientists President Ken Kimmell called it ""absurd, imposing a Sophie's Choice on federal agencies.""William Gale of the left-of-center Brookings Institution complained that ""there's no logic to this.""Public Citizen head Robert Weissman called Trump's order ""unworkable,"" ""harmful,"" ""unprecedented and untested,"" and ""horrifying.""""Americans will once again have to pay the price for the consequences of corporate recklessness, greed and lawbreaking,"" Weissman added for good measure.Trump's executive order, signed on Monday, doesn't deregulate anything. It simply is an attempt to cap the current costs of regulations this year by requiring agencies to offset the costs of any new rule by eliminating regulations that impose equal costs.""The heads of all agencies are directed that the total incremental cost of all new regulations, including repealed regulations, to be finalized this year shall be no greater than zero,"" the order said.It's a tiny first step toward cutting the enormous cost of federal regulations — which by some estimates adds up to almost $1.9 trillion a year.What critics of deregulation fail to mention, however, is that it is greedy corporations that are likely to be one of Trump's biggest opponents when it comes to dismantling, or even taming, the federal government's massively complex and enormously expensive regulatory state.Soon after Trump was elected, for example, more than 350 companies signed a letter urging him not to abandon the Paris climate change agreement that President Obama had signed onto. ""Failure to build a low-carbon economy puts American prosperity at risk,"" the letter said.Among those companies signing it were household names like General Mills (GIS), Kellogg (K), DuPont (DD), eBay (EBAY), Starbucks (SBUX), Staples (SPLS), Nike (NKE) and Intel (INTC).Trump's effort to fix Dodd-Frank won't get much support from the banking industry, either.Business Insider reports that ""bankers are concerned the Trump administration, joined by like-minded Congress, will scrape or significantly change the rules.""Dodd-Frank required banks to invest in staff and technology and make other changes to comply with that law's vast web of regulations. But ""now that Dodd-Frank is largely in effect, the industry sees a total elimination as more of a threat than a blessing.""Brokerage firms worry that the Labor Department's ""fiduciary rule"" could be in jeopardy. BlackRock (BLK) CEO Larry Fink said on a January earnings call that the rule ""has some very great components in it.""Why would companies be pushing to keep costly regulations in place?This is the dirty secret that so-called public-interest groups never share. Big corporations are often the biggest beneficiaries, and at times the strongest advocates, of federal regulations.Daniel Hannan, a member of the European Parliament, put it best during the Brexit debate last year. Big business vigorously supported the Remain campaign, he noted, despite the fact that EU regulations were suffocating the British economy.""Ask yourself why it is that the megabanks and the multinationals are pouring money into the Remain campaign,"" Hannan said. ""I'll tell you why. The biggest surprise for me when I was a newly elected MEP was the extent to which these giant corporations wanted more regulation. They love regulation because they can afford the compliance costs more easily than their smaller rivals.""See? Regulations can give big companies a competitive advantage — not only can they more easily afford the cost of regulatory compliance than their smaller competitors, they can finance an army of lobbyists to make sure the rules are written to their benefit.The most noteworthy effect of Dodd-Frank, for example, hasn't been that it's made the financial sector less vulnerable — as IBD noted recently, it hasn't. It is, instead, the destruction of smaller community banks, which in turn has let large banks further consolidate their grip on the industry.""The number of community banks (those with less than $10 billion in assets) shrank 14% between Dodd-Frank's passage in 2010 and late 2014,"" noted Harvard Business School's Marshall Lux and Robert Greene. ""When regulations — not consumers — drive consolidation, banking system risk increases,"" they wrote.Some other examples, courtesy of the Cato Institute:Airline deregulation is another prime example of how big business fights deregulation more fiercely that it fights regulation.Before 1978, the federal Civil Aeronautics Board controlled airline routes and fares. Airlines routinely complained about CAB rules, but when President Carter and liberal Sen. Ted Kennedy teamed up to deregulate the airline industry, it was the airlines themselves that mounted a determined fight against it, and encouraged their employees to do likewise.The chairman of Delta Airlines (DAL) at the time called deregulation a ""wolf in sheep's clothing,"" saying it would somehow lead to more regulation and ""perhaps eventual nationalization"" of the airline industry.Carter ignored these warnings and disbanded the CAB. The result made life tougher for airline executives, but it was a consumer bonanza of increased competition and far lower rates.Yet despite countless such examples over the decades, this dynamic goes almost entirely unrecognized when the subject of federal regulations comes up. Regulations are always portrayed as helping the little guy at the expense of big business — when the reality is often the opposite.This isn't to say that big business will always fight against deregulation. But when it comes to free-market policies, corporate executives can be fickle friends. And if Donald Trump wants to live up to his promise to deregulate the economy, he's likely going to have to take on not just the liberal left, but some of the biggest businesses in the world.RELATED:Now They Tell Us: Trump's Economic Plan Will Boost GrowthTrump Day One To-Do List: Repeal $1.7 Billion Of Dodd-Frank RulesIs Ford's Move A Cave-In To Trump Protectionist Talk, Or A Savvy Bet On Future?

317,DAL,"Analysts upgraded Netflix (NFLX), pushing the streaming media giant back into buy range. Comcast (CMCSA) and Mobileye (MBLY) both got buy ratings while Delta Air Lines (DAL) received a higher price targetDeutsche Bank upgraded the streaming video company to hold from sell, hiking its price target to 110 from 92. While valuation remains a concern for analyst Bryan Kraft, the upgrade reflects improvement in international subscriber gains. Netflix is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results after the market close on Wednesday.Shares of Netflix rose 3.5% to 133.70 on the stock market today. The stock has retaken its 129.39 buy point after falling just below that entry area on Thursday.Deutsche Bank upgraded the cable and media giant to buy from hold, boosting its price target to 88 from 68. Kraft said the benefits of tax reform aren't yet priced in, assuming a 25% corporate tax rate. Less regulation, an acceleration in free cash flow growth and low foreign-currency exposure in a rising dollar environment also make the shares look attractive, he wrote.Comcast shares rose 1.9% to 72.77, hitting an all-time high.IBD'S TAKE: Comcast shares cleared a buy point in mid-November. Shares have been rising recently but aren't quite extended, meaning 5% above the buy point, which is a riskier entry point. Jefferies started coverage on the developer of advanced driver assistance technology with a buy rating and 52 price target, citing Mobileye's strong market position and expectations of 44% annual revenue growth through 2020.Mobileye shares climbed 3.3% to 42.18.Cowen raised its price target for Delta to 60 from 57, keeping an outperform rating.

318,DAL,"The Trump administration's measure barring airline passengers from bringing larger electronic devices into flight cabins could cost passengers an extra $1.1 billion or more if applied to flights coming to the U.S. from Europe, the head of the International Air Transport Association said.The remarks come amid broader industry concerns about how President Trump's attempts to establish tighter screening and security measures might impact tourism and travel demand. U.S. and EU officials were also set to meet on Wednesday to discuss the potential expansion of that ban.In an interview with Bloomberg published online Wednesday, the industry group's CEO, Alexandre de Juniac, said he was unsure what the basis for the intelligence justifying for the ban, which is already in place for U.S.-bound flights from some locations in the Middle East and Africa — and weather it was suited to current security threats. The U.K. has similar restrictions in place.He said he had contacted U.S., U.K. and European Union authorities about the matter, and urged governments to ""work very closely with the industry"" to develop appropriate measures to protect passengers without burdening the airline business.He also said the IATA would urge European governments not to retaliate with similar measures for flights coming into Europe.""We do not claim to be genius,"" he said, ""but we claim to be the specialist of transporting people and goods.""He added that explosive-tracing technology already existed in many airports, and that additional training could be used to ensure security without disrupting business.In breaking down the IATA's $1.1 billion cost to passengers, de Juniac said in a letter dated Tuesday that ""loss of productive time of business passengers"" would cost $655 million, ""harm to passenger well-being"" would cost $195 million, and loss of time due to longer travel times would amount to an extra $216 million in costs.""Businesses will cancel trips rather than risk having laptops checked due to risk of confidential information,"" he said in the letter, which was addressed to Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and Violeta Bulc, the European Commission's commissioner for transport.That's the big issue for IATA. Business travel, a lucrative segment for carriers, may fall if the electronics ban is expanded.The IATA estimates that the restrictions would affect 390 flights a day if applied to all of Europe.The current restrictions affect 350 U.S.-bound flights per week from the Middle East and North Africa, the IATA estimates. That's hit Middle East-based carriers.Delta Air Lines (DAL) closed down 3.2% on the stock market today, and American Airlines (AAL) sank 4.3%, both backing away from potential buy points as the broader indexes sold off. United Airlines (UAL) lost 3.6%, dipping below its 76.90 buy point.IBD'S TAKE: The trans-Atlantic is a very lucrative but competitive market for American, Delta and United, so the implications of any travel restrictions from Europe loom large.De Juniac has expressed concern about the Trump administration's travel and device restrictions in the past, and his remarks follow similar concern from U.S. carriers.Airline industry representatives reportedly met with Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly last week to discuss the agency's plans to potentially broaden the electronics restrictions to flights from Europe.RELATED:Delta Says It Handles Overbookings Better Than Rivals; Outlook StrongThese Airline Stocks Close In On Buy Points As Buffett Boosts Stakes

319,DAL,"Richard Branson hinted that he was considering creating another U.S. airline following Alaska Air Group's (ALK) $2.6 billion purchase last year of Virgin America, the carrier that is part of the Virgin brand that he started.A new airline would have to compete in an industry whose barriers to entry have grown higher due to a decade of consolidation that has left Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL), United Airlines (UAL) and Southwest Airlines (LUV) in control of 80% of U.S. traffic.Also, a new carrier would increase the supply of available flights, potentially sending fares lower, even as Wall Street pressures the industry to pull back on expanding flight coverage to shore up profit.In an interview with Bloomberg TV on Thursday, Branson had been discussing the royalties that Alaska must pay Virgin. He said that Alaska would ""carry on paying royalties — unless we decide to start another airline. So, we'll see what happens.""When asked if starting a new airline was something he would be willing to do, he said: ""Watch this space.""Shares of Alaska were up 2.2% to close at 84.57 on the stock market today. Delta rallied 1.1% to 48.20, while American rose 1.3% to 45.22, heading for a 47.49 buy point. United climbed 2.6% to 77.98, going back above its 76.90 buy point, as Southwest gained 1.3% to 58.04, creeping closer to its 58.83 entry.IBD'S TAKE: The International Air Transport Association estimates that an expansion of the in-flight electronics restrictions imposed by President Trump would cost passengers more than $1 billion annually.Branson's remarks come as Virgin and Alaska argue over how long Alaska should pay royalties. Branson has said that Alaska has to pay royalties on the Virgin brand through 2040, based on the terms of a licensing agreement.However, Alaska, which will retire the Virgin brand in 2019, has said there were many ways out of that deal and that they didn't believe they should keep paying for a name they weren't using.Meanwhile, Alaska's acquisition of Virgin gives it a chance to toughen up its position against Delta on the West Coast and on transcontinental flights.But some have argued that Virgin, despite its upbeat, more cosmopolitan take on air travel, struggled to compete against larger rivals on profitability and against the cheap fares offered by budget carriers.Meanwhile travel demand has been strong, but some analysts have said it hasn't been as strong as once expected following the election. Higher labor costs also threaten the industry's margins.Higher oil prices in recent months also have helped chasten the industry. But that could help capacity stay under control by preventing overexpansion and excess competition.Berkshire Hathaway's (BKRB) Warren Buffett has continued to buy airline stocks after last year's surprise change of heart about investing in the industry as the benefit of consolidation became clear.In its most recent filing, Berkshire hiked its stake in American by 8.4% to 49.3 million shares in Q1 vs. Q4 and bulked up its holdings in Southwest by 10.4% to 47.7 million.

320,DAL,"Shares of American Airlines (AAL) and Southwest Airlines (LUV) edged closer to entry points Tuesday, a day after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) disclosed bigger positions in the carriers.Berkshire hiked its stake in American by 8.4% to 49.3 million shares, as compared to the fourth quarter. The firm bulked up its holdings in Southwest by 10.4% to 47.7 million.Berkshire's position in United Airlines (UAL) was unchanged, and its holdings in Delta Air Lines (DAL) were trimmed to 55 million shares, down 8.3%.Meanwhile, Soros Fund Management dissolved its position in Delta.Shares of American ended the regular trading session up 0.6% to 46.94 on the stock market today, closing in on a 47.49 buy point. Southwest rose 0.4% to 58.27, just below a 58.83 entry. Delta shares were flat at 49.51, and United climbed 1.6% to 79.06, still in buying territory from a 76.90 entry.Buffett's disclosed investments in the airline industry — after previously calling airline stocks a ""death trap"" that had brought ""100 years with terrible results"" — helped lift the sector last year.Buffett reportedly reconsidered the airline industry after consolidation brought operational discipline and minimized competition, a characteristic he tends to prefer when he picks investments.President Trump's election, and the hopes of deregulation, a better economy and increased travel demand, also helped airline stocks. So did airlines' results, after rising fuel prices prompted the industry to tighten up flight capacity and improve unit revenue, a much-watched figure in the airline business.But despite the consolidation that may have attracted Buffett, airlines still try to match one another aggressively when they add service to different parts of the world, cutting fares as their supply of seats and flights rises — moves that threaten financials.Rising labor costs have also risked cutting into profits. And demand, while solid, perhaps wasn't as strong as once expected following the election.RELATED:This Kind Of Airline Competition Is Hitting Buffett's PortfolioDelta Says It Handles Overbookings Better Than Rivals; Outlook Strong

321,DAL,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) on Monday said it was testing facial recognition technology to match travelers' faces with their passport photos, part of a bigger investment intended to move people through long airport lines more quickly.The technology would be tested on one of four self-service bag drop machines that will be available this summer in Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport. The bag machines amount to a $600,000 investment, the company said.""And, since customers can operate the biometric-based bag drop machine independently, we see a future where Delta agents will be freed up to seek out travelers and deliver more proactive and thoughtful customer service,"" Gareth Joyce, senior vice president of airport customer service and cargo, said in a statement.Delta said it would be gathering customer feedback during the tests. The carrier also said studies have shown that self-service bag drops can double the number of customers processed hourly.Delta's announcement comes as the airline industry faces growing criticism over the way it handles customer service after police last month dragged a United Airlines (UAL) passenger from his seat when he refused to give it up on a packed flight.United introduced an array of new policies following that incident, including a customer relations team and an app intended to make it easier to resolve issues with passengers.Delta's new technology also comes as the Trump administration tries to put tougher travel restrictions and screening procedures in place — moves it says will strengthen national security. However, stricter vetting also raises privacy issues and runs the risk of greater inconvenience and reduced travel demand.The airline industry has expressed more concern about the administration's potential plans to expand an in-cabin ban on larger electronic devices to include U.S.-bound flights from Europe, a lucrative market for Delta, United and American Airlines (AAL). Those restrictions currently affect flights coming into the U.S. from some airports in the Middle East and Africa.Delta advanced 1.1% to 49.51 in the stock market today, building the right side of a consolidation. United moved back above a 76.90 entry point, rising 1.8% to 77.79. American rose 1.8% to 46.67, approaching a 47.49 buy point above a handle.RELATED:Delta Air Lines Raises Dividend By 51%, Approves $5 Billion BuybackDelta, United Rival Emirates Cuts U.S. Flights After Trump Crackdown

324,DAL,"Regulation: Given the way the airline industry is depicted these days, you'd think air travel is like being stuck in Dante's Inferno. But a new survey shows passengers are happier than ever. Why the disconnect?J.D. Power, a top market research company well-known for tracking customer satisfaction, released a survey last week that found ""customer satisfaction with airlines has reached its highest level ever, continuing a trend that now stretches five consecutive years.""How could that possibly be, given the United Airlines (UAL) passenger dragged off a plane, the traveler nearly hit with a stroller on an American Airlines (AAL) plane, a California family thrown off a Delta (DAL) flight, a brawl at a Spirit Airlines (SAVE) counter, and several other recent incidents?It turns out that those horror stories are more like shark attacks than bee stings — rare events that capture a huge amount of publicity because they are rare.That hasn't stopped some from using these anecdotes to depict the entire industry as indifferent, if not openly hostile, to the needs of their passengers.Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said that the ""degrading treatment"" of the United passenger ""is the latest example of a major U.S. airline disrespecting passengers and denying them their basic rights.""USA Today recently asked: ""Can air travel get any more miserable than it already is?"" to which it answered ""yes.""The Washington Post's Dana Milbank described the industry this way: ""packed cabins; tiny seats; proliferating fees for food, bags and flight changes; boarding delays; higher fares; labyrinthine contracts; and routine overbooking.""There's a reason for this: Democrats, and most reporters, like government regulation and think the airlines need more of it. So every time something bad happens, they use it as the latest evidence that the government should step in.Milbank, for example, prefaced his dreary rundown by saying ""this is what laissez faire looks like."" Blumenthal is pushing dozens of new regulations. An article on Bill Moyers' site claims that ""Airlines treat people like dirt because the Republicans in Congress let them.""The J.D. Power findings directly counter this big government push — which is why they got so little attention. The survey found that actual customers are seeing ""improved on-time performance, fewer lost bags, historically low bump rates and high scores for flight crews"" as well as an average 8.5% cut in airfares.That's not to say that airlines can't improve customer service. But if you think government bureaucrats know how to do it better than the airlines themselves, spend a day at the DMV.RELATED:United Airlines Flunks Economics 101Trump's Plan To Cut Regulations Will Face A Surprising FoeNo, Budget Cuts Aren't Why You're Waiting Hours To Get Through Airport Security

325,DAL,"Airline industry representatives met with Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly on Thursday, reportedly to discuss the agency's potential plan to widen its restrictions on electronic devices, amid growing industry concern about those measures' effectiveness and impact on demand.The meeting, which was set to include officials from Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL), took place Thursday, and airline representatives have also aired their worries about the restrictions to Congress, Bloomberg reported.Airlines For America, which said it was ""represented"" at the meeting, told IBD that it continued to believe that ""security and efficiency are not mutually exclusive goals"" and would work with DHS and the TSA on making travel smooth and safe.The industry anxiety follows a report from Reuters that the Trump administration was considering expanding a ban on laptops — currently in effect on U.S.-bound flights from some airports in the Middle East and Africa — to some flights from Europe. No official decision on the matter has been made.U.S. airlines have minimal exposure to the six nations targeted in Trump's travel ban, the merits of which were being turned over in a federal appeals court.But the European market is a much bigger moneymaker for the Delta, American and United, and they face intense competition on flights to Europe from low-cost carriers.The airlines have been trying to persuade the government to consider other security measures that would not prevent business travelers — who drive a lot of profit for the industry — and other passengers from using laptops and other electronic devices, Bloomberg said.Among the measures suggested, Bloomberg reported, were using explosive-detection swabs and X-ray technology to detect anything that might make passengers' electronic devices a security risk.Gulf rival Emirates said it plans to cut flights to the U.S. in response to the electronics ban. The Trump administration's plans to tighten vetting for visa applicants and other travelers coming into the U.S. have also raised concerns about the impact on travel demand.Delta fell 1.4% to 48.99 on the stock market today. American lost 1.5% to 45.83.

326,DAL,"X Delta Air Lines (DAL) boosted its annual dividend 51% to $1.22 per share and announced a new $5 billion repurchase program, according to a regulatory filing.The carrier said it is committed to keeping 2017 capacity growth capped at 1%, and that it is ""well positioned"" to achieve its 2018-2020 targets, which include 16%-18% operating margin and more than 15% EPS growth.Calling 2017 a ""transition year,"" Delta also said it is on track to resume margin expansion in the second quarter, having fully absorbed margin headwinds for the full year in Q1.Shares fell 0.6% to 49.69 on the stock market today. American Airlines (AAL) lost 1.6% to 46.54. United Airlines (UAL) retreated 1.5% to 77.36, still above a 76.90 buy point.  Southwest (LUV) slid 0.5% to 58.09.Delta's massive boost to shareholder returns comes as the airline industry faces higher labor costs after new contracts for pilots, flight attendants and ground crew provided pay increases.Meanwhile, fuel costs have remained low as oil prices have fallen back below $50 a barrel. When prices initially tanked in late 2014, airlines rewarded shareholders with steep returns the following year.Improved capacity discipline has also brightened the picture for airlines unit revenue, which is returning to growth after years of declines.RELATED:Why Flying On Spirit Airlines Now Is A Real 'Riot'This Airline Breaks Out To High, 2 Rivals Near Buys On Strong Traffic

327,DAL,"Shares of budget airline Spirit Airlines (SAVE) tumbled again Tuesday after the company a day earlier said roughly 300 flights had been canceled over the past week amid a dispute with pilots — a development one analyst said could dent earnings per share this quarter.The cancellations have reportedly caused turmoil among travelers over at least the past two days, with a video circulating during that time showing police escorting people away from a Spirit Airlines check-in counter after an altercation of some kind.Shares of Spirit was down 2.3% to 56.11 on the stock market today, off intraday lows of 54.33. Airlines' monthly traffic figures continue to hold Wall Street's focus more than passenger outrage over customer service, with the latest reports spurring a strong rally in shares of United Airlines (UAL), American Airlines (AAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL).This video of a ""riot,"" reportedly taken at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, shows uniformed officers removing some passengers — said to be angry over the cancellations — from a Spirit Airlines check-in counter.@nbc @NBCNews Riot breaks out at #FLL over @SpiritAirlines #cancelled flights. People are angry, some arrested. #worstcustomerservice pic.twitter.com/y1VaH7Lb9w— Jose L. Rodriguez (@asg749d) May 9, 2017""We expect Spirit to prevail in addressing the issue, but believe the cancellations could impact our 2Q17E EPS of $1.20 ($4.25 for 2017E) by $0.10-0.15, although likely to boost (unit revenue),"" Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth said in a research note on Tuesday.However, the note, citing flight-tracker FlightStats, said the rate of cancellations had eased, with 83 cancellations on Sunday, 67 Monday and possibly 28 on Tuesday.Spirit on Monday sued the pilots union over the disruption, accusing the pilots of engaging ""in a pervasive illegal work slowdown"" that had upended travel plans for more than 20,000 customers and cost the carrier some $8.5 million.In its complaint obtained by Skift, Spirit said the pilots were stalling air travel in attempt to sway negotiations over an amended collective bargaining agreement in its favor. Spirit also said it had asked the carrier's pilots union, the Air Line Pilots Association, to end the standoff, but that the union had been unable to do so.The company also alleged that some pilots ""are also engaged in a campaign to threaten and intimidate other pilots who accept junior assignments or pick up open time flying.""The ALPA, in a statement, called the legal action by Spirit ""unwarranted and counterproductive.""""The Air Line Pilots Association, Int'l and the Spirit pilot group it represents are not engaged in a job action,"" it said in the statement. ""Rather, ALPA and the Spirit pilots are continuing to do everything possible to help restore the company's operations, which have experienced significant problems over the past several days.""Later Tuesday, Spirit said it was ""shocked and saddened"" by the events at the Florida airport. The alleged actions by the pilots, Spirit said, affected roughly 15% of flights across its network.The carrier also said Tuesday that a U.S. court granted it a temporary restraining order forcing the union pilots ""to return to status quo."" The legal action, Spirit said, would ""protect its customers from further disruption due to an unlawful job action by Spirit pilots."" The court also ordered a motion for a hearing for a preliminary injunction, set for May 15.The ALPA, in a statement issued later Tuesday, said it would comply with the order.""The court has spoken and Spirit pilots will fully comply with the order handed down, which is completely in line with our overriding goal: the resumption of normal operations,"" the group saidStill, the tensions mark the latest to surface online in video, following passenger disputes with United, American and Delta.But the continuing negotiations between Spirit and its pilots illustrate the ongoing, conflicting pressures within the industry.Employees have wanted more pay after two years of cheap oil widened airlines' profits. But Wall Street wants airlines to keep expansion limited and costs low. Investors last month punished American Airlines after it offered a pay raise to pilots and flight attendants that was intended to keep the carrier competitive with rivals.RELATED:Delta Says It Handles Overbookings Better Than Rivals; Outlook StrongThe Latest Threat To Delta, United Comes From This New Budget Carrier

The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 eased 0.2%. Volume on the NYSE was tracking slightly higher than Wednesday's levels. Nasdaq volume fell a bit.In the stock market today, Macy's (M) crashed 16% to its lowest level since 2011 after reporting another quarter of disappointing sales. Group peer Kohl's (KSS) also sold off on earnings, slumping 6%. Nordstrom (JWN) reports after the close. Shares were down 7% ahead of the results.The selling wasn't just limited to department store operators as about half of the day's worst performing industry groups were in the retail sector. Home furnishings name RH (RH) gapped down after the company updated its earnings guidance.

329,DAL,"Airline stocks were moving above the clouds, topping or nearing all-time highs on strong traffic and revenue figures.American Airlines (AAL) on Tuesday lifted its second-quarter forecasts for unit revenue and adjusted pretax margin, citing better pricing power on fares and lower expected fuel costs. Alaska Air Group (ALK) also turned out solid April traffic figures, following strong data from United Airlines (UAL) late Monday.American Airlines shares rose 4.8% to 47.08 in the stock market today, approaching a 47.49 buy point. United Airlines leapt 4.8% to 78.55, hitting a new all-time intraday high and clearing a 76.90 buy point. Alaska Air Group climbed 0.8% to 84.20 but is trading near five-month lows.Delta Air Lines (DAL) advanced 2.1% to 49.56 continuing to build the right side of a base. Delta Air reported positive April unit revenue last week. Southwest Airlines (LUV) rose 1.4% to 58.28 as the carrier approaches a 59.78 buy point.American said it expected second-quarter unit revenue to rise roughly 3.5% to 5.5%, up from an earlier outlook of 3%-5%. The company forecasts adjusted pretax margin of 12%-14%, up from 11%-13%.The carrier said that passenger traffic for April rose 3.1%, on a modest capacity increase of 0.8%. Load factor, a measure of seats filled, was 82.2%, up 1.8 percentage points.Airlines' bookings practices, including how tightly they pack flights, came under intense scrutiny last month after police dragged a passenger from a United Express flight after he refused to give up his seat to accommodate crew members.However, the financial impact from that incident appears likely to be minimal.Even as United settled with the passenger, David Dao, and airline executives were questioned by a House panel, Wall Street has been focused more on airlines' ability to keep their growth plans in check and wring profits from passengers as oil and labor costs rise. Alaska Air Group said its traffic for April increased 7.8%, while capacity rose 4.6%.United reported a 7.4% jump in traffic, outpacing a 4% increase in flight capacity for last month. United said it would stick with its second-quarter forecast for unit revenue, a key metric that gauges an airline's sales in relation to its overall flight coverage.Southwest on Monday reported April traffic rose 8.4%, while capacity rose 7.6%. Load factor rose 0.6 percentage points to 84%. The carrier held to its second-quarter unit revenue forecast of a 1%-2% increase.RELATED:Why Flying On Spirit Airlines Now Is A Real 'Riot'Delta Says It Handles Overbookings Better Than Rivals; Outlook StrongThe Latest Threat To Delta, United Comes From This New Budget Carrier

330,DAL,"X Shares of IBM lurched 2.5% lower early Friday amid news that Warren Buffett has been dumping the tech giant in 2017. Investors digested the news ahead of Berkshire Hathaway's (BRKB) annual meeting, a day when the Berkshire CEO answers shareholders' questions.Late Friday, Berkshire reported Q1 net earnings dropped 27% to $4.14 billion as insurance losses and adjustments soared 146%, but revenue climbed 25% to $65.19 billion. Insurance premiums earned nearly doubled to $21.75 billion, and railroad, utilities and energy revenue grew 6.3% to $9.4 billion.Among the potential topics that billionaire investor could address are his reasons for selling IBM (IBM), Apple's (AAPL) rising dividends, turbulence in the airline industry and a merger snub for one of his top stocks.Buffett has sold a third of his stake in the tech giant over the first and second quarters, considerably trimming his 81 million shares as of December 2016, CNBC reported.""IBM is a big strong company, but they've got big strong competitors too,"" he said in an interview, adding IBM stock had not performed in line with his expectations.The iPhone maker is a sure bet for the spotlight at Saturday's meeting.Buffett doubled his stake in Apple at the start of this year, owning $17 billion of the stock as of February. He disclosed a position in Apple in 2016 after sitting out the tech giant's hot growth streak over the past decade. He attributed the change of heart to Apple's ""enormously useful product"" and intelligent deployment of capital.Buffett's ""invest in what you know"" principle made him a big buyer of the best high-dividend stocks such as Verizon (VZ), General Motors (GM), IBM (IBM) and Coca-Cola (KO). He likes financially sound companies with a durable competitive advantage that reward shareholders. Dividends can be a sign of a quality company.Apple's hefty dividend hike may make the stock more attractive for Buffett, though he said in February that Apple stock was ""at a price different than I would buy it now.""Apple shares rose 0.6% to 147.38 in morning trade on the stock market today. The stock fell fractionally Wednesday and Thursday after reporting tepid revenue and iPhone sales for the second fiscal quarter but significantly raising its dividend and buyback.Berkshire Hathaway has also been upping its stake in airline stocks — another big change of heart. He is reported to have owned more than 7% of the total common stock of each of Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL), American Airlines (AAL) and Southwest Airlines (LUV) as of February.With airlines executives in congressional crosshairs after a spate of disturbing passenger-related incidents, Buffett may be grilled himself on his airline positions.Other headwinds for airline stocks include high labor costs, increased competition and discounted fares that cut into profits.Still, all four of the big U.S. carriers have moved back above their 50-day moving averages.If Buffett stays true to form, investors can expect some frank discussion of Kraft Heinz's (KHC) failed $143 billion merger bid for Unilever (UN) and what other steps Kraft may do to revive growth.Berkshire is one of the largest stakeholders in the $108 billion company behind beloved household names such as Jell-O and Kool-Aid.After Wednesday's market close, Kraft Heinz reported earnings per share and revenue below Wall Street views. EPS climbed 15% to 84 cents a share while sales dipped 3% to $6.36 billion. Analysts had expect EPS of 85 cents and sales of $6.462 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Sales have fallen for four of the last five quarters, while there may be limits to Kraft's aggressive cost-cutting measures under Berkshire and co-lead investor 3G.Kraft shares fell sharply intraday Thursday, but closed up 0.6%. The stock dipped 0.1% Friday morning.In previous annual meetings, Buffett has weighed in on Valeant Pharmaceuticals' (VRX) flawed business model, defended his sizable stake in Coca-Cola, and knocked hedge fund managers (between playing ping-pong with a giant paddle and doing a ukulele singalong).RELATED:Apple Investors Find Comfort In 10.5% Dividend HikeLawmakers Grill United CEO Munoz

331,DAL,"British Airways parent International Airlines Group on Friday said sales for its new low-cost, long-haul airline were ""running well ahead of expectations,"" underscoring the threat such European carriers pose to Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL).IAG launched its new low-cost, long-haul carrier, called Level, in March. Level in June will start offering flights to out of Barcelona to Los Angeles, San Francisco, Buenos Aires and Punta Cana.Those flights will be offered on two Airbus (EADSY) A330 jets.IBD'S TAKE: Low-cost, long-haul carriers out of Europe have proliferated in recent years, threatening to make a lucrative trans-Atlantic market a little less so for the big three U.S. network carriers.Corporate bookings to North America rose during the first quarter, while demand in Asia, which is set to broaden in the years to come, also accelerated, the company said, according to Bloomberg.Delta Air Lines shares closed up 0.1% in the stock market today, and American rose 1.4%. American is currently in a cup-with-handle base. United added 0.5%. All three stocks are up sharply for the week, above their 50-day lines, following strong April traffic figures from Delta.The apparent demand for Level comes as U.S. airlines deal with their own problems domestically. Lawmakers have pressured the industry to change its booking and transparency practices after passenger David Dao was dragged by police from a United Express flight last month.At a House panel on Tuesday, Joseph Sprague, senior vice president of external relations at Alaska Air Group (ALK)-owned Alaska Airlines, said the carrier was reviewing policies like overbooking, which airlines use to ensure they don't lose out on potential sales.Also at that hearing, Kerry Philipovitch, senior vice president of customer experience at American, said the carrier had ""not established an upper limit on what we will pay to solicit volunteers"" to give up their seats in the event of an oversold flight. Delta and United have pushed that payout ceiling up to $10,000.As low-cost air travel becomes more available, Delta, American and United have rolled out fewer-frills ""basic economy"" fare options.However, William McGee, an aviation consultant at the hearing, argued that much of airlines' investments go to premium seating classes, which drive profit.RELATED:Lawmakers Grill United CEO Munoz: This Is Why Airline Stocks Are FlyingDelta Says It Handles Overbookings Better Than Rivals; Outlook StrongDragged-Off United Passenger Called 'Unintended Champion' For Change
"
332,DAL,"Even as a House panel tried to grill United Airlines (UAL) CEO Oscar Munoz and other industry executives Tuesday, shares of top airlines were market leaders. The congressional hearing amounted to lawmakers venting and warning, but not signaling a push for new legislation. Meanwhile, new industry data suggest airlines are getting better at packing planes to capacity.Delta Air Lines (DAL) reported positive unit revenue — a measure of sales in relation to an airline's flight and seating capacity — for the month of April.Delta Air led the airline sector higher in the stock market today, rising 5.35% to 47.83, retaking its 50-day moving average.United Airlines (UAL) rose 5.2% to 73.94, also retaking its 50-day line.American Airlines (AAL) ascended 4.25% to 43.87, rebounding from its 200-day line and nearing its 50-day.Southwest Airlines (LUV) climbed 3.6% to 58.33. Southwest is currently in a cup base with a 59.78 potential buy point.Delta's passenger unit revenue in April rose 1%. That's the second straight month of positive results for the key metric. In March, the carrier turned passenger unit revenue positive for the first time since November 2015.Delta's flight capacity fell 0.8%. Traffic for the month rose 1.6%.Delta's monthly traffic results come as the very things that airlines do to make investors happy — higher fares, lower capacity and tighter operations — were scrutinized by lawmakers in a hearing before members of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.During that hearing, lawmakers called out airlines for a recent string of ""disturbing customer-service breakdowns"" — most notably the violent removal of passenger David Dao from a United Express flight last month that resulted in a settlement between him and the carrier.United's CEO, Oscar Munoz, who attended the hearing with President Scott Kirby, said that event was marked a ""serious breach of public trust"" and apologized for an ""inadequate"" response. Munoz also reiterated changes the airline would make in the wake of the incident.Also in attendance were Bob Jordan, Southwest's CCO; Kerry Philipovitch, senior vice president of customer experience at American; and William McGee, aviation consultant for Consumers Union.Overbookings, a decade's worth of consolidation, passenger contracts as long as 67 pages, the overall ""miserable"" experience from booking a ticket online to going through a TSA checkpoint to waiting at the gate — all those subjects and more were on the table for the House panel.""I can't get comparable prices, so before the ticket, I'm frustrated,"" said Washington Democratic Rep. Rick Larsen, who had no questions.And GOP Rep. Duncan Hunter of California — who said he'd considered using his time to gauge the industry's contempt for the American people — said it was ""an absolute joke"" that competition existed in the airline industry, citing a lack of choice in many markets.""We don't have a choice. ... The American people have to fly, all the time,"" he said.Two lawmakers on the panel called for the Government Accountability Office to look at ways to improve operations and consumer protections.Airline executives said competition has intensified over the years, despite the merger wave that began in the prior decade. Low-cost carriers threaten them domestically and internationally. And executives said overbooking — which, in a way, oversupplies flights — allows them to keep fares low and made scores of seats available.Southwest has said it would end overbookings, potentially by the middle of this year, but Jordan said some flights could be oversold for operational reasons.""This is an intensely competitive industry,"" said Philipovitch. She added, ""This competition is good for consumers.""However, most executives wouldn't get into specifics on what measures they would take to make passenger rights easier to understand.When asked if they would create a one-page document that outlined passenger rights, Munoz and Kirby said they supported simplicity but were unsure about whether the document would be one page. Joseph Sprague, senior vice president of external relations at Alaska Air Group's (ALK) Alaska Airlines, said ""that would be our goal."" Philipovitch and Jordan said they favored simplicity.""You may think you're looking at members of Congress,"" said Democratic Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes of the District of Columbia. ""But really you're looking at your customer base.""RELATED:Delta Says It Handles Overbookings Better Than Rivals; Outlook StrongThis Kind Of Airline Competition Is Hitting Buffett's Portfolio 
"
333,DAL,"United Airlines (UAL) on Thursday reached a settlement with David Dao, the passenger who was shown in a video being dragged from a United Express flight earlier this month. The amount of the settlement wasn't disclosed.In a statement, Thomas Demetrio, one of Dao's lawyers, commended United and its CEO, Oscar Munoz, for taking ""full responsibility for what happened on Flight 3411, without attempting to blame others, including the City of Chicago.""Demetrio added that Dao had become ""the unintended champion"" for change that would ""help improve the lives of literally millions of travelers.""The news came hours after United released a review of the incident and unveiled or reiterated policy changes to make service better.""We are pleased to report that United and Dr. Dao have reached an amicable resolution of the unfortunate incident that occurred aboard flight 3411,"" United said in a statement.After the incident, in which Chicago aviation security dragged Dao from a flight headed from that city to Louisville, Ky. after he refused to give up his seat on a packed flight, Dao's lawyer said a lawsuit was likely. Video of the incident showed Dao with his face bloodied, and an attorney representing him said he had broken his nose, lost two front teeth and suffered a concussion.United shares closed down 0.9% at 70.70 in the stock market today, near session highs. Airline shares in general were lower on Thursday, with American Airlines' (AAL) proposed pay raise to pilots and flight attendants raising concerns about costs.The dragging incident was a learning experience for many travelers, who didn't know they could be involuntarily denied boarding to accommodate crew who might need to board, as was the case that led Chicago aviation security to remove Dao from the flight.Dao's removal also raised questions about overbooking, which airlines use to keep flights tight and sales high. And it renewed the sense that many air travelers have that unless you have the money for first-class, you'll end up peppered with extra fees and relegated to claustrophobic conditions.In United's review, the carrier noted that its procedure for involuntary boarding denials is automated, and that customers ""with the lowest paid fare are placed at the top of the list for involuntary denial of boarding.""Flight 3411 was overbooked by one passenger, United said, after earlier saying the flight was sold out. The dispute began after United tried to offer an $800 travel credit and other accommodations to persuade four passengers to get off the plane, with no luck, the review said. Earlier attempts, pre-boarding, were also unsuccessful, and United resorted to the involuntary boarding denial selection.United, in the review, said it did not offer enough to those passengers, and that agents ""did not have the authority to act independently and authorize higher levels of compensation or provide other modes of transportation and/or the right destination options.""In response, United said that effective Friday, it would raise its payout ceiling for travelers bumped from flights to $10,000. That followed a similar move by Delta Air Lines (DAL) after the incident.The company, which promised the review of the incident by April 30 after it drew worldwide anger, also said it would reduce overbookings.United said ""adjustments have been made to reduce overbookings on flights that historically have experienced lower volunteer rates, particularly flights on smaller aircraft and the last flights of the day to a particular destination.""Among the other changes United outlined the carrier said it would restrict use of law enforcement ""to safety and security issues only"" and not make passengers involuntarily give up their seat unless it posed a risk to security and safety. The carrier also said it would ""ensure crews are booked onto a flight at least 60 minutes prior to departure."" Those policies are already in place.Employees would also get more training and flexibility to resolve issues with passengers, United said. An app for employees that the company will make available this year is intended to help staff compensate passengers more easily when problems arise.The company also committed to creating a customer relations team — expected to be up and running by June — to help gate agents look at other options if flights are packed. Those could include using other airlines, nearby airports and even ground transit, United said.United also said it would develop an automated system to seek out people willing to change flights. That system, set to be introduced later this year, will have a new automated check-in process that will assess a person's willingness to deplane, for compensation, on overbooked flights.The carrier said there were 3,765 involuntary denied boarding incidents last year. The rate of such denials was down 44% from 2015 and below the average of airlines that report statistics to the Department of Transportation.United tends to overbook flights by ""less than 0-3 percent of the plane's seat capacity,"" it said. Roughly four percent of flights have more customers than seats.Delta retreated 1.3%, while American sank 5.1%. Southwest (LUV), which reported earnings today, lost 2%. 
"
334,DAL,"While notable hedge fund firms such as David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital, Dan Loeb's Third Point and David Tepper's Appaloosa Management trimmed or exited their Apple (AAPL) stake in the first quarter, one famously skittish tech investor made a massive grab for the iPhone maker — and reaped impressive returns.Here are some of the best and worst calls in Q1 by high-profile investors and hedge funds, as disclosed by their latest 13F filings. Rank-and-file investors closely track this regulatory data to get a sense of where the ""smart money"" is being put to work in the stock market.Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) loaded up on Apple in the first quarter, swelling its stake in the tech titan by more than 125% vs. the previous quarter to a total of 129.4 million shares. Shares of Apple have continued to sizzle in the second quarter of 2017, adding 8.8% through May 15 to take year-to-date gains to 35.5%.By comparison, the S&P 500 has gained roughly 2% so far in Q2 and 8% year to date, while the Dow Jones industrial average is up roughly 2% and 7% over the respective periods. And that's with Apple as the biggest weighting in both indexes.Buffett described Apple's resonance with customers as ""amazing"" in a recent CNBC interview. He also said Berkshire used its knowledge of the furniture business to evaluate Apple's worth and its edge over rivals.Apple shares edged down 0.15% to 155.47, their straight modest decline.Another move that paid off for Buffett, who is known to prize more established companies with an ""economic moat"" or durable competitive advantage: avoiding the flash and dazzle of one hot IPO.Snapchat owner Snap (SNAP) was snubbed by Buffett but scooped up by Third Point, Appaloosa and George Soros' Soros Fund Management, to their cost. Snap stock has lost 8% in Q2 and sits 17% below its closing price of 24.48 on March 2, when it made its highly anticipated stock market debut.Still, the hedge funds snapping up the stock may view it as an investment with solid long-term potential.Snap rose 0.1% to 20.76 after big gains the prior two sessions from last Thursday's post-IPO lows.In one of its biggest and best Q1 moves, Soros hiked its position in Facebook (FB) by more than 80% last quarter. The social networking leader has advanced 6% in the second quarter to date, building on a win streak that has seen the stock climb by more than 30% year to date.Soros Fund Management also upped its Goldman Sachs (GS) position by about 40% to 86,000 shares, with less luck.Goldman Sachs has slid a further 2% since the start of April, taking 2017's losses to nearly 6%. The S&P financial sector is flat so far in Q2 and up a mere 2.5% year to date, lagging the broad S&P 500.Soros' hedge fund may be buying the dip in financial stocks, anticipating a resumption in their five-year rally should improving economic conditions keep the Fed's tightening plans on pace.Facebook fell 0.3% to 149.78 as it consolidates tightly. Goldman rose 02.% to 225.60, still below its 50-day line.In Q1, Berkshire offloaded shares of International Business Machines (IBM), the seventh largest Dow component, and 21st Century Fox (FOX), which has been hit hard by scandals, in a big way.Dumping those stocks has buoyed Berkshire's investment portfolio. Shares of both companies are well off their recent 52-week highs. So far in Q2, IBM has tumbled 12% and Fox 13%, extending their hobbled run year to date.IBM rose 1.4%, adding to Monday's gains after tumbling sharply. Fox slid 1.4% extending its sell-off.In Q1, Berkshire grew its American Airlines (AAL) and Southwest Airlines (LUV) stakes significantly, maintained a position in United Airlines (UAL) and pared back Delta Air Lines (DAL).Those have been smart moves overall. Airline stocks have soared since the end of March despite adverse publicity, with some firms reporting that traffic growth has outpaced capacity increases.American and United are more than 10% higher in Q2; Southwest and Delta are up nearly 8%.United rose 1.4%, still in buy range. Southwest climbed 0.4% and American 0.6%, just below entry points. Delta was flat.Appaloosa's huge bet on an American industrial renaissance in Q1 hasn't paid off so far, but that could change. Most analysts remain bullish on the outlook for the industrials and materials sectors. Infrastructure spending under President Trump and China's One Road, One Belt project are two potential catalysts for companies in these sectors, including steel stocks.In Q2 so far, AK Steel (AKS) and Nucor (NUE) — Appaloosa's new buys from last quarter — are both in the red, down roughly 21% and 4% respectively. ArcelorMittal (MT), a position in the hedge fund that grew more than 400% in size, has given up 10% over the same period.AK Steel fell 0.5%, Nucor rose 0.3% on Tuesday. ArcelorMittal climbed 2.7%.In Q1, Third Point opened stakes in Parsley Energy (PE), Halcon Resources (HK) and Enerplus (ERF). The hedge fund may be of the view that the energy sector is oversold and could be due for a bounce in the medium term. Sector earnings and oil prices are highly correlated — and West Texas crude prices averaged $52 a barrel in the first quarter, up more than 50% year over year, following an OPEC-led deal on output cuts.In the near term, however, oil prices and energy stocks have been under pressure.Halcon has given up nearly 12% in the second quarter, extending 2017 losses to 27%. Parsely and Enerplus haven't fared much better this quarter, down 0.8% and up 0.8% respectively.Parsley sank 1.3%, Halcon 3.7% and Enerplus 0.5% on Tuesday.RELATED:Buffett's Berkshire Stays Away From Snap, But Not These FundsBuffett, Soros Moves Keep Delta, American In Holding PatternWhat Will Berkshire Filing Show As Loeb Cuts Facebook, Apple Stakes?Why Buffett Still Isn't Sure If He'd Buy Amazon, Alphabet Stock Now

335,DAL,"Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) hiked its stake in Apple (AAPL) by more than 125% to 129.4 million shares in the first quarter, and made modest changes to its airlines holdings while avoiding Snapchat parent Snap (SNAP), which went public in March.Meanwhile, Soros Fund Management bought 1.7 million shares of Snap, joining David Tepper's Appaloosa Management and Dan Loeb's Third Point. Soros also dissolved his firm's positions in Amazon.com (AMZN) and Delta Air Lines (DAL), and added to its stake in Facebook (FB), according to filings late Monday.David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital trimmed its Apple holdings to 4.2 million shares from 6.1 million in Q4, while more than quadrupling its stake in General Motors (GM) to 55 million shares from 13 million.In Q1, Berkshire grew its American Airlines (AAL) stake to 49.3 million shares, up 8.4% vs. the previous quarter, and its investment in Southwest Airlines (LUV) to 47.7 million, up 10.4%. It trimmed its position in Delta to 55 million shares, down 8.3%, while keeping its holdings in United Airlines (UAL) steady at 28.9 million.The regulatory filing confirmed news from early May that Berkshire's Buffett busily dumped tech giant IBM (IBM) in Q1. It had 64.6 million shares left at quarter-end, down 20%. (Even IBM Retirement Fund's unloaded 70,000 shares of IBM, leaving it with 12,451 IBM shares in Q1, according to the fund's 13F filing on May 10.)Meanwhile, the conglomerate's massive long-term stakes in Coca-Cola (KO), American Express (AXP) and Kraft Heinz (KHC) were left basically unchanged.Buffett had already said Berkshire more than doubled its Apple holdings in Q1, giving it a 2.5% stake in the iPhone maker's outstanding shares. Berkshire initiated a position in Apple, worth $1.1 billion, in Q1 2016 and doubled down on Apple as the year progressed.By contrast, Appaloosa Management slashed its stake in 2017's best-performing Dow component Apple by a third, to 300,000 shares, and trimmed Facebook by 12.6%, to 1.9 million shares in Q1, according to filings from Friday. The company also scooped up 100,000 shares of Snap, which tanked 17.5% last week on a dismal debut earnings reports following its March IPO.Similarly, Third Point exited its 1.85 million-share stake in Apple during Q1, while buying 2.25 million shares of Snap.Shares of Berkshire closed up 0.3% at 163.76 on the stock market today. Apple dipped 0.3%, down from Friday's fresh record high, and Snap rallied 8.4%, after last week's plunge. Facebook eased 0.1%, and IBM added 0.7%.Among Appaloosa's other notable moves, the fund entirely liquidated its massive stakes in two troubled stocks: chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) and retailer J.C. Penney (JCP).Appaloosa added a 1.6 million-share stake in Symantec (SYMC), which was leading a cybersecurity stock rally Monday on the heels of a global ransomware attack. Appaloosa also raised its Western Digital (WDC) stake by 16.1% to 1.3 million shares.But the hedge fund's biggest bet seems to be on an American industrial renaissance. It opened positions of roughly half a million shares each in AK Steel (AKS) and Nucor (NUE), while upping ArcelorMittal (MT) by more than 410%, to nearly 5 million shares.Other hefty new positions included Bank of America (BAC) and CBS (CBS) (8.8 million and 1.0 million shares, respectively).Third Point's other moves include adding to positions in T-Mobile (TMUS), Salesforce (CRM), Qualcomm and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD).The fund closed a small stake in Goldman Sachs (GS), and reduced holdings in Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase (JPM).Late Friday, Trian Fund Management also disclosed bigger positions in General Electric (GE) and Procter & Gamble (PG) and a smaller stake in DuPont (DD).RELATED:What Will Berkshire Filing Show As Loeb Cuts Facebook, Apple Stakes?Why Buffett Still Isn't Sure If He'd Buy Amazon, Alphabet Stock Now

336,DAL,"When Berkshire Hathaway (BKRB) CEO Warren Buffett loaded up on airline stocks last year, he reportedly did so because years of mergers consolidated the industry into a handful of large carriers that kept a lid on competition for passengers and made business more stable.But as Thursday's market freakout over American Airlines' (AAL) higher labor costs shows, airlines still have to battle each other aggressively on employee pay and costs, even as the ""wide moat"" that drew Buffett to the sector protects the carriers from new entrants.What's more, airlines still remain competitive on adding seats and flights to different parts of the world. American in January suggested that it might ratchet up domestic flight capacity, and United defended its own growth plans. Moves like that, as they have over the past two years, threaten to raise investors' stress about more competition and fare discounts that erode profits and returns.American late Wednesday said it wants the pay of its pilots and flight attendants to equal that of rival carriers. Wall Street got mad Thursday, and shares closed down 5.2% on the stock market today, after sinking as much as 8.6% earlier.Southwest (LUV) added to worries about higher expenses in the airline sector when it reported Q1 earnings that missed forecasts, with costs weighing there too. Shares fell 2.1%.Delta Air Lines (DAL) lost 1.4,% and United Airlines (UAL) dipped 0.9%. JetBlue (JBLU) edged 0.5% lower, and Alaska Air Group (ALK) sank 3.8%, while Hawaiian Holdings (HA) rose 0.1%. Berkshire Hathaway shares dropped 0.6%American said the higher pay would raise costs by some $230 million this year — hitting EPS as much as 35 cents per share, Cowen analysts said — and $350 million for next year and 2019, which could impact EPS by up to 50 cents.In a statement Wednesday, American Airlines CEO Doug Parker and President Robert Isom said the proposed midcontract pay raises follow a commitment after its merger to compensate staff on the same level as its rivals.""But as our industry has rapidly evolved and pay increases at other airlines have accelerated, some of our colleagues have fallen behind their peers at other airlines in base pay rates,"" the statement said. ""And, unless their current contracts are modified, they'll remain far behind for more than two years.""But the potential pay hike worried some analysts.""We are troubled by AAL's wealth transfer of nearly $1 billion to its labor groups,"" JPMorgan analysts said in a research note quoted by Reuters. ""In addition to raising fixed costs, American's agreement with its labor stakeholders establishes a worrying precedent, in our view, both for American and the industry.""Pilots and flight attendants ratified new five-year contracts in 2014 and 2015, ahead of pay raises at American's two biggest rivals. However, the statement added that currently, pilot hourly pay rates were roughly 8% lower than the industry's best, while rates for flight attendants were around 4% lower. The pressure from labor groups has been building.""While the move is a drag on earnings, it likely removes an overhang on the shares,"" Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth wrote in a research note.The proposal needs union approval, and management said ""we do not expect disagreement."" Other analysts, however, expressed caution about the response from workers.""We believe there is some risk that they think they should be paid more than Delta and United employees,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note. ""Giving pay increases out of negotiations is risky and could backfire.""Southwest, meanwhile, said it expected unit costs, excluding fuel and other items, to rise around 6% in Q2, based on current cost patterns.In Q1, Southwest said costs rose ""due to the significant snap up in wage rates"" following its own new contract for flight attendants and pilots that took hold in Q4. Costs were also up due to the preparation of a new reservation system.EPS during the quarter fell 31% to 61 cents, after industry profits were padded a year ago by cheap fuel prices, missing estimates for 63 cents. Revenue slipped 1% to $4.883 billion, missing views of $4.92 billion.Still, Southwest forecast positive unit revenue, or sales as they relate to an airline's flight capacity, in Q2.As for American, its quarterly results and forecast on Thursday remained solid despite the potential extra labor costs and sees Q2 unit revenue rising 3%-5%, reflecting better demand in corporate and leisure travel. Adjusted pretax margins in Q2 are expected to come in at 11%-13%.Q1 EPS plunged 51% to 61 cents, after cheap fuel padded profits a year earlier. Those results topped estimates for 57 cents. Revenue ticked up 2% to $9.624 billion, just shy of expectations for $9.629 billion.The company said that results so far in its Basic Economy fare class were ""encouraging.""""Approximately 50% of customers who are presented with a choice for Basic Economy end up choosing a Main Cabin fare, showing that they understand their options and are choosing the ticket that's the right fit for their travel,"" Isom said in a statement.Meanwhile, United said it would raise its payout ceiling for travelers bumped from flights to $10,000 after one such passenger was dragged from a plane earlier this month. The company, which promised a review of that incident by April 30, after it drew worldwide anger, also said it would reduce overbookings, among a series of other policy changes.RELATED:Delta Says It Handles Overbookings Better Than Rivals; Outlook StrongDelta, American, United Go Guns Blazing Into Battle Of The Atlantic

337,DAL,"Gulf carrier Emirates, one of the biggest international rivals to Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL), will soon reduce flights to to Boston, Los Angeles, Seattle, Orlando, Fla., and Fort Lauderdale, Fla., amid the Trump administration's attempts to restrict travel from parts of the Muslim world.Emirates' announcement comes as analysts try to gauge the impact of President Trump's executive order, which is held up in court, to suspend travel from a handful of largely Muslim nations as well as the administration's ban on large electronic devices on direct U.S.-bound flights from some Middle-Eastern airports.""The recent actions taken by the U.S. government relating to the issuance of entry visas, heightened security vetting and restrictions on electronic devices in aircraft cabins, have had a direct impact on consumer interest and demand for air travel into the U.S.,"" Emirates said in the statement, according to Bloomberg. ""Over the past three months, we have seen a significant deterioration in the booking profiles on all our U.S. routes, across all travel segments.""An analysis by ForwardKeys in March showed international bookings the U.S. fell in the days after Trump's first attempt at a ban.The U.S. network carriers have complained that their Persian Gulf rivals get an unfair advantage because they receive government subsidies to compete, a claim the Gulf carriers deny.That has prompted some to speculate that the electronics restrictions were an attempt by the administration to steer travelers away from the Gulf carriers, which have said they would offer loaner devices to some customers to get around the restrictions.Shares of Delta closed up 1.5% on the stock market today. American rallied 1.35% and United climbed 2.3% after sinking 4.3% Tuesday.IBD'S TAKE: While Trump's second attempt at a travel ban is tied up in court, here's a look at the implications for the big U.S. airlines. While travel to the U.S. is slowing, demand for travel in China has risen by double digits, Emirates' chief commercial offer, Thierry Antinori, told Bloomberg earlier.Those results would gibe with projections from the International Air Transport Association, which anticipates that China would be a bigger air-travel market than any other by 2024.Delta and American have recently put more focus on the trans-Pacific region, either through joint-venture agreements or investments, as low-cost competition escalates in the airspace above the Atlantic.Meanwhile, United must repair its reputation in the region after its forcible removal of an Asian passenger drew allegations of racism and a widespread backlash in China. But the company said Tuesday that Asia had been a particularly high-pressure market.RELATED:Delta Says It Handles Overbookings Better Than Rivals; Outlook StrongUnited Won't Commit To Ending Denied Boardings; Defends Capacity Growth Plan

338,DAL,"For the past two years, airline executives have done their share of groveling before analysts, vowing to be more humble in their ambitions to control the skies so as not to deluge the market with additional service when demand isn't there.Not so on Tuesday with United Airlines (UAL).President Scott Kirby gave a more impassioned defense of the company's growth plans — or, in industry speak, ""capacity"" — than has been normal for earnings conference calls since 2015. During that year, cheap oil enticed airlines to broaden their flight coverage a bit more than Wall Street was comfortable with.""You guys used to get on this earnings call and beat them up about why aren't their finances good,"" Kirby said on United's first-quarter earnings call on Tuesday. ""And you gave them a cure for that, which was 'Cut capacity, cut capacity, cut capacity.' And it just made the problem worse.""That remark came in response to a question about how United's growth plans might impact margins. United has said it wants to boost margins by gaining or reclaiming market share. However, management stressed that it didn't view their capacity growth — expected to be up 2.5% to 3.5% this year — as invading a rival's turf but reclaiming what was United's ""natural"" share.""Despite taking the same medicine quarter after quarter and the numbers got worse and worse and worse — that was part of the problem,"" Kirby continued. ""When the airline was cutting capacity and taking regional jets out of places ... like Rochester, Minnesota, and redeploying them in places like Newark and Atlanta, in order to keep capacity low — that was driving margins lower.""United did not provide a clear timeline as to when such ""natural"" share might be fully reclaimed. But any attempt to expand could result in attempts by rivals Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL) and Southwest (LUV) to match it.That means more expansion and lower fares to lure consumers. That's better for travelers, but not so much for investors because it hurts financial results. Investors appeared to be reacting to that possibility.Shares of United finished down 4.3% on the stock market today, while Delta edged up 0.1%, American fell 1%, and Southwest lost 0.55%.In a research note, Cowen analyst Helane Becker noted that United's capacity plans are not new. She also said there has been ""very little competitive response"" to United's capacity moves, beyond those from American in Chicago.United has in recent months advanced into smaller cities in an attempt to reclaim customers lost to rivals. Other remarks made during the call indicated a strategy that held off selling tickets for some seats until it was closer to departure time.""In the past, we forced many of our best customers to fly on our competitors, because we were sold out,"" management said earlier in the call.RELATED:Delta Says It Handles Overbookings Better Than Rivals; Outlook StrongDelta, American, United Go Guns Blazing Into Battle Of The Atlantic

339,DAL,"A week after police dragged a passenger off a sold-out flight and a creature described as a scorpion stung another passenger on a separate flight, United Airlines (UAL) topped Q1 forecasts Monday but predicted capacity will grow at a faster rate this year and exceed Delta Air Lines' (DAL) planned expansion.Estimates: EPS to drop 69% to 38 cents, a reflection of higher fuel costs. Revenue is expected to increase 2% to $8.379 billion. United has said it expects unit revenue to be ""approximately flat.""Results: EPS of 41 cents on revenue of $8.42 billion, as unit revenue was flat.Outlook: Q2 passenger unit revenue up 1%-3%, with capacity up 3%-4%. Adjusted Q2 pre-tax margin of 10%-12%, and unit costs, excluding fuel, profit-sharing and other expenses, rising 4%-5% after a 5% Q1 gain. Full-year capacity to grow 2.5%-3.5% after rising 1.4% in 2016. By contrast, Delta said last week it will cap full-year capacity growth at 1%.Shares: United rose 1% late. Shares closed up 2.5% on the stock market today, after dropping 2.5% last week. American Airlines (AAL) added 0.5% late after finishing up 2%, back above its 50-day. Delta edged up 0.5% later after ending up 0.7%, holding above its 200-day moving average after a post-earnings reversal on Wednesday and Thursday.After being called everything from insensitive to racist, United apologized multiple times for the police's forcible removal of the passenger, David Dao, whose attorney last week indicated that a lawsuit was likely to result.Thomas Demetrio, one of Dao's attorneys, said Dao had broken his nose, lost two of his front teeth and suffered a concussion after authorities wrestled him from his seat when he refused to give it up.The dispute over his seat and the police's response arose when United randomly selected him and a few others to deboard a plane headed from Chicago to Louisville, Ky., to accommodate crew who were boarding the plane to work another flight.United's conference call to discuss the results takes place on Tuesday. Listeners will likely be keyed in to any further commentary management offers about the incident and if it's having any impact on ticket bookings.""It is obvious from recent experiences that we need to do a much better job serving our customers,"" CEO Oscar Munoz said in a statement Monday. ""The incident that took place aboard Flight 3411 has been a humbling experience, and I take full responsibility. This will prove to be a watershed moment for our company, and we are more determined than ever to put our customers at the center of everything we do. We are dedicated to setting the standard for customer service among U.S. airlines, as we elevate the experience our customers have with us from booking to baggage claim.""In an email on Friday, United said crew now have to book so-called ""must ride"" flights at least an hour before takeoff, as opposed the previous policy that allowed them to book up to the departure time, the Associated Press reported.The carrier on Thursday said it was ""committing that United will not ask law enforcement officers to remove passengers from our flights unless it is a matter of safety and security."" Results of a review and steps United will take to make things right will be presented by April 30.Following the United incident, Delta has also allowed staff to pay as much as $2,000 to get passengers to give up their seats on over-packed flights, up from $800. In special circumstances, the payout is allowed run as high as $9,950.Delta, on its earnings call last Wednesday, called overbooking a ""valid business process,"" and said it had a lower number of involuntary boarding denials than rivals. The carrier at that time also said additional regulations on overbooking were not needed, but it didn't say whether it was concerned that more rules would result.GOP New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has called on the Trump administration to temporarily suspend overbookings. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., meanwhile, is pushing a bill that would ""prohibit airlines from forcibly removing passengers after they have already boarded the plane due to overbooking or airline staff seeking to fly as passengers.""The Transportation Department is reviewing the incident on the United flight. However, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the matter likely didn't need a federal response.President Trump, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, called the incident ""horrible"" and said United should have offered to pay more.""Government intervention should be a concern for investors, as any changes could have financial implications,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note on Monday. ""We expect United's comments tomorrow will be highly scrutinized.""RELATED:Delta, American, United Go Guns Blazing Into Battle Of The Atlantic

341,DAL,"United Airlines (UAL) would not say on Tuesday whether it would end the involuntary bumping of passengers from flights following widespread outrage after security last Sunday dragged one such passenger from a sold-out Louisville-bound flight.Calling that incident the product of flaws within the company's entire system, CEO Oscar Munoz also said he hadn't considered firing any employee afterward. The forceful removal of the passenger, David Dao, has raised questions about the way airlines book flights amid pressure from Wall Street to squeeze more profits out of passengers.The remarks came during United's first-quarter earnings call, one in which executives repeated that the carrier needed to do better following the incident. The carrier has promised the present the results of a review by April 30.But as calls grow for tighter regulations on the overbooking practices airlines use to ensure packed planes, United has forecast higher flight-capacity growth for the year than Delta Air Lines (DAL), which has capped its own growth plans.Analysts during the call questioned management about the impact United's plans to add service, particularly in smaller cities, would have on margins.United tried to emphasize that its growth plans weren't intended to invade a rival's market but were more about reclaiming United's ""natural market share"" and ""restoring United to where it should have been."" But the carrier was unable to offer a clear timeline as to when it might fully reclaim that share, which would give investors a clearer picture of when fundamentals might improve.Shares sank 4.3% to 67.75 in the stock market today. Delta, which issued earnings last week, rose 0.1%, while American Airlines (AAL) sank about 1%.United in a slide presentation also said that the carrier ""now has more seats available for close in business traffic."" Moves to keep more seats open, management said, have helped the carrier reclaim customers.United on Monday reported first-quarter results that topped views, and it forecast positive unit revenue for the second quarter — the first time in two years. The company, in its earnings release, said it was ""obvious from recent experiences that we need to do a much better job serving our customers.""U.S. and state politicians have called for halting airlines' overbooking practices and legislation that prevents the forceful removal of passengers due to overbooking or crew accommodations.United, in response to the incident, has said it would ""not ask law enforcement officers to remove passengers from our flights unless it is a matter of safety and security."" The carrier's crew members must also book ""must-ride"" flights at least an hour before takeoff.The potential financial fallout from the United incident is unclear. United, along with Delta and American, dominate much of the U.S.' airspace, and the barrier of entry for new competition in the airline industry is high.""This fiasco where a man was dragged off a UAL plane is a classic media-driven overreaction, in our view,"" Wolfe Research analyst Hunter Keay wrote in a research note dated Friday. ""While truly a bad situation that (1) shouldn't have happened and (2) UAL handled badly afterward, we expect it will blow over. These things usually do. But we do believe policy changes are likely.""Delta has raised the ceiling on how much it will pay passengers to get off planes. And on its earnings call last week, Delta cited statistics it said showed that it managed overbookings and so-called involuntary denied boardings better than rivals. Overbooking, management said, was a ""valid business process,"" but stressed the importance of handling it the right way.United on Tuesday said that its corporate accounts were still ""supportive"" and ""want us to fix this."" But the company said it was too early to gauge the impact on leisure travel or demand in China, where some on social media said Dao's removal was racist because he was Asian.Munoz said he had spoken with and would continue to speak with Chinese officials about the matter on a trip to China he had previously planned.IBD'S TAKE: For more about what U.S. airlines are doing to compete with a new type of low-cost, long-haul carrier, read this story. Cascend Securities Chief Strategist told MarketWatch that he did ""expect to see a purchase decline of some level for tickets but the data doesn't imply how bad it could or could not be.""Keay said he expected that United would end involuntary denied boardings. And he added that if United paid $3,000 each to the 3,765 passengers that were involuntarily denied boarding last year, it would have hit United's earnings per share by 0.3%.He likened United's PR difficulties to a situation in 2012, when Spirit Airlines (SAVE) initially declined to refund a Marine veteran, Jerry Meekins, who had said he found out his cancer was terminal shortly after the purchase.After Meekins' doctors told him he shouldn't fly, he tried, unsuccessfully, to get a refund from Spirit. Spirit's CEO defended the airline's decision, arguing that the man hadn't paid extra for insurance.

342,DAL,"United Airlines (UAL) apologized one more time Thursday as the injuries suffered by a passenger dragged off a flight Sunday became clearer — as well as the prospects for a lawsuit.Thomas Demetrio, an attorney for David Dao, said Dao will ""probably"" bring a lawsuit against the carrier after suffering a concussion, a broken nose and sinus damage that will require reconstructive surgery when Chicago police violently removed him from a flight headed to Louisville.Demetrio also said the city of Chicago could also be liable for the incident. One of police officers involved was placed on administrative leave following the incident for not observing standard procedures.Soon after the news conference, United issued another statement.""We continue to express our sincerest apology to Dr. Dao,"" United said. ""We cannot stress enough that we remain steadfast in our commitment to make this right.""United shares closed down 1.2% on the stock market today. Delta Air Lines (DAL) tumbled 2.3%, and American Airlines (AAL) fell 1.4%.United CEO Oscar Munoz apologized Tuesday and vowed ""to fix what's broken so this never happens again"" and said United will conduct a review of crew movement, passenger incentives on oversold flights, and partnerships with airport authorities and law enforcement. The results are due by the end of the month.But Munoz's apology came after an earlier memo to employees leaked Monday in which he said the airline had ""followed established procedures"" and called the passenger ""disruptive and belligerent.""The United incident sparked global outrage on social media after the videos emerged of Dao being forcibly removed from his seat and dragged down the aisle by the police. Some users on China's Weibo (WB) microblogging site speculated that the man was discriminated against for being Asian and others called for a boycott of the airline.But Cascend Securities Chief Strategist Eric Ross told Market Watch that the backlash so far hasn't impacted ticket sales vs. other airlines, but he does ""expect to see a purchase decline of some level for tickets, but the data doesn't imply how bad it could or could not actually be.""RELATED: Delta Says It Handles Overbookings Better Than Rivals; Outlook Strong 
"
343,DAL,"XDelta Air Lines (DAL) on Wednesday said that more legislation to regulate the overbooking of flights wasn't necessary and called the practice a ""valid business process,"" and it emphasized that it handled involuntary boarding denials better than rivals.The remarks from the carrier, on a conference call to discuss first-quarter earnings, came after New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie on Tuesday called for a halt to the rule that enables airlines to overbook flights after a passenger was dragged from a sold-out United Express flight on Sunday.Delta, however, would not comment on whether it was concerned that more regulations on overbooking were coming. The airline said that managing overbooked flights before boarding was crucial and that the process wasn't a ""significant challenge"" for them.Delta on Wednesday said it had 1,200 involuntary boarding denials last year. That was five times better than other major carriers, it said.Government data, as reported elsewhere, has shown that Delta had the lowest rate of involuntary removals last year and from 2008 through 2016 among major U.S. airlines. United, the data shows, has reduced the rate at which it bumps passengers against their will.Delta sees passenger unit revenue, the metric that Wall Street zeros in on to gauge an airline's efficiency, rising 1%-3% in Q2. That was in line with Wall Street forecasts for a 2% gain. Second-quarter capacity was seen as flat to up 1%. Full-year capacity growth will be capped at 1%.Delta earned 77 cents per share in the first quarter, above estimates for 75 cents. Revenue of $9.148 billion was shy of expectations for $9.184 billion. Total passenger unit revenue edged down 0.5% but was positive in March for the first time since November 2015.""We expect the entirety of our 2017 margin pressure to have occurred in the March quarter from higher fuel prices,"" said CFO Paul Jacobson in a statement. ""With an improving revenue profile and further improvement as our cost growth moderates in the second half, we are on track to expand margins for the balance of the year.""Delta fell 0.5% to 45.05 on the stock market today, reversing from morning highs of 47.17 as broader averages retreated. American Airlines (AAL) clung to a 0.1% gain. United Airlines (UAL), which reports Monday, briefly erased its weekly losses and peeked above its 50-day line, but retreated for a 1.1% decline.Delta's outlook comes after the carrier this month canceled around 4,000 flights following heavy thunderstorms around Atlanta. Management said the storm will reduce its Q2 pretax income by $125 million.Delta, during the earnings call, said the carrier was not understaffed, but that a combination of severe storms around Atlanta during the spring-break travel season limited what it could do to accommodate passengers. The carrier said it was investing in technology to help better track crews to minimize disruption.The carrier said it had completed its expansion of its basic economy fare option in the U.S. and Canada. It described its recent joint-venture agreement with Korean Air as a ""game-changer"" and said alliances in the trans-Pacific region were ""crucial.""IBD'S TAKE: U.S. airlines have paid more attention to Asia, where a massive upswing in travel demand is expected in the years to come. Meanwhile, they also face more competition from low-cost carriers in Europe. But Delta's flight cancellations and United's difficulties have brought more scrutiny over the way airlines manage bookings — and the dignity that carriers afford passengers.The industry has used higher-end fares and business travel to drive unit revenue while testing the boundaries for ""economy"" seating amid ultra-low-cost competition. Wall Street has pressed for fuller flights and limited availability — moves that can squeeze airfares and profits higher and boost airline stocks. Airlines also regularly overbook flights as a hedge against people who don't end up aboard the plane.United has drawn sweeping condemnation after video posted on social media showed police wrestling a passenger, David Dao, from his seat and dragging him by his wrists down the aisle of a sold-out United Express flight heading to Louisville, Ky., from Chicago.The situation arose after the carrier said it needed four passengers to give up their seats to accommodate crew members needed for another flight. After a voucher offer didn't work, the carrier selected passengers to leave. Dao refused; authorities dragged him away.In an interview with ABC News' ""Good Morning America"" broadcast Wednesday, United CEO Oscar Munoz said he felt ""shame"" watching the incident. He said that in the future the carrier would not use a law enforcement official to remove ""a booked, paid, seating passenger. We can't do that.""United Airlines later said it would reimburse tickets for everyone on the flight.Since the incident occurred, United has appeared to try to balance defending its reputation while standing by its employees. Munoz said language used in prior remarks — including an apology for ""having to reaccommodate"" passengers, which drew ridicule given what video footage showed — ""fell short"" of what he and the company were feeling.He called the incident a ""system failure"" and said United needed to look at the way it offers incentives to passengers once they board planes.""We have not provided our front-line supervisors and managers and individuals with the proper tools, policies, procedures that allow them to use their common sense,"" Munoz said. ""They all have an incredible amount of common sense, and this issue could have been solved by that. That's on me. I have to fix that.""He said he hasn't spoken to Dao and that the company's attempts to reach him have been unsuccessful. Munoz told ABC he had not considered resigning.On Tuesday, Munoz said the carrier would conduct a review of its relationships with airport and local authorities and the way it handles oversold flights and present the findings in some form by April 30.RELATED:What The New Travel Ban Means For Airlines, Travel Demand

345,DAL,"Financial markets didn't skip a beat last week as reports emerged that President Trump would sign a new order on Friday blocking citizens of Iran and six other predominantly Muslim nations from traveling to the U.S.But it's not surprising that stocks woke up on the wrong side of the bed on Monday after the messy rollout of a policy that temporarily invalidated green cards, stranded hundreds of travelers at airports, sparked large protests and drew condemnation from countries around the world.American Airlines (AAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL) led a downdraft among airline stocks after airport protests that didn't exactly present the most inviting picture to welcome travelers. Delta was itself a big part of the news coverage after Trump tweeted that the company's technological snafu that grounded flights was the real cause of weekend chaos at airports.Apple (AAPL) and Starbucks (SBUX) were among the U.S. companies that tried to distance themselves from the policy. Chief Executive Tim Cook said Apple ""would not exist without immigration,"" since Steve Jobs' father came from Syria, target of Trump's indefinite refugee ban.Starbucks committed to hiring 10,000 refugees in the next five years in the 75 countries where it does business. Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google said it's putting up $2 million for groups including the American Civil Liberties Union that work to secure legal protections for immigrants and refugees.Companies have reason to be worried about the symbolism and the real impact on some foreign-born employees. For investors, the moves may lower confidence that Trump will be able to execute his agenda of tax cuts and infrastructure spending that have fueled the market's postelection rally.IBD'S TAKE: If the WTO found the border tax to be illegal, the GOP would face three difficult choices that could throw the ruling party into crisis.Google said it recalled workers on H-1B visas from targeted countries amid concern that they wouldn't be able to return to the U.S. under Trump's order. Now tech companies, in particular, are bracing for another executive order on reform to the H-1B program that provides visas to workers in specialized occupations. Shares of computer services firms including Wipro (WIP) and Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) were under pressure on Monday.For the broad market, the bigger concern is that Trump may be alienating those who he will need to deliver on his agenda. Above all, he'll need the support of at least 49 of 52 Senate Republicans to pass corporate tax reform, which is shaping up to be a contentious battle. The White House is signaling support of House Speaker Paul Ryan's plan for a border-adjusted tax that big importers like Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT) are gearing up to fight.While few GOP senators have taken a position on the House approach, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., tweeted that anything that slaps a border tax on Corona would be ""mucho sad."" After Graham and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., criticized Trump's immigration order for making America less safe, Trump lashed out with his own tweet, calling the two ""sadly weak on immigration.""Bloomberg News reported over the weekend that the White House now views the House border-tax plan favorably, calling it the ""most nationalist"" way to reform the corporate tax code. Yet, assuming Trump can find the votes to pass it, the big corporate tax cut could end up backfiring if the World Trade Organization rules that it is illegal, as many experts expect it to do. With Trump praising Brexit, dissing the European Union, sparring with Mexico and bellowing ""America First,"" the chances that the WTO will give America the benefit of any doubt are looking increasingly unlikely.It's not yet clear if Trump's infrastructure package will need Democratic votes to pass, but the wildly anti-Trump sentiment on the left makes it harder for Democratic lawmakers to meet him halfway. At the moment the opposition party is setting a high hurdle for Trump to win their support, laying out their own $1 trillion government-funded package that bares little resemblance to the White House approach of offering $137 billion worth of tax credits as an incentive for the private sector to undertake massive infrastructure projects.All of these challenges come on top of huge uncertainty and disagreement among Republicans about their first order of business: Repealing ObamaCare on a party-line vote and then, somehow, figuring out to replace it without blowing up the individual insurance market.RELATED:Trump Tax Fears: Wal-Mart, Target, Macy's Hit New LowsTrump Wall Stocks Caterpillar, Materials Firms Breaking Out

347,DAL,"American Airlines (AAL) on Wednesday hiked its forecast for total fourth-quarter unit revenue, following similar moves by United Airlines (UAL) and other rivals. Meanwhile, the Justice Department reportedly has not discovered any evidence to justify antitrust action after an investigation into whether the four major U.S. carriers colluded to prop up ticket prices.American Airlines said it expected total unit revenue to be flat to up 2% in the fourth quarter, potentially becoming the first of the major U.S. carriers to turn the metric positive. That's better than the carrier's forecast last month for a 1% decline to a 1% gain.The carrier also forecast improving Q4 adjusted pretax margin — 7%-9%, compared to earlier guidance for 6%-8%. Margins could become a bigger focus for investors as unit revenue improves.American cited ""improving yields,"" a measure of an airline's pricing power on airfares, as the primary reason for the more bullish outlook.The forecast comes a day after Southwest (LUV) and United Airlines (UAL) bumped up their outlooks for Q4 unit revenue, which measures an airline's revenue as it pertains to capacity. Last week, Delta Air Lines (DAL), which reports fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday, also raised its Q4 unit revenue estimates.American closed up 0.3% at 48.64 in the stock market today. United Airlines gained 1.9% in the wake of its late Tuesday news on December traffic and Q4 unit revenue. Southwest Airlines advanced 0.7%. Delta Air added 1%. Capacity control, improving demand and pricing trends, an investment from Warren Buffett and the election of Donald Trump have all lifted airline stocks.IBD'S TAKE: After a run that began around the fall, some analysts expect the sector to take a breather. Cowen & Co. recently downgraded much of the industry, sparing Delta and Southwest. The Justice Department hasn't found evidence that the four major U.S. airlines colluded on pricing and capacity plans, the Wall Street Journal reported. The probe, which began in 2015, hasn't officially concluded, the Journal said. A law professor told the WSJ that the incoming Trump administration seemed unlikely to pursue the investigation.The DOJ probe came under fire from the outset. As the investigation got underway, cheap fuel prompted the airlines to aggressively expand, pushing airfares lower. Unit revenue turned negative at the beginning of 2015 and hasn't been positive since.For the month of December, American said traffic fell 0.8%, while capacity rose 0.5%.RELATED:Can Delta, United, American Declare Mission Accomplished In 2017?

348,DAL,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) on Thursday said it could have difficulty retaining market share in the skies above the Atlantic, adding that it had ""further segmentation to do"" as competition with low-cost carriers escalates.The remarks come as low-cost carriers and international rivals chip away at the major U.S. airlines' dominance of the airspace here and over the Atlantic. Iceland's Wow air, Canada's WestJet and Norwegian Air Shuttle all offer cheap flights across the Atlantic, while Gulf carriers like Emirates and Etihad have stepped up service to the U.S.Delta appears to have settled on so-called segmentation — the seemingly endless dividing-up of a plane's cabin into different fare classes — as the way to compete amid the rise of cheap seats. The carrier hopes to have its ""basic economy"" available across its fleet in 2018.""You look at what Norwegian [offers], they don't have flat beds,"" Delta President Glen Hauenstein said on a conference call. ""If you look at what a lot of the ultra low-cost carriers — they haven't made that investment in those types of products. And we need to adjust to that new paradigm.""Delta shares closed down 1.1% at 50.89 in the stock market today, but well off intraday lows and still in buy range. United Airlines (UAL), which reports Q4 results on Tuesday, fell 1.4%. American Airlines (AAL) lost 1.1%, and Southwest (LUV) fell 1.3%.Delta management during the call also found a lot to like about the incoming Trump administration, adding that the company has ""already provided some input in to the transition team."" Delta said it was excited about tax reform, the chance to improve airports in a bigger infrastructure overhaul, as well as the potential chance to keep Gulf rivals at bay.""We're very excited to the opportunity to present our case for the Middle Eastern situation, with all the growth that those carriers have brought to this country on a subsidized basis, where we are competing against governments, not ... airlines,"" CEO Ed Bastian said.Delta, American and United have said government funding of some Gulf airlines has allowed them to expand aggressively and more easily compete on airfare, although the Gulf carriers have denied those claims. The big U.S. carriers hope the government will restrict those airlines' U.S. operations.Still, Delta said that consumer confidence was strong and that the outlook for corporate travel spending was the best the company has seen in two years.Earnings per share fell 31% to 82 cents, in line with analyst views. Revenue edged lower to $9.46 billion, slightly above forecasts for $9.41 billion. Unit revenue fell 2.7% vs. a year earlier, better than the initial guidance given in October for a drop of 3%-5%.And the carrier said that, at least in the U.S., rebounding ticket sales from business travel were the ultimately bigger factor in helping to improve unit revenue, which the company said would be flat to up 2% overall in the first quarter — potentially the first time the key metric would turn positive in two years.Higher fuel and labor costs will pressure margins in the first half of 2017, but Delta said improving unit revenue should bring it back to margin expansion starting in the second half. February and March are likely to be better months than January for Q1 unit revenue, the carrier said. Q1 capacity should be flat to down 1%.The carrier said the pressure on margins is ""likely to peak"" in Q1. Delta forecast Q1 operating margin of 11%-13%. The company expects unit costs to rise 5%-7%.""We will remain conservative and keep our capacity growth in check until we see a further firming of these revenue trends in the near-term and longer-term, a return to our 17%-19% operating margin target,"" said Hauenstein in Delta's earnings statement.Earlier in the day, Bastian also said Trump's election had helped fuel demand.""There was no question post the election that we saw an improvement,"" he told CNBC. ""You see in the marketplace. You see it in some optimism with respect to starting to get things done in Washington. We saw it in our results.""IBD'S TAKE: Airlines' unit-revenue forecasts have improved on the prospect of higher fuel costs, capacity discipline, stronger close-in booking trends and postelection consumer confidence. In the quarters to come, margins and costs could become more of a focus following airlines' labor dealsAlso Thursday, JetBlue (JBLU) said December traffic rose 4.5% on a 3.1% capacity increase. Load factor widened to 84.1% from 83%. Shares sank 4.2%.United and American have also rolled out barer-bones, basic economy seating classes to win back customers seeking cheap fares.But as airlines continue to chop up cabin space, Delta was asked on the call if standard coach class was slowly going extinct. Hauenstein said that the main cabin was still where Delta made most of its money.""The death of the main cabin, I think, it's premature to prognosticate on that,"" he said.RELATED:American Lifts Unit Revenue View; DOJ Backs Off Collusion CaseUnited, Southwest Raise Q4 Unit Revenue Views, Joining Delta

349,DAL,"Boeing (BA) will add more rows to a planned 737 Max 10X plane that could launch in 2020, as it also readies a new midsize plane that can take on the Airbus (EADSY) A321neo, which has filled a market niche that Boeing exited years ago.The Max 10X will carry 190-230 people, or 10-15 more than the 737 Max 9, but will have the same engines as the rest of the Max family, according to CNN and Aviation Week.While that still falls short of the A321neo's planned capacity of up to 240 by 2018, Boeing's eventual goal is to build a completely new plane that can carry 200-275 passengers and travel up to 5,000 nautical miles, industry officials told CNN.In October, Boeing said it was considering simultaneous development of a midsize plane and longer 737 to fill the gap created by the 757, which saw production end in 2004. Management said in October that the new midsize plane could be delivered by 2024-2025.Boeing shares closed down 0.7% at 158.29 on the stock market today. Airbus' U.S. listed shares dipped 0.3% to 17.22.On Thursday, RBC Capital initiated coverage on Boeing with an underperform rating and 136 price target, citing pressure on profit margins from new commercial platforms.While development of a midsize plane is expected to weigh on earnings and shares, Boeing may have little choice as it has been losing badly to Airbus in that category.Airbus has racked up 1,400 A321neo orders vs. about 425 for comparable Boeing planes, according to Flightglobal Ascend.Also, a recent internal Boeing memo announced plans for involuntary layoffs from its engineers and voluntary layoffs in other divisions, according to a Reuters report out Tuesday, as Airbus takes market share.Meanwhile, Boeing is looking around for commitments from enough customers for the Max 10X, which is seen as a way to help slow the bleeding ahead of the new midsize plane.United Airlines (UAL), Delta Air Lines (DAL) and Alaska Airlines (ALK) were among top U.S. carriers it hope to seal a deal with for the Max 10, CNN said. International customers could include carriers in China and Indonesia's Lion Air.RELATED: Boeing Lands $8 Billion GE Order After Losing $4 Billion Delta Buy

351,DAL,"Shares of JetBlue (JBLU) soared on Tuesday after the carrier said traffic growth outpaced capacity in August and forecast quarter-to-quarter improvement in unit revenue, a key measure of an airline's efficiency.The company said that it expected third-quarter unit revenue, a measure of revenue as it relates to an airline's available seats and flight coverage, to fall between 3%-4%, an improvement from the 8.2% drop JetBlue reported for the second quarter.One analyst said that forecast suggests an improved end to the quarter for the carrier.""The guidance implies September unit revenue will be down 1%-4%, better than initial (forecasts) of September being the worst month of the quarter,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note. ""JetBlue's guidance update is consistent with what we heard from other airlines, with the first half of August being worse than expected, but improving throughout the month and continuing into September.""Traffic rose 6.2% during the month, outpacing capacity growth of 5.7%. Load factor, a measure of an airline's ability to put passengers in seats, rose 0.4 point to 87.4%.JetBlue's traffic and capacity figures for August reverse the trend seen from bigger network carriers American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL), which both said passenger traffic had grown less than capacity, or an airline's supply of seats and flights.Wall Street has wanted airlines to curb that supply and raise fares amid concerns that carriers' expansion was unsustainable. Delta has been saying that the days of low oil prices, which cushioned airlines' profits and allowed them expand and absorb costs, are over.JetBlue ascended by 2.4% to close at 17.19 on the stock market today, popping above its 50-day line. American lost 2.5% to 37.37, testing its 200-day line, while United dropped 3% to 51.64. Delta Air Lines (DAL), whose forecast greater operational discipline on a potential rise in fuel prices helped lift airline stocks last week, was down 2.4% to 37.53, undercutting its 50-day line. Southwest (LUV), which has also forecast reined-in capacity growth next year, fell 1.8% to 37.14.IBD's TAKE: Airlines don't exactly rank highly among their peers from other sectors, with IBD's Transportation-Airline group coming in at 108 out of 197 tracked industries. But Hawaiian Holdings has mostly been a standout, hovering within buy range in recent days.  JetBlue's results come after a summer marked by Brexit, terrorism concerns and choppy unit revenue and capacity trends, massive rounds of flight cancellations and executive shake-ups.

352,DAL,"American Airlines (AAL) on Monday held to its outlook for third-quarter unit revenue and adjusted pretax margin, but the carrier said that passenger traffic declined in August while flight capacity rose, after a report from United Airlines (UAL) on Friday also showed weak traffic.The monthly results come as airlines have vowed to pull back capacity growth to be more in line with demand after investors have punished the sector since the spring for what has been seen as a lack of restraint in adding more seats and expanding flight coverage.American said traffic fell 2.8% in August, while flight capacity rose 1.4% but still expects Q3 unit revenue, which measures revenue as it relates to capacity, to fall roughly 3%-5%. The carrier continues to see Q3 adjusted pretax margin of 12%-14%.Shares of American closed down 0.4% to 38.34 in the stock market today, rebounding from intraday plunge below their 200-day average as the major averages rebounded. Delta Air Lines (DAL) rose 1.8% after undercutting its 50-day line early, while United Air rebounded for a 1.5% gain. Hawaiian Holdings (HA) rose 1.15% to 47.66, above a 47.02 buy point.IBD's TAKE: Airlines don't exactly rank highly among their peers from other sectors, with IBD's Transportation-Airline group coming in at 108 out of 197 tracked industries. Despite dipping below a buy point Monday, Hawaiian Holdings has mostly been a standout. Unit revenue industrywide has fallen after an oil oversupply beginning in 2014 drove down fuel costs, boosting airlines' profits and making it easier to absorb costs from competition and expansion. But Wall Street has been worried that airlines have risked overexpansion. The stronger dollar has also weakened international demand, also pushing unit revenues lower.Airlines got a bump last week after Delta and Southwest Airlines (LUV) forecast greater operational discipline. Delta also said that potentially higher fuel costs in Q4 quarter could prompt airlines to pass those costs onto passengers, meaning higher fares and better unit revenue.A broader market sell-off on Friday, however, helped erase those gains.Also on Friday, United said traffic rose 0.6% in August, outpaced by a capacity increase of 1.9%. But the company stuck with its outlook for a Q3 consolidated passenger unit revenue drop of 5.5% to 7.5%.""The year-over-year performance is primarily impacted by demand growth not keeping pace with capacity growth, soft close-in yields, competitive actions and travel reductions in the energy sector,"" United said in a statement.United also forecast adjusted unit costs to rise 2.5% to 3.5% for the full year, up from guidance given earlier, due to a new contract agreement with flight attendants that was ratified in August. The company's guidance for adjusted unit cost for Q3 was unchanged, but it said there would be ""a modest increase"" to non-fuel expenses during the quarter due to the contract.RELATED:Why Southwest Stock Deserves A Premium Over Delta, United, AmericanDelta Says Flight Cancellations Cost $100 Million, Cites Other Industry Woes

The goal was later moved back to year-end, and in July, Delta appeared to soften its outlook further, saying it was making the right decisions to reverse its declines in unit revenue, ""even if it takes longer than year-end.""An Imperial Capital analyst said last month that Delta's unit revenue may not grow until 2018, though that would still be earlier than United and American.Morgan Stanley also upgraded Brazil-based Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes (GOL) to equal weight from underweight and boosted its price target to 23 from 6.50, according to Benzinga.While Milberg warned Gol is a ""high risk play,"" the airline has seen a ""dramatic improvement"" in its financial situation, due to Brazil's currency strengthening and restructuring moves like fleet reductions, refinancing and cost cuts.Still, Milberg remains cautious, adding that ""While we are shifting to a Equal-weight rating on GOL we continue to believe it presents elevated risk and that it has yet to fully overcome its weak financials.""Shares gapped up 5.15% to 23.90 and has doubled since breaking out of a cup base in July.

The carrier said the disruption and recovery would cost it $150 million in pretax income during the quarter, or roughly 1.5 points of operating margin.But excluding the outage's impact, Delta's unit revenue and operating margin guidance still fell largely within the carrier's forecasts given during its second-quarter earnings report in July.Delta said the outage added about 1 percentage point to the unit revenue decline during the third quarter. In July, the company said it expected Q3 unit revenue to fall 4%-6%.Delta's outage cost $100 million in revenue last month, the airline said last week.The carrier also sees capacity growth of around 1.5%, compared with the 1%-2% growth forecast in July. The carrier forecast operating margin of 18-19% on Wednesday, compared with an estimate two months ago for 19%-21%.Delta now expects slightly higher unit costs. And while it expected cheaper fuel than its estimates given in July, it said the cheap-fuel tailwind, which fattened profits and made it easier for the industry to expand through 2015, was ""now behind us.""Airline stocks in general have struggled due to rising oil prices, an inability to align flight and seat capacity with demand, foreign exchange challenges in part due to Brexit and concerns about the Zika virus and terrorism.

359,DAL,"Shares of United Airlines (UAL) jumped Tuesday following the news that Scott Kirby had joined the carrier after a run as president of  American Airlines (AAL), a move one analyst said gives United someone regarded as ""one of the best revenue managers in the industry"" but raises questions about how it will approach low-cost rivals like Spirit Airlines (SAVE).Meanwhile, other airline stocks also rallied Tuesday, with several retaking or testing key technical levels, with Hawaiian Holdings (HA) seeking to break out of a bullish pattern.Kirby's position as president -- a new one United created for him -- was announced on Monday and took hold immediately. The move, which surprised some analysts, comes after United this month appointed Andrew Levy as chief financial officer and Julia Haywood as chief commercial officer.Under CEO Oscar Munoz, United has tried to overhaul its management to be more competitive with American and Delta Air Lines (DAL).Credit Suisse analyst Julie Yates cited Kirby's reputation as a sales and pricing strategist. But she also raised questions about ""whether Mr. Kirby will be as aggressive with low-cost carrier competition at UAL as he was at AAL"".That move helped American compete with Spirit but also drove airfares lower, damaging unit revenue, a key metric of an airline's operating efficiency.""Some may view this as negative for Spirit with a view that Kirby will bring the same aggression on pricing to a new seat at United, potentially creating more weakness in the pricing environment,"" Yates wrote in a research note dated Monday. ""However, others may argue it could be a positive catalyst if American eases aggressive pricing behavior that many were led to believe was a function of Mr. Kirby's strategy.""United has plans to eventually roll out a bare-bones 'basic economy' seating class, a move that could help it compete with Spirit. Levy was also an executive at Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT), which runs low-cost carrier Allegiant Air.United Airlines spiked 8.6% to 50.99 by the closing bell on the stock market today, making it the first of the Big 3 network carriers to clear its 200-day line since April. Yates said Kirby's move to United would likely lift shares.American, which replaced Kirby with Robert Isom, rose 2.4% to 37.05, just below its 200-day.Delta Air Lines (DAL), the last of the big three U.S. carriers, climbed 1.7% to 37.16, meeting resistance at its 50-day line. Delta remains well below its 200-day.Some analysts have also been more bullish on United in part due to the management changes, but others worry that industry profits are likely to suffer due to higher fuel costs, labor deals, weaker global demand and Brexit.Meanwhile, Hawaiian Airlines parent Hawaiian Holdings rose 1.9% to 46.72, backing off from a 47.02 buy point after rising intraday to 47.10. Hawaiian has formed a cup-with-handle base formed in April.Spirit Airlines rose 1.5% to 39.96.IBD'S TAKE: Airlines have benefited from cheap jet fuel, but they've struggled to rein in capacity. That may worry investors, but it pleases passengers: Airfares are plunging.While Yates felt Kirby was likely to succeed American CEO Doug Parker, who is 55, Cowen analyst Helane Becker said such a development was a long time away.""Given concerns over Mr. Munoz's health,"" Becker said in a research note, ""the potential for Mr. Kirby to eventually be his successor is a real one.""RELATED:

"
361,DAL,"United Airlines' (UAL) passenger unit revenue will likely begin to improve next year, and the company stands to benefit from executive-team shakeups, improved labor relations and an extensive global network, Imperial Capital said Tuesday.Domestically, the declines in United's passenger unit revenue will begin to ease as airlines pull back on capacity growth, starting in this year's fourth quarter, Imperial Capital analyst Michael Derchin wrote in initiating coverage of the carrier with an outperform rating and a 57 price target.And internationally, Derchin said, capacity cuts in Latin America amid ""bottoming economic conditions"" will also help unit revenue, an important metric of an airline's efficiency.Concerns about terrorism and the U.K.'s vote this summer to leave the European Union will continue to pose difficulties for the carrier, as they do for rivals Delta Air Lines (DAL) and American Airlines (AAL).Passenger unit revenue calculates revenue as it relates to an airline's overall capacity. The metric has fallen over the past several quarters due to the strong dollar and airlines' overestimation of demand. Airlines expanded their flight capacity after the oil-price crash that began in 2014 made it less costly to do so.United is also close to resolving labor issues after a contentious history with its workforce, Derchin wrote. The carrier's flight attendants this month ratified a five-year deal that brought together all those attendants under a single contract. The deal included ""double-digit pay increases"" and better job security, health care and flexibility, United said.That deal should also ""finally permit integration of United and Continental workers, which we expect to improve morale and productivity,"" Derchin wrote.United finished 1.15% higher at 47.49 in the stock market today. Delta Air Lines edged up 0.2%, while American Airlines added 1.1%.IBD'S TAKE: Airlines' recent deals with staff, many of whom have withstood their share of low morale, raise questions about how far along the industry is in the current profitability cycle. Learn more about when to sell stocks. On Monday, Delta offered its pilots a 27% pay hike over four years, below what they wanted, Bloomberg reported. American this month reached an interim agreement to give 30,000 of its ground employees a raise, following earlier agreements this year. United has struck deals this year that have covered more than 65,000 employees, CEO Oscar Munoz has said.United's recent moves to appoint Andrew Levy as its CFO and Julia Haywood as the company's chief commercial officer will ""improve the problem-solving skills at UAL and provide an entrepreneurial bent, which, in our view, were attributes in short supply at this 'mega-carrier' in recent years,"" Derchin added.What's more, the note said, the airline's presence in the Asia-Pacific region is stronger than that of many of its rivals, and its hubs in Chicago, San Francisco, Houston, Denver and Newark, N.J., are also advantages. But United's extensive coverage also leaves it more exposed to global turmoil.""Brexit and terrorism in Europe, the Zika scare in Latin America and the Caribbean, and excess foreign flag carrier capacity growth in the Asia/Pacific region (where UAL is the largest U.S. carrier) are potential challenges for the new management team,"" Derchin wrote.""UAL has the least exposure to the U.K. among the Big 3, which may prove positive, relatively speaking, but also constitutes another significant uncertainty,"" he wrote.RELATED:

But Imperial Capital analyst Michael Derchin said Delta could beat American and United to positive unit revenue growth, in part on the strength of its branded fares.""As the first airline to adopt a Branded Fares strategy that optimizes the service/price trade-off offered to customers, we believe DAL may be the first airline among the Big 3 to report flat RASM (revenue per available seat mile) and a pathway to positive results, which we anticipate by the"" fourth quarter of 2017, Derchin wrote.Branded fares -- or the array of airfare classes that include or exclude different charges or amenities -- have become more important for airlines to stay competitive. Having a wider variety of fare options gives airlines more ways to make passengers pay for preflight and in-flight conveniences.The Big 3 have either launched or plan to launch ""basic economy"" fares to compete with Spirit Airlines' (SAVE) cheap, bare-bones but often fee-heavy service. Delta last week also unveiled Delta One, a new international business-class seating option. United in June introduced Polaris, also a new international business seating class. American announced the launch of its international premium economy seating in December.Overall, Derchin -- who initiated coverage on Delta, rating it in-line and setting 41 price target -- said that Delta was ""the highest-quality airline among the Big 3."" The carrier, he said, ""has the only investment-grade corporate credit rating and industry-leading margins, free cash flow generation and established capital deployment plan.""But he said that a number of events beyond the carrier's control are reason for short-term caution.""The biggest surprise was Brexit and its potential impact on U.K. business travel for DAL and its U.K. partner, Virgin Atlantic,"" Derchin wrote. ""At the same time, DAL and its Continental Europe partner, Air France/KLM, have been adversely impacted by deteriorating economic, social, and terrorism problems in Europe.""Terrorist attacks in Europe -- notably those in Paris, Brussels and Nice -- have helped caused ""an industrial disaster"" for Paris' tourism industry, a tourism official for the Paris region said, according to reports on Tuesday. German carrier Lufthansa this month warned on terror attacks in Europe, and heightened unrest around the world had hurt passenger volumes. Air France-KLM has issued a similar warning.RELATED:

363,DAL,"Here's How Much 'Brexit' Will Hurt American, Delta And United AirCould Brexit Actually Help Airlines? American Airlines Thinks So
"
364,DAL,"The fall in ticket prices for U.S. carriers so far this year has steepened slightly from last year, Airlines for America said Wednesday, a trend that has helped air travelers but worried investors in carriers like Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL).Ticket prices had fallen some 6% systemwide so far this year, compared to a 5.2% drop in 2015, the trade group said in a statement Wednesday.Airfares have fallen as airlines have expanded flight and seat capacity to stay competitive. Investors over the past year have occasionally punished airlines for what has been seen as an inability to keep capacity -- a carrier's supply of flights and seats -- in line with demand.Airlines for America also projected that 4% more passengers would travel over the Labor Day travel period than last year. Airlines would add more than 98,000 seats per day to its capacity during the period than a year earlier, the group forecast.That outlook comes as the TSA has dealt with its own difficulties in ushering passengers through checkpoints and after huge rounds of flight cancellations from Delta and Southwest (LUV) this summer. Those cancellations have raised questions about airlines' aging technological infrastructures and passenger expectations of air travel in general.Southwest cut its third-quarter revenue outlook after an outage caused more than 2,000 flight cancellations, while Delta spent much of last week racing to get its systems back online after a power outage caused a similar number of flight cancellations.Last Thursday, Delta said that backup systems didn't kick in after a small fire occurred that Aug. 8 at a power switch, causing a ""massive failure"" at its technology command center that created the outage. The carrier said that around ""300 of about 7,000 data center components were discovered to not have been configured appropriately to avail backup power"" and that it was working to bolster redundancy and connectivity.Airlines have been trimming their post-Labor Day capacity in recent weeks, Wolfe Research notes.""But our optimism is a bit guarded as we've noticed some airlines have shown a tendency to make capacity cuts to only add it back the following week somewhere else,"" Wolfe analyst Hunter Keay said in a research note on Monday. ""Regardless, the constant pruning shows airlines continue to schedule fairly dynamically and eliminate unproductive flying where it makes sense.""Delta Air fell 1.2% in the stock market today. American Airlines slid rose 0.2%, United fell 1.2%. Southwest retreated 1 cent to 36.84. Oil prices continue to limb, suggesting that jet fuel costs will trend higher.IBD'S TAKE: Terror attacks, warnings about the Zika virus and Brexit have been bad news for airline stocks this summer. Higher oil prices and labor deals could also weigh on profits. Many airline stocks have struggled for support at their 50-day line, a key measure of investor support. Learn more about  how to read stock charts. Delta this week also introduced a new international business-class seat, Delta One, whose seats feature sliding doors for privacy, lie-flat seats and direct access to aisles. The seating class is set to be available on select flights in the fall of 2017, debuting on the carrier's first Airbus (EADSY) 350 and then, over time, its Boeing (BA) 777 jets.The new seating class comes as airlines continue a so-called ""unbundling of the product"" -- breaking out different costs and adding new segments to cabins in an attempt to find new ways to draw money out of passengers. All three network carriers have also debuted or plan to debut bare-bones ""basic economy"" fares to compete with Spirit Airlines (SAVE), whose low-cost service has helped lead pricing downward.Airbus fell 1.7% while Boeing climbed 0.2% and Spirit 0.1%.RELATED:

365,DAL,"The U.S. created jobs in August, but at a slower pace that suggests no Fed rate hike soon. The EU said Apple (AAPL) must repay $14.5 billion in taxes and Mylan (MYL) buckled to pressure and offered a half-priced generic EpiPen. Salesforce (CRM) gave weak guidance, while United Airlines (UAL) hired a key American Airlines (AAL) executive.The major market averages rose modestly for the week, continuing the long string of sideways action near record highs. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.6% while the S&P 500 and Dow industrials climbed 0.5%. Investors see a Fed rate hike in September as even less likely now. Fiber-optic stocks remained hot, generic drugs rebounded. Apparel stores were among the notable losers.The European Union's executive arm ordered Apple to repay 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) in back taxes plus interest to Ireland, part of a broader crackdown into EU member nations' special tax treatments for big multinationals. Apple CEO Tim Cook vowed to appeal the decision and criticized the commission's 'unprecedented"" action as ""total political crap."" Apple set plans for a Sept. 7 event, with widespread expectations that it will unveil the iPhone 7.Apple shares rose 0.7% to 107.73 for the week, approaching a 110.33 by point.The U.S. added 151,000 jobs in August, below views and down from gains of 275,000 in July and 271,000 in June. Meanwhile, ISM's manufacturing index for August signaled its first contraction in six months. The odds of a September rate hike, already low, fell further. But markets still expect a year-end hike.Ford Motor (F), General Motors (GM) and most other big automakers reported lower U.S. sales in August vs. a year earlier. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' (FCAU) sales rose 3%. But it was the only one of the seven top U.S. sellers to report higher demand.U.S. sales totaled 16.98 million vehicles at a seasonally adjusted annualized rate vs. a 17.88 million pace in July. GM joined Ford in forecasting lower domestic sales for the industry in 2016 after hitting record levels last year.GM and Ford shares fell modestly Thursday on the auto sales news, but rose slightly for the week. Tesla Motors (TSLA) tumbled 10% to a 2-month low amid cash-crunch concerns about the electric car maker and its takeover target, SolarCity (SCTY).U.S. crude oil prices fell 6.7% to $44.44 a barrel, its worst weekly loss since early July. Crude inventories rose for a second straight week, while mixed economic data also weighed. U.S. oil rig counts edged higher to a seven-month high.Drugmaker Mylan (MYL) launched a generic EpiPen on Monday, responding to a frenzy of criticism over price hikes on its allergy treatment. But it faced new lawmaker calls for EpiPen-related documents, while others asked the FDA for an explanation of what was holding up approval for other generic versions. On Friday, some lawmakers accused Mylan of overcharging Medicaid for EpiPen, while Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said she would crack down on drug-price hikes. Mylan fell 7.1% this week after tumbling 11.6% in the prior week.Palo Alto Networks (PANW) earned 50 cents a share excluding items, meeting fiscal Q4 views for a 79% gain. Revenue growth topped. But EPS guidance for current Q1 was weak and indicated yet another quarter of decelerating Palo Alto growth from very high levels. Despite solid full-year EPS guidance and a $500 million buyback plan, shares fell 7.2% on Wednesday, but rallied for a 3.2% weekly gain, just below its 200-day line.Chipmakers Broadcom (AVGO) and Ambarella (AMBA) late Thursday posted top- and bottom-line beats for quarters ended July 31, and both gave guidance that topped Wall Street … and both stocks fell Friday and for the week. One problem is that investors and analysts have some doubts about crucial products about to be announced by key customers.Ciena (CIEN), a major fiber-optic company, earned 42 cents a share excluding items in its fiscal Q3, up 13.5% and beating by four cents. Sales grew 11% to $670.6 million, slightly below views for $672.2 million. Ciena stock broke out of a consolidation, rising 5.8% for the week. Ciena and Cisco (CSCO) are lead vendors on a major 100-gigabit metro rollout for Verizon (VZ). Telecoms, cloud computing giants and China are seeing huge demand for fiber-optic gear, lifting hot IPO Acacia Communications (ACIA) and others.Salesforce.com reported Q2 earnings and revenue that beat estimates. But billings were below expectations, with Q3 guidance that implied billings growth might tick down again. Salesforce, which said it sees some ""softness"" in U.S. demand, projects fiscal Q3 revenue of $2.11 billion to $2.12 billion, vs. Wall Street consensus of $2.12 billion. It expects EPS minus items of 20 cents to 21 cents, below the consensus of 24 cents.Salesforce stock fell 6.2% for the week, trading below its 200-day line for the first time since the end of March.Closeout retailer Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI) topped earnings and sales forecasts, and guided full-year estimates higher. Teen-centric retailer Five Below (FIVE) gave weak third-quarter guidance. That followed murky forecasts from Target (TGT), Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR). The results come as Wal-Mart (WMT)begins its own price-cutting campaign, potentially drawing customers away from rival discounters.Ollie's stock rose 4% for the week, retaking a 26.65 buy point after falling below its 50-day line. Five Below fell 6.5% as it extended its losing streak to eight straight sessions.Lululemon Athletica (LULU) met earnings estimates of 38 cents a share, marking 12% growth, but missed on revenue, as sales grew 14% to $514.5 million vs. forecasts for $515.5 million. Currency-neutral same-store sales rose 5% for the yogawear maker and retailer. Some analysts were anticipating an earnings turnaround, but Lululemon issued cautious Q3 guidance. Shares sank 10%, erasing virtually all of Lululemon's gains from its breakout after its prior earnings report.Shares of United Airlines (UAL) jumped this week after Scott Kirby joined the carrier from American Airlines (AAL), where he had served as president. Kirby, now United's president, is seen by some as one of the industry's best revenue strategists. The move rounds out United's recent efforts to shake up its executive team to compete with American and Delta Air Lines (DAL). United rose 9% for the week, retaking its 200-day line. American climbed 0.8%. Delta, which reported that August unit revenue fell 9.5% vs. a year earlier as it suffered outages that forced cancellations, rose 3%. Hawaiian Holdings (HA), parent of Hawaiian Airlines, rose 4.8%, breaking past a buy point, but in light volume.Smith & Wesson (SWHC) late Thursday reported first-quarter results that easily beat Wall Street forecasts. It raised full-year guidance, helped by new acquisitions. But shares of the gunmaker slid 6.4% on Friday to a two-month low and back below its 50-day line. That's in part due to FBI data on August background checks — a loose indicator of firearm demand — that didn't exhibit the surge seen in previous months. Shares of rival Sturm Ruger (RGR) fell 2.5% on Friday.Stun-gun maker Taser (TASR) broke out of short consolidation on Tuesday, then crashed to fall 6.8% for the week, diving through its 50-day line.Veeva Systems (VEEV) was expected to report a soft Q2 due to the lumpiness of its bookings, but Veeva earnings beat estimates, while 34% sales growth also surprised. Analysts credited strong uptake of the Vault content-management system. The stock rose 5% for the week, hitting its best levels since late 2013 and keeping its place on the IBD 50.

366,DAL,"Update: The Pentagon late Friday approved letting the Air Force sign two contracts for Boeing (BA) to make 19 KC-46 tankers. The deals, worth $2.8 billion, follow multiple delays due to technical problems with the tanker.""The KC-46 program has made significant strides in moving the Air Force toward the modernization needed in our strategic tanker fleet,"" Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said in a statement.A decision on the KC-46 tanker had been expected this month after an update this week.(An earlier story reporting on the looming tanker decision follows).* * *WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The Air Force is still on track to hold a formal decision-making meeting over the Boeing (BA) KC-46 tanker later this month.At the State of the Air Force hearing Wednesday, Air Force Secretary Deborah James said a meeting with top Pentagon procurement officer Frank Kendall will take place later this month to approve production of the KC-46 tanker, known as Milestone C.""We believe that aircraft has meet all the wickets that are required to meet Milestone C, but of course it remains to be seen, so I'll say stay tuned for that,"" she said.The meeting was originally scheduled for June, but Boeing said in a May statement that it was delayed so the company would have ""additional time to implement the solution to a refueling boom loads issue identified during flight testing earlier this year.""Boeing shares rose 0.5% to 133 in the stock market Thursday.Boeing took a $393 million after-tax charge on the KC-46 in the second quarter due to higher costs to work on technical issues that put the plane behind schedule.Boeing also reported a charge on the tanker in Q1 and has racked up $1.5 billion in cost overruns on additional engineering and development work.IBD'S TAKE: Boeing's tanker struggles and weak commercial sales have weighed on shares. It is lagging behind stronger defense players Raytheon and Northrop Grumman.At the hearing, James also outlined incentives to retain pilots, as U.S. commercial airlines like United Airlines (UAL), American Airlines (AAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL) are on a hiring spree to replace retiring pilots. The Air Force is expected to face a shortfall of 1,000 pilots by the end of the year.Last month, Boeing projected that airlines would need 617,000 pilots the next 20 years, up 11% from its forecast in 2015. U.S. carriers are expected to hire 20,000 pilots over the next decade.United Airlines stock rose 0.3%, American Airlines ascended 2.3% and Delta Air climbed 0.6%.

368,DAL,"Shares of American Airlines (AAL) edged up Tuesday after the carrier forecast that a key operational metric wouldn't be as bad in the third quarter as originally anticipated, while Delta Air Lines (DAL) continued to cancel hundreds of flights due to an outage a day earlier.American said it expected third-quarter unit revenue -- a measure of how much money airlines make on passengers as related to available seats -- to fall roughly 3% to 5%. That compared with an earlier forecast for a 3.5%-5.5% decline, which was still an improvement from prior quarters.The company said it continued to expect third-quarter adjusted pretax margins of 12%-14%.Still, the measure of an airline's ability to fill seats, known as ""load factor,"" dropped 2.1 percentage points to 85.2% in July. The carrier said July traffic fell 0.3% on a 2.3% increase in carrying capacity.The monthly figures and quarterly forecast come after American agreed last week to a pay raise for 30,000 workers.American shares were up 0.7% to 34.59 by the closing bell on the stock market today. American's stock has hovered above its key 50-day line after reporting improved fundamentals this earnings season, including restrained capacity growth plans and improved unit revenue, which has fallen as airlines have expanded and cut fares.IBD'S TAKE: Delta shares struggled this earnings season compared to rivals American Airlines and United Airlines. While investors want airlines to trim capacity and raise fares to boost profits, the industry has contended with fears related to terror attacks and the Zika virus. See how the sector is doing at IBD's Stock Checkup.Meanwhile, Delta said it would cancel roughly 300 flights Tuesday morning as it continues to untangle the mess caused by a power outage on Monday in Atlanta. The outage created widespread computer problems for the carrier and forced around 1,000 flight cancellations on Monday, although it was able to resume flights that same day.""We were able to bring our systems back on line and resume flights within a few hours yesterday, but we are still operating in recovery mode,"" Dave Holtz, a senior vice president for the airline, said in a statement. ""We are sorry for what many of our customers have experienced over the past 24 hours, including those who remain at airports and continue waiting for their flights.""The carrier offers around 15,000 flights daily. Delta last week reported July traffic figures that disappointed many investors, and how the outages will affect its overall third-quarter performance remains unclear.Shares of Delta dipped 0.8% to 37.15, while Southwest (LUV), which experienced a similar outage last month, added 1 cent to 37.46. United Airlines (UAL) shares lost 1.4% to 47.81.

Delta offers more than 15,000 daily flights.Delta shares fell 0.6% in the stock market today. Southwest ticked down 1.1%. United Airlines (UAL) rose 0.2%, while American Airlines (AAL), which on Friday announced an interim agreement to raise pay for 30,000 employees, was down 0.3%.IBD'S TAKE: The airline sector last week was also hit by fears of terror attacks and a CDC warning advising pregnant women not to travel to parts of Miami due to concerns about the Zika virus.

It agreed to be bought by Steinhoff International for $64 a share cash. Tempur Sealy (TPX) rose 0.8%, and Select Comfort (SCSS) rose 6.6% in sympathy. 
"
371,DAL,"Stocks opened slightly higher Monday but soon reversed amid a flurry of headlines to start off the week, including news that Wal-Mart (WMT) is buying privately held e-commerce firm Jet.com for just over $3 billion.Wal-Mart shares have built a giant saucer-with-handle base, creating a 74.45 buy point. Wal-Mart fell 0.7% to 73.25 in early trading.Meanwhile, Sotheby's (BID) was bid up more than 9% following earnings results. Tyson Foods (TSN) initially rallied but is now down 0.5%.The S&P 500 hit a fresh record high soon after the opening bell but turned a hair lower. The Nasdaq fell 0.1%, while the Dow Jones industrial average was just lower.West Texas Intermediate crude oil for September delivery gained nearly 2% to $42.57 a barrel on renewed chatter that certain OPEC members favor a production freeze.Leaderboard name Freeport McMoRan (FCX) rose more than 3%.In other M&A news, shares of Mattress Firm (MFRM) more than doubled to 63.71 on news it was being bought by African retailer Steinhoff International for $2.4 billion, or $64 per share.

"
372,DAL,"Southwest (LUV) on Wednesday cut its third-quarter unit revenue outlook after an outage last month caused more than 2,000 flight cancellations, while Delta Air Lines (DAL) said it expected operations to be back to normal ""by mid-to-late afternoon"" after a meltdown within its own computer infrastructure.Southwest said it expects third-quarter unit revenue, a much-watched metric that measures revenue as it relates to carrying capacity, to fall 3.5%-4.5%, below an earlier forecast for a 3%-4% drop.The carrier also said it expected adjusted unit costs to rise 3%-4% during the third quarter as a result of the outage.Southwest also said that July traffic rose 1.4%, while capacity climbed 2.3%.Shares fell 1.3% to close at 36.99 on the stock market today. Delta was off 1.3% to 35.48 while United Airlines (UAL) gave back 1.4% to 47.12 and and American Airlines (AAL) lost 1.2% to 34.18.Southwest's forecast doesn't seem to bode well for Delta, which saw a unit revenue decline last month that has already disappointed investors and left some worried that the carrier faces an uphill battle in improving the measure of operating efficiency in the third quarter overall.A combination of overexpansion -- leading to unfilled seats -- competitive fare discounts and an adverse foreign-exchange environment have weighed on unit revenue industrywide over the past several quarters.Delta said it would begin Wednesday ""with a little over 150 systemwide cancellations,"" following the cancellation of 800 flights on Tuesday and more than 1,000 a day prior. The carrier said an outage at one of its locations in Atlanta early Monday crashed its computer systems and that backup systems failed to kick in.IBD'S TAKE: Investors have punished airlines occasionally this year for what they see as lack of capacity and unit-revenue control. Terror attacks, Brexit and a recent travel warning in Florida related to the Zika virus have also hit shares. Now, technological issues could compound their difficulties. For more, see IBD's Stock Checkup.The outages experienced by Delta and Southwest, as well as technological glitches at United last year that upended travelers' plans, have raised questions about whether the technology airlines use to deploy flights needs to be modernized.JetBlue (JBLU), meanwhile, said July traffic rose 6.6%, outpacing capacity growth of 5.5%. Preliminary unit revenue for July fell roughly 2.5%.JetBlue stock rose 0.8% to 17.13.
"
373,DAL,"Delta Air Lines' (DAL) second-quarter profit beat analyst expectations as cheap fuel overcame foreign-currency weakness against the dollar and a nagging decline in fares.Adjusted earnings were $1.47 a share, topping the $1.42 average of 13 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue was $10.4 billion, compared with the average estimate of $10.5 billion. The carrier said it expects unit revenue, or passenger revenue for each seat flown a mile, to fall by 4 percent to 6 percent in the current quarter.The carrier also said it would cut planned capacity growth, expanding available seats by 1 percent in the fourth quarter instead of the previously planned 2 percent, responding to investor concerns that too much capacity was weighing on fares. The Atlanta-based carrier said it was planning deeper capacity reductions on routes to the U.K. due to the recent drop in the pound and economic uncertainty after the country voted to leave the European Union.""While the revenue environment remains challenging, with persistent headwinds from close-in domestic yields and geopolitical uncertainty, we remain focused on achieving our goal of positive unit revenues by year end,"" Glen Hauenstein, Delta's president, said in the statement.Delta Air shares rose about 1% to 39.90 in premarket trading on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Delta Air shares fell last month to their lowest level since late 2014 as Breixt fears hit global carriers. Shares have rebounded but have met resistance this week at the fast-falling 50-day moving average. Wait for Delta to build the right side of a sound base before booking your ticket in this stock.

374,DAL,"The stock market mounted a late recovery Wednesday, closing with a positive reversal.The Dow Jones industrial average led with a 0.5% increase, as Merck (MRK) defied weakness in the health care sector, rising 3%.The Nasdaq, down as much as 0.5%, closed 0.2% higher. The S&P 500 climbed 0.3%. The small-cap Russell 2000 added 0.1%. Volume rose across the board, early figures showed.Indexes were erratic as Wall Street reacted to President-elect Donald Trump's first press conference since he was elected Nov. 8. Stocks swung as Trump blasted drug companies and the cost of the Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35 fighter jet. He gave few details on his plans to spend massively on highways, bridges, airports and other infrastructure.But indexes worked their way back throughout the afternoon, in what can be termed a bullish price reversal.Biotech, generic drug and other medical stocks were down the most Wednesday after Trump took aim at drug prices for the second time since he was elected. Pharmaceutical and related groups fell roughly 2% to 5%. The iShares Nasdaq Biotech (IBB) fell 3%. Medical stocks such as Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Myriad Genetics (MYGN) fell in unusually high volume.But the energy sector led as U.S. crude oil futures climbed 2.8% to $52.25 a barrel.  Mining and metals also came out on top of the day's performance table.Earnings season is just warming up, and Thursday's announcements will include Delta Air Lines (DAL) and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). Delta's results are especially noteworthy because airline stocks have rebounded this week, thanks to a spate of favorable metrics from individual airlines.Thursday's economic reports include the weekly jobless claims and import-export prices, both due at 8:30 a.m. ET.  Of perhaps more importance to the market will be speeches given by several Federal Reserve officials, including Chairwoman Janet Yellen. She speaks after the market close, at 7 p.m. ET at a town hall meeting with educators in Washington, D.C.RELATED:Trump Says Drugmakers 'Getting Away With Murder', Cites F-35, Ford, FiatTrump Vows Fighter-Jet Competition, 'Big Things' On Lockheed F-35 U.S. Crude Stockpiles, Production Soar, But Prices Rise As OPEC Cuts
"
375,DAL,"Better unit revenue, but higher costs. That's basically Wall Street's outlook for the airline industry overall in the fourth quarter, and Delta Air Lines (DAL), which reports Q4 results on Thursday, is no different.Analysts expect earnings per share to tumble 31% to 82 cents, marking its worst decline since Q4 2012 as oil prices rallied, with revenue slipping 1% to $9.4 billion.Delta last week said it expects Q4 unit revenue to fall 2.5%-3%, an improvement from a decline of around 3% the carrier projected last month. However, Delta said it expects non-fuel unit costs, including profit-sharing, to jump around 10% due to a new contract with pilots.Unit revenue measures an airline's revenue as it relates to its overall supply of seats on planes and flight coverage. Analysts largely expect the key metric to turn positive this year as postelection travel demand firms up and rising fuel and labor expenses force airlines to pull back on their expansion plans and pass more costs onto customers.American Airlines (AAL), United Airlines (UAL), Southwest (LUV) and JetBlue (JBLU) have also offered stronger unit revenue forecasts, with American indicating that total unit revenue could turn positive in Q4.But as with all the airlines' earnings reports, Delta's forecast on industry trends will probably grab more of the spotlight. Delta has said it expects unit revenue to be flat in the first quarter of this year. As unit revenue improves, investors could turn more of their attention to how airlines manage their margins and costs.""After Delta's latest guidance, we believe the expectation is for unit revenue guidance to move higher,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note on Monday. ""Despite improving revenue trends, we expect little change to margin guidance as jet fuel continues to rise.""IBD'S TAKE: Delta and Southwest were the only airlines not to be downgraded by Cowen last week. The firm said many of Delta's difficulties were in the past and that it could be among the biggest beneficiaries of improving airfare trends in business travel. Delta and other airline stocks have rallied since the fall as the industry tightens up on capacity growth and as demand strengthens. But the stocks have lost some steam in recent weeks, and analysts expect the sector could take a break from its massive run-up in the coming months.""Airline stocks as a group have outperformed the S&P 500 by 47% since Brexit. Something is priced in,"" Wolfe Research analyst Hunter Keay said in a research note last week. ""And while history suggests we could be entering a three, or even six, month cooling off period ... , the 2017 outlook for DAL and this group is more encouraging by the day.""RELATED:Delta Eyes Trans-Atlantic Battle Vs.

377,DAL,"United Airlines (UAL) and Southwest Airlines (LUV) upgraded their fourth-quarter unit revenue estimates Tuesday, a week after Delta Air Lines (DAL) raised its outlook for that metric.United expects Q4 unit revenue to drop 1.25%-1.75% vs. a prior outlook for a 3%-4% decline. Southwest now sees it falling 3%-4%, better than its earlier guidance for a 4%-5% dropBoth carriers cited an improvement in close-in yields, or how much an airline can get passengers to pay for flights booked closer to departure time.For December, United's traffic increased 2.6%, matching its capacity gain. Load factor edged up to 83.1% from 83% a year ago. Southwest's traffic rose 4.2%, while capacity grew 4.8%. Load factor shrank to 82.6% from 83%.Meanwhile, Alaska Air Group (ALK) reported that December traffic including newly acquired Virgin America, rose 5.6% vs. a year earlier as capacity climbed 5%.

379,DAL,"Boeing (BA) said Wednesday it received an order for 75 737 Max 8 jets from General Electric's (GE) aircraft leasing division, in a last-minute boost to its 2016 tally.The GE order is valued at $8.25 billion at list prices, but large orders typically receive a discount. GE Capital Aviation Services now has 170 737s on order.Boeing booked the GE order at the end of last calendar year, putting its 2016 total above 500. Official yearly results are expected Thursday.Boeing shares finished 1% higher at 158.62 on the stock market today. European rival Airbus (EADSY) rose 1.2%.

"
380,DAL,"Shares of global carriers Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) dropped Tuesday after German carrier Lufthansa warned on passenger volumes and Delta reported a 7% dive in July unit revenue.The Atlanta-based carrier blamed the July weakness to currency swings, excess capacity on trans-Atlantic flights, and low fares for last-minute bookings. Capacity rose 2.1% during the month, outpacing a passenger-traffic increase of 1.2%.Meanwhile, Lufthansa warned recent terror attacks in Europe and heightened global distress had caused ""a tangible impact on passenger volumes."" CEO Carsten Spohr said in a first-half earnings release that ""our industry has to prepare for a difficult second half-year.""""The terrorist attacks in Europe and also the increasing political and economic uncertainties are having a tangible impact on passenger volumes,"" he added. ""The forward bookings, in particular for our long-haul services to Europe have declined significantly. We expect the high pricing pressure to continue.""Delta plunged 7.8%, while American tumbled 5.9% and United lost 6.25% on the stock market today. The big three U.S. network carriers offer flights to Europe and collaborate with European airlines, but recent violence and upheaval around the world has made passengers more reluctant to fly. JetBlue (JBLU), which is considering offering flights to Europe, sank 6.5%.The share-price drop extended Delta's journey below its 50-day line, and it pushed American and United closer to the key test of investor support.IBD'S TAKE: Domestic-focused carriers like Southwest and Alaska Air have been less exposed but not immune to the global unrest affecting travel demand. Compare the industry's big names at IBD's Stock Checkup. Lufthansa said it expects unit revenue excluding currency fluctuations will drop 8%-9% in the second half of the year, and the company cut its planned flight capacity growth to 5.4% from 6%.Unit revenue gauges how much money an airline makes compared to available seating capacity and distance traveled, and is considered a key measure of how efficiently an airline is operating.Along with the violence, the U.K.'s vote this summer to leave the European Union has also raised concerns about foreign exchange difficulties as well as the U.S. airlines' ""open skies"" agreements in the region and other potential business restrictions.Delta and United took a more cautious approach toward Brexit, with plans to cut flight capacity to the U.K. American, however, was a bit more upbeat, saying that in short-term, the planned separation might cause more corporate travel as businesses try to find their footing in a post-Brexit world.United and American got a boost this earnings season on tighter capacity discipline and improving unit revenue trends. American's shares were also helped by a credit-card deal expected to generate more pretax income over the next two-or-so years.Investors have wanted airlines to pare back capacity growth to be in line with passenger demand. More aggressive expansion and competition between airlines stateside has caused airfare prices to drop, hurting unit revenue.Alaska Air Group (ALK), meanwhile, said traffic increased 7.8%, compared to a capacity increase of 9.6%.Alaska shares fell 4.1%. Discount carrier Southwest (LUV) lost 4%.

382,DAL,"Stocks moved sideways at all-time highs this week, but the week was packed with market-moving news. Alibaba (BABA) broke out as growth accelerated, while Acacia Communications (ACIA) exploded as fiber optic and IPO growth names sparked. Macy's (M) triggered a huge relief rally, and Wal-Mart (WMT) bought Jet.com to better compete vs. Amazon (AMZN). Oil prices rebounded, but solar stocks crashed.After weeks of the S&P 500 and Dow industrials hitting all-time highs, the Nasdaq eclipsed its 2015 peak. All three major indexes rose fractionally for the week -- the Nasdaq and Dow closed up 0.2% while the S&P 500 climbed 1 point. More quality breakouts appeared. Retailers, energy plays and some hot growth stocks led the market amid earnings reports and higher oil prices. But solar stocks tumbled on weak SunPower (SPWR) guidance. REITs struggled as investors sought growth names -- and worried about store closures.Alibaba reported revenue of $4.84 billion, beating the Wall Street consensus estimate of $4.53 billion. Revenue rose 59% in local-currency terms, the best gain since Alibaba's September 2014 IPO. EPS rose 33% to 74 cents, beating the consensus of 63 cents.JD.com reported revenue of $9.8 billion, slightly above the consensus and up 42% in local currency. It reported earnings per share of 4 cents, double the 2 cent consensus, but its Q3 revenue estimate fell short of projections. Both companies showed strong growth in mobile users.Alibaba stock soared 16% for the week, breaking out of a base to their highest level since January 2015. JD.com leapt nearly 13%.Next week, messaging giant Tencent (TCEHY), perhaps Alibaba's biggest Chinese rival, reports earnings. So do mobile gaming portal NetEase (NTES) and flash e-commerce seller Vipshop (VIPS).IBD'S TAKE: With the market at record highs, many growth names large and small are breaking out. To get an in-depth look at Alibaba, Acacia and other top-rated stocks -- and how they fare vs. rivals -- go to IBD Stock Checkup to develop your watch list.Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih hinted at a production freeze, which could come at a meeting on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum next month. But Russia's energy minister said he didn't see a reason for renewing talks. The International Energy Agency said the oil glut has disappeared, but it warned of weaker demand on a ""dimmer macroeconomic outlook"" in 2017. OPEC said Saudi Arabia pumped a record amount of crude oil in July, and the cartel left its 2017 demand outlook unchanged at 95.41 million barrels per day. The Energy Information Administration said that U.S. stockpiles rose by 1.1 million barrels to 523.6 million for the week ended Aug 5. And U.S. production fell by 0.2% to 8.44 million barrels, a second straight week of declines.U.S. oil rigs in operation rose by 15 to 396 in the week ended Aug. 12, Baker Hughes said. That's the seventh straight weekly gain and the highest level since late February.Still, U.S. crude oil prices closed the week at $44.49 a barrel, up 4.4%.Wal-Mart Stores, looking to keep pace with Amazon, agreed to buy Jet.com for $3.3 billion. Wal-Mart has sizable online sales, but growth has been decelerating. Wal-Mart also will put Jet.com CEO Marc Lore in charge of all of Wal-Mart's e-commerce operations, though Jet.com will remain separately. Lore previously founded Quidsi, parent of Diapers.com, before Amazon bought it.Wal-Mart stock rose 0.2%, hitting a 14-month high during the week.Solar stocks after SunPower cut its 2016 guidance and inverter-supplier SolarEdge (SEDG) cited a slowdown at U.S. installers. For Q2, SunPower's Q2 revenue growth and adjusted loss topped estimates. But SunPower sees Q3 revenue of just $700 million to $800 million vs. the consensus for $1.13 billion, as demand for utility-scale solar projects tumbles. And SunPower also cut its 2016 view to $2.8 billion-$3 billion, missing analysts' view for $3.3 billion.SolarEdge's $124.8 million in fiscal Q4 sales missed analysts' expectations for $129.4 million, but 44 cents EPS minus items beat by a nickel. The midpoint of current-quarter sales guidance for $130 million-$139 million trailed the consensus at $137 million, and EPS missed by a penny.SolarCity (SCTY), which has agreed to a takeover deal by Tesla (TSLA), topped analysts' Q2 projections for adjusted loss and revenue. But its current-quarter view for $155 million-$168 million in revenue lagged the consensus for $174.6 million.SunPower stock crashed 28% to a 3-year low.Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), involved in everything from gaming to autonomous driving and AI, rose 8.3% for the week to a fresh high after the Tesla partner reported $1.43 billion in sales and 40 cents earnings per share. That topped the consensus for $1.35 billion and 37 cents, and was up 24% and 700%, respectively, vs. last year. Nvidia sees current-quarter sales at $1.68 billion, plus or minus 2%, beating analysts' model for $1.45 billion.With China, telecoms and data centers spending heavily for higher-speed connections, makers of fiber optic components are seeing huge demand.Hot IPO Acacia Communications said Q2 revenue rose 101% to $116 million, and adjusted earnings soared 305%. Lumentum (LITE) and Inphi (IPHI) also reported stronger-than-expected figures. NeoPhotonics (NPTN) sales growth fell short due to sluggish demand for older parts, but production of 100-gigabit gear is ramping up. IBD's 14-company Telecom-Fiber Optics industry group hit a 15-year high Thursday and ranks No. 10 out of 197 groups.Acacia rose 41% Friday and nearly 50% for the week, blasting to new highs. Lumentum rose more than 4% and Inphi 16%, also to new highs. NeoPhotonics climbed 2.6% to 14.01, clearing a 13.85 buy point on Friday.Related:IBD'S TAKE: Acacia Communications is among several tech leaders that have risen 20% past a buy point, putting them in profit-taking zone. But when you should you sell these top stocks? IBD's latest Tech Leaders column explains when to hold onto winning stocks, and how those rules apply to Acacia, Weibo and others right now.Recent IPO Twilio (TWLO), a communications software firm, reported a narrower than-expected non-GAAP loss. Q2 revenue jumped 70% to $64.5 million, vs. Wall Street estimates of $58.2 million, although sales from its top customer, Facebook (FB)-owned WhatsApp, fell 8% year over year. Twilio's full-year guidance edged consensus estimates.Twilio shares surged 28% for the week, hitting a new high.Medpace Holdings (MEDP) soared 20% to 27.79 in Thursday's debut after pricing at 23, the high end of its expected IPO range. Shares edged up 0.9% to 28.04 on Friday. Medpace provides outsourced clinical development services for drug and medical device companies.Specialty drugmakers ended what had been a strong Q2 season for the drug industry on a more ambiguous note. Allergan (AGN), freshly divested of its generics business, beat expectations slightly but trimmed its sales guidance. Shares fell 1.7% for the week. Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) missed Q2 numbers but affirmed its guidance as it reorganized. It said its deal with Walgreens (WBA) was finally turning profitable and that it was willing to sell $8 billion worth of non-core assets. The stock soared 25% Tuesday, but pared weekly gains to 13.5% on a report that Valeant could face criminal charges of defrauding insurers.Medivation (MDVN) reported a ho-hum quarter, but profit will likely be flat until an expected market expansion for its drug Xtandi in Q4. Shares rose 4.4% to 66.02, a 14-month high and just barely in buy range from a 63.04 entry. Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ) missed EPS estimates and lowered guidance, partly due to a change in tax reporting and partly due to higher costs. Its stock dropped 9.3%. Mylan (MYL) beat its profit estimate slightly and affirmed its guidance, with its controversially high-priced EpiPen making up for light generic drug sales. Mylan closed the week unchanged.Walt Disney (DIS) topped Wall Street estimates late Tuesday and said it had bought a 33% stake in streaming company BAMTech. As it vies to remain competitive in digital, the media conglomerate plans to launch an ESPN-branded over-the-top service, but it will not include current ESPN content. Q3 EPS rose 12% to $1.62 on 9% revenue growth to $14.28 billion. Shares were up about 1% for the week, but failed to hold above their 50-day line.Southwest (LUV) cut its third-quarter unit revenue outlook and said it expected higher unit costs due to 2,000-plus flight cancellations in July after a single router failure blacked out much of its technological infrastructure. The guidance came as Delta Air Lines (DAL) spent much of the week trying to recover from some 2,000 of its own flight cancellations caused by an outage early Monday. American Airlines (AAL), meanwhile, forecast an improvement in its Q3 unit revenue.Southwest and Delta shares fell 3.5% while American Air climbed 1.4%.Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) reported lower sales, while Macy's also had declining earnings and said it would cut 100 stores. But they both topped forecasts after weeks of bad news from consumer stocks such as Ford (F) and McDonald's (MCD). So Macy's and Kohl's skyrocketed 16.7% and 14.3%, respectively for the week. Nordstrom (JWN) and JCPenney (JCP) topped on earnings and missed on revenue, with their shares also soaring for the week. But overall, retail sales were flat in July -- and down 0.3% excluding autos -- according to the Commerce Department. Home Depot (HD), Lowe's (LOW), Wal-Mart and Ross Stores (ROST) are among the retailers reporting this coming week.The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index rose to a 14-month high in August, climbing 2.9 points to 48.4. That's still below the neutral 50 level.
"
383,DAL,"JetBlue's (JBLU) plans to expand its cross-country premium Mint service with additional Airbus (EADSY) jets could also allow it to start offering flights to Europe.CEO Robin Hayes said on the carrier's second-quarter earnings call on Tuesday that the Airbus agreement would allow it to fly to Europe from the East Coast, ""should we choose to do so.""The remarks came after Hayes told the Wall Street Journal that JetBlue was contemplating adding flights to European destinations. Hayes said trans-Atlantic flights ""suffer from the same lack of competition and high fares"" as transcontinental flights, according to the newspaper.JetBlue said the revised purchase deal with Airbus would add 30 more A321 jets -- with at least a handful to be outfitted with the Mint service -- over seven years. Hayes also told the Journal that JetBlue must decide by late next year if it wants long-haul versions of the plane that could fly to Europe.Shares of JetBlue jumped 8% to close at 18.67 in the stock market today. Shares of the big three U.S. carriers, which offer cross-country and trans-Atlantic flights, finished higher. Delta Air Lines (DAL) edged up 0.2%, United Airlines (UAL) rose 1.8%, and American Airlines (AAL) added 2.1%. U.S.-listed Airbus shares rallied 1.5%.IBD'S TAKE: Airlines stocks have had a mixed performance this earnings season. Compare and contrast JetBlue with larger rivals in IBD Stock Checkup. Mint, which debuted in 2014, offers lie-flat seats, in-flight entertainment and other amenities. Unit revenue on Mint routes has jumped by more than 20% since 2014, the company said.The carrier hopes the agreement for additional Airbus planes will help it compete in the transcontinental market, which it said was ""waiting for disruption"" and ""continues to suffer from inferior service and high prices.""The carrier also hopes the additional aircraft will strengthen its position on the West Coast. It comes as Alaska Air Group's (ALK) agreement in April to buy Virgin America (VA) gives the Seattle-based carrier a stronger West Coast presence, prompting JetBlue said it would to step up its coast-to-coast offerings of Mint flights.Meanwhile, JetBlue's Q2 results were mixed. Earnings per share jumped 20% to 53 cents, topping estimates by 4 cents. Total revenue rose around 2% to $1.64 billion, below analysts' forecasts for $1.65 billion.Passenger unit revenue, or the average amount of money an airline makes per passenger flown one mile, sank 10.5%. Yield per passenger mile, a measure of an airline's ability to charge more for tickets, fell 9.9%.Measures of unit revenue have been hurt by industrywide fare discounting, which comes after two years of cheaper oil have made it easier for airlines to spend more of their money on expansion.Passenger traffic grew 10.3%, while flight capacity rose 11.1%. As a result, the company said, load factor, or how effectively an airline fills seats, edged down to 85%.The carrier said its Q3 capacity would likely rise 5.5%-7.5%, and that it continued to expect full-year capacity to rise 8.0%-9.5%. Investors have wanted airlines to temper their capacity growth to keep it more attuned to actual demand.Unit costs, excluding fuel prices and profit sharing, would likely rise between 1%-3% for Q3, JetBlue said as it kept to its forecast for flat to 1.5% growth for the full year.

384,DAL,"Oil and gas stock ETFs leapt ahead of sector peers Monday as the major stock indexes closed mildly lower, with declines in the health care sector offsetting higher oil prices.Crude extended gains for a fourth session, jumping more than 2% as some OPEC members called for production curbs to bring crude supplies in line with demand.Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) popped 1.3% on the stock market today. Top holdings and Dow industrials Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) were among the advancers.SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production (XOP) scored a 2.1% gain and VanEck Vectors Oil Services (OIH) advanced 2.3%.Despite crumbling crude prices, energy has outstripped all but the utility sector in the S&P 500 so far in 2016, with a 15% gain.United States Oil (USO), a commodity ETF investing in near-month WTI futures, added 2.4% Monday for its best level in more than a week. West Texas intermediate crude futures settled higher at 43.02 per barrel.Health care trailed the S&P 500, with funds investing in biotech and pharmaceutical stocks giving up 1% to 2%.IBD'S TAKE: The outlook for the oil markets continues to be murky. Gillian Rich takes a look at what may be driving the change of heart among some OPEC members on a production freeze.In other ETF market action, U.S. Global Jets (JETS) added as much as 0.9% Monday before reversing. Delta Air Lines (DAL) was hit by a computer outage that lasted more than six hours, stranding global passengers.The airline ETF turned lower as investors digested news of a possible OPEC production cut, which could send energy commodity prices higher.

"
385,DAL,"American Airlines (AAL) on Friday appeared to find at least some short-term silver lining in the U.K.'s vote last month to leave the European Union, even as rivals Delta Air Lines (DAL) and United Airlines (UAL) plan to reduce flights to the region following the decision.""The direct impact, I actually think, will be positive,"" American Airlines President Scott Kirby said on a conference call to discuss the carrier's second-quarter results.""And when I say direct impact,"" he added, ""I mean the number of people having to fly back and forth across the North Atlantic, particularly business customers, as there's a lot more consultants, lawyers, bankers that are likely to be flying back and forth figuring out what the heck this means, and what are we going to do.""The U.K.'s so-called Brexit vote caused the pound to plunge against the dollar, potentially creating a foreign-exchange headache for airlines. The vote also leaves unclear the future of agreements that have facilitated business for the airline and banking industries.Delta last week cut its Q4 capacity growth outlook, in part due to Brexit, and United this week said it would reduce winter flights to Britain. The vote shook markets initially, but they have recovered since.""I think it's unlikely that we're going to see a big change in confidence, all of which means I think for the next few years at least, there's not going to be much impact from Brexit"" when considering broader economic indicators, he said.Kirby added that booked revenues have improved over the past month since the vote. But he that said that data were still limited and that the economic landscape in Europe could still change. But he said he didn't expect a lot of near-term impact from the vote.American Airlines on Friday also said total unit revenue for the third quarter would fall 3.5% to 5.5% year over year, better than results seen in the prior two quarters, and the carrier's second-quarter results surpassed expectations.Shares closed up 4% on the stock market today, continuing their climb after American last week announced a credit card deal that it expects to rake in more than $1.5 billion in pretax income over the next 2-1/2 years. Delta added 1.1% and United rose 2%.IBD'S TAKE: Higher fuel prices have helped airlines pare back their carrying-capacity growth, which could help fundamental measures of performance in the industry. See which airlines have benefited most this earnings season in IBD Stock Checkup. American Airlines also said that full-year capacity would rise roughly 2% year over year, compared to a forecast for 2.5% growth given in April.Investors have been hoping airlines will align capacity, an airline's supply of flights and seats, with passenger demand, which has not always kept up with airlines' growth plans.But lower unit revenue -- brought on by lower fares, overexpansion and weaker travel demand -- as well as rising fuel costs and global uncertainty have all helped spur more capacity discipline among rivals Delta and United Airlines this earnings season. Unit revenue measures the money airlines make as it relates to capacity.American said it expected a third-quarter adjusted pretax margin of 12% to 14%. It sees higher unit costs and fuel costs during the quarter.Q2 earnings per share fell 32% to $1.77, but that was better than analysts' expectations for $1.68. Total revenue edged up to $10.363 billion, compared to analysts' expectations for $10.317 billion.Consolidated passenger unit revenue, or how much money an airline makes on average for one passenger flown one mile, fell 6.3% during the second quarter. Consolidated passenger yield, a gauge of an airline's pricing power for airfare, fell 5.3%.The company blamed ""competitive capacity growth, continued global macroeconomic softness and foreign-currency weakness.""American also said it hoped to roll out its ""basic economy"" seating option at the end of the year, a move that helps the carrier compete with Spirit Airlines (SAVE) and other low-cost carriers.Spirit, which this week said it had seen ""more fare discounting than what is typical for a peak summer travel period,"" rose 3.6%.

386,DAL,"At the end of September, airline stocks looked like losers. The transportation sector was next to last among 33 IBD sectors. The airline industry group was No. 173 among 197 groups.

387,DAL,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) forecast improved fourth-quarter passenger unit revenue Wednesday, helped by strong December demand, and Cowen & Co. said the carrier was its top pick, arguing that many of the issues the company faced last year were behind it.Cowen said that while demand and business airfares have strengthened since the election, higher labor and fuel costs would likely deflate the industry's margins this year. But the firm offered reasons to be optimistic about Delta and maintained an outperform rating on it.""We believe investors will look to own shares that underperformed in 2016 given certain company-specific issues,"" analyst Helane Becker said in a research note out Wednesday. ""Both Delta and Southwest (LUV) had headwinds from technology outages in 3Q16, which provide for easier comps than their peers.""She also said that if business yields improve, Delta ""will be one of, if not the, largest beneficiaries of improving yields.""Meanwhile, Cowen kept its outperform rating on Southwest but downgraded the rest of the sector — including American Airlines (AAL), United Airlines (UAL), Alaska Air Group (ALK), JetBlue (JBLU) and budget carrier Spirit Airlines (SAVE) — to market perform from outperform.""We believe with the recent positive trend in the shares and subsequent upward multiple moves the group is due for a break,"" Becker wrote.Shares of Delta rose 2.5% to close at 50.70 on the stock market today, still within buy range. American rose 0.9%, United edged up 0.4% and Southwest climbed 2.6%, now above buy range. Alaska rose 1.3%, JetBlue 1.2% and Spirit 1.8%.IBD'S TAKE: As airline stocks show more bullish signs, Barclays also says that many carriers could bring ""ample upside for patient investors.""Delta expects Q4 unit revenue to decline 2.5% to 3%, better than the carrier's forecast last month for a roughly 3% dip, and has said it sees the metric going flat in Q1.For December, unit revenue was flat, as traffic growth of 2.6% outpaced a capacity increase of 1.5%. The carrier credited strong demand and better close-in domestic yields — or how much an airline can get passengers to pay for flights booked closer to departure time — for the results, as well as revenue management and more restrained capacity.The flat passenger unit revenue also came ""despite the tougher comparison resulting from the holiday timing,"" Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth noted. Analysts had expressed concern that the calendar timing of certain holidays could put a dent in airlines' December and fourth-quarter results.With unit revenue improving, Cowen said Wall Street could turn its attention to the airline industry's margins in Q2.""The issue we see with the group is that unit revenue is clearly on the road to being positive (year over year) and sooner rather than later,"" Becker noted. ""We expect investors will look for the next issue to nitpick. We believe that issue will be margin compression due to higher jet fuel and labor costs.""Meanwhile, Ryanair (RYAAY), the Irish budget carrier that says its low fares will push rivals out of markets, reported a December traffic increase of 20%.

388,DAL,"The stock market was narrowly mixed Thursday morning as it sought to bounce from a sharp decline the prior session.The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 rose 0.1%. The Nasdaq eased less than 0.1% after erasing a mild gain at the open. The composite reached a record high just past 5500 on Tuesday but has met resistance at that level. The small-cap Russell 2000 led with a 0.3% gain.In the penultimate session of 2016, volume was tracking slightly lower compared with the same time Wednesday. But winners led losers by 7-to-3 across the board.Indexes have the task of rebounding after taking a punch Wednesday that saw the S&P suffer its worst one-day decline since October.Gold stocks led as the price of gold continued a moderate rebound. The SPDR Gold Trust ETF (GLD) was up 0.4%. Some retail and transportation industry groups also were in the top 10 for the day. Energy, auto and banking stocks were some of the laggards.Nvidia (NVDA) slid more than 4% in heavy volume, continuing a sell-off that started Wednesday. The hot graphics-chip stock has flashed signs of overheating and of being in a climax top. Those included an abnormal run of nearly 30% in just 10 sessions.A couple of automakers were among the stocks down in unusually heavy volume.Tesla Motors (TSLA) fell 2%. The electric-car manufacturer has climbed back above the 200-day moving average this week as it keeps working on a long base. Toyota (TM) was down less than 1% and found support just above the 50-day line. A breakout past a 122.19 buy point Dec. 8 has been floundering, but Toyota has not made a sell signal.Elsewhere in the stock market today, Hawaiian Holdings (HA) was up 1% as one of the few stocks up in heavy trading. The parent of Hawaiian Airlines is extended from a Nov. 22 breakout and is one of several airline stocks trading near 52-week highs.Another is Copa Holdings (CPA), which is forming a flat base. Delta Air Lines (DAL) has retraced a small gain from a breakout past 49.51.RELATED:Retailers Face 2017 'Reckoning,' More 'Sad Malls' As Amazon Keeps BoomingHow To Invest: How To Track The Major Indexes Like A ProStock Market Today: The Signs That Showed A Correction In Nvidia Is NearHow To Invest: Trading Lessons From A Wall Street Legend, Gerald Loeb

389,DAL,"Airbus (EADSY) will cut its A380 delivery plans, and Delta Air Lines (DAL) canceled a Boeing (BA) 787 order.Late Tuesday, Airbus said it would shift six A380 deliveries from next year to 2018 and shift another six from 2018 to 2019 over issues with engine supplier Rolls-Royce.Emirates, Airbus' biggest A380 customer with over 140 of the superjumbo jets, said there were ""technical issues"" with the engines and voiced concerns about maintenance issues in November.The delays come after Airbus announced over the summer that it would cut production to 12 A380s in 2018 vs. the 27 it built in 2015. It planned to build 20 in 2017.The superjumbo jet is a good fit for Middle Eastern carriers with routes to densely populated Asian cities and it offers space for upscale amenities like private rooms. But overall demand for large jets has been slowing worldwide.Also Tuesday, Delta said it would cancel an order for 18 widebody 787s that it accepted as part of its merger with Northwest Airlines. The carrier will still take delivery of new 737-900ER jets through 2019.""This business decision is consistent with Delta's fleet strategy to prudently address our widebody aircraft needs,"" said Greg May, Delta's senior vice president for supply chain management and fleet, in a statement.Airbus' U.S.-listed shares were down 1.2% at 16.21 on the stock market today. Boeing shares dipped 0.9% to 156.10. Delta shares lost 1.7% to 49.51.Boeing has also seen top customers pull back their delivery plans.Last month, United Airlines (UAL) delayed delivery of $5 billion Boeing jets to look at used aircraft options and in June Southwest Airlines (LUV) delayed its order of Boeing planes.RELATED: Boeing, Airbus Supplier TransDigm Guides 2017 Low Amid CautionBoeing Gets $3.2 Billion China Southern Order As China Travel Booms

390,DAL,"This week's most notable insider trades were led by executives at Facebook (FB) and Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL), both of which report quarterly results next week, while top brass at JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Delta Air Lines (DAL) also got in on the action.COO Sheryl Sandberg disclosed a sale and options exercise of 148,104 shares for a total transaction value of $17.48 million. Michael Schroepfer, the social networking giant's chief technology officer, unloaded 51,283 shares for a transaction worth a little over $6 million. Chief Product Officer Christopher Cox shed 37,217 shares for $4.36 million. The three have been regular sellers.Facebook is expected to see earnings pop 62% when it reports Wednesday.Shares notched a 3.55% weekly gain to end at 121.01, just under a 121.18 buy point from a flat base.The CEO of Alphabet's Google unit, Sundar Pichai, was active again this week with a sale and options exercise of 4,000 shares for a transaction totaling $2.96 million.The tech giant is set to report quarterly results Thursday, with earnings projected to rise 15%.Shares rose 3.2% this week, trading in buy range from a double-bottom base with a 753.58 buy point.IBD'S TAKE: Buying a stock ahead of a quarterly report can be risky, but it can also have a big payoff. To eliminate the bulk of that risk, check out IBD's earnings options strategy in this Investor's Corner story.JPMorgan's chief risk officer, Ashley Bacon, shed 15,521 shares for nearly $993,000. COO Matthew Zames sold 3,991 shares for about $255,000.Last week, JPMorgan reported a surprise gain in earnings, while revenue rose 2% to top views.Shares jumped in the wake of the results but dipped 0.2% for the week, trading 8% below their 52-week high as they continue to consolidate.The airline's executive chairman of the board, Richard Anderson, disclosed a sale and options exercise of 758,000 shares for a total transaction value of $30.37 million.Delta Air Lines last week reported view-topping quarterly EPS while revenue slightly missed.Shares recently reclaimed their 50-day line and had been finding support around that level, but gapped down with other airline peers on Thursday after Lufthansa said terror attacks have hit travel demand.For the week, Delta lost 2.55%.Insider transactions don't typically have a major impact on a stock or indicate major pending news. Rapid liquidation of all or most of an insider's holdings, however, can affect a stock.
"
391,DAL,"Citigroup (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) led a rally in bank stocks Friday, as the strong July jobs report raised the chances of a Federal Reserve interest rate hike, potentially boosting lenders' net interest margins.The U.S. economy added 255,000 jobs in July, far above expectations for 185,000, and hiring gains for the prior two months were revised up. The unemployment rate for July remained at 4.9%, while the labor force participation rate crept up 0.1 point. The July figures follow strong results in June, after May's data disappointed.Fed funds futures prices indicate the chances of a rate hike at the central bank's September meeting have doubled to 18%.Shares of Bank of America closed up nearly 4% to 15.05 on the stock market today, gapping above their 200-day average for the first time since late December. Citigroup jumped 4.3% to 45.72, touching its 200-day line. JPMorgan rose 2.7% to 66.30. Wells Fargo (WFC) added 1.8% to 48.68, retaking its 50-day line. Investment banking giant Goldman Sachs (GS) climbed 2.6% to 162.09 while rival Morgan Stanley (MS) also rose 2.6%, to end the week at 29.01.IBD'S TAKE: July's jobs figures follow a solid round of earnings reports and stress-test results from the banks this summer. But the U.K.'s vote in June to leave the European Union left the economic landscape there in the balance and led many analysts to believe the Fed would stay cautious on raising rates. A second-quarter roundup can be found here.  Still, the outlook for consumer spending remains uncertain, even though the banks' second-quarter results portrayed a relatively stable consumer outside of the energy sector. Auto sales have also disappointed recently, and concerns have grown about an auto-loan bubble.Companies from McDonald's (MCD) to Starbucks (SBUX) to Delta Air Lines (DAL) have cited the U.S. election, Brexit, and fears of violence in the U.S. and abroad as potentially affecting their business plans and consumer sentiment.

392,DAL,"This week's top insider sales were led by the chief executives of Amazon (AMZN), Northrop Grumman (NOC) and Gilead Sciences (GILD). Meanwhile, top brass at Southwest Airlines (LUV) and Delta Air Lines (DAL) purchased shares amid the industry's recent sell-off. Bank of America (BAC) also got in on the action ahead of Friday's bullish jobs report.Chief Executive Jeff Bezos disclosed on Thursday the sale of 1 million shares for a total transaction value of $756.7 million, a week after the company's view-topping second-quarter earnings report. Bezos also shed 1 million shares the week after Amazon's first-quarter report.The e-commerce giant has been on a big run, gaining 27% since breaking out of a cup-with-handle base shortly before its first-quarter earnings report in April. Amazon shares finished Friday up 0.7% to 765.98, just below their all-time high of 770.50 set on Monday.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon earns a high IBD Composite Rating of 97 out of 99 based on top-notch fundamental and technical factors including earnings and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity and relative price performance. For all the details, take a look at IBD Stock Checkup.The defense contractor's CEO, Wesley Bush, disclosed on Friday the sale of 35,000 shares for a transaction valued at $7.65 million.Northrop reported estimate-beating quarterly results last week, but a drop in technology service sales impacted its profit margin and weighed on shares.Still, the stock has been able to find support at its 50-day line. It ended Friday trading at 218.95, a penny ahead of its buy point. Northrop is also trading just 2% below a recent high.CEO John Milligan on Monday disclosed a sale and options exercise of 70,000 shares for $4.97 million.Last week, Gilead gapped down to breach its 50-day moving average after reporting its first quarterly sales and earnings decline in years. The biotech's shares are now trading more than 30% below their 52-week high, and ended Friday up 0.8% to 80.41.Three Southwest executives grabbed more shares this week. CEO Gary Kelly disclosed Wednesday the purchase of 28,106 shares for a little over $1 million.Director William Cunningham bought 5,700 shares for a little over $204,000, while EVP and COO Michael Van De Ven bought 4,200 shares for about $150,000.Southwest jumped 3.9% to 37.85 Friday, looking to rebound from a nearly six-month low hit on Tuesday amid a broad sell-off in consumer stocks as well a drop among airline peers sparked by European travel fears.Delta was hit especially hard on Tuesday after reporting a 7% dive in July unit revenue. Director George Mattson took the opportunity to buy shares on the cheap, and disclosed Thursday the purchase of 10,000 shares for nearly $365,000.The stock's recent attempts to retake the downward-sloping 50-day line have been met with resistance. Though shares rebounded Friday, climbing 3.1% to 37.67 at the close, the stock is still trading nearly 30% below its 52-week high.Director Thomas Woods disclosed Wednesday a 25,000-share purchase totaling about $353,000.Bank of America and its banking peers rallied Friday as the strong July jobs report increased the chances of a Fed rate hike, which would potentially boost lenders' net interest margins.Shares gapped up by early 4% to retake the 200-day line for the first time in 2016, ending Friday's trading at 15.05. The stock is trading 17% below its 52-week peak.Insider transactions don't typically have a major impact on a stock or indicate major pending news. Rapid liquidation of all or most of an insider's holdings, however, can affect a stock.
"
393,DAL,"Spirit Airlines' (SAVE) warning on its second-quarter unit revenue raised fears that fare discounts from rivals could be weighing, sinking shares Tuesday and putting pressure on Southwest (LUV), JetBlue (JBLU) and Alaska Air (ALK).Late Monday, Spirit said Q2 total unit revenue, which measures the money an airline makes as it relates to available seats and flight distance, ""came in at the low end of the range contemplated in our initial guidance for the quarter (down 14.3% year over year).""Spirit also said it saw ""more fare discounting than what is typical for a peak summer travel period."" Industrywide fare discounting -- some of it prompted by aggressive expansion from low-cost carriers like Spirit into the bigger airlines' turf -- has hurt airlines' unit revenue.Shares closed down 6.1% on the stock market today. The stock is making its way through a cup base begun in April. Southwest shed 1.1%, JetBlue eased 1.2% and Alaska fell 0.6%.IBD'S TAKE: Airline stocks have struggled in recent months. But domestic-focused carriers such as Spirit Airlines, Alaska and Southwest have fared far better than global giants such as United, Delta and American, which are more exposed to the strong dollar and other global headwinds. How does Spirit's stock compare with its larger rivals? See IBD Stock Checkup for more information.Spirit also estimated that its economic fuel cost crept up 2 cents from its earlier forecast to $1.47 per gallon. But the increase wasn't as steep as those forecast this month by American Airlines (AAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL). Wall Street has been concerned that airlines have been too dependent on cheap oil for profits.However, Spirit said Q2 capacity growth likely came in at 23.1%, slightly lower than the 23.8% growth the company forecast in April. Investors have been hoping airlines would rein in their capacity, or supply of available seats, to improve unit revenue.Adjusted unit costs likely fell around 8%, Spirit said, better than the roughly 5% drop expected for the second quarter in April.Spirit's announcement came ahead of United Airlines' (UAL) second-quarter results, which topped Wall Street forecasts on earnings and revenue.United Airlines shares closed 0.3% higher then rallied 2% after the close. American lost less than 0.1%, Delta rose 1.1%, with both edging up late.
"
394,DAL,"Southwest (LUV) missed second-quarter expectations and forecast its first unit-revenue decline for the year, while warnings from European carriers on the effects of recent terror attacks weighed on Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL).Southwest's Q2 earnings per share rose 15.5% to 1.19, missing estimates by 2 cents. Revenue rose 5% to $5.38 billion, shy of views for $5.405 billion. Traffic growth of 6% outpaced capacity growth of 4.8%, leading to a unit revenue gain of 0.6%.But the discount carrier expects Q3 unit revenue, which measures revenue as it relates to an airline's carrying capacity, to fall 3%-4%. That's worse than consensus for a 1.3% drop, according to a research note from Cowen.""While solid traffic demand has continued into July, thus far, the fare environment remains challenging, and close-in yields have softened in recent weeks,"" CEO Gary Kelly said in a statement, referring to an airline's ability to charge more for tickets booked closer to a flight's departure.Shares plunged 11.2% on the stock market today, diving below their 50-day average. A computer glitch Wednesday also forced Southwest to cancel flights, but it has since been fixed. United lost 3.4%, Delta dropped 4.2%, and American retreated by 2.7%. European carriers Lufthansa and easyJet said Thursday that terror attacks in the region and international upheaval were likely to discourage travel.IBD'S TAKE: Southwest and other domestic-focused carriers have been more insulated from the international troubles faced by its bigger network rivals. But low fares continue to affect fundamentals. See how Southwest and rivals stack up at IBD Stock Checkup. Southwest also said it expected unit costs to rise around 2% for Q3 and roughly 1% for the full year.Southwest began offering more flights after federal limits on its Love Field hub in Dallas expired in 2014. But as oil prices crashed that year, the big three network carriers and low-cost carriers like Spirit Airlines (SAVE) also stepped up flight coverage, creating a competitive, lower-fare landscape that weighed on unit revenue.On Tuesday, Spirit warned on its Q2 unit revenue, citing ""more fare discounting than what is typical for a peak summer travel period.""Southwest noted Thursday that Q3 comparison will be more difficult as its co-branded credit card agreement JPMorgan Chase (JPM) went into effect a year earlier. American Airlines recently forecast a $1.55 billion pretax income boost over the next 2-1/2 years from a similar deal with Citigroup (C), Mastercard (MA) and Barclays (BCS).Meanwhile, Alaska Air Group (ALK) said earnings per share jumped 20% to $2.12, topping analyst forecasts. Total revenue rose 4% to $1.494 billion; analysts expected $1.498 billion.Alaska Air Group agreed in April to buy Virgin America (VA) to strengthen its West Coast presence.Alaska Air stock climbed 1.9%.Hawaiian Holdings (HA), the parent of Hawaiian Airlines, closed down 0.6%. After the market close, Hawaiian rose modestly after reporting Q2 EPS of $1.21 on revenue of $594 million. Analysts had expected EPS of $1.15 on revenue of $591 million.American reports earnings on Friday.
"
395,DAL,"Nonfarm payrolls rose by 255,000 in July, the Labor Department said Friday morning, much better than expected for a second straight month, and reviving sentiment about the U.S. economy. But while the Federal Reserve will take notice, markets aren't expecting Fed action for several months.The jobless rate held at 4.9%, while hourly earnings rose 0.3% and the workweek nudged higher.Economists expected nonfarm payrolls up 185,000, the jobless rate dipping to 4.8% and average hourly earnings 0.3% higher.Also, June's strong figure was revised up by 5,000 to 292,000. May's weak hiring was revised up by 13,000 to 24,000.""Maybe it's not morning in America, but the coffee is brewing and jobs are being created,"" said Joel Naroff, president and chief economist of Naroff Economic Advisors.Professional services, hospitality, retail and government sectors were key contributors. Manufacturing also rose in a broad-based gain. Mining, which includes oil drilling, showed further declines.The labor force participation rate rose 0.1 point for a second straight month to 62.8% as the labor force climbed by 407,000. The household survey, from which the unemployment rate is derived, showed an employment gain 0f 420,000.""The July jobs report was uniformly positive and strong,"" said IHS Chief Economist Nariman Behravesh in statement. He said the strong labor force gain ""signals greater confidence among US workers about job prospects.""Behravesh did note that ""as the economy approaches and reaches full employment, the pace of jobs gains is likely to slow.""Stocks soared on the jobs report, with the S&P 500 hitting a fresh high and the Nasdaq composite rising to within 1% of its all-time best.Normally, back-to-back strong jobs reports and bullish markets would raise the specter of a Federal Reserve rate hike. But with other economic reports looking less robust -- and other central banks such as the Bank of England and Bank of Japan increasing monetary stimulus --- U.S. policymakers are still seen on hold for the foreseeable future.Fed funds futures peg the odds of a September or November meeting hike below 20%, vs. below 10% before the jobs report. The odds don't top 50% until next March, though investors see a reasonable chance of a December move.""Given the unevenness of the data and still-present imbalance in the economy across sectors with a relatively solid consumer and markedly weak business investment, policy makers are likely to wait for further information regarding the longer-term trajectory of activity,"" wrote Stifel Fixed Income chief economist Lindsey Piegza.Strong hiring and solid wage gains --  holding at post-recession high of 2.6% vs. a year earlier -- should underpin consumer spending, which the economy has relied on even more in recent months. Consumer spending rose at a brisk 4.2% annual rate in the second quarter, even as the overall economy grew about 1% for a third straight quarter.But recent corporate reports have raised doubts about consumer-related stocks and perhaps the broader economy.Apple (AAPL) reported a second straight quarter of declining earnings and revenue. Apple shares have rallied as per-share earnings and iPhone sales topped weak forecasts, but they reflect weak demand.IBD'S TAKE: For a more detailed look at consumer-related stocks' recent woes, click here.Ford Motor (F) last week missed second-quarter earnings estimates, citing sluggish U.S. sales and higher incentive spending climbed. Ford predicted domestic industry sales would fall in 2016 and 2017. On Tuesday, Ford and General Motors (GM) reported declining sales vs. a year earlier. Other automakers generally reported weaker-than-expected results.Meanwhile, McDonald's (MCD) and Starbucks (SBUX) also have reported weaker-than-expected U.S. comps, both citing consumer unease in part. Several analysts see restaurant stocks in trouble generally, though pizza chains are doing well.Delta Air Lines (DAL) on Tuesday reported weak July unit revenue, hitting airline stocks that day.Despite retailers' headwinds, the sector added 25,000 jobs last month.Manufacturing added 15,000, the best since January. Auto production had been a manufacturing driver for several years. If Ford, General Motors and others see flat to lower sales for the foreseeable future, that could hurt factory output and jobs. And with oil prices well off midyear highs, any hoped-for revival in energy-related jobs may also be short-lived.

396,DAL,"Stocks reversed modestly lower Wednesday, after the Nasdaq capped Tuesday's session at a new closing high.The S&P 500 closed just below a fresh record of its own and the Dow industrials settled less than 0.3% from the 20,000 mark.In morning trade, the Nasdaq fell 0.5%, the S&P 500 0.4% and the Dow 0.1%.Goldman Sachs (GS) rose 0.6% intraday. Goldman shares are up about 70% from a July low, riding rallies in both banking and commodity prices — although analysts' consensus projects a sharp slowdown in the bank's fourth-quarter earnings growth.Delta Air Lines (DAL) fell 1.2%, and Boeing (BA) dipped 0.1% after the two companies agreed to cancel an order for 18 widebody 787 Dreamliner aircraft. The order was placed by Northwest Airlines prior to its acquisition by Delta in 2008.  Delta has ordered 25 widebody aircraft from Airbus, according to Reuters, and has orders for 120 narrow-body jets from Boeing.Qualcomm (QCOM) slipped 1% after South Korean regulators fined the company $853 million for antitrust regulations. The move, which followed similar penalties in China, raised questions about Qualcomm's royalty revenue model in those countries. The stock is forming a cup with handle with a 70.34 buy point.Graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) fell more than 3% after rising 2% in the premarket and soaring nearly 7% on Tuesday. The high-flying IBD 50 stock has begun flashing some warning signs that it might be due for a pullback of some sort.Rumbles from the oil price war continued, with Bonanza Creek Energy (BCEI) diving 11%. The Denver-based oil producer reported it had committed to a bankruptcy protection plan that would wipe $850 million in debt from its books in a prepackaged bankruptcy to be initiated Jan. 5.  Bonanza shares ended Tuesday's session down 98% from a June 2014 high.In Japan, Toshiba shares dropped hard for a second straight session as investors continued to react to the company's warning of multi-billion-dollar writedowns linked to its Westinghouse nuclear operations in the U.S. Shares are down 30% so far this week on the Tokyo market. Toshiba's U.S. shares, trading over the counter as TOSBF, were 0ff 23%.Economic news will keep things simple in the stock market today, with only November pending home sales numbers expected from the National Association of Realtors at 10 a.m. ET.Oil prices rose modestly, pushing West Texas Intermediate just above $54 a barrel. Gold traded a fraction higher to $1,140.70 an ounce. The dollar edged up. The 10-year yield was down 1 basis point to 2.55%.Overseas markets were narrowly mixed Wednesday.

398,DAL,"The airline industry's declines in unit revenue — and a nearly two-year fixation on the key metric — appear likely to end next year, but investor attention could shift to margins and attempts to counter low-cost carriers.Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL), United Airlines (UAL) and JetBlue (JBLU) have all forecast improvements in Q4 unit revenue, with American indicating it could be positive by the end of 2016.""Even at West Palm Beach, which is normally an airport where I can get there 20 minutes before my plane is due to take off and get right through security ... there was a long line even at the TSA PreCheck,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said. ""So we're definitely seeing an increase in traffic. We're definitely seeing an uptick in pricing.""Airline stocks have taken off too. IBD's Transportation-Airline industry group has jumped more than 40% from a June low, helped by Berkshire Hathaway's (BRKB) bet on the sector.So ... ""mission accomplished,"" right?To be sure, maintaining positive unit revenue will still be important next year. But analysts say the recovery could draw more attention to the health of the airlines' margins as they contend with more expensive fuel as well as richer pay and benefits for their employees.""Investors are expecting margin compression in most cases — the focus here is on if the magnitude can be better than feared,"" Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth said over email.Meanwhile, competition for leisure travelers from budget carriers, in the U.S. and over the Atlantic Ocean, will continue to make life difficult for the United, Delta and American.Ultra-low-cost but heavy-fee carriers, like Spirit Airlines (SAVE), could comprise 10% of the U.S. market by 2020, according Becker. That would be a big jump from today. A recent Barclays note estimated the sector's share of U.S. revenue at 3% in Q2 this year.But the big three U.S. network carriers have rolled out or plan to roll out barer-bones, ""basic economy"" seating classes to win back customers seeking cheap fares.Research indicates an opening for them. A recent Morning Consult survey found that 44% said they prefer to fly with a full-service carrier, while 28% said they preferred a budget one that breaks out extra costs.Becker said bargain-seeking travelers could gravitate to the basic economy seats offered by Delta, United and American, if their ticket prices are close to what's offered by budget rivals, as the on-time performance of carriers like Spirit has largely lagged.""I think there are a lot of the ultra-low-cost carriers that kind of think of it as being, 'Well, we're within an hour of our posted departure time, we're doing a good job,' "" she told IBD.IBD'S TAKE: As airline stocks show more bullish signs, Barclays also says that many carriers could bring ""ample upside for patient investors.""Despite the challenge from the no-frills airlines, the barriers to entry in the airline sector are high, and the last decade's consolidation wave has left Delta, United, American and Southwest (LUV) with inherent advantages. Those four controlled 86% of the revenue in the U.S. market in Q2, Barclays estimated.Industry watchers say that edge was part of the reason Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway recently bought those stocks after the billionaire investor once called the industry a ""death trap"" for investors.""Buffett likes a moat,"" said Frank Holmes, CEO of U.S. Global Investors, which launched the airline-tracking U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) in 2015. ""And he said in business, 'I look for economic castles protected by an unbreachable moat.' ""Also, the prospect of tax reform, fewer regulations and more infrastructure development under the incoming Trump administration could help air travel and the industry.But amid the changes headed for airlines next year, there's still one metric that rises above the rest.""I would expect that even if/after unit revenue turns positive next year, that will remain the most focused-on metric as investors see it as the best way of determining pricing power in the industry and it's the most significant driver of EPS (outside of big swings in oil prices),"" Stifel analyst Joseph DeNardi said over email.RELATED:United: Airlines Within Airlines Are 'Doomed To Fail'United, Southwest See Stronger Ticket Demand During Holidays

399,DAL,"International Airlines Group, the parent of British Airways, plans to launch low-cost, long-haul flights out of Barcelona starting in June — with potential U.S. destinations on the West Coast — marking the newest entry into a trans-Atlantic market swarming with low-cost carriers.The planned operation comes as the big three U.S. network carriers, Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL), also try to maintain their influence in the airspace over the Atlantic as offerings from budget carriers have grown more common internationally.Iceland's Wow air, Canada's WestJet and Norwegian Air Shuttle offer lower-cost flights across the Atlantic. A budget airline from Air France-KLM could also eventually come to the U.S., the Wall Street Journal reported last month.What IAG's budget operation might look like is not yet clear. In a statement, IAG said that options include creating a new airline or ""using existing resources from IAG's airlines."" No decision has been made yet, the company said.The new operation could offer flights to San Francisco, Los Angeles, Argentina's Buenos Aires, Chile's Santiago, Tokyo and Havana, a market the U.S. has only just begun to re-enter after a thawing of diplomatic relations with Cuba.Low-cost carriers, in the U.S. and internationally, have become more of a topic of discussion recently among the U.S. network carriers. Delta recently said it has no plans to create ""an airline within an airline"" to compete with low-cost rivals overseas. United said the airline-within-an-airline approach ""was always doomed to fail.""IBD'S TAKE: Rather than create ""an airline within an airline"" to compete with low-cost carriers, the big 3 U.S. airlines appear to think ""basic economy"" offerings on their flights is the way forward. Delta has said it was considering an array of fare classes and cabin layouts to draw more types of passengers to their trans-Atlantic flights.Delta closed up 0.2% at 49.89 in the stock market today, still in buy range. United climbed 0.8% while American dipped 0.4%.

401,DAL,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) and Alaska Air Group (ALK) will end their code-sharing agreement after April 30, the carriers said Monday, a largely expected move that follows years of diminishing returns from the deal and Alaska's recent merger with Virgin America.The decision to end the pact also follows escalating competition between Delta and Alaska in Seattle, and Delta said its expansion into that market reduced the need for code-shares, or the agreements airlines make to share flight routes.The decision, Delta said, ""is a positive milestone for both airlines as Alaska focuses on its merger integration with Virgin America and Delta focuses on creating more customer choice at its Seattle-Tacoma International Airport hub,"" where Delta has more than tripled its flights since 2013.Revenue from the agreement has been falling since 2009, and the impact on Alaska is expected to be minimal next year, Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note. Alaska also has ""a significant number of other partners who serve many of the same markets as Delta,"" she noted.Delta edged up 0.5% to 50.42 on the stock market today, still in buy range after breaking out two weeks ago. Alaska rallied 1.8% to 90.34, nearing profit-taking sell territory. American Airlines (AAL) rose 2% and United Airlines (UAL) added 0.1%.IBD'S TAKE: The prospect of higher oil prices, greater operational discipline and fewer regulations under a Trump presidency have lifted airline stocks in recent weeks. Warren Buffett's recent investment in the airlines hasn't hurt either. Starting May 1, passengers of either airline will no longer be able to earn or redeem Delta miles or Mileage Plan miles on flights conducted by the other airline, Delta said, adding that the carriers will keep an ""interline agreement"" that allows connectivity for ticketing and baggage.Alaska closed its purchase of Virgin last week, making it the fifth largest U.S. airline and a stronger player on the West Coast.Alaska, in announcing the merger's closing, said that it plans to make a decision on what to do with the Virgin America brand early next year. Still, Alaska CEO Brad Tilden said that ""Alaska Airlines and Virgin America are different airlines, but we believe different works — and we're confident fliers will agree.""RELATED:Delta's Costs Spike But Yields Improving; Southwest, Hawaiian Flirt With BuysAlaska Air Takes On Some Heavy Baggage With Virgin BuyoutAmerican Airlines Signals Even Faster Unit Revenue Recovery Than Delta

Merck (MRK) had succeeded with a similar patient group in a trial of its competing drug Keytruda, though it was aiming at a smaller potential market. Merck stock jumped 10.4%, hitting its highest level since June 2001.Earlier, Merck was reported to be talking with Biogen (BIIB) about a possible Biogen buyout, as was Allergan (AGN). This further boosted Biogen's stock a day after its partner Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) announced the unexpected success of a clinical trial of nusinersen, a treatment for a rare spinal disease with blockbuster potential.

403,DAL,"United Airlines (UAL) on Wednesday said it expected transatlantic flight capacity to be down 1%-2% in the fourth quarter, and the company said weaker pricing for corporate travel and global uncertainty could restrain seating supply for the rest of the year.The capacity forecast for the region, included in a slide presentation, came a day after the carrier said it would reduce U.S. flights to the U.K. this winter, partly due to the U.K.'s vote last month to leave the European Union. Delta Air Lines (DAL) also cut its fourth-quarter flight capacity outlook to 1% growth, partly due to the Brexit vote.The vote initially shocked world markets and has left the U.K.'s business relationship with the rest of Europe up in the air. United's presentation said the company was monitoring the effects of Brexit and would ""adjust accordingly.""United expects overall fourth-quarter capacity growth of 1%-2%, partly due to lower GDP estimates for the period.

United CEO Oscar Munoz said Wednesday that ""we fully acknowledge we aren't yet performing from a financial perspective to the level of our and your expectations.""Delta has said it would remain dedicated to turning around unit revenue, a key measure of an airline's financial performance, by year-end. United has been less committed to a specific target.Munoz on Wednesday said the company acknowledged ""the importance of returning to positive unit revenue"" and how its capacity plans affect the metric, which measures sales per passenger as it relates to available flight seating and distance traveled.""However, we must evaluate what our network is today and the evolution to ensure that long-term optimization of sustainable earnings is maintained,"" he said during the call.

404,DAL,"Kate Spade (KATE) plunged Wednesday after the handbag and fashion company missed estimates and slashed guidance, blaming tourism and general retail woes. The move also dragged down peers including Michael Kors (KORS) and Coach (COH) and exacerbated concerns about the consumer sector. Kate Spade's Q2 earnings per share rose 38% to 11 cents, missing estimates by 3 cents a share. The retailer topped earnings expectations in Q1 after missing the prior four quarters in a row.""Several factors contributed to our second-quarter results falling short of our expectations, the most impactful of which are the retail landscape and continuing tourist headwinds,"" CEO Craig Leavitt said in the written earnings statement.Terror fears and a rising dollar is hurting travel from Europe.The New York retailer sees full-year earnings of 63-70 cents, far below analyst consensus of 78 cents a share. It cut its 2016 revenue outlook to $1.37 billion to $1.48 billion, down from $1.39 billion-$1.41 billion, and below projections of $1.41 billion.IBD'S TAKE: Kate Spade's earnings miss and weak outlook is stoking fears that weakness in the consumer sector and a slump in tourism could be a negative economic indicator. To see how Kate Spade ranks vs. other retailers see the IBD Stock Checkup.Kate Spade shares dived more than 18% to 16.47 at the close on the stock market today.

Meanwhile, Delta Air Lines (DAL) reported weak July revenue, bringing down airline stocks that day. And Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) tumbled Tuesday on weak sales and sales guidance, following weaker-than-expected U.S. sales at McDonald's (MCD) and Starbucks (SBUX).
"
405,DAL,"The consumer stock sell-off intensified and broadened Tuesday, as bad news from General Motors (GM) added to concerns from McDonald's (MCD), Ford Motor (F) and others.The consumer slide fueled a general market retreat. But it's also a warning for the broader U.S. economy.Recent economic data on consumers have been positive. Consumer spending rose at a robust 4.2% annual rate in the second quarter, with a Tuesday report showing a 0.4% monthly gain in June. But consumers were a rare bright spot, with business investment falling for a third straight quarter and homebuilding spending also falling. If consumer spending falters, the economy may struggle to match its anemic second-quarter growth of 1.2%.General Motors and Ford reported July U.S. sales that fell vs. a year earlier. Fiat Chrysler Automotive (FCAU) eked out a gain, but less than expected. Ford had reported weak earnings last week amid rising incentives spending and stalling U.S. demand. It sees U.S. industry sales falling in 2016 and 2017 after years of big gains.General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler shares fell 4.4%, 4.3% and 4%, respectively, on the stock market today.Texas Roadhouse (TXRH), which has been a top-rated restaurant stock, fell 12.4% Tuesday. The steakhouse chain missed on second-quarter revenue and said same-store sales growth was slowing in the early weeks of the current third quarter. Dave & Buster's (PLAY) dived 5.6%, taking a round trip on its breakout.Those follow weaker demand at McDonald's, which had been a great turnaround story in recent months. But last week McDonald's said U.S. comps in the second quarter fell short of Wall Street forecasts, and cited ""softening industry growth."" Starbucks (SBUX) also reported weak U.S. comps.More generally, analysts have been issuing warnings about the retail sector.McDonald's fell 0.3% Tuesday and Starbucks 1.6%.IBD'S TAKE: Texas Roadhouse and Dave & Buster's have been among the best-rated restaurant stocks in recent weeks. For a complete look at these stocks and other consumer giants, take a look at IBD Stock Checkup.Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) cut its 2016 outlook Tuesday, citing higher fuel costs and the weak British pound following the Brexit vote. Royal Caribbean stock sank 6.3% Tuesday. Carnival (CCL) lost 3.1%.Airlines sold off Tuesday as Delta Air Lines (DAL) said unit revenue fell sharply in July. Also hitting the sector: A Zika virus warning for a Miami neighborhood and  German carrier Lufthansa saying that terror attacks and global unease have had a ""tangible"" impact on demand. Delta Air stock fell more than 7% intraday, while American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) fell 6%.Department stores were among the biggest losers, with Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) down 8% and Nordstrom (JWN) tumbling 7%.Kroger got a downgrade from BMO Capital Markets to market perform from outperform, citing the deflationary environment for groceries. Shares are off 4.1%, on track for their lowest close since early January 2015. That follows weak same-store sales from natural foods grocer Whole Foods Market (WFM).One relative bright spot for consumer stocks has been consumer products producers such as Procter & Gamble (PG). P&G edged past profit views Tuesday, rising 0.4% to 86.78 for a 52-week high. But Procter & Gamble and other consumer- and food-product giants have been relying on cost cuts to offset declining revenue.
"
406,DAL,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) said it remains focused on hitting positive unit revenues by the end of the year as it trims capacity growth, but appeared to leave open the possibility of some wiggle room on that goal's timeline.The carrier is making the right moves to improve unit revenue ""even if it takes longer than year-end,"" Delta CEO Ed Bastian said on an earnings conference call Thursday.In December, Delta said it expected to return to a ""flat to positive unit revenue trajectory"" by this summer. The company later pushed that goal back to the end of the year.And while it laid out plans to limit growth, Delta said it would not consider outright cuts to capacity.Delta's latest remarks come as Delta and other airlines have struggled to improve unit revenue, which measures the money airlines make from passengers as it relates to available seats and distance traveled. Unit revenue has fallen since last year due to an array of factors: expanded flight coverage prompted by cheaper fuel, competitive cuts in ticket prices, the stronger dollar and insufficient demand.Delta's shares ended trading up 3.6% to 40.98 on the stock market today but had been as high as 4.5%. United Airlines (UAL), which reports quarterly results on Tuesday, jumped 4.3% to 47.85. American Airlines (AAL), which reports results next Friday, rallied 4.2% to 35.88.IBD'S TAKE: Delta Air shares fell last month to their lowest level since late 2014 as Brexit fears hit global carriers. Shares have rebounded but have met resistance this week at the fast-falling 50-day moving average. Wait for Delta to build the right side of a sound base before booking your ticket in this stock.For the second quarter, Delta's earnings per share increased 16% to $1.47, topping views for $1.45. Total revenue fell 2.4% to $10.45 billion, compared with analysts' expectations for $10.5 billion. Passenger unit revenue fell 4.9%, weighed by a tough foreign exchange environment.Delta said in a statement that the savings from cheap oil, which gave the industry a profit windfall last year, ""are largely behind us."" For Q3, Delta sees an average fuel prices of $1.52-$1.57 per gallon, better than the spike seen in Q2.The company forecast a Q3 unit revenue decline of 4%-6% and capacity growth of 1%-2%, showing better discipline than Q2's 3.2% increase.On Thursday's earnings call, Bastian conceded that the airline had done ""a poor job"" predicting changes in unit revenue, but vowed to improve it.The U.K.'s vote last month to leave the European Union appeared to hasten the company's plans to restrain capacity growth. Delta said it would cut its Q4 flight-capacity growth forecast by roughly one percentage point to 1%, citing in part the uncertainty caused the Brexit vote and its impact on the pound, which plunged after the vote.Delta also Thursday said it hopes to have full domestic coverage for basic economy by next year, as it competes with low-cost carriers like Spirit Airlines (SAVE).

408,DAL,"American Airlines (AAL) forecast higher-than-expected second-quarter fuel costs, but it said a key measure of its operating efficiency wouldn't be as bad as expected, echoing similar guidance from United Airlines (UAL). Meanwhile, JetBlue (JBLU) reported strong June traffic results, sending shares higher.American now sees Q2 fuel costs of $1.39-$1.44 on average per gallon, higher than the $1.30-$1.35 forecast in April. That, however, was not as bad as the outlook given by Delta Air Lines (DAL), which said it expected Q2 fuel costs of $1.95-$2.00 per gallon on average, far above an earlier forecast of $1.48-$1.53.Fuel is often one of the industry's biggest expenses. Investors have worried that airlines have relied too much on the cheap fuel seen over the past two years to prop up their profits.American also expects Q2 consolidated passenger unit revenue to fall 6%-7%, better than earlier forecasts for a 6%-8% decline. The metric gauges revenue per passenger as it relates to available seats and distance traveled.Late Monday, United said it sees Q2 consolidated passenger unit revenue falling 6.5%-6.75%, better than an earlier forecast for a decline of up to 7.5%.Shares of American edged down 0.6% on the stock market today, a day after the stock jumped 11.2%, above its 50-day line for the first time since April. United lost 0.65%, following Tuesday's 9% jump, and Delta retreated 1.6%. But JetBlue climbed 1.1%.IBD'S TAKE: While the outlook for unit revenue is less grim, rising fuel costs are starting to erode profit growth, with Delta's Q2 earnings expected to show the smallest gain since 2014.American also said that flight capacity for 2016 would be up around 2%, showing a bit more discipline in its expansion compared to the 2.5% forecast for the year in April.Passenger traffic for June rose 2.2%, while capacity rose 2.8%. Load factor -- a measure of an airline's ability to fill seats -- fell 0.5 percentage point to 84.9%.After a cheap-fuel boom last year spurred fare cuts and competitive expansion, Wall Street has hoped that airlines would raise fares and keep the growth of flight capacity -- the supply of available flights -- more in line with passenger demand. Airlines have had difficulty this year striking that balance, and unit revenue has fallen as a result.Meanwhile, JetBlue reported a June passenger traffic increase of 11.6%, outpacing a 10.5% increase in capacity. Load factor rose 0.9 percentage point to 86.2%.Delta Air Lines kicks off the second-quarter earnings season for the airline industry on Thursday. Along with far higher fuel costs, the carrier has already forecast weaker unit revenue than anticipated and thinner margins.United reports its Q2 results on Tuesday. American holds its earnings call next Friday. JetBlue holds its Q2 conference call on July 26.

Airlines are back up to early June levels after dipping for much of the last month. Hotels recovered to March levels after a four-month drought. The travel booking sector that includes Priceline and Expedia is back up after a brief, Brexit-inspired sell-off. And cruise lines recently broke out to reach prices not seen since December.The attack in Nice happened late Thursday night as revelers were at a parade celebrating France's Bastille Day. A truck, reportedly filled with weapons and explosives, slammed into the crowd killing at least 84 people and wounding 100 others.The suspected terror attack comes eight months after gunmen opened fire at a Paris nightclub and cafes frequented by tourists.But, like prior attacks, the incident in Nice is unlikely to have long term effects on travel.In an prior interview with IBD, Jack Plunkett, CEO of global market research firm Plunkett Research, said that airlines were busy again within a few weeks after the 9/11 terror attacks and the same was true after the 2002 nightclub bombing in Bali, Indonesia, and the transit bombings in Madrid in 2004 and London in 2005.

415,DAL,"Priceline Group (PCLN) and Expedia (EXPE) could face increased competition from Airbnb, which is developing a service for booking air travel, according to a report from Bloomberg.Development of the flight-booking feature is early and Airbnb is considering various routes to break into the business, the Bloomberg report said, citing people familiar with the plans. It said Airbnb may acquire an online travel agency or license data from a provider, such as Amadeus IT Group or Sabre (SABR).Last month, Delta Air Lines (DAL) announced a partnership with Airbnb. The partnership allows Airbnb guests to earn SkyMiles redeemable for Delta flights.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's Leisure-Travel Book group has been a laggard, as it ranks 165 out of 197 industry groups tracked by IBD. Priceline is the top-rated stock in the group. Priceline has an IBD Composite Rating of 74, meaning it has outperformed 74% of stocks on a variety of metrics over the past year. Here's a look at other Tech Leaders.Priceline shares closed 0.3% higher at 1,488.83 in the stock market today, still below their 50-day moving average.

416,DAL,"Tech stocks fell out of favor after the election sparked a wave of sector rotation, but they're now starting to make a comeback as Apple (AAPL), Netflix (NFLX) and Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL) are all nearing buy points. Broadcom (AVGO) and Delta Air Lines (DAL) are also showing compelling chart action.After finding support near its 200-day line and retaking its 50-day line, Alphabet closed Friday at 809.84, 3.5% below an 839.10 flat base buy point.Netflix, which has been added to IBD's Leaderboard, closed Friday at 124.22, close to a 129.39 cup-with-handle buy point, with the base going back to early December 2015.

"
417,DAL,"American Airlines' (AAL) bullish forecast on its credit-card deals and United Airlines' (UAL) more upbeat Q2 outlook sparked a sector rally ahead of Delta Air Lines' (DAL) quarterly report Thursday.Three months ago, when Delta reported Q1 results, investors and analysts were focused when the carrier might improve unit revenue -- a key measure of money made from passengers -- amid concerns cheap fuel was doing the heavy lifting on the bottom line. Three months later? Basically the same story.""It's a broken record: the focus will continue to be on the pricing environment,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note on Monday.Analysts expect Delta's Q2 earnings per share to rise 16.5% to $1.48, its weakest growth since 2014, when a drop in oil prices helped lift industry profits all through last year. Overall revenue is seen slipping 1.9% to $10.5 billion.American surged 11.2% in the stock market today. United jumped 8.8%, and Delta rallied 5.5%. American shares were helped by management's forecast that credit-card deals with Citigroup (C) and Barclays (BCS) will add $1.55 billion to pretax income in  the next two-and-a-half years.IBD'S TAKE: While United, Delta and American have seen unit revenue continue to suffer, discount carrier Southwest Airlines (LUV) has predicted a Q2 increase in that metric.Unit revenue dropped industrywide last year after costs fell and airlines expanded with lower fares in competitive markets. Weaker travel demand and the strong dollar have also hurt unit revenue.The environment may have shifted. Late Monday, United said it sees Q2 consolidated passenger unit revenue falling 6.5%-6.75%, better than an earlier forecast for a decline of up to 7.5%. The company cited higher fares internationally and stronger business travel at the end of June as reasons for the improvement.On Tuesday, analysts at Deutsche Bank upgraded United, American and Delta and lifted their prices targets, saying headwinds like Brexit, weaker global growth and excess capacity have been priced into shares, while improvements in unit revenue have yet to be fully reflected in their stock prices.""In light of the current valuations, we think downside is limited and that therefore investors can afford to be early given the rapidity in which airline share prices can appreciate once it becomes apparent that trends are indeed getting better,"" according to Deutsche Bank.Analysts at Credit Suisse, however, said earlier this month that unit revenue for Delta, United and American is unlikely to stop declining until late 2017.Delta has said that it wants to be ""the first network carrier to return to positive unit revenue growth later this year."" That almost certainly didn't happen in Q2 -- the carrier last week said that unit revenue for the quarter likely fell 5%, worse than the company initially expected.Fuel prices spiked far past Delta's expectations during the quarter, the company said, while capacity rose to the high end of its expected range. Operating margins were also expected to be thinner, due to losses suffered after the company settled its remaining fuel-hedge contracts for this year. Those contracts attempt to lock in cheap fuel prices to guard against oil-price fluctuations.In reporting first-quarter results, Delta said it would cut capacity during the fall if necessary to improve unit revenue. The company had already begun to pare back some post-Labor-Day capacity as of last month, according to Wolfe Research.

421,DAL,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) on Thursday said that it should reach flat unit revenue in the first quarter and offered more bullish fourth-quarter guidance, while Barclays said many carriers could offer ""ample upside for patient investors.""Delta's forecast comes after American Airlines (AAL), United Airlines (UAL) and JetBlue (JBLU) gave more upbeat Q4 unit revenue guidance. The important metric eroded after the 2014 oil crash when carriers expanded flights and reduced airfares in some markets. The stronger dollar has also weighed, while terrorist attacks and political upheaval have kept more people away from traveling.Delta on Thursday said it expected flat passenger unit revenue — or revenue from passengers per available seats flown one mile — in Q1 and reiterated that would cap capacity growth next year at 1%.The company also said it now expects Q4 unit revenue to fall roughly 3%, at the high end of the 3%-5% decline forecast earlier this month. Delta now sees operating margin of 10.5%-11%, up from an earlier outlook for 9.5%-10.5%.""Continued traction"" in close-in domestic yields — a measure of an airline's ability to charge more for flights booked closer to takeoff — helped improve revenue trends, Delta said. Domestic unit revenues were expected to be ""roughly flat"" from November through January, the company added.Delta also said that its cabin segmentation — that is, the array of fare and seating classes offered by airlines — increased customer loyalty. The carrier said its domestic rollout of ""basic economy"" seating, its attempts to compete with low-cost carriers, would likely be finished by the middle of 2017.Shares of airlines took off, but they lost some altitude by the closing bell. Delta climbed 1.4% to 50.50 in the stock market today, off intraday highs of 51.74. It's still in buy zone after a breakout last week. American climbed as high as 49.95, selling for a 0.8% advance to 48.30. United settled for a 2.5% gain, JetBlue 1.5%. Alaska Air Group (ALK) surged 4.3% to 90.12, entering profit-taking sell territory after a November breakout. Southwest (LUV) rose 2.7%, climbing just above a buy zone.IBD'S TAKE: The airlines have been on a roll over the past two months, as higher oil prices help the industry tighten up its plans for growth and Warren Buffett, who has long avoided the business, reconsiders it. Meanwhile, Barclays analyst Brandon Oglenski wrote that the industry was ""working to reduce volatility"" and appeared to be keeping capacity growth in check. He added that airlines were undervalued, trading near the bottom of the S&P 500, but would remain profitable through the next recession. Barclays' top picks were United, JetBlue and Alaska Air.Oglenski praised United's leadership changes, saying they could help the company ""focus on closing the gap to best in class profitability,"" but said higher labor costs would pose challenges to the carrier next year.He also said Alaska Air's merger with Virgin America would strengthen its presence in New York and Los Angeles.And while JetBlue trades ""at a steep discount to the rest of the airline group despite a profitable growth outlook,"" he said it's poised for greater gains due to its focus on customer service.RELATED:United: Airlines Within Airlines Are 'Doomed To Fail'Southwest Airlines Hits Buy Point On Traffic Data; Delta Breaks OutUnited, Southwest See Stronger Ticket Demand During Holidays

422,DAL,"Talk about hot! Imagine if quarterback Tom Brady were as good at playing defense as he is at leading the New England Patriots offense. That would be impressive, right? Well, that two-way talent is what fund manager Craig Hodges displayed in 2016.Hodges is a quarterback of the $15.9 million Hodges Pure Contrarian Fund (HDPCX), whose 71% gain through Dec. 29 outperformed all other U.S. diversified stock funds regardless of size. Contrarian is a small-cap value strategy. At the same time, he's also lead signal-caller for the $411.5 million Hodges Fund (HDPMX), whose 40.47% gain made it 2016's third-best performing growth fund.Value. And growth. Two very different strategies. And outperformers both.Hodges Fund, the larger of the two portfolios, has been driven by leaders like Southwest Airlines (LUV), which climbed 16% in 2016 and has a strong IBD Composite Rating of 92; construction and industrial leasor United Rentals (URI), which jumped 46% for the year and also sports a 92 Comp Rating; and construction materials maker Eagle Materials (EXP), up 63% in 2016 and boasting a 90 Comp Rating.IBD's TAKE: Hodges Fund co-manager Eric Marshall recently told IBD why he and Craig Hodges like stocks such as Horizon Pharma, Facebook and Texas Pacific Land Trust.Hodges is also CEO and chief investment officer of Hodges Capital Management and the son of Donald Hodges, founder of Hodges Capital's parent company. Craig Hodges, 53 years old, talked with IBD about his investment approach from his office in Dallas.IBD: What should investors do with their portfolios in 2017?Hodges: We're optimistic about some niches in retail, some selected companies. J.C. Penney (JCP) is one. Some low-hanging fruit. The old (company management) regime almost wrecked the company. The new regime is turning the company around, making it profitable.We don't like retail as a whole, but we like some selected names like Duluth Holdings (DLTH) and G-III Apparel (GIII), which have significant upside.And there are some names in consumer discretionary. Adidas (ADDYY) has taken market share from Under Armour (UAA) and Nike (NKE). There are some names we feel good about.IBD: Which existing holdings got a boost from the Trump election?Hodges: We owned a good position in U.S. Concrete (USCR) as well as Eagle Materials and U.S. Steel (X). Those could benefit if the new administration acts on its interest in investing in infrastructure.We already had quite a bit of exposure to energy, and we added to some like Diamondback Energy (FANG), RSP Permian (RSPP) and Matador Resources (MTDR). Those are our three favorite Permian Basin plays. Hillary Clinton was viewed as anti-fracking, so a lot of those stocks went up. Long term, we think those companies are as well situated as any we know in energy.Volaris Avia (VLRS), a Mexican airline, dropped from about 20 to about 14 or 15. It was on concerns that trade with Mexico would be affected. But we think that fear is political rhetoric. In fact, we think trade with Mexico will be a big part of what (the U.S. does).IBD: Have you bought any stocks that looked poised to benefit from the Trump election?Hodges: Yes, one is Forterra (FRTA). They're in the water infrastructure industry. They provide cast cement piping, precast products for a wide range of water-related infrastructure, even drainage. If you build a road or bridge, drainage is essential. And they have a good management team. They had an IPO right before the election. That was not a good time for an IPO, so we got it at a favorable time.About Nov. 11 (as its share price climbed) we started buying a larger stake. We bought quite a bit in the 17-18 range. It ran up above 20, pulled back, then we added to it. Now it's trading near a 52-week high (around 22).We bought some (Mexico-based) Cemex (CX) ADRs. Thirty percent of their business is in the U.S. They got hit hard by the election results. We think the stock has a good chance to go back to where it was before the election.IBD: Am I right in thinking that Contrarian and Hodges funds are about as different as funds can be?Hodges: Contrarian is just that. It buys the most out-of-favor, unloved name we can come across. About 80% of its stocks would never cross over into Hodges Fund.IBD: Freeport McMoRan (FCX) posted eight straight quarters of EPS slowdown before finally notching a gain. Why do you still like this mining company?Hodges: Our assessment is that they will survive. They're doing things necessary to survive. They're selling off Gulf oil properties, getting their balance sheet squared away, fixing their short-term ills. Our cost is under 6 per share. (It's trading around 13.50). They're not out of the woods, but their asset sales will get them out of the woods.IBD: Facebook (FB) said last month that its advertising-revenue growth rate would slow, which hurt its share price. Do you still like the stock?Hodges: We think it's the ultimate social media company. They're the ones that continue to gain market share. They're diversified. They own Instagram. They're the ones hurting Twitter (TWTR). They're rock solid in my mind.For us, it's a way to participate in what's going on in social media without paying a crazy multiple. It's not inexpensive, but relative to their number of users and how fast it's growing, it's inexpensive.The stock hasn't done much for a quarter and a half. Maybe people who bought it in the 130s are selling and taking losses. But the stock will do well next year.IBD: Southwest Airlines posted a 1% decline in earnings per share growth in the third quarter and it expects a revenue decline in Q4. Do you still like the airline?Hodges: The days of wild fluctuations in earnings for airlines are gone. The competitive landscape is more friendly. They've gone from eight main carriers to three, and Southwest is the fourth.There are barriers to entry. It's expensive to buy the fuel-efficient planes that you need to compete. Meanwhile, Southwest is paying down debt. You've seen a decrease in airlines' earnings estimates, but most are up 30% to 40% (in share prices) for the year. All are buying back their stock. I imagine Delta (DAL) (which Hodges Fund also owns) will continue to raise its dividend. Others might pay more, once they pay back debt. Southwest is buying back a lot.IBD: Match Group (MTCH) aims to help people get an education and get a spouse. It's somewhat new to Hodges Fund. What's your thesis?Hodges: They are like the Facebook of online dating. They own several different dating sites. Their biggest is Match.com, but they also own OKCupid, PlentyOfFish and BlackPeopleMeet. They have 45 dating brands. In the education space, they own PrincetonReview.com.They make money from advertising and membership fees. They don't have a great growth rate, but they own such a good(-size) part of the business that it creates a barrier to entry.IBD: United States Steel's earnings per share grew 61% and 157% the past two quarters after slowing for five quarters in a row. What's the driver?Hodges: The main thing is, people don't understand how hard it is to get into the business, even after there have been so many bankruptcies and so much consolidation. And China has been dumping steel into the U.S. for years. Now there's a president who not only will refine trade agreements but push to get a level playing field for companies like U.S. Steel.There just isn't a lot of (U.S.) competition, but U.S. Steel has tremendous earnings power. Shares trade in the mid-30s. Shares traded near 200 in 2008 on $17 per share in earnings. They're not going near that. But this company could earn $4 to $5 a share in two to three years. On that, the stock could trade back into the 60s or 70s. With a more robust economy, you could see some real multiple expansion.RELATED:2017 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2016 Stock Market ReviewTop-Notch Investor's Bets On Likely Trump-Era Stock LeadersFranklin DynaTech's Matthew Moberg Wins With Stocks Of InnovatorsWarren Buffett Liked Airlines So Much That He Bought Several

423,DAL,"JetBlue (JBLU) outlined plans Tuesday to be a more efficient airline for the years to come, a day after the carrier forecast stronger fourth-quarter unit revenue.Late Monday, JetBlue said it expects unit revenue, or sales per available seats and miles those seats are flown, to fall between 1%-2% in Q4, better than the 3.5% dip in Q3.Last week, American Airlines (AAL) said it expects total unit revenue for Q4 to range from a 1% dip to a 1% gain, an improvement from an earlier forecast for a 0.5%-2.5% drop, and United Airlines (UAL) forecast a 3%-4% Q4 unit revenue decline compared with a prior view for a 4%-6% drop. Delta Air Lines (DAL) in October predicted that metric would fall 3%-5% in Q4, an improvement from Q3's 6.8% drop.JetBlue shares rose 4.2% to 22.53 on the stock market today, hitting the highest level since February. American edged up 0.5%, United dipped 0.9%. Delta sank 0.6%, still just above a buy point. Southwest (LUV), which broke out from a long cup base this month, rose 0.4%, also in buy range.IBD'S TAKE: Investors have become more bullish on airlines after the industry has shown greater potential for cutting back on the capacity expansion and fare discounts that have worried investors through this year and last year. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway recent investments in the industry have also driven some airline stocks higher.In an investor presentation on Tuesday, JetBlue also said it expects flight capacity growth of 6.5%-8.5% next year, largely a pullback from the double-digit growth seen in this year's first half.The carrier is targeting $250 million-$300 million in structural savings by 2020, aided in part by customer self-service at airports and other digital initiatives. Nonfuel unit costs, however, were seen rising 1%-3% in 2017.RELATED:Delta's Costs Spike But Yields Improving; Southwest, Hawaiian Flirt With BuysAmerican Airlines Signals Even Faster Unit Revenue Recovery Than DeltaUnited, Southwest See Stronger Ticket Demand During Holidays
"
424,DAL,"American Airlines (AAL) on Friday said it could see, at long last, that rarest of things for the industry beginning in the fourth quarter: an actual increase in unit revenue.The outlook would make American the first U.S. network carrier to push the key metric into positive territory after two years of expansion, fare cuts and a stronger dollar dragged it lower, and would outpace Delta Air Lines (DAL), which had sought to be the first but recently tamed expectations on when it might pull that off.American's forecast is the latest good news for the airline industry, which in recent weeks has signaled greater operational discipline as fuel costs, which combined with labor make up an airline's biggest expenses, trend higher. A possible uptick in travel after the election, the prospect that President-elect Trump could roll back regulations on businesses, and investments from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) haven't hurt either. American said it expects total unit revenue for Q4 to range from a 1% dip to a 1% gain, an improvement from an earlier forecast for a 0.5%-2.5% drop, and now sees adjusted pretax margin of 6%-8%, up from prior guidance for 5%-7%. The carrier hiked its forecasts due to improving yields — a measure of an airline's ability to charge travelers more for flights.Unit revenue measures sales in relation to an airline's overall flight capacity and is seen as a purer gauge of how efficiently an airline does business.""American will likely lead the industry in unit revenue performance in 2017 given the annualization of the credit card agreement (announced in 3Q16),"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note on Friday.American's shares climbed 3.3% to 49.64 on the stock market today, after rising as much as 5.4% earlier. Delta also pared gains sharply and settled 0.8% higher. United Airlines (UAL) added 3.3% after the carrier late Thursday also gave a more upbeat forecast on fourth-quarter unit revenue and reported strong November results. Southwest (LUV) rose 0.4%.Delta and Southwest shares are in buy range from this week's breakouts after briefly moving out of the 5% chase zone intraday.IBD'S TAKE: Donald Trump, in his election victory speech, said he would work to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. That could be good for airlines, and it could also be good for building stocks like NCI Building Systems. Southwest CEO Gary Kelly, in an interview with Bloomberg on Thursday, also cited an uptick in booking trends, adding: ""I think we are all feeling a little bit more spring in our step.""American Airlines said that traffic for November fell 0.2%, while capacity rose 0.1% and load factor, a measure of an airline's ability to fill seats on planes, fell 0.3 percentage points. Investors have wanted the airlines to keep capacity growth more even with passenger demand and move away from lowering airfare.Still, the International Air Transport Association forecast that the airline industry's profits would fall next year as oil prices rise and that, overall, capacity would still exceed demand in 2017. Recent labor deals are also likely to drive up expenses for airlines.RELATED:United: Airlines Within Airlines Are 'Doomed To Fail'Air France's New Budget Carrier May Squeeze Delta, United, AmericanRyanair Sees Its Low Fares Forcing Rivals Out Of Some Markets

425,DAL,"United Airlines (UAL) and Southwest (LUV) offered upbeat views Thursday on ticket demand for the holiday season, while an industry group said profitability will drop next year from this year's projected record high.United late Thursday gave a better outlook for its fourth-quarter consolidated passenger unit revenue, forecasting a 3%-4% decline compared to a prior view for a 4%-6% drop, mainly due to ""stronger than expected bookings during the second half of the quarter.""Meanwhile, Southwest CEO Gary Kelly told Bloomberg there has been an increase in booking activity since the election.""We had a record load factor for November,"" he said. ""It's not that it was remarkably better, but it was better and we had a really strong month. And bookings for December look a little better. Does that translate into anything different? Not necessarily, except I think we are all feeling a little bit more spring in our step.""Shares of Southwest edged down 0.5% to close at 49.60, still in buy range after breaking out Wednesday. United finished 0.4% higher at 72.74 then rose another 1.65% after hours. Delta Air Lines (DAL) reversed higher to rise 0.5% to 51.35 on the stock market today, also still in buy range after breaking out from a cup-with-handle base on Wednesday. American Airlines (AAL) fell 1.2% to 48.05. Hawaiian Airlines parent Hawaiian Holdings (HA) jumped 4% to 56.45, edging further above buying territory.United also said that November traffic rose 1.7%, roughly in line with 1.6% capacity growth, and November had the fewest cancellations of any month in its history.After a contract with technicians was ratified on Monday, United now expects a 4%-4.5% increase in Q4 unit costs, which it said was ""better than original expectations,"" and sees Q4 pretax margin of 7.5%-8.5%. (Delta projected a 10% jump in Q4 unit costs following a similar deal with its pilots.)IBD'S TAKE: Airline stocks have jumped in recent weeks, in part because Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed new stakes in the major U.S. airlines — after shunning the industry for years.But as the cheap-oil windfall that began in 2014 recedes, the International Air Transport Association said early Thursday the global airline industry's profits will fall and capacity growth will slow next year to 5.6% from 6.2% expected this year, while traffic growth is expected to slow to 5.1% from 5.9%.That means expansion of capacity — or an airline's supply of seats and the distance they carry passengers — will continue to exceed the expansion in passenger traffic. Investors over the past two years have worried about industry overexpansion and have wanted airlines to curb supply to bring it closer to actual demand.The IATA also sees 2017 airline profits falling 16% to $29.8 billion, and the trade group cut its 2016 profit forecast to $35.6 billion from an outlook in June to $39.4 billion, citing higher costs and slowing global GDP growth. Still, 2016 is expected to be a record year for airline profits.Profitability next year was expected to be driven by North American airlines, the IATA said. And the group stressed that the dip in profitability next year would represent a ""soft landing"" for the industry.""These three years are the best performance in the industry's history — irrespective of the many uncertainties we face,"" IATA CEO Alexandre de Juniac said in a release. ""Indeed, risks are abundant — political, economic and security among them. And controlling costs is still a constant battle in our hypercompetitive industry.""RELATED:Delta's Costs Spike But Yields Improving; Southwest, Hawaiian Flirt With BuysUnited: Airlines Within Airlines Are 'Doomed To Fail'Delta, American, United Price Targets Hiked; FireEye Downgraded

426,DAL,"Southwest Airlines (LUV) on Wednesday reported November traffic that outpaced capacity growth, but the carrier stuck with its Q4 unit revenue outlook that disappointed investors when it reported third-quarter results.Passenger traffic jumped 7.2% in November, while carrying capacity rose 4.9%. Load factor, a measure of seats filled, rose to 85.1%, a 1.8 percentage point increase from a year ago.Southwest said it continues to expect fourth-quarter operating unit revenue to fall 4% to 5%, based on November's results and current conditions. Unit revenue measures sales in relation to an airline's available seats and flight coverage, and is seen as a gauge of an airline's operating efficiency.Shares rose 4.55% to 49.85 in the stock market today above a 48.10 buy point of a long cup base. Delta Air Lines (DAL) climbed 2.2% to 50.53, moving above a 49.51 buy point from cup-with-handle base. But Southwest and Delta stocks rose in flat or below-average volume. Investors should look for stocks breaking out in strong trade, indicating mutual funds and other big institutional investors are adding to positionsHawaiian Holdings (HA), parent of Hawaii Airlines, rose 2% to 54.20, now slightly extended from a 51.63 buy point.Southwest's fourth-quarter unit revenue guidance makes it an outlier among the four big U.S. airlines. Delta Air, American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) in October all forecast stronger unit revenue for Q4; Southwest didn't. (Hawaiian Holdings raised its unit revenue target on Monday.)IBD'S TAKE: After airline stocks crumbled for much of the year on fears they were being overaggressively competitive, they've seen an end-of-the-year rebound. Delta, Southwest and Hawaiian Airlines are all in buy points. IBD discussed how several airline stocks were near buy points. Unit revenue has fallen for the past two years as airlines expanded and cut fares amid a cheap-fuel windfall. Wall Street has wanted the airlines to curb that growth and find ways to raise fares in order to improve unit revenue.As for November, Delta held to its Q4 unit revenue outlook and reported decent underlying fundamentals despite an anticipated spike in costs following a new contract with its pilots. Analysts have also worried that the timing of certain holidays during the quarter might adversely affect airlines' financials, a trend cited by Southwest in its Q4 unit revenue forecast.American Air shares climbed 4.8%, while United advanced 2.1%.RELATED: Ryanair Sees Its Low Fares Forcing Rivals Out Of Some MarketsUnited: Airlines Within Airlines Are 'Doomed To Fail'

The Dow Jones industrial average also hit an all-time high, adding 1.4%. The small-cap Russell 2000 made a record high of its own, adding 0.6%.Dow component Home Depot (HD) rose 2.5% and is drawing near the 132.23 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. IBM (IBM), another of the Dow 30 stocks, rose 2% and is back above the 161.96 entry of a cup with handle.IBM, the tech services and Big Data computing giant, could also be viewed as forming an additional handle over the prior six sessions, furnishing a slightly higher yet relevant entry of 164.76.The Nasdaq climbed 0.9%, as a rout in pharmaceuticals and some health care stocks failed to spread to other sectors. The composite still has some recovery to do before topping prior highs.Volume was tracking higher across the board. That was a good sign on a day when indexes hit new highs, as was the day's breadth: Winning stocks led losers by more than 3-to-1 on the NYSE and by 9-to-5 on the Nasdaq.Technology and financial stocks were the best performing in the IBD 50. But the index was indicated 0.3% higher, a lagging performance that was curious, to say the least, in the context of today's strong market.An eclectic mix of metal, consumer, technology and transportation stocks led the broad market today. Airlines were active on the upside.Southwest Airlines (LUV) rose 3.5%, making its best move above a 48.10 buy point so far. But volume was running well below Southwest's usual levels, which made the breakout suspect. The airline reported November traffic that outpaced capacity growth. Southwest also kept its Q4 unit revenue outlook, which had disappointed investors. Delta Air Lines (DAL) jumped 2.7% to 50.85 and surged past a 49.51 buy point of a large cup-with-handle pattern. Shares are still in proper buying range. Yet volume also was tracking roughly 19% below normal levels with an hour left in Wednesday's session.Hawaiian Airlines parent Hawaiian Holdings (HA) rose more than 2.3% and is barely out of proper buy range from a 51.63 buy point it cleared a couple of weeks ago.In the IBD 50, Middleby (MIDD) made a new high and is adding a bit of cushion above the 139.34 buy point of a cup-with-handle pattern.

428,DAL,"Hawaiian Holdings (HA) subsidiary Hawaiian Airlines hiked its fourth-quarter revenue guidance on Monday, while shares of Ryanair (RYAAY) rose after the Irish budget carrier reported November traffic results.Hawaiian Holdings said it now expects operating unit revenue, or revenue as it relates to an airline's available seats and flight coverage, to rise 3%-6% in Q4, well up from an earlier forecast for a 0.5%-3.5% increase.The company still expects capacity growth of 3%-5%.For the month of November, the carrier saw traffic increase 9%, outpacing capacity growth of 2.9%.Shares rose 1.3% to 51.85 on the stock market today, re-entering buy range after breaking out last month from a cup base with a 51.63 buy point. But Hawaiian Holdings closed well off early highs, at 51.85.Ryanair, meanwhile, said traffic for November grew 15%, with load factor, or a measure of seats filled, up 2 percentage points to 95%.Shares rose nearly 2% and came closer to the 84.14 buy point of a cup-with-handle base.IBD'S TAKE: Brexit and long-haul, low-cost carriers have made trans-Atlantic competition more difficult for U.S. airlines. Delta and United are weighing a variety of options in response, but new airlines don't appear to be among them. Delta Air Lines (DAL) dipped 1% to 47.82, continuing to work on a handle of a cup base with a 49.51 buy point. Southwest (LUV) briefly crossed a 48.10 buy point intraday, but reversed to close down 1.75% to 47.07.Airlines for the most part have reported or forecast improving unit-revenue trends in recent months, after the key metric spent has been hurt by aggressive expansion and lower airfares in some markets.Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) also recently disclosed new stakes in Delta, American Airlines (AAL), United Airlines (UAL) and, as CNBC reported, Southwest, even though Buffett historically has largely shunned the industry.United Airlines, which said its mechanics have approved a new labor deal, fell 1.5%. American eased 0.8%.RELATED:Delta's Costs Spike But Yields Improving; Southwest, Hawaiian Flirt With BuysSouthwest Is Only Airline That Sees Worse Unit Revenue; Stock Dives

429,DAL,"Southwest (LUV) on Friday said second-quarter operating unit revenue increased less than 1%, but it added that passenger traffic growth of 6% during the quarter outpaced flight-capacity growth of 4.8%.The Dallas-based carrier had said last month it expected a ""modest increase"" in second-quarter operating unit revenue, an important industry metric used to assess an airline's efficiency that measures revenue per passenger as it relates to available seats. The results come ahead of earnings season for the industry, and amid questions over how efficiently -- and profitably -- airlines can run their businesses without the aid of low fuel costs.Cheap oil last year helped prop up earnings and inspired a wave of industry expansion, competition and cuts in some ticket prices. But corporate and leisure travel demand have not always risen in tandem. Investors have wanted airlines to raise fares and keep capacity in line with passenger demand to improve unit revenue amid signs that oil might not be so cheap in the future.Delta Air Lines (DAL) this week said it expected fuel costs in the second quarter to be around $1.95 to $2.00 per gallon on average, well above the $1.48-$1.53 range it forecast in April. The company said it expected second-quarter operating margin, unit revenue and capacity that would be worse than prior guidance. Delta will hold a conference call to discuss results on Thursday.Southwest shares gained 1.7% in the stock market today, clawing their way back up toward their 50-day line. Delta climbed 2.75%, while American Airlines (AAL) was up 2.2%, and United Airlines (UAL) surged 3.5%.Airline stocks have spent much of the past two months below their key 50-day lines, which have crossed below their 200-day lines, a bearish sign.Southwest's traffic during June rose 6.8%, while capacity increased 5.4%, and load factor -- a metric that gauges seats filled -- crept up to 87.4%.Southwest's results came a day after Hawaiian Holdings (HA) subsidiary Hawaiian Airlines said it expected a 7.1% increase in traffic during the second quarter, compared to a 2.5% rise in capacity. Alaska Air Group (ALK) and Irish budget carrier Ryanair (RYAAY) also reported monthly traffic results this week.Credit Suisse this week downgraded American and United and said declines in unit revenue for the big three airlines might not find a bottom until late next year. The firm expects more expensive fuel, labor deals, the stronger dollar and the uncertainty following the U.K.'s vote to leave the European Union to dent their results.""Until unit revenues show firm evidence of improvement, which requires capacity discipline or a macro reacceleration, the disillusion with owning airlines will persist, with rallies limited to those led by risk-on appetites instead of improving fundamentals,"" the firm said.Southwest, however, remained its top pick.

430,DAL,"Despite Brexit-inspired global growth woes that pushed bond yields to record lows, stocks rose, helped by a strong jobs report. Breakouts were more common. Tesla Motors (TSLA) held up amid negative headlines. Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) bet big on oil, but crude prices promptly suffered heavy losses. Delta Air Lines (DAL) and other carriers face stiff headwinds.The major averages were up and down for most of the week, but moved higher after Friday's strong jobs report. The S&P 500 rose 1.3% for the week, settling Friday just 1 point below a record close and 5 points from an all-time best. The Nasdaq advanced 1.9%. General Electric (GE), Facebook (FB), Costco Wholesale (COST) and Pepsi (PEP) were among the notable breakouts. Apple (AAPL) retook its 50-day moving average. Health food stocks soared after Danone agreed to buy WhiteWave Foods (WWAV).The 10-year Treasury yield plunged to a record low but closed above those levels Friday.The U.S. economy added 287,000 jobs in June, far more the 180,000 economists expected. It was a sharp bounceback from May, which saw its meager gain of 38,000 revised down to just 11,000. The jobless rate rose to 4.9%, reflecting a jump in the labor force.Over the past three months, job gains have averaged 144,000. That, along with the upward trend in wage gains, might have been enough for the Federal Reserve to start hiking rates again soon, but Brexit will likely keep policymakers on the cautious side.Minutes from the Fed's June 14-15 meeting, when policymakers kept rates steady, revealed concern over the June 23 Brexit vote and the sharp slowdown in U.S. job gains in May. But there remained divisions over the labor market's general health, inflation trends and the outlook for economic growth.Tesla Motors said car deliveries fell well below its forecast for the second quarter. The 14,370 vehicles delivered fell short of its guidance of 17,000, due to ""the extreme production ramp in Q2 and the high mix of customer-ordered vehicles still on trucks and ships at the end of the quarter."" But production fell short of Tesla's estimates as well.It was the second quarter in a row that Tesla has missed its own delivery targets, and it comes as Tesla has made a much-criticized bid to acquire SolarCity (SCTY). A key objection to a SolarCity deal is that it could distract Tesla from ramping up vehicle production.Meanwhile, Tesla confirmed that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has opened a preliminary evaluation into the performance of the Autopilot feature in the Model S, following a recent fatal crash. The NHTSA confirmed it will also investigate the recent nonfatal crash of a Tesla Model X ""to determine whether automated functions were in use at the time of the crash.""Tesla shares rose 0.1% fractionally for the week, just between its 50-day and 200-day lines, which crossed in bearish fashion during the week.Chevron, Exxon Mobil and their partners said they would invest $36.8 billion to expand the Tengiz oilfield in Kazakhstan. Main operator Chevron and its partners have already spent $37 billion on the project. The report comes after BP (BP) said it would spend $8 billion to build another liquefied natural gas plant in Indonesia. Energy giants had cut spending as crude prices fell but the new investments could be a sign that companies are confident about the price rebound after a rally in 2015 failed.But did oil majors bet at just the wrong time? Crude prices have tumbled this week amid global growth concerns, a stronger dollar and higher-than-expected U.S. inventories. U.S. crude fell 7.1% to $45.41 a barrel, its biggest weekly drop since February. Brent futures sank 7.1% to $46.76 a barrel, its sharpest loss since January.Samsung Electronics posted its biggest Q2 sales gain in more than two years, helped by strong demand for its Galaxy S7 handsets. Samsung is benefiting from weaker-than-expected demand for Apple's iPhone 6S handsets. Apple's next smartphone, the iPhone 7, likely will be released in September, but it isn't expected to be much different than the 6S. Apple moved sideways during the week, but the stock closed above its falling 50-day line on Thursday.Meanwhile, BlackBerry (BBRY) said it's ending production of its iconic BlackBerry Classic mobile phones.Shares of Hain Celestial (HAIN) and Amplify Snack Brands (BETR) were among the health-focused food companies that got a lift after French dairy products maker Danone (DANOY) agreed Thursday to buy WhiteWave Foods (WWAV) -- the owner of Silk soy milk and brands that include Horizon Organic -- in a $10 billion deal. The proposed merger highlights the trend among consumers toward healthier fare. On Thursday, WhiteWave rose 19%, Hain Celestial climbed 7% and Amplify rose 2%. For the week they rose 20%, 6% and 9%, respectively.Delta Air Lines forecast Q2 operating margin and a unit revenue decline that were worse than it had anticipated in April. The carrier also said fuel costs were far higher than expected. Unit revenue declines for Delta, American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) might not level off until the end of 2017, Credit Suisse said, while earnings could also come in below consensus for that year. Among the reasons cited for the darker forecast are higher fuel costs, labor deals, Brexit and an unfavorable foreign exchange environment.Southwest Airlines (LUV) traffic rose 6.8% in June, more than the 5.4% capacity increase.Meanwhile, Alaska Air Group (ALK) said June traffic rose 10.9%, outpaced by an 11.7% capacity increase. Irish budget carrier Ryanair (RYAAY) said June traffic rose 11%, while load factor edged up to 94%.Delta, American, United, Southwest and Alaska Air rose modestly for the week, while Ryanair fell somewhat, but well off its lows.Comcast (CMCSA) soon will offer direct access to Netflix (NFLX) for subscribers with its broadband-based X1 set-top box. The nation's No. 1 pay-TV operator previously refused to allow third-party, over-the-top internet video services on its set-top boxes, for competitive reasons. The arrangement is seen as a win-win for both firms. The deal bolsters Comcast's broadband service and reduces the risk of cord-cutting, while providing an easy on-ramp to Netflix service for new and existing customers.Costco said June sales increased 3% to $11.33 billion, while sales for the 44 weeks ended July 3 rose 2% to $96.33 billion. Shares climbed 5% Thursday in heavy volume, breaking past a 158.89 buy point from a double-bottom base with a handle.Pepsi also broke out Thursday, rising 1.5% to clear a 107.04 flat-base buy point in heavy trade. The packaged-food and beverage giant said quarterly earnings increased 2% to $1.35 a share, beating estimates by 5 cents. Sales fell 3.3% to $15.4 billion, but were above forecasts.Costco rose 1.1% to 165.44 on Friday while Pepsi climbed 0.7% to 108.27.The drugstore chain topped Q3 profit views by 4 cents with 16% growth to $1.18 per share, but revenue gains of 2% to $29.5 billion missed analyst estimates for $29.7 billion. U.S. retail pharmacy sales rose 3.7%. International retail pharmacy sales fell 2.3% but rose 3.4% ex currency. Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) raised the lower end of full-year guidance by a dime to $4.45-$4.55, vs. views for $4.49. But shares lost 1.5% for the week, below their 200-day line but rebounding from their 50-day line.

431,DAL,"Military planes, including Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35, may steal the spotlight at next week's Farnborough Airshow, as demand for commercial jets from Boeing (BA) and Airbus (EADSY) cools.The Air Force's F-35A and the Marine Corps' F-35B version will fly Friday at the Royal International Air Tattoo, which is an earlier lead-in event to the Farnborough show. The F-35B will also be showcased at Farnborough, which runs July 11-17.While Farnborough is typically an event where big commercial orders are announced, it is still a major opportunity for defense contractors to show off their wares and lay the groundwork for future military orders. And for the F-35 in particular, flying demonstrations could help shield governments from criticism over plans to buy the over-budget and behind-schedule plane.""The F-35 will provide cover to military leaders and politicians that have taken heat at home,"" Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia said. ""They can say 'See it's ready for prime-time. We were right to order it.' ""IBD'S TAKE: Defense stocks like Lockheed have been strong despite overall economic uncertainty, with some of the top Pentagon contractors entering buy range recently. Meanwhile, companies that largely serve the commercial market haven't fared as well.The U.K. appearance will be the first time U.S. pilots will fly the F-35 in an international air show and mark its debut at a major event. Dutch pilots flew the jet at a local military air show last month. The F-35 was supposed to make its international debut two years ago in the U.K., but the fleet was temporarily grounded after an engine fire.The Pentagon has noted recent improvements in the F-35 program, and a top Air Force official said Thursday that software fixes for its logistics and maintenance system is progressing. Lockheed's F-35 program manager also said the company and the Defense Department are close to reaching a deal on a production contract for the next batch of planes.Lockheed shares closed down 0.1% on the stock market today but remain in buy territory.Boeing's P-8 also will be a headliner at Farnborough, as the U.K. is considering buying nine more, and other European countries are looking at the anti-submarine aircraft, Aboulafia said. In January, the Royal Australian Air Force ordered four of the planes to replace its aging Lockheed AP-3C Orions.Other military planes on display at the show include Boeing's F/A-18 Super Hornet and the Eurofighter Typhoon.Meanwhile, no blockbuster commercial deals are expected at Farnborough, as worries of a slowing global economy and air traffic growth rates are putting a damper on orders.""The macro market environment on the commercial side still has problems where the industry is doing better than the world economy would suggest,"" Aboulafia said.On Wednesday, Airbus said net orders for the first half of the year totaled 183, well off its pace to reach 650 by year's end. Boeing has booked 276 net orders through June 28.The economy isn't the only headwind the aerospace heavyweights are facing. The C Series from Canada's Bombardier is becoming a formidable rival, and orders for the new jets could be a source of surprises at the show.The C Series has faced developmental delays and slow sales since its inception nearly 10 years ago. But earlier this year, Bombardier scored an order for 75 narrow-body CS100 jets from Delta Air Lines (DAL), with an option for 50 more, the largest-ever order for Bombardier's commercial aircraft business.Bombardier ""pretty much has been humiliated at every air show in the past decade, but they are under new management and doing better, so it might be time to show off for new prospects,"" Aboulafia said.A Moody's report out in May also said Bombardier ""likely has the most technically proficient model in this class of aircraft,"" focused on the 100-150 seat market.Boeing's big announcement likely will be the finalization of an order from Iran, according to Robert Mann, president of aviation consultancy R.W. Mann & Co.Last month, Boeing and Iran reached a tentative deal for more than 100 commercial planes, marking the first such deal between the U.S. aerospace giant and the Islamic republic since its 1979 revolution.But Mann said issues over restrictions from the State Department and Treasury had to be resolved before official details are announced.Less likely, according to Mann, would be a big announcement of a new mid-range jet or a stretched version of its 737 Max from Boeing. But Aboulafia said it was still a possibility.The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Mike Delaney, Boeing's vice president of airplane development, said a new plane ""is coming faster than you think"" but added that the idea would still need the board's approval.Boeing said in February it was surveying customers about the need for a midsize plane to replace the 757, which was last produced in 2004.Drones will be a big part of the airshow for the first time. Lauren Kisser, Director of Amazon Prime Air, will present at the U.K. Drone Show portion of Farnborough, giving an overview of the drone delivery system Amazon (AMZN) is developing. A drone racing event is also scheduled.

432,DAL,"Earnings season was in full swing this week, with Netflix (NFLX), Intel (INTC), Microsoft (MSFT), General Motors (GM) among those reporting. Elon Musk unveiled his new Tesla Motors (TSLA) ""master plan."" Meanwhile Japan's SoftBank (SFTBY) announced it will buy U.K. chip designer ARM Holdings (ARMH), while the Justice Department blocked two big health insurance merger deals.The S&P 500 and Dow hit fresh highs while the Nasdaq set new 2016 bests as all three rose modestly for a fourth straight weekly gain. Facebook (FB), Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and New Oriental Education & Technology (EDU) were among a slew of stocks hitting buy points, though Facebook's low-volume breakout struggled. Several other highly rated big names are close to entry points. Oil prices retreated to below $45 a barrel.Internet television network Netflix attracted just 1.68 million new customers in the second quarter vs. its target for 2.5 million. For Q3, Netflix expects to add 2.3 million new subscribers, vs. analyst estimates for 3.7 million. Netflix blamed the slowing subscriber growth on increased churn related to price increases for longtime subscribers. It also said the Summer Olympics will put the brakes on new subscriber gains in August. Netflix topped profit views, but shares sank nearly 13% for the week.Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk unveiled his ambitious, long-term plans for the electric car company in combination with SolarCity (SCTY), which Tesla aims to acquire in a $2.8 billion offer. Plans include a new kind of pickup and minibus, as well as a compact SUV and a commercial truck. All of this as Tesla struggles to meet its production goals. The expansive report gave no indication about when Tesla will be consistently profitable. Tesla stock fell more than 3% on Thursday after the ""masterplan"" was released, but rose close to 1% for the week, holding above the 200-day line.Tesla will hold a ""grand opening"" event July 29 for its Gigafactory, though the Reno, Nev., battery plant is far from finished.IBD'S TAKE: Tesla stock is still trying to recover and the company has report several quarters of losses. But Mobileye, a maker of driver-assistance technology used by Tesla and many other automakers, has strong fundamentals. MBLY cleared a new handle entry point at 49.10 on Friday. For detailed ratings on Mobileye, go to IBD Stock Checkup.The software giant earned 69 cents a share ex items in its fiscal fourth quarter, up 11% vs. a year earlier as revenue climbed 2% to $22.64 billion. Analysts had expected EPS to fall to 58 cents on sales of $22.15 billion. Microsoft credited strong sales of cloud computing software and services for the Q4 beat. For the just-started fiscal year, it vowed to improve the profitability of its cloud businesses including Office 365 and Azure. Microsoft shares rose 5.3% to 56.57 this week, close to a buy point of 56.87.Japan's SoftBank will pay $32 billion to acquire ARM Holdings, which designs chips for the Apple (AAPL) iPhone, as well as for most other smartphones and the booming Internet of Things market. The deal occurred after the Brexit vote caused the British pound to tumble vs. the yen. SoftBank plans to expand ARM's overseas headcount over the next five years. But some analysts wonder: Can SoftBank maintain ARM's vendor-neutral approach?ARM shares have soared 40% so far this week. SoftBank fell nearly 11%. Sprint (S), majority-owned by SoftBank, slid 7.6%.Chipotle Mexican Grill's (CMG) Q2 EPS sank 80% to 87 cents, while revenue fell 17% to $998.4 million. Both missed views. Still, Chipotle shares rose 9.3% this week, retaking the 50-day line. Domino's Pizza (DPZ) beat views, with EPS up 21% to 98 cents on 12% revenue growth to $547.3 million. Domino's stock broke out to a new high, leaping 9.6%. Papa John's (PZZA) popped 6% as KeyBanc said pizza deliveries are faring well amid civil unrest.Starbucks (SBUX) disappointed with a Q3 revenue miss and in-line EPS, as adjusted profit grew 17% to 49 cents on 7% sales growth to $5.24 billion. But weaker-than-expected Americas comps were an ""anomaly,"" said CEO Howard Schultz. Starbucks rallied Friday to hit three-month highs. Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) turned in mixed results. Shares fell Thursday but rose 2.3% for the week.EBay (EBAY) gapped out of a base, spiking 16% for the week to a record high after reporting Q2 EPS growth of 2% to 43 cents, beating views by a penny. Revenue rose 6% to $2.2 billion, also topping. Top- and bottom-line guidance for Q3 was light, but eBay's full-year projections were strong. Yahoo (YHOO) Q2 EPS missed by a penny but revenue and Q3 revenue guidance easily beat forecasts. Reports say Verizon (VZ) may announce a Yahoo buyout deal within a few days.Intel (INTC), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) reported mixed earnings. Intel's $13.5 billion and 59 cents earnings per share ex items for Q2 edged and topped the consensus, respectively. But Intel shares fell from an 18-month high on weaker-than-expected data center sales, though they closed the week down just 1.2%. Qualcomm reported $6 billion in sales and $1.16 EPS ex items for fiscal Q3, beating Wall Street expectations for a respective $5.58 billion and 97 cents. Qualcomm shares rose nearly 12% to a nine-month high. For fiscal Q3, Skyworks reported $751.7 million in sales and $1.24 EPS minus items, both down 7% vs. the year-earlier quarter but narrowly beating consensus expectations. Skyworks slid 8.6% on Friday and 3.8% for the week.After a long review, the Justice Department filed to block the Aetna (AET)-Humana (HUM) and Anthem (ANTM)-Cigna (CI) mergers, saying they would hurt competition and consumers. Shares rose on the news though, as investors had priced in skepticism that the deals would win approval. Meanwhile, Humana raised its EPS guidance and said it will exit many ObamaCare exchange markets next year. UnitedHealth (UNH), the largest managed care firm, topped EPS views and said 2017 profit will improve from exiting nearly all exchanges.United Airlines (UAL) beat Q2 estimates and cut full-year carrying capacity growth, as international uncertainties weighed. The carrier also said it would reduce winter flights to the U.K. Delta Air Lines (DAL) said in the prior week that it would do the same following the nation's Brexit vote. Southwest (LUV) forecast a Q3 unit revenue decline, which would be its first this year. The carrier also missed Q2 estimates, and, like Spirit Airlines (SAVE), indicated that heavy lower-fare competition persists -- good for customers, but bad for airlines' financial results. American Airlines (AAL) reported a Q2 profit drop that wasn't as bad as expected. American also said the Brexit may help, not hurt, global carriers.The Q2 season kicked off with three solid reports from big-cap drugmakers. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) beat estimates and raised guidance, driven by the strength of its pharma division. Novartis (NVS) also beat Q2 estimates, but its stock fell as it warned of rising expenses related to new drug launches, and also said the FDA had rejected its biosimilar version of Amgen (AMGN) drug Neulasta. Biogen (BIIB) rose after its beat and raised, but its CEO George Scangos said he was quitting after six years.J&J stock rose modestly to a fresh high. Novartis advanced slightly, and Biogen jumped nearly 11% as biotech stocks tried to recover.General Motors (GM) reported strong Q2 profit growth, topping estimates. GM revenue surged 11.5%, the fastest pace since 2010, although some industry officials say U.S. auto sales could level off this year. GM stock rose 4.5% for the week.. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU), which reports July 27, is under investigation by the Justice Department for unspecified fraud, according to people familiar with the matter. Ford (F) reports next week. Volkswagen (VLKAY) is mulling building an electric vehicles plant either at its Chattanooga, Tenn., site or in Mexico.General Electric (GE) reported a 65% EPS gain for Q2, much better than expected, but industrial orders fell 16%, and core organic revenue fell too. Honeywell (HON), another diversified industrial giant, topped EPS views but missed on sales. Honeywell cut its full-year organic revenue forecast to a small drop. GE and Honeywell shares fell Friday after hitting long-term highs earlier in the week.Lockheed Martin (LMT) raised its full-year outlook after reporting Q2 results above analyst estimates, but management warned it can't sustain its current level of F-35 spending unless the defense giant gets another production contract from the Pentagon soon. The attempted coup in Turkey isn't expected to weigh on the fighter's sales or production. Textron (TXT), maker of Cessna planes and Bell helicopters, reported a 10% jump in EPS, beating analyst expectations and revenue that climbed 8.1%, also above Wall Street views. It sees full-year EPS of $2.60 to $2.80. The midpoint is under analyst estimates for $2.72.Lockheed stock hit a record high during the week, closing the week up 0.1%. Textron rose 2.8%.
"
433,DAL,"Earnings for Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) are likely to badly miss analysts' consensus estimates in 2017, and unit revenue is unlikely to stop declining until the fourth quarter of that year, Credit Suisse said in a research note Wednesday.The investment firm cited a range of factors for the downbeat forecast, including higher fuel costs, deals struck with airline workers, the stronger dollar, weaker corporate demand and the U.K.'s vote last month to leave the European Union.Credit Suisse sees United's earnings per share next year coming in at $5.08, 38% below Wall Street estimates. For American, it sees 2017 EPS of $4.00, 28% below views. Delta's EPS next year is likely to be $5.55, 16% below analyst forecasts.The firm downgraded American to underperform from outperform, while it cut United to neutral from outperform. But Credit Suisse kept its outperform rating for Delta, saying it was better equipped to hold up after the cheap oil -- which many say was a crutch for airlines' profits last year -- gets more expensive.""With an investment-grade balance sheet, the most sustainable cash flow and shareholder return profile and the best execution track record, we prefer DAL over UAL and AAL,"" Credit Suisse analyst Julie Yates said in the note.Shares of Delta closed down 0.1% in the stock market today, but had lost as much as 4.3% earlier. American and United also pared steeper loss and finished 2% and 2.4% lower, respectively.Shares of all three have tumbled below their 50-day and 200-day lines since this spring, as investors perceive a lack of disciplined expansion. Competitive fare cuts have helped customers, but insufficient demand has hurt unit revenue, which measures money made per passenger as it relates to capacity. Airlines' attempts to stay ahead of fuel-price fluctuations through their fuel-hedging strategies haven't always been successful either, adding to investors' irritation.On Tuesday, Delta said that fuel costs have spiked and that margins and unit revenue would be weaker than anticipated for Q2. Those results could prompt the carrier to move away from its goal to get unit revenue into positive territory by the end of the year, Wolfe Research analyst Hunter Keay said in a note Tuesday.As for carrier-specific problems, Credit Suisse said Wednesday that American's exposure to challenged international markets could become more of a difficulty for the rest of this year. After slashing ticket prices to compete with budget carriers like Spirit Airlines (SAVE), ""AAL does not have as much control over its domestic pricing to undo the aggressive actions taken in 2015 vs. ULCCs as we thought,"" Yates said, referring to ultra low-cost carriers.American has said it will launch a new ""basic economy"" fare class as part of its plans to compete with low-cost carriers and turn unit revenue around, but the benefits from that and other initiatives could still be a long time away, Credit Suisse said.Meanwhile, United's management is ""heading in the right direction,"" Credit Suisse said. While United announced plans last month to drive profits -- including installing slimline seats and reducing flight-delay and cancellation costs -- it could take a while for the company's plans for improvement would materialize as ""labor pressures stand to increase in 2017,"" Credit Suisse said.

434,DAL,"Luxury electric car maker Tesla Motors (TSLA) saw its stock get a price target cut on production woes and a mix shift to lower-priced Model S vehicles on Wednesday. Meanwhile, internet television network Netflix (NFLX) was hit with another downgrade.And investment bank Credit Suisse downgraded U.S. airline stocks American Airlines Group (AAL) and United Continental Holdings (UAL).Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brad Erickson reiterated his sector weight rating on Tesla stock, but cut his price target to 190 from 212.""Checks indicate initial demand for Tesla's new, less-expensive car is strong, which would be dilutive to gross margin,"" Erickson said. ""We are lowering estimates to reflect this, previously reported Q2 deliveries and slightly lower unit volumes due to persistent production challenges.""Erickson said he has continuing concerns that Tesla's production ramp may be too ambitious. Tesla on Sunday reported weaker-than-expected Q2 vehicle delivery and production.Tesla stock finished trading up 0.2% to 214.44 on the stock market today.Netflix on Wednesday received its second stock downgrade in as many days. Jefferies lowered its rating on Netflix to underperform from hold.Needham analyst Laura Martin on Tuesday downgraded Netflix stock to hold from buy on concerns that the Brexit adds to risks of decelerating growth for Netflix in the U.K. and European Union over the next 12 to 24 months. She also predicted higher subscriber churn in the region.Netflix stock lost 3.4% to 94.60 at the close.Credit Suisse analyst Julie Yates downgraded shares of American Airlines to underperform and United Continental to neutral. She previously rated both stocks as outperform.She cited international macroeconomic risk and a tougher business climate in the second half of the year for her downgrades.Yates cut her price target on American to 28 from 47. She trimmed her price target on United to 42 from 64. She reiterated her outperform rating on Delta Air Lines (DAL), but raised her price target to 51 from 48.American Airlines dropped 2% to 28.35 while United Airlines fell 2.4% to 39.31. Delta edged down 4 cents to 35.58.

436,DAL,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) on Friday cut its fourth-quarter operating margin forecast and hiked its expected unit costs due to a newly ratified contract with its pilots, but the carrier reported encouraging November results.Meanwhile, Alaska Air Group (ALK) reported traffic that outpaced carrying capacity growth.The news pushed Delta shares up 1.1% to 48.31 on the stock market today, closer to a 50.60 buy point. Southwest (LUV) climbed 1.8% to 47.91, just below a 48.10 buy point after topping that level intraday. American Airlines (AAL) added 0.8%, and United Airlines (UAL) rose 1.2%. Hawaiian Airlines parent Hawaiian Holdings (HA) rose 1.6% to 51.20, but is back below a 51.63 entry point after rising as high as 51.95 earlier.Delta now expects its nonfuel unit costs, including profit sharing, to spike around 10%, well up from the 1%-2% increase forecast when the company reported third-quarter results in October. The carrier expects operating margin of 9.5%-10.5%, down from a forecast of 14%-16% given in October.The earlier outlook, Delta noted then, did not factor in costs from any deal struck with pilots. On Friday, Delta said its new pilot contract included a retroactive adjustment that would be accrued in Q4 for a total cost of $475 million. Excluding the labor deal, operating margin would be at the higher end of the forecast the carrier gave in October, Delta said.Still, the carrier held to its forecast for a 3%-5% drop in passenger unit revenue, a measure of how much money airlines make on passengers compared to available seats and distance traveled. The company said it still expects Q4 capacity to be up around 1%.In November, unit revenue, or sales as they relate to an airline's overall carrying capacity, fell 1%. Capacity dipped 0.7%. Load factor, a measure of seats filled, rose 0.9 percentage points to 85%.The carrier said it ""continued to see stabilization"" of close-in domestic yields, or its ability to make more money on tickets booked closer to a flight's departure time. Positive unit revenue in Latin America also helped, Delta said.Alaska Air Group shares rose 2.4% to 84.83 climbing further above buy range, after the carrier said passenger traffic rose 7% in November, while capacity rose 2.8%.IBD'S TAKE: As low-cost carriers outside the U.S. offer cheaper trans-Atlantic flights, the big U.S. network carriers have tried to find ways to compete. Airlines like Delta, American and United have leaned more toward cheaper fare classes, as opposed to dedicated low-cost airlines of their own.After punishing airlines through much of the year on concerns of overexpansion, Wall Street has taken a more sympathetic approach to the industry. With oil prices rising, investors have been more hopeful that airlines will pare back growth and, in turn, shore up unit revenue. Warren Buffett's recent investments in the big carriers has also helped.RELATED:Ryanair Sees Its Low Fares Forcing Rivals Out Of Some MarketsAir France's New Budget Carrier May Squeeze Delta, United, AmericanDelta, American, United Price Targets Hiked; FireEye DowngradedDelta Eyes Trans-Atlantic Battle Vs.

437,DAL,"Delta Air Lines (DAL), Southwest (LUV) and Irish budget carrier Ryanair (RYAAY) are all setting up for potential breakouts as they prepare to report key monthly traffic data in the coming days.Those reports, for the month of November, could also include important unit-revenue and capacity guidance for the fourth quarter overall, potentially lifting or sinking those carriers' stock prices.Delta shares sank 0.8% to 48.18 in the stock market today, in an eight-month-long cup base with a 50.60 buy point. Delta appears to be building a handle that could offer a slightly lower entry, but that hasn't fully formed yet.Southwest dipped 1.3% to 46.61, close to a 48.10 buy point of a cup base begun in April.Ryanair dropped 3% to 79.84, forming the handle of a lopsided cup base, first formed in June, with an 89.77 buy point. And Hawaiian Airlines parent Hawaiian Holdings (HA) was down 2.2% to 51.35, dropping out of buy range of a cup base with a 51.63 buy point.Airline stocks have surged this month, partly on airlines' attempts to pare back growth in capacity — or an airline's supply of seats and flight coverage — and improve unit revenue, a key metric that tallies revenue in relation to that capacity.Investors had been concerned that the 2014 oil crash, which lowered fuel prices, caused too many fare cuts and overexpansion.IBD'S TAKE: Analysts believe that higher oil prices could also prompt airlines to pass those costs onto consumers, adding another annoyance to air travelers but helping to encourage operational discipline within the industry. Crude prices jumped Wednesday after OPEC and other oil producers agreed to lower output. Berkshire Hathaway's (BRKB) newly disclosed stakes in Delta, Southwest, American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) have also helped lift the sector.That said, analysts have expressed concern about how the timing of certain holidays might affect airlines' Q4 results. And Southwest, during the third-quarter earnings season, was the only airline that indicated it wasn't seeing quarter-to-quarter unit revenue improvement.Meanwhile, a sustained increase in fuel prices after an agreement between OPEC and non-OPEC states to lower oil production will also add to airlines' costs.United shares eased 1.1% Wednesday and American slipped 1%.RELATED:Delta Eyes Trans-Atlantic Battle Vs.

It also sees Q2 operating margin of around 17%, compared to an earlier forecast of 21%-23%, after the early settlement of fuel hedges increased fuel costs.Despite the deteriorating performance, Delta estimated capacity expanded 3% in Q2, a at the high end of its 2%-3% view.Delta shares sank 3.1% in the stock market today. Rival United Airlines (UAL) fell 2.6%, and American Airlines (AAL) lost 1.4%. The declines also come after a wave of terror attacks in Turkey, Iraq, Bangladesh and Saudi Arabia over the past week.Shares of Delta, United and American Air have been slumping for several months, all recently hitting their lowest levels since 2014.Investors have been hoping that the airlines could improve unit revenue -- a measure of an airline's efficiency -- after a two-year slump in oil prices prompted carriers to increase their flight coverage and cut airfares to compete. Airlines are now under pressure to keep capacity in line with passenger demand after concerns of overexpansion.Meanwhile, Alaska Air Group (ALK) and Ryanair (RYAAY), the Irish budget carrier and ardent 'Brexit' opponent, both reported June traffic increases of around 11% on Tuesday, a day after German carrier Lufthansa continued to back its full-year profit targets despite the U.K.'s vote to leave the EU and a string of terror attacks in the Middle East and Asia.Alaska Air Group said passenger traffic in June rose 10.9%, outpaced by a 11.7% increase in carrying capacity. Load factor, a measure of how effectively an airline fills seats, dipped 0.7 points to 86%.Shares edged down 0.2%.Ryanair, meanwhile, said June traffic rose 11% on a 1% rise in load factor to 94%.

Ryanair urged the European Commission to intervene, as it has before.Ryanair shares sank 2.2%.Lufthansa, which has a joint venture with United, said on Monday that it still expected adjusted earnings before interest and taxes this year to come in at around $2 billion.""We had a buffer from the first few months of the year, so even if we have some weaker months our guidance remains the same,"" CEO Carsten Spohr said, according to Reuters.Lufthansa's announcement comes after IAG, the owner of British Airways, lowered its full-year profit forecast shortly after the outcome of the vote, which sent the pound crashing to a 30-year low. European budget carrier EasyJet last week also said it expected a weaker financial performance following the Brexit vote.Some analysts have worried about Brexit's potential impact on U.S. airlines. The weaker pound against the dollar could be great for American tourists going to the U.K., not so great for U.K. travelers coming to the States.Others have worried a Brexit could stiffen passport controls, hurt airline profits and jeopardize the ""open skies"" agreement between the U.S. and the EU. That agreement allows U.S. carriers to partner and share revenue with U.K. airlines without violating antitrust law.American Airlines has one such partnership with British Airways and has the most flight capacity dedicated to the U.K. Delta, meanwhile, owns nearly half of British carrier Virgin Atlantic.

Fellow Dow financial JPMorgan Chase (JPM) reported strong second-quarter results on Thursday. Goldman Sachs reports its Q2 results on Tuesday.Cheap fuels also has hurt aircraft maker Boeing, the Dow's second-worst performer. Cheap fuel has given airlines less of an incentive to order new jets and allowed them to hold onto older, less-fuel-efficient planes for longer.

""We have all the things we sort of need to put the airplane together.""Boeing had said in February that it was surveying customers about the need for a midsize plane to replace the 757, which was last produced in 2004. United Airlines (UAL), American Airlines (AAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL) are still flying 757s, and FedEx (FDX) uses a cargo version of the plane.But before Boeing gets approval for the new jet, it would need to prove it could build the aircraft at whatever price carriers and leasing companies require. If the board green lights the program, the new Boeing jet could enter service in 2024 or 2025.United Airlines shares rose 0.8% in the stock market today, while those of Boeing inched lower. American shares climbed 3.6%, Delta Air 0.9% and FedEx 1.3%.The new jet would need to fly trans-Atlantic routes and Asian market routes, between 2,900 and 5,000 nautical miles. It would be a rival to Airbus' (EADSY) A321s.Airbus' U.S.-listed shares fell 1.6%.Boeing has more concepts on the drawing board as well and is looking at a new version of the single-aisle 737 Max with new engines that could seat 250. Both new planes could be put into production.For the larger market, Boeing is looking at stretching  its 777 wide-body jet to carry 450 passengers, with an extra four rows of seats vs. the 777-9. The redesign would move Boeing's plane closer to the low end of the Airbus' A380's capacity.

445,DAL,"How does an investor steer a straight course when governments, central banks, and companies around the world are muddling through monetary policy, foisting shocks like Brexit on the markets, and grappling with diminished profits?It begins by keeping a sense of perspective, said one investing expert at the 2016 UBS CIO Global Forum held on Tuesday at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Los Angeles.""We need to recognize that we're in a maturing bull market; we're not seeing signs of an emerging bear market"" yet, Jeremy Zirin of UBS (UBS) Wealth Management Americas, which organized the event, told an audience of more than 200 of the firm's financial advisors and their typically high-net-worth clients.Moreover, he added, ""the worst of the headwinds"" of the recent past -- a rout in energy prices and a strong dollar -- is behind investors.The annual event, now in its third year, brought to the fore for its more than 200 attendees key topics impacting the market landscape, from the November U.S. election to the just-transpired Brexit referendum to the impact of program traders on execution of trade orders.How does an election year affect your investment thinking, moderator Steven Schroko of UBS asked the panelists at a session titled ""Equities: Prognosis for an aging bull market.""The short answer, Charles Brandes, chairman and founder of Brandes, a leading investment advisory firm, replied, is it doesn't.""We look around the world to find good businesses trading at a significant discount for one reason or another,"" he went on to explain. ""Long term, the question is, do I want to own that business, not who is the political head of these countries.""An instant audience poll followed and found that a majority of attendees expect the U.S. to outpace other countries for the best equity returns over the next six months.That led Schroko to ask: Does diversifying into global markets still make sense?Kent Whitaker, a research analyst at independent money manager Davis Advisors, responded that he constructs portfolios with a long-term view and was excited by some European opportunities. ""There are individual companies that tend to go on sale in events like Brexit,"" or Britons' vote to leave the European Union, he said. One he particularly likes Safran, a French manufacturer of jet engines that is growing at a tidy clip within a slow-growth industry and has a ""fantastic franchise.""Brandes pointed to Sberbank, Russia's biggest bank, as another quality international stock. The conservatively run company, he said, was focused on cutting costs and paid an attractive 6% dividend.Schroko then turned his attention to program traders and flash traders, whose computerized, high-volume trades execute automatically when index prices rise or slide to a certain level.""They've added to intraday market volatility,"" Robert Doll, chief equity strategist at asset manager Nuveen, said. ""As a portfolio manager, I embrace it rather than be a victim. I use more limit orders than I used to in the middle of the day.""Zirin and Brandes broadly agreed with Doll. Whitaker added that while he doesn't like program trading, the higher volatility it can create offers opportunities to capture a stock at below its underlying value.""I don't associate volatility with risk in any way,"" Whitaker said, noting it had helped him to some ""home runs"" in the stock market.Schroko proceeded to ask the panelists about their highest conviction ideas over the next six to 12 months.Whitaker said the dislocations in the market had created opportunities in financials and energy. As an example, he cited Apache Energy (APA), which can look forward to decades of drilling opportunities in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico. ""We like to align with managers that understand how to create long-term value in the business,"" he added.Zirin responded that consumer discretionary stocks look attractive to his team, which does top-down work on industries and sectors. Consumer discretionary, he explained, was largely insulated from risks stemming from outside the U.S. and American consumers' spending power is looking the strongest it has in roughly 15 years. He singled out housing-related companies such as Home Depot (HD), which are seeing pent-up demand for their goods and services.Doll, of Nuveen, replied he was long the S&P 500 and short the 10-Year Treasury. Recently he has added to Delta Airlines (DAL), a stock that has sold off hard but belongs to an industry that is increasingly efficient. He's trimmed his position in Verizon (VZ), a stock that's had a nice run-up in the past year.Other panels at the one-day event grappled with macroeconomic challenges, low yields in fixed income, multiasset portfolios and emerging trends in the wealth management industry.

The carrier said the era of cheap oil boost profits is largely over. Delta said it's aiming for unit revenue growth by year-end. Delta says it will curb capacity growth in Q4, partly due to the Brexit vote's impact on the economy and the pound. But it won't reduce capacity outright.Meanwhile, United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) (IBD) forecast Q2 unit revenue that was better than earlier forecasts. American also inked credit card deals that it said would bring in $1.55 billion in pretax income through 2018.Airline stocks have rebounded somewhat from post-Brexit vote sell-offs. They fell Friday following Thursday night's deadly terror attack in Nice, France but still closed up sharply for the week.No one expects the Fed to raise rates at its meeting later this month. And markets don't see much of a chance of a hike this year. But it no longer seems completely off the table. Stocks are at record highs, more than recouping brief post-Brexit losses.

447,DAL,"The State Department in meetings this summer will attempt to address Gulf airlines' competitive practices in the U.S. -- weighing the interests of major carriers like United Airlines (UAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL), smaller rivals like JetBlue (JBLU), and the governments of Qatar and the United Arab Emirates in a spat with no clear winners yet.At issue is the aggressive expansion in the U.S. of Gulf carriers like Qatar Airways and the UAE-based Emirates and Etihad Airways. The big three carriers in the U.S. -- American Airlines (AAL), Delta and United -- allege that their Gulf rivals have gotten a massive funding cushion from their governments, enabling them to easily, and unfairly, muscle in on new markets and drop prices. The Gulf airlines have adamantly denied those claims.The big three U.S. carriers want the State Department to change its ""open skies"" agreements and slap restrictions on flights from the Gulf carriers into the U.S.But smaller players, including JetBlue and Alaska Air Group (ALK) -- which have partnerships with the Gulf carriers -- worry any changes to current agreements could set a precedent for more barrier-raising among competing airlines.The State Department has invited a group that includes Alaska, JetBlue, Hawaiian Holdings (HA) and others to meet on Wednesday to potentially discuss the matter, the Wall Street Journal reported.And next month, the State Department meets with the UAE and Qatar for ""informal, technical discussions."" But the U.S. is not planning at this point to attempt to formally rework the ""open skies"" pacts or stop new flights to the U.S. from the Gulf airlines, sources told the paper.The nature of the discussions, so far, is unclear. But people representing both the smaller and larger carriers appeared to try to claim the upper hand over the meetings, with some reservations.The trade group U.S. Travel Association, an opponent to the big three's requested restrictions, praised the State Department's decision to invite it and smaller airlines to the Wednesday meeting, according to the Journal. However, the group said it was uncertain whether the discussions with the Gulf nations next month would produce any results.Meanwhile, a source familiar with the big airlines' perspective told the Journal that the July meetings were ""a good development"" but also ""kind of open-ended.""Shares of Delta gained back 3.9% to 34.67 in the stock market today after four straight losing session. American, which also has partnerships with Qatar Airways and Etihad, surged 5.9% to 26.77, and United added 3.2% to 38.95. JetBlue jumped 3.8% to 15.73, Hawaiian rallied 2.4% to 37.73, and Alaska edged up 1.9% to 56.71.

448,DAL,"Wall Street continued to unload shares of American Airlines (AAL), Delta Air Lines (DAL) and United Airlines (UAL) in the stock market today, following the U.K.'s vote last week to leave the European Union.American Airlines, which has the most flight exposure to the U.K., sank 6.6% to 25.27, the lowest since December 2013. United plunged 8.1%, while Delta tumbled 5.2%, both the lowest since 2014. American Air lost 11% Friday, with United off 9% and Delta 8%.Nobody knows what the business landscape would look like for the U.K. following a departure from the bloc, but the long process of hammering out a formal separation agreement could further heighten economic uncertainty.Analysts have also worried that a so-called ""Brexit"" would dampen travel demand and jeopardize U.S. airlines' ability to collaborate with carriers that are based in the U.K. American has such a partnership with British Airways.Delta, meanwhile, owns roughly half of British carrier Virgin Atlantic.In Europe, conditions continued to be far worse. Budget carrier EasyJet on Monday forecast weaker revenue per seat for the second half of the year as a result of the U.K.'s vote, saying it expected ""additional economic and consumer uncertainty"" this summer. The carrier said it expected a constant-currency decline in revenue per seat of ""at least a mid-single digit percentage"" as a result of the referendum outcome.On Friday, EasyJet said it was ""confident"" the vote would ""not have a material impact on its strategy or its ability to deliver long-term sustainable earnings growth and returns to shareholders.""The carrier said then that it had been preparing for a potential vote in favor of leaving the EU and that it would ""accelerate discussions"" with authorities to ""ensure that the U.K. remains part of the single EU aviation market."" Its shares traded on the London exchange went into freefall, losing 23.7%Irish budget carrier Ryanair (RYAAY), a vocal supporter of the U.K. staying in the EU, followed EasyJet down, with its U.S.-listed shares plummeting 13.9%. Ryanair lost 4.35% on Friday.Meanwhile, Southwest Airlines (LUV) and other, more-U.S. focused carriers sold off more modestly.Southwest dropped 4%, while JetBlue (JBLU) sank 2% Meanwhile, Alaska Air Group (ALK) fell 1.5%, as Spirit Airlines (SAVE) were whacked by 2.3%.

451,DAL,"American Airlines (AAL) likely has more flight capacity at stake than its rivals as the U.K. apparently voted Thursday to leave the European Union, while United Airlines' (UAL) profit next year could be hit the hardest if the nation left, analysts suggest.A series of recent polls had put the Remain camp in the lead. On Thursday, an Ipsos Mori showed 52% backing Remain and 48% for Leave.American Airlines stock rose 1.5% on the stock market today as Brexit fears eased. United Airlines added 0.2% though Delta Air Lines (DAL) dipped 0.6%. But shares of all three carriers last week tumbled to late 2014 levels as Brexit fears stepped up.They also come with disclaimers from the analysts that a so-called ""Brexit"" would result in negotiations that make forecasts particularly difficult.In the same way a Brexit could restrain U.K.-located banks' ability to sell services freely across the EU, analysts say a departure from the EU calls into question how open the bloc's ""open skies"" deal with U.S. carriers would be if the U.K. departed.That open skies deal, struck in 2007, makes it easy for U.S. carriers to travel through the EU and allowed the U.S. carriers to partner and share revenue with carriers in Europe for flight coverage.""It is likely, we think, that the two countries would revert back to a basic reciprocity-based relationship (access, but with restrictions),"" Wolfe Research analyst Hunter Keay wrote in a research note last week.""We believe regulators would move quickly to hammer out a status-quo-like agreement on an interim basis until a new Open Skies agreement could be reached, but there's no guarantee that would be easy,"" he said.One potential advantage for the U.K. is, in any case, its already massive aviation market.""If an airline said, 'I'll give you London, or I'll give you the rest of Europe,' you might take London,"" Kaplan said.American is seen as likeliest to take the biggest hit from any Brexit fallout, in part because of its large joint-venture with British Airways and its higher concentration of resources in the island nation. Delta Air Lines, meanwhile, owns nearly half of British airline Virgin Atlantic. United doesn't have a partner in the U.K. but still flies a lot to the nation.But excluding such joint-venture agreements, American Airlines also had the most exposure to the U.K. market, with 6.2% of round-trip capacity hitting the U.K., Buckingham Research said in an analysis on Friday. United had 5.3%, while Delta had 2.7%.However, if a Brexit dented the U.K. economy, as some analysts have warned, United's 2017 earnings per share could fall 11% from current estimates in a ""mild"" recession and 21% in a ""severe"" recession, Buckingham's analysis found. That compares to 6% ""mild"" impact and 17% ""severe"" impact for American. Delta was seen as the least affected among the three. Revenue would also slip from current estimates.""Demand for business travel is highly correlated to corporate profits, business confidence/sentiment, all of which are have been affected by Brexit worries,"" analyst Daniel McKenzie wrote in the report. ""Following a vote to leave the EU, travel would likely be negatively impacted even further given economic and financial turmoil.""Carriers could try to cut capacity in the U.K., but their options might be limited given the global economy's struggles.""The airlines, I'm sure, to whatever degree they could, would look to reallocate capacity elsewhere, to get supply in line with demand,"" said Seth Kaplan, managing partner at Airline Weekly. ""The problem is, there's just kind of limited scope to do that because there are so many problem places in the world right now.""

United Airlines (UAL) shares plunged 9.1%, Delta was down 8.2%, and American Airlines (AAL) tumbled 10.8%.BP shares pared losses and were only down 4.8% in the afternoon, with the oil giant formerly known as British Petroleum saying it would keep its headquarters in the U.K.""However, we do not currently expect it to have a significant impact on BP's business or investments in the U.K. and Continental Europe, nor on the location of our headquarters or our staff,"" BP said, according to Reuters.Oil tumbled on the news amid worries of a global economic slowdown that could cut demand.

"
453,DAL,"United Airlines said Tuesday that it expects second-quarter consolidated passenger unit revenue to fall 6.5%-7.5%, an improvement from an earlier forecast of a 6.5%-8.5%, as it works to squeeze more passengers into planes in part through slimmer seats over the coming years.The announcement comes as more investors look for airlines to turn unit revenue around and exercise more discipline with how they expand their flight capacity.Shares closed up 3.4% for the company formally known as United Continental Holdings (UAL) in the stock market today. American Airlines (AAL) rose 1%, while Delta Air Lines (DAL) gained 1.5%.Unit revenue, which measures how much money airlines draw out of passengers as it relates to carrying capacity and is used to gauge an airline's operating efficiency, has fallen industrywide over the past two years.The oil crash that began around that time has kept airlines' profits higher and costs lower and prompted them to compete more aggressively, sending airfares lower amid sometimes insufficient travel demand. Those moves have all hurt unit revenue.United also said it hoped to generate $1.5 billion by 2018 in part through ""increased customer segmentation,"" or different types of fare and seating classes.Over that time, United also said it also will work to install more slimline seats on planes, which have less room but fit more passengers into the cabin and potentially draw more sales from each flight. The company also said it would try to cut costs related to delays and cancellations after lagging rivals in customer satisfaction.Delta and American have recently launched or introduced ""basic economy"" seating options in attempt to compete with low-cost carriers like Spirit Airlines (SAVE). United this month also introduced a new Polaris business class, which offers flat-bed seats with direct-aisle access.United Hosts hosts an investor call Tuesday morning to discuss its plans.

455,DAL,"Is Brexit much ado about nothing for investors? By Wednesday, London's FTSE 100 Index erased all of the losses triggered by the June 23 vote. By Friday, the benchmark index closed at 10-month highs with its best weekly gain since 2011 after the Bank of England promised more stimulus.But don't be fooled: Brexit is a real crisis for the U.K. and could significantly affect the strategies, profits and stocks of global corporations from American Airlines (AAL) to Toyota Motor (TM).The crisis will move in slow motion until the British government invokes Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. Only then will the clock start ticking on a two-year separation before Britain's ultimate divorce from the European Union.For the moment, most companies are in a holding pattern, plotting how they'll respond to Brexit. But analysts are already working through scenarios to try to price in the uncertain impact of the vote to leave the EU on businesses with significant exposure to the U.K.U.S. banks that use London as a base for conducting business throughout the EU face the biggest upheaval. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) said before the vote that it may have to move 4,000 of its 16,000 employees in the U.K. A pre-Brexit analysis by Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said that 1,600 Goldman Sachs (GS) employees may be on the way out of Britain.A major concern among banks and asset managers is that the U.K.'s eventual exit agreement won't maintain so-called passporting rights that allow financial services firms to sell in all EU countries, even where they don't have a branch. EU leaders have insisted this week that any exit agreement that preserves current access will have to allow for the freedom of movement of EU migrants, but controlling immigration was a major impetus behind the Brexit vote.Investment-banking revenue also is likely to come under pressure, says Fitch Ratings: ""Corporate issuance and M&A activity are likely to be lower, particularly for cross-border transactions, while clients face uncertainty during the two-year exit process.""Capital Economics has projected that exports of financial services to the rest of the EU could halve. KBW said that JPMorgan earnings in 2017 could fall by 6.7% due to Brexit, while Goldman's could drop 7.9%. Estimates of financial-sector jobs lost to the EU run as high as 100,000, but New Financial, a London-based think tank, said it expects a more moderate 30,000 to 50,000 jobs. On Thursday, London-based banking giant HSBC, which has heavy exposure to Asia, said it won't move its headquarters, but that doesn't mean some staff won't depart.The auto industry is another one that had good reason to fear Brexit. Toyota publicized a letter to its U.K. employees before the vote warning that the cars (190,000 last year) and engines it produces there could face tariffs of 10% after a split from the EU. About 80% of U.K.-built cars are produced for export, with 60% of those going to EU countries, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.IHS Global Insight told Bloomberg that it expects Brexit to lower 2017 global auto sales by 1.25 million units compared with prior estimates, with an outright drop in the U.K. and slower growth elsewhere.Another big corporate concern is what will happen to the some 3 million non-British EU citizens living in the U.K. While it's hard to imagine that U.K. leaders will want to send them packing, both individuals and businesses can be expected to act to protect themselves.London-based communications giant Vodafone (VOD) warned this week that it might move its headquarters, noting that ""a very large majority of our 462 million customers, 108,000 employees and 15,000 suppliers are based outside the U.K.""As the reality of Brexit sinks in, some commentators are holding out hope that the successor to Prime Minister David Cameron, who will be chosen in early September, will never file divorce papers with the EU.Yet, while decisions about whether to move staff are on hold, businesses also are putting on hold new investment plans. Siemens said its plan to export wind-turbine equipment from its U.K. manufacturing facility was now in doubt, and such decisions are likely to multiply. Fitch is predicting ""a large investment shock,"" with expenditures down 5% in 2017 and 15% in 2018 relative to prior estimates.Low-cost Irish airline Ryanair (RYAAY) said it would shift planned investments from the U.K. to other EU areas, while London-based EasyJet said it would consider moving its headquarters. While the lower British pound might boost tourism, airlines face a currency hit and potential weakness in business travel. American Airlines and Delta Air Lines (DAL) have respective joint ventures with British Airways and Virgin Atlantic involving U.S.-U.K. routes that give them added exposure.Plenty of investment will continue: Amazon (AMZN) said its web services business is moving forward with plans to open a new London data center. Still, even cloud computing faces a cloud of uncertainty due to Brexit because of EU cybersecurity rules requiring that certain kinds of data be hosted on computers within the political union.Investment delays are likely to start hitting the tech sector almost immediately, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a research report on Wednesday. ""For subscription-based companies, we anticipate a potential impact to deal signings,"" the report said.Pretty much every U.S. multinational with significant exposure to the U.K. faces a knock in dollar terms from the weaker British pound, with additional risk of a hit to sales from an expected recession. Goldman cut estimates for a slew of tech firms, including Alphabet (GOOGL), Facebook (FB) and Microsoft (MSFT).Ireland, with its low corporate tax rate and relatively stable EU relationship, is making a pitch for more tech firms to join Google and Facebook in making it their headquarters in Europe.Eventually, the U.K.'s loss could be the EU's gain, but for the moment Brexit is a negative for the EU as well. The eurozone is likely to grow 0.9% in 2017, down from a pre-Brexit forecast of 1.8%, says IHS Global Insight.Even the FTSE 100's recovery is not quite what it appears, once you consider that the British pound is now worth less than $1.33, vs. $1.50 before the Brexit vote results.

459,DAL,"United Airlines (UAL) at its Investor Day on Tuesday said that its network of travel hubs and its range of fare offerings give it a long-term advantage over low-cost, high-fee rivals, which have set their sights on trans-Atlantic routes long dominated by the big U.S. network carriers.The issue has come up as top European airlines launch budget units. But during Delta Air Lines' (DAL) third-quarter earnings call last month, management said it had ""no intent to create an airline within an airline"" to compete on cheaper fares offered by overseas rivals.And on Tuesday, United said such a model ""was always doomed to fail,"" in part because it forced traditional airlines to compete on the low-cost carriers' terms.What the big U.S. airlines are pursuing instead is cabin segmentation, or dividing the plane up into different seating classes. To that end, United also on Tuesday introduced its United Basic Economy seating class, mimicking similar efforts from American Airlines (AAL) and Delta to draw people looking for cheap flights.United Basic Economy is set to debut next year in select markets and offers some of the same amenities as the carrier's traditional economy services, such as food, Wi-Fi and other features, ""with availability depending on the flight.""But full-size carry-ons won't be allowed on board unless the passenger is a Premier member, a Star Alliance Gold member, or a primary card-member of a qualifying MileagePlus credit card. Passengers are allowed to bring a small personal item aboard, and the policies for checking bags are the same as with standard economy.Seat assignments are also automated and provided at check-in, which means that passengers might not be able to sit together, United said.Despite its aversion to creating an airline within an airline, United acknowledged that competing in the skies above the Atlantic would be difficult next year, as budget rivals in and outside of the U.S. have focused more on international travel.Canada's WestJet, Iceland's Wow air and Norwegian Air Shuttle offer cheaper flights across the Atlantic. Within Europe, Lufthansa's Eurowings competes in the low-cost market. And the Wall Street Journal recently reported that Air France-KLM plans to launch a budget airline that could eventually fly to the U.S. Meanwhile, Irish budget carrier Ryanair (RYAAY) said it expects its low fares to prompt rivals to simply give up in some areas.IBD'S TAKE: As low-cost carriers swarm, Delta has said it would consider an array of options to compete for market share over the Atlantic. United also said it hopes to keep unit-cost growth under 1% from 2018 to 2020, and said it was targeting a 1.5-point margin premium to Delta by 2020.Shares jumped 5% to close at 66.06 on the stock market today. Delta edged up 0.4%, while American climbed 3.1%.Shares of United, Delta and American rose after hours on Monday after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) disclosed new stakes in the carriers. CNBC reported that Berkshire had also taken a stake in Southwest (LUV).That would be just a bit of a reversal for Buffett, who once said investing in airlines was a ""death trap"" that had essentially lit investors' money on fire for an entire century.""Here, a durable competitive advantage has proven elusive since the days of the Wright brothers,"" he said in a 2008 letter to shareholders. ""Indeed, if a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favor by shooting Orville down.""Elsewhere during United's Investor Day presentation, management said they might benefit from President-elect Donald Trump's plans to spend big on infrastructure improvements. However, the company said it was still too early to tell how a Trump presidency might affect them, adding, ""We're just simple folks trying to run an airline.""RELATED:United Airlines Will Pare Capacity On Brexit, Corporate DemandUnited Sees Unit Revenue Improving In Q4 But Labor Pact To Lift CostsAmerican Airlines Sees Thinner Margins, Alaska Air Trims Capacity

460,DAL,"Shares of the four big U.S. airlines got an after-hours bump after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) disclosed new stakes in the carriers. It's a dramatic reversal for Buffett, who for decades has vocally opposed investing in airline stocks.Delta Air Lines (DAL) rose 2.6% after hours in the stock market today, while American Airlines (AAL) 4.3% and United Airlines (UAL) 2.2%.Airline stock have been soaring in recent days. During the regular session, Delta rose 2.35% to its highest since April. American Air climbed 1.1% to a seven-month best. United Air soared 4.5% to a an 18-month best.Berkshire also took a stake in Southwest (LUV), CNBC reported. Southwest was up 3.4% late Monday after closing 3.4^ higher.In an SEC filing, Berkshire (BRKA) said it owned $797 million in shares of American Airlines, $249.3 million in Delta and $237.8 million in United, as of Sept. 30. Buffett told CNBC that Berkshire has also invested in Southwest after Sept. 30.Back in 2013, Buffett said airline stocks were a ""death trap,"" adding that ""Investors have poured their money into airlines for 100 years with terrible results.""Buffett has been wary of investing in carriers since he nearly lost all of a 1989 investment in US Airways, though he eventually made money on the deal, CNBC noted.""The worst sort of business is one that grows rapidly, requires significant capital to engender the growth, then earns little or no money,"" Buffett wrote in a 2008 letter to shareholders. ""Think airlines. Here, a durable competitive advantage has proven elusive since the days of the Wright brothers. Indeed, if a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favor by shooting Orville down.""IBD'S TAKE: Airlines are among the many sectors soaring since the presidential election. Here's the case for a Trump bull market.

461,DAL,"Stocks continued to trade lower on Wall Street Monday afternoon, but business software giant Salesforce.com (CRM), which has been the focus of some speculation of being a potential M&A target, held its ground following a May 18 breakout.The Nasdaq composite saw its losses narrow slightly to 0.5% after briefly rebounding into positive territory in late-morning trading. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average eased 0.3% each. The Nasdaq and Dow did find support, at least intraday, at their 50-day lines. The Dow transports were down 0.5%, led by a sharp sell-off in airline shares.In the stock market today, airline stocks fell in unison amid the persistent rebound in crude oil prices and the mass shooting by a lone gunman pledging allegiance to the ISIS terrorist organization early Sunday morning at an Orlando, Fla., downtown gay nightclub.Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines (DAL) dropped 3% in active trading. Hawaiian Air (HA) slid 5% in heavy trade. The former big winner in 2015 is now reaching new lows in its current base-building efforts. Watch to see if the stock tests buying support at its 200-day moving average, seen in red on an Investors.com daily chart. Hawaiian Air is 25% below a 50.95 all-time peak.Department store, dairy product, meat and supermarket stocks are also leading the market's downside. Yet software stocks are generally stronger Monday in the wake of the Microsoft (MSFT) plans to buy social networking firm LinkedIn (LNKD) for $26.2 billion cash.Salesforce is fractionally higher at 82.10, 5.3% above a 77.92 cup-with-handle buy point. In other words, the big-cap cloud-based software provider is now out of buy range once again. An investor seeking profits in the best growth stocks should not chase a leader more than 5% beyond a proper entry.Salesforce has shown a propensity to round-trip all of its gains from recent breakouts, such as the move in October 2015 past a 76.31 early buy point within an undefined base. The stock rallied just 9% past that pivot point in five weeks, then gave back all of those gains during the market's December-to-January correction.Salesforce, which grew earnings per share 46%, 50%, 36% and 50% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters, earns an enviable 99 Composite Rating at IBD Stock Checkup.Is your stock is best in class within its industry group in terms of profit growth, margins, sales, return on equity, institutional fund sponsorship and relative price strength?

462,DAL,"Shares of American Airlines (AAL), Delta Air Lines (DAL) and United Continental Holdings (UAL) continued their rapid descent Tuesday, closing at their lowest levels since late 2014, amid a slew of negative headwinds and headlines.The plunge came amid elevated concerns about terror in the skies, Brexit and a general market sell-off.The attack by suspected ISIS sympathizer Omar Mateen at a gay nightclub in Orlando early Sunday killed 49 and was the worst terror attack on U.S. soil since the 9-11 attacks. It has once again put the threat of attacks -- in the air or at tourism hot spots -- back in the headlines.The U.K.-based Guardian newspaper said Tuesday that a new poll showed that the campaign to have Britain leave the European Union was 7 points ahead of sentiment to stay in the EU. The referendum will be held June 23. Britain's exit would shake up the EU, and businesspeople are likely to avoid traveling to the EU to conclude deals until they know which way Britain votes.Meanwhile, the stock markets were down amid general uncertainty Tuesday afternoon. The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq were working on their fourth straight day of losses, all trading back below their 50-day moving averages. American Airlines, the largest U.S. carrier by annual revenue, was headed for its third straight downward close. After recovering from the early 2016 market sell-off, it rose as high as 43.78 on March 21 but has plunged 31% since then. It ended the day down 4.5% at 30.36 in the stock market today. American Air is trading at the worst intraday levels since October 2014.Delta, a close rival to American, slid 3.6% to 39.11. That's the lowest since the Aug. 24, 2015 market flash crash and it's set for the lowest close since October 2014.After years of steady revenue growth, Delta has seen sales shrink slightly for the last three quarters in a row. Delta recently warned on passenger unit revenue.No. 3 United Airlines fell 4.5% to 42.09, well below a March 21 intraday high of 61.41. Shares have undercut their January low to their worst intraday levels since October 2014. Southwest Airlines (LUV), the top domestic carrier by passenger volume, was down 5.4% to 39.88. Southwest Air has plunged through its 200-day line this week and is at a three-month low.JetBlue Airways (JBLU) ended the trading day down 3.1% at 16.77. That's the lowest since the Aug. 24, 2015, market crash. JetBlue is on track for the lowest close since March 2015.

463,DAL,"Shares of Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL), United Continental Holdings (UAL) and Southwest (LUV) fell Monday following Sunday's shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando that killed 49 people as well as a bombing at Shanghai Pudong International Airport that day that wounded at least five.Airline stocks have generally fallen after recent terror attacks on fears that people will be more reluctant to travel, but they have often rebounded shortly after.Authorities say that the gunman in Orlando, Omar Mateen, swore allegiance to the head of ISIS before carrying out the shooting at the nightclub. The bombing in Shanghai comes as Walt Disney (DIS) prepares to open a theme park there. However, authorities are still trying to determine Mateen's precise motives for the shooting. While the FBI had previously investigated Mateen, his father told NBC News that the shooting had ""nothing to do with religion"" and that Mateen was outraged at recently seeing two men kissing in Miami.Delta shares ended trading down 3.5% to 40.57 on the stock market today. United lost 4.4% to 44.06, and American dropped 4% to 31.80. Southwest retreated 3.4% to 42.16.Meanwhile, airline complaints fell nearly 20% in April, according to Transportation Department data out Monday. Issues related to flight cancellations, delays, missed connections, boarding, baggage and customer service generally drew the most complaints. Four discrimination complaints were logged in April.Spirit Airlines (SAVE) had 6.81 complaints per 100,000 enplanements -- or passengers boarded. That was down 7.2% from last April but by far the most for any airline, according to the DOT. Spirit has said it would try to improve customer service. Southwest had the lowest rate of complaints in April with a rate of 0.36, down from 0.44 a year ago.Frontier Airlines saw that metric drop 68% to 2.76 -- the biggest such drop among airlines recorded. For Hawaiian Holdings' (HA) Hawaiian Airlines, complaints per 100,000 enplanements nearly tripled to 1.76.United's rate fell 28.6% to 2, Delta's edged down to 3% to 0.61, and American's complaints per 100,000 enplanements fell 34% to 2.13.Complaint rates also fell in March, and low fares and better on-time performance have made passengers happier overall with air travel. Airlines are trying to improve amenities as well to get more revenue out of passengers.But data for the month of May could slam the brakes on that trend, after scores of people missed flights due to epic wait-times at understaffed TSA checkpoints during the month. Lower airfares could encourage more people to fly this summer, adding more strain to the TSA.Airlines are trying to address the complaints. American Airlines has spent $4 million to deploy staff to help TSA staff move lines faster. Delta has ponied up $1 million to test out ""innovation lanes"" in Atlanta. The lane systems allow five passengers at a time to load items into bins.And U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal and Edward Markey have also said airlines should eliminate bag fees this summer to move passengers through the lines more quickly.Shares of Spirit finished the day down 3.3% to 44.30, while Hawaiian tumbled 5.8% to 37.67.

464,DAL,"Stocks retreated Monday for the third consecutive session, with airlines leading the way down.The S&P 500 skidded 0.8%, while the Nasdaq lost 0.9%. The Dow Jones industrial average lopped off 0.7%. The Nasdaq closed below its 50-day moving average for the first time since May 23; the S&P 500 closed just above its 50-day line. The Dow closed below that support level.The Russel 2000 fell 1.2%. Volume in the stock market today was higher on the Nasdaq but lower on the NYSE, early figures showed. Losers led winners by more than 3-to-1 on the NYSE and Nasdaq.Airline stocks suffered, apparently on fear of traveling in the wake of the terrorist attack Sunday in Orlando, Fla. Hawaiian Holdings (HA) scored one of the bigger drops, a 6% dent. Delta Air Lines (DAL), the biggest airline stock by market cap, fell 3.5%. Although most airline stocks were down, volume was restrained. Hawaiian and Delta saw average volume.Firearms stocks rose, apparently on the conviction that terrorist-inspired fears can spark demand for weapons. Sturm Ruger (RGR) and Smith & Wesson (SWHC) added 8.5% and 7%, respectively.In the IBD 50, Facebook (FB) lost more than 2% and closed below its 50-day moving average. Short seller Citron Research criticized the social media company, saying it is losing relevancy.Some interest rate-sensitive stocks fell also. Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL) fell 3% and closed below its 50-day moving average, 6% below its 37.58 buy point.

465,DAL,"Right now in stocks, small is big. Small-cap stock mutual funds continue to soar. Small-cap value funds are up 22.20% this year going into Friday, according to Morningstar Inc. Small-cap blend funds were next best, up 18.27%. Those topped all U.S. diversified stock fund categories. Small-cap growth funds were sixth best, up 12.10%.Small-cap stocks are thriving amid concerns that any trade war sparked by a Donald Trump presidential administration would hurt large-cap multinational companies the most. Meanwhile, U.S. economic growth at the moment is strong enough to prompt Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen to say that a rate hike by the central bank could come ""relatively soon."" That economic growth has heartened small-cap investors.""Small caps are outperforming as investors realize that the Trump administration will be a much more business-friendly administration,"" said Craig Hodges, co-manager of $356.4 million Hodges Fund (HDPMX). ""That's going to have a more dramatic effect on small companies. Also, that fact that ObamaCare could get rolled back is positive for small caps. It's such a costly expense, especially for small caps.""Brian Smoluch, lead co-manager of $169 million Hood River Small Cap Growth (HRSRX), says small caps in several industries stand to benefit from lighter regulatory burdens and possible tax cuts. In addition, if Trump pushes infrastructure investments, small caps in that space would benefit, he adds.Hodges cites Trinity Industries (TRN), which makes rail cars and construction aggregates, as a small cap that stands to benefit from a Trump White House. ""It has gone to nearly 28 from 21 on no new news other than the election results (ushering in) a different business environment.""For similar reasons, he likes United States Steel (X) and Eagle Materials (EXP). U.S. Steel, which has an IBD Composite Rating of 87, is up 73% in the past month. Eagle, which makes gypsum wallboard and cement products, gapped up 8% the day after the election.IBD'S TAKE: The Composite Rating, which starts at 1 and runs to 99, combines IBD's five performance ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher, which means that they've outperformed 95% of all other stocks in terms of their Composite Rating. Here's where to learn more about reading the Comp Rating road signs.And Hodges Capital Management also holds Corecivic (CXW) and Geo Group (GEO), two REITs that run correctional facilities. ""(Hillary) Clinton was adamant about having the government get out of that business,"" Hodges said. ""Prison stocks fell when the Department of Justice talked about getting out of that. They've rebounded since.""And Hodges says he has renewed interest in restaurants. He has been underweight. We're looking for under-owned, good-looking situations. Hodges Capital is down to one restaurant stock, Cracker Barrel (CBRL). ""Cracker Barrel and Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) — we got out of that — a lot of their fixed costs will go down if minimum wages aren't rising 50% and a lot of their health care costs go down.""""And we still like energy,"" Hodges added. If the price per barrel of oil is in the 55-to-65 range, ""a lot of exploration and production companies are extremely popular,"" he said. Oil's recent volatility has hurt oil stocks. ""But we would be buyers on weakness,"" he added.""Matador Resources (MTDR) is active mostly in the Delaware and Permian basins,"" he said. ""They've got the best small-cap management team in the E&P space. Their science is second to none.""Hodges also likes the outlook for some bigger stocks. A decreased prospect of government regulation should aid airlines stocks, he says. ""Warren Buffett said he is buying airlines for the first time since 1989: Delta (DAL), United[ticker symb=UAL], Southwest (LUV), American (AAL). We own all of those.""Smoluch cites PRA Group (PRAA) as a stock that stands to benefit from a regulatory rollback. ""They do credit-card-receivables collections,"" he said. ""I wouldn't be surprised if regulation by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau is significantly curtailed, which would help this company.""He added, ""PRA Health Sciences (PRAH) would benefit from a biotech spending pickup as that industry gets healthier. This company helps manage clinical trial. As more capital flows into biotech with a healthier outlook, then more money flows to companies like this.""Small-cap funds have done well over those past 10 years as well. Small-cap funds with at least $100 million in assets averaged an annual gain of 6.91% over the decade ended Nov. 16 vs. a 6.79% pace by the S&P 500.If you had invested $10,000 in a cross section of small-cap funds a decade ago, it would have grown into $20,939 by Nov. 16. That would be a bit more than the $20,256 result for the big-cap bogey.RELATED:Small-Cap Rally Offers Investors Alternatives To Big-Cap Multinationals

467,DAL,"Irish budget carrier Ryanair (RYAAY) on Monday boosted its traffic outlook in the coming years and said it expects its low fares to force rivals out of some markets.The bullish expectations come as low-cost carriers in Europe and the U.S. force their larger non-budget rivals to cut fares to compete. Ryanair said it has already seen rivals shrink their footprint across Europe and that they were likely to pull back further.During the first half of the year, ""we've observed a growing trend of competitors closing bases and routes where they are unable to compete with Ryanair's lower fares, and we expect this trend to continue, especially in markets such as Germany, Italy, Spain and Belgium, where significant restructuring of loss making operators (even at lower oil prices) continues,"" the carrier said.The low-fare battle prompted Air France-KLM last week to launch a low-cost airline that may eventually offer flights to the U.S., potentially ratcheting up pressure on Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines and United Airlines (UAL), which together control about a third of U.S.-Europe flights. But Delta has said it won't create a budget airline.Nearer term, however, Ryanair said low fares and the U.K.'s Brexit vote have made them cautious about fiscal 2017.Still, it was raising its long-term traffic forecast by more than 10% to 200 million passengers annually by March 2024.""Despite the uncertainty of Brexit, Ryanair believes that we can deliver profitable growth across Europe by controlling costs, lowering airfares, and maximizing load factors in a manner that will most benefit our customers, our people and our shareholders,"" the company said in a statement.U.S.-listed shares of Ryanair jumped 5.2% to close at 79.20 in the stock market today, popping above its 200-day line for the first time since September. Delta climbed 3.1%, American jumped 4.4% and United added 2.3%.IBD'S TAKE: With low-cost carriers outside the U.S. starting to offer their own trans-Atlantic flights, carriers like Delta are looking at a variety of ways to compete. Still, Ryanair said the fallout from the U.K.'s decision this summer to leave the European Union would likely ""continue to overhang our business"" during fiscal-year 2018. And it said ""weaker airfares and Brexit uncertainty will be the dominant features"" of the second half of its fiscal 2017, which ends in March.The vote, which caused the British pound to tank and made foreign exchange difficult, has prompted the carrier to slash 2017 flight-capacity growth in the U.K. to around 5% from 12%.The carrier, a vocal opponent of Brexit, said it would, in turn, shift that capacity growth toward Italy, where the government has cut taxes, and Germany and Belgium, where it said rivals were cutting back.While Ryanair has become known for its bare-bones approach to service and its CEO's brash approach to language, the carrier has tried to improve bookings, benefits, business-travel offerings and even leg room.Meanwhile, U.S. discount carrier Southwest (LUV) on Monday said that it continued to expect fourth-quarter unit revenue to fall 4% to 5% based on its October results. October traffic rose 5.2% on a capacity increase of 5.4%.Southwest shares finished 3% higher.RELATED:Southwest Is Only Airline That Sees Worse Unit Revenue; Stock DivesJetBlue Eyes Flights To Europe As Premium Service Expands

468,DAL,"Air France-KLM plans to launch a low-cost airline that may eventually offer flights to the U.S., potentially ratcheting up pressure on Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL), American Airlines (AAL) and other network carriers trying to compete with budget airlines in Europe.The details of those plans, as reported by the Wall Street Journal, follow last month's remarks from Delta that it won't create a new budget airline, though it would consider options like basic economy fares and different cabin layouts to compete with low-cost carriers in Europe.Delta on Wednesday said that a ""supply-demand imbalance in the Transatlantic"" weighed on its October traffic results. Delta and United have also said they would cut flight capacity to the region following the U.K.'s Brexit vote this summer, while JetBlue (JBLU) is also eying flights to the European market. Air France's new airline is slated to begin flights to Asia next winter, the Journal reported, with trans-Atlantic flights potentially coming after that. The quality of service on the new airline would be somewhere between what Air France currently offers and the bare-bones service offered on the budget carriers.Delta, United and American, which control about a third of U.S.-Europe flights, also must contend with long-haul, low-cost trans-Atlantic flights to U.S. cities from such discount airlines as Norwegian Air Shuttle.Irish budget carrier Ryanair (RYAAY) has likewise turned up the heat in Europe, with traditional carriers there creating their own discount airlines to stay competitive. WestJet, a Canadian airline, and WOW air, from Iceland, also offer lower-cost flights across the Atlantic.IBD'S TAKE: In addition to capacity concerns and low-cost competition, analysts say the labor deals airlines have made recently with employees could weigh on profits in the coming year.Air France's announcement comes as low-cost U.S. carriers like Spirit Airlines (SAVE) have already sucked the bigger carriers into an airfare battle domestically.Shares of Delta fell 1 cent to 41.92 in the stock market today, while United fell 0.4% and American lost 0.8%.

Fed chief Janet Yellen expects a rate hike ""soon,"" while OPEC output talks revived and Warren Buffett booked a flight on airline stocks. Retail results and outlooks were mixed heading into Black Friday.The Nasdaq rose 1.6% for the week, briefly hitting an all-time intraday high Friday, as big-cap techs such as Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet (GOOGL) recouped some losses. The Dow industrials, after the prior week's postelection spike to a record high, rose just a fraction. The S&P 500 rose 0.8%, also close to record highs. Bank stocks moved sideways or higher as Treasury yields dipped initially but then rose again. Some fiber-optic, chip and cybersecurity stocks broke out.Fed chief Janet Yellen said that a rate hike would be ""appropriate relatively soon."" She stressed the risks of delaying a move but also didn't sound like the central bank would follow up with a series of tightening steps.

Its U.S.-listed shares leaped 12.8% to 1.35.Bombardier is finalizing the huge order, Bloomberg said, citing a source close to the situation. The deal is estimated to be worth $5.3 billion to $6.2 billion at list prices, though aerospace companies usually give discounts to carriers for large orders.No. 2 U.S. carrier Delta is set to order 75 of Bombardier's fuel-efficient C Series jetliners and is seeking options for 50 more of the single-aisle Bombardier jets as it replaces older planes, the report said.Boeing is slated to report first-quarter earnings before the market opens April 27.

472,DAL,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) sees $3 billion in fuel savings this year but is also looking ahead to the end of cheap oil and vowed Thursday to improve unit revenue via capacity cuts if necessary.Ed Bastian, president and soon-to-be CEO of Delta, said in a conference call that the carrier is ""pushing as much of those fuel savings to the bottom line as we can.""In the first quarter, adjusted fuel expenses plunged 54% to $1.24 billion on 40% lower market-fuel prices. That helped Q1 earnings nearly triple to $1.32 per share, 2 cents better than consensus forecasts. Revenue fell 1.5% to $9.25 billion, slightly under views for $9.26 billion, as currency headwinds and the terrorist bombings in Brussels weighed.Shares rose as much as 3.7% earlier in the day but ended 0.9% higher in the stock market today. American Airlines (AAL) climbed 3.1%. United Airlines (UAL) rose 2.1%, and Southwest Airlines (LUV) added 1.9%.While Delta expects fuel to average $1.48-$1.53 per gallon in Q2, up from $1.33 in Q1, more unfavorable fuel hedges will expire, helping Delta boost profits.Still, oil prices have rallied since February, and market forecasters are seeing signs that the global supply glut could ease later this year.""While lower fuel costs are providing huge benefits for our business, there is a lot of uncertainty in the global environment and we know fuel won’t stay low permanently,"" said CFO Paul Jacobson on the conference call. ""So as result we remain focused on staying disciplined with our costs.""Delta management added that demand is strong, but if fuels prices go up and economies don’t grow, then that will be an indication the industry would need to pull back on capacity to increase margins.In Q1, passenger unit revenue fell 4.6% on a 2.7% increase in capacity. For Q2, Delta sees passenger unit revenue falling 2.5%-4.5% and capacity up 2%-3%.“While this is an improvement over our March quarter performance, we are focused on getting unit revenues back to a positive trajectory and we will make adjustments to our fall capacity levels if we are not making sufficient progress over the coming months,” said Glen Hauenstein, Delta’s incoming president, in the earnings release.Capacity typically grows when oil prices fall as carriers look to lower unit costs. But that comes at the expense of unit revenues.Seth Kaplan, managing partner with Airline Weekly, said Delta and others will have to keep a ""real close eye on capacity"" to keep falling unit revenues in check.He also applauded Delta's performance in Q1, an off-peak quarter, saying the numbers would have been the envy of the industry even in a peak quarter.""First and foremost this is a fuel story,"" Kaplan said. ""But it's not only that, it's also a deft capacity-management story.""Delta has other factors working to its advantage besides low fuel costs. Its network exposure has been more sheltered from slowing economies in Asia that have impacted United, though Delta is among the U.S. carriers being hit by new capacity from low-cost Chinese airlines expanding rapidly.Delta also has less exposure to Latin America, which is likely to hit American's Q1 earnings. And domestically, it doesn't have as much exposure to the Texas market, which is reeling from falling oil prices, as peers like United do.American, United and Southwest report quarterly results next week.

"
477,DAL,"Delta Air Lines' (DAL) first-quarter earnings are expected to nearly triple from a year earlier when the airline reports results Thursday, helped as ever by low fuel costs. But with the company expecting positive passenger unit revenue this year -- a rarity across the industry recently -- analysts may be focusing more on the company's guidance.Meanwhile, labor and profit-sharing deals could weigh on American Airlines' (AAL) earnings this year, the company said Monday. But it lowered its capacity guidance, which was pushed down by difficulties internationally.Wall Street expects Delta to report Q1 earnings per share of $1.30, up 189% from the 45 cents reported a year earlier. Total revenue for the quarter is expected to edge down to $9.256 billion.Delta's passenger unit revenue -- how much an airline makes per passenger as it relates to its available flight capacity -- likely fell roughly 4.5% in the quarter, the company said last week in an investor update.Passenger unit revenue has fallen across the industry due to the stronger dollar, which discourages foreign travel, as well as lower airfares and capacity expansion last year in some competitive markets.But given Delta's upbeat forecasts on the key metric, many investors could be looking more toward Q2.""Delta continues to reiterate they expect PRASM to turn positive at some point in the summer (for a day? a month? the quarter? remains unclear), and it will be interesting to see if they reiterate that on the earnings call,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note Monday. PRASM refers to passenger revenue per available seat mile.Delta could have a lot more room for profits this year as fuel hedges -- contracts airlines enter into to lock in fuel prices and guard against market fluctuations -- fall away. The company's staff is less unionized than rivals, which also gives it more financial flexibility.The carrier likely paid an average of $1.33-$1.37 a gallon in fuel for the quarter, it said last week. But unit costs were seen rising between 4.5%-5%, with carrying capacity up around 2.7%.The company also expects operating margins in the quarter of 18%-19%, below an earlier forecast of 18%-20%.Last week, Delta said the company's March traffic results suffered from weaker foreign exchange and ""a $5 million impact"" due to the terror attacks in Brussels. However, the company said that ""demand remains solid with forward bookings tracking ahead of last year,"" even though close-in yields -- a measurement of last-minute bookings -- weighed on results during the month.Shares closed up 0.6% in the stock market today. Earlier, shares topped their 50-day and 200-day lines, which had become entangled in recent days, but ended below those levels of support.Meanwhile, rival American Airlines said it expected recent contract deals with staff to push unit costs 3%-5% higher this this year. The return of a profit-sharing program, announced last month, will also increase unit costs. However, the company lowered its full-year capacity guidance to a 2.5% increase from an earlier forecast of 3% growth.""The international capacity reductions do not come as much of a surprise, given the currency headwinds, lower fuel surcharges, recent terrorist events in Paris and Brussels, as well as struggling international economies,"" Becker said in a separate research note Monday. ""The reduction in capacity will increase non-fuel unit costs but benefit PRASM.""American expects first-quarter consolidated passenger unit revenue to fall roughly 7%-8%, worse than an earlier forecast for a 6%-8% slide, and stuck with its forecast of pretax margin of 12%-14%. The margin outlook includes the impact of the profit-sharing program.The airline reports first-quarter results on April 22. Analysts expect EPS to fall 33% to $1.15, with revenue down 4% to $9.4 billion.American's March traffic rose 3.3%, while capacity grew 3.8%, the company said Monday. Load factor, a measure of an airline's ability to fill seats, slipped 0.4 percentage point.Shares rallied 0.6% Monday, but they have trended below their 50-day and 200-day lines following the announcement of the profit-sharing agreement.On Friday, United Airlines (UAL) reported that traffic and capacity slipped in March. The carrier expects first-quarter passenger unit revenue to fall 7.25%-7.75%, hurt by a stronger dollar, falling close-in business travel around spring break and Easter, and ""travel reductions from energy-dependent corporate customers.""United shares rose 1.2% Monday.The end of certain federal restrictions in 2014 allowed Southwest (LUV) to expand its flight coverage, prompting other airlines to boost capacity to compete.While that sparked worries that expansion could overshoot demand, there's a greater sense that the bigger players could temper their growth plans this year as the smoke clears.""For the first time in a while, we actually expect an improvement in (year over year) PRASM growth in Q2, entirely on capacity deceleration and not higher fares,"" Wolfe Research analyst Hunter Keay said in a research note last week. He said schedule data indicates domestic capacity in the industry growing 4.5% in the second quarter, down from 6.3% in Q1.Image provided by Shutterstock.

481,DAL,"Alaska Air Group (ALK) is expected to announce a deal to buy Virgin America (VA) for more than $2 billion on Monday, besting JetBlue (JBLU) in the bidding process, according to several reports.Alaska Air will pay $2.5 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported on the deal's prospects on Saturday. Reuters reported Alaska would pay $56-$58 a share for Virgin America, which closed at 38.90 on Friday. It was 30.67 on March 22, before reports that Richard Branson's carrier was putting itself up to sale.Virgin America, which began in 2007, sought to offer substantial amenities and low fares. Few peers sought to provide that combination at the time, and even fewer do now.The deal would move Alaska over JetBlue as the fifth-largest U.S. carrier.It would be the first notable airline merger since American Airlines (AAL) and US Airways combined in 2013. An Alaska-Virgin deal likely would receive close regulatory scrutiny given that the top four carriers -- American Airlines, United Continental (UAL), Delta Air Lines (DAL) and Southwest Airlines (LUV) -- dominate 80% of U.S. traffic.Delta Air Lines likely will release March traffic figures early this week.
"
482,DAL,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) on Wednesday said October unit revenue fell in line with expectations, while Alaska Air Group (ALK) reportedly monthly carrying capacity that was roughly in line with its forecasts for the fourth quarter overall.Delta said unit revenue, a key measure that gauges revenue as it relates to available seats and distance flown, fell 6.5% in October.The carrier said it ""continued to see stabilization of close-in domestic yields"" during the month, referring to its ability to get more money from flights arranged closer to their departure. However, Delta said it faced an imbalance of supply and demand in the Transatlantic region, while the timing of certain holidays also weighed on results.Delta had indicated on its third-quarter earnings call that unit revenue was likely to be weak in October.Delta's traffic fell 0.3% for the month, while its carrying capacity rose 1.7%. The company has said it expects fourth-quarter capacity to rise around 1%.Shares rose 0.1% to 41.93 in the stock market today, after closing above the 200-day moving average on Tuesday for the first time since mid-April.Meanwhile, Alaska Air Group said traffic rose 5.5%, outpacing a capacity increase of 3.2%. Alaska Air Group last month said it expected fourth-quarter capacity to rise around 3%. Load factor, a measure of seats filled, rose 1.9 percentage points to 84.2%.Alaska Air stock lost 0.7% to 70.96. The stock is in a long, deep cup-with-handle base with a potential buy point of 73.41.The results come ahead of monthly reports from American Airlines[ticker symb=AAL], Southwest (LUV) and others.IBD'S TAKE: In addition to capacity concerns, analysts say the labor deals airlines have made recently with employees could weigh on profits in the coming year.American and Southwest were down marginally.

483,DAL,"United Airlines (UAL) delayed delivery of $5 billion in Boeing (BA) jets on Tuesday, following a similar delay from Southwest Airlines (LUV) in June, and may add more used jets to its fleet as carriers look to cut costs.United said it would delay accepting 61 737-700s it ordered from Boeing earlier this year but didn't give a new delivery date. The carrier will still take delivery of four of the jets ordered but upgrade them to the larger 737-800.United said the delay will save the airline $1.6 billion in capital costs and come as United looks to improve profitability through 2020 in an effort to beat out rival Delta Air Lines (DAL).United shares climbed 5% to 66.06 in the stock market today, coming amid its investor day Tuesday and late Monday disclosure from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) that it has bought a stake in United Airlines, Delta and American Airlines (AAL) in Q3. Buffett also said Berkshire has bought Southwest shares after Sept. 30.Boeing fell 1.25% to 148.11. Southwest added 2%. Delta gave up most of its gains to close up just 0.4%.IBD'S TAKE: The delivery delays are trickling down to aerospace supplier TransDigm, which gave weak 2017 guidance and said it is cautious about the commercial transport aircraft market.In June, Southwest said it would delay delivery of 67 Boeing 737 Max8 planes by as much as six years, but would accelerate six 737-800 orders to 2017 from 2018 as it will retire older 737s. And in July, American Airlines pushed back the delivery of 22 Airbus (EADSY) A350 widebody aircraft.Meanwhile, oil prices remain cheap after crashing two years ago. This has made flying older aircraft economical and reduced the need for newer planes with more fuel-efficient engines.Boeing has said cheap fuel hasn't affected long-term demand for aircraft, but carriers are able to push back delivery of new models by deploying used planes.Meanwhile, the company said late Tuesday that it is consolidating facilities in its defense and space business, transferring some jobs and closing sites in El Paso, Texas, and Newington, Va. The net result is a reduction of 500 positions. Boeing has trimmed its workforce by almost 17,000 this year.RELATED: Boeing: 'Realistic Possibility' Of Midsize Jet, Stretch 737; Stock In Buy ZoneUnited: Airlines Within Airlines Are 'Doomed To Fail'Warren Buffett, Who Called Airline Stocks A 'Death Trap,' Invests In Big 4Boeing Gets $3.2 Billion China Southern Order As China Travel Booms

"
485,DAL,"Southwest (LUV) reported third-quarter earnings on Wednesday that topped views, but the carrier's fourth-quarter unit revenue outlook disappointed, causing shares to sink.The carrier said it expects Q4 revenue per available seat mile to fall 4%-5%, based on ""the shift in holiday timing, and bookings thus far."" The news makes Southwest an outlier in an industry that has forecast improvement in the much-watched metric.""While current trends suggest a stabilization of close-in fares, the overall revenue yield environment remains soft,"" Southwest said.Southwest's forecast makes it the only airline to indicate that it is not seeing quarter-to-quarter improvement in unit revenue, Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note. Many airlines this earnings season got a boost in Q3 due to stronger September results, following a summer in which the Zika virus and terrorism deterred some passengers from flying.Airlines have tried to prop up unit falling revenue over the past year in part by aligning their expansion plans with demand, and their outlooks for when unit revenue might turn positive have been a main focus for Wall Street. Rising fuel costs could also help the industry temper their capacity growth and raise ticket prices.The airline plans to slow its capacity growth to below 4% in 2017, down from 2016's projected growth of 4%-6%. Capacity rose 4.2% in Q3.Southwest sank 8.5% to close at 38.40 on the stock market today but pared steeper, early losses. American Airlines (AAL) finished the session down 0.9% to 39.32, while Delta Air Lines (DAL) reversed higher to edge up 0.5% to 41.40 and United Airlines (UAL) lost 1.2% to 53.98.IBD'S TAKE: In addition to capacity concerns, analysts say the labor deals airlines have made recently with employees could weigh on profits in the coming year.Earlier this month, United said  expects to continue shoring up unit revenue during Q4. Delta has delayed its timeline for growing unit revenue but sees it turning positive by early next year. American sees Q4 unit revenue declining 1%-3%, with the midpoint slightly improved vs. the 2.2% drop in Q3.So why is Southwest going the opposite direction?""Southwest has historically been slow to reduce capacity after they load it in the system, so the issues in (the fourth quarter 2016) were likely not fixable from when concerns arose on the (second quarter 2016) earnings call,"" Becker said in the research note. ""The comps will be the most challenging for Southwest in (the first half of 2017), but the company is slowing capacity growth which should help to mitigate some of the issues.""Southwest sees adjusted Q4 unit costs rising 4%-5%, pushed up by the expected costs of proposed and amended union contracts, as well as ""the additional depreciation expense associated with accelerated retirement of the Company's Classic fleet (Boeing (BA) 737-300/-500 aircraft) to third quarter 2017.""Q3 earnings per share fell 1% to 93 cents, beating estimates for 88 cents, while revenue dropped 3% to $5.14 billion, missing views for $5.165 billion. Unit revenue fell 4.1%. Some of that likely came from a July outage in its technological infrastructure that caused some 2,000 flight cancellations.RELATED:JetBlue Warns On Q4, Spirit Sees Improving Unit RevenueDelta Delays Unit-Revenue Target But Vows Tight Capacity ControlAmerican Airlines Sees Thinner Margins, Alaska Air Trims Capacity
"
486,DAL,"JetBlue (JBLU) on Tuesday said Hurricane Matthew was likely to gouge unit revenue and costs during the fourth quarter, and the carrier reported mixed third-quarter results.The airline expect unit revenue for October to be down around 3.5%-4%, including a roughly 2-percentage-point impact from Hurricane Matthew.The storm affected October's unit revenue because it hit during the only travel peak during the month, JetBlue said on its third-quarter earnings call. However, the carrier said it has seen more strength in close-in bookings — or tickets booked closer to a flight's departure time — in recent weeks.JetBlue said unit costs excluding fuel and profit-sharing was likely to rise 4.5%-6.5%, with Hurricane Matthew adding ""approximately half a point"" to the increase. The company held to its full-year adjust unit cost guidance of flat to 1.5% growth.For the rest of the fourth quarter, JetBlue said it expected December's unit revenue to be the weakest for the three months during the quarter, due in part to the ""unfavorable Christmas calendar placement this year.""JetBlue said it expects fourth-quarter carrying capacity to rise 3%-5%, with full-year capacity up 8.5%-9%. In July, JetBlue forecast a 8%-9.5% capacity expansion for the year.The industry this quarter has been making strides at curbing capacity growth, which has spurred big cuts in fares last year and tanked unit revenue, which measures an airline's revenue as it relates to its overall flight capacity.Larger carriers have largely topped earnings forecasts, including Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL), American Airlines (AAL) and Alaska Air (ALK).JetBlue said it expects to take delivery of five Airbus (EADSY) A321 aircraft during the fourth quarter, with one of those configured for its premium Mint seating class, which offers lie-flat seats and faster check-in and boarding, among other things.JetBlue's recently revised purchase deal with Airbus would allow it to add 30 more A321s, some of which would offer the Mint service, over seven years. That deal also gives JetBlue the option to use a long-haul version of the jet that could, perhaps, allow it to offer flights to Europe.No decision on whether to actually offer flights to the Continent has been made publicly, and the matter did not come up during the earnings call on Tuesday. CEO Robin Hayes told the Wall Street Journal in July that JetBlue must decide by late next year if it wants the long-range plane, which could hit the market in 2019, the Journal said then.IBD'S TAKE: While JetBlue may or may not offer flights to Europe, transatlantic competition between the large U.S. network carriers and low-cost European carriers is heating up. To keep apace, Delta is weighing a variety of options. For the third quarter, the carrier reported mixed third-quarter results. Earnings per share of 58 cents were flat vs. a year earlier, missing estimates for 60 cents. Revenue rose 2.6% to $1.732 billion, just past expectations for $1.724 billion.Passenger unit revenue in the third quarter fell 4.7%; operating unit revenue fell 3.5%, better than in the second quarter.Shares closed down 3.6% to 18.07 in the stock market today, after briefly swinging to a gain earlier in the day.Meanwhile, low-fare, high-fee carrier Spirit Airlines (SAVE) said third-quarter total unit revenue fell 7%, an improvement from the second quarter. Q3's drop reflected a ""decrease in passenger yield as a result of industry competitive pricing pressures.""""Although yields decreased year over year, throughout the third quarter 2016, the Company saw sequential improvement in the rate of decline,"" Spirit said.Capacity rose 16.2%, showing more restraint than in Q2. Earnings per share fell 13.3% to $1.17, matching estimates, while revenue rose 8.1% to $621.3 million, topping estimates.Spirit Airlines stock rose 3.9% to 48.66.IBD's airline industry group has been climbing quickly.

"
487,DAL,"American Airlines (AAL) and Alaska Air Group (ALK) both reported third-quarter results that beat forecasts early Thursday, although American forecast thinner margins for the fourth quarter.American said its adjusted pretax margin in the fourth quarter would be around 4% to 6%, weaker than in prior quarters this year.The carrier also said it expected adjusted mainline unit costs to rise 8%-10% during the fourth quarter and 5%-7% for the entire year, in line with guidance given by the company this month. Those higher costs for the year reflect profit-sharing and the company's recent labor deals with a variety of employees.American said it expected full-year capacity to grow around 1.5%, in line with a forecast given earlier this month.For the third quarter, unit revenue fell 2.2%, while capacity grew 1.2%.The drop in unit revenue ""was due to competitive capacity growth, continued macroeconomic softness outside of the United States, and foreign currency weakness,"" American said.Unit revenue measures revenue as it relates to available seats and distance traveled, while capacity, broadly, measures available seats, flights and distance traveled.Wall Street has called for airlines to improve unit revenue by raising airfares and reining in flight capacity to align with passenger demand. Investors have focused on airlines' forecasts as to when unit revenue might turn positive and when capacity growth will become more restrained after cheap oil made airlines' expansion easier through last year.American's earnings per share fell 36% to $1.76, better than expectations for $1.69, on revenue down 1% $10.59 billion, above views for $10.54 billion.Still, investors showed concern over forecasts, and shares shaved off 4 cents to close at 40.59 on the stock market today.Meanwhile, Alaska Air Group said it expected fourth-quarter capacity growth of around 3%, far more restrained than in prior quarters. The company sees adjusted unit costs up roughly 0.5% during the fourth quarter.Unit revenue fell 4.4% during the third quarter. Earnings rose 2% to $2.20 a share, whereas analysts had expected a 3% drop to $2.09. Overall revenue climbed 3% to $1.566 billion, just topping views $1.561 billion.The company said it was ""fully focused"" on completing its merger with Virgin America (VA). The Justice Department has lengthened its review of that deal, announced in April, due to competitive concerns. There have been more indications recently that the deal would ultimately be approved.Shares rose 2.5% to 75.29.IBD'S TAKE: Low-cost carriers have dragged their bigger airlines into an airfare war in the U.S. and posed greater competition abroad. Delta Air Lines is considering a broad range of options to hold up against budget rivals in Europe. Delta Air Lines (DAL) and United Airlines (UAL) have already reported Q3 results. Delta was up 1.4% to 41.46 while United climbed 2% to 56.57. JetBlue (JBLU) picked up 2% to 18.60, while Southwest (LUV)ticked up 4 cents to 42.29.Southwest holds its third-quarter earnings call Wednesday, JetBlue on Tuesday.RELATED:Delta Delays Unit-Revenue Target But Vows Tight Capacity ControlUnited Sees Unit Revenue Improving In Q4 But Labor Pact To Lift Costs

488,DAL,"United Airlines' (UAL) on Monday said it expects to continue shoring up unit revenue during the fourth quarter, but new labor contracts will also drive up costs.The company expects consolidated passenger unit revenue to fall 4%-6% in Q4, largely marking an improvement from Q3's 5.8% drop and the bigger declines seen in Q2 and Q1.The Q3 unit-revenue decline was partly the result of the strong dollar, weakness in fare-pricing power and ""reductions from energy-related corporate travel,"" the company said.The carrier said it expects flight capacity to grow 1%-2% in Q4 vs. growth of 2% in Q3.United said that consolidated unit costs excluding special charges, third-party business expenses, fuel and profit sharing rose 3.4% during Q3. The increase, the company said, primarily reflected recent labor deals. The company anticipates those unit costs will be up 4.75%-5.75% during Q4.Earnings per share tumbled 31% in Q3 to $3.11, but that was better than the $3.06 analysts expected. Overall revenue fell 4% to $9.91 billion, just above views for $9.90 billion.United's conference call takes place on Tuesday.Shares fell 0.15% in extended trading in the stock market today. Delta Air Lines (DAL), which reported third-quarter results last week, closed down 1.7%. American Airlines (AAL), which reports Thursday, rose 0.3% after dipping 0.2% in regular trading.IBD'S TAKE: In addition to capacity concerns, analysts say the labor deals that airlines have made recently with employees could weigh on profits in the coming year.With oil prices rising, the cheap-fuel tailwind that kept airlines' profits aloft last year is fading. As with other airlines, Wall Street has been looking to see whether United could tighten flight-capacity growth and continue to improve unit revenue.Fare cuts, expansion and the stronger dollar have hurt unit revenue. But Delta has said that rising oil prices in the fourth quarter could prompt the airline industry to pass costs onto travelers — bad news for passengers but better news for the key metric, which measures revenue in relation to capacity.RELATED:Delta Delays Unit-Revenue Target But Vows Tight Capacity ControlDelta Eyes Trans-Atlantic Battle Vs. Low-Cost Rivals; No New Airline
"
489,DAL,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) on Thursday pushed back its target yet again for returning to positive unit-revenue growth, but its promise of greater capacity discipline appeared to please shareholders.The company during its third-quarter earnings call said higher fuel prices, more conservative capacity growth and improved ticket purchases made closer to departure time gave it greater hope that it could reverse the nearly two-year trend of falling unit revenue by early next year.Delta had previously said it would reach that goal by this summer, then pushed it back to the end of this year, and then hinted at some wiggle room on that.But management said it would keep next year's capacity growth -- broadly, an airline's supply of available seats -- ""in line with the December quarter's 1% growth level."" That's down from Q3 growth of 1.5%, Q2's 3.2% gain and Q1's 2.7% increase.The carrier also said it expected fourth-quarter unit revenue to fall 3% to 5%, an improvement from Q3's 6.8% drop.Delta shares were up 1.9% to 40.01 in the stock market today, finding support at their 50-day line after falling earlier. American Airlines (AAL) surged 5%, United Airlines (UAL) rallied 1.5%, and Southwest Airlines (LUV) gained 3.4%, with all three also reversing prior losses.IBD'S TAKE: In addition to capacity concerns, analysts say the labor deals airlines have made recently with employees could weigh on profits in the coming year.However, Delta's unit revenue for October, the first month of Q4, is likely to be weak, and November will likely do the heavy lifting during the period, management indicated on the call.Quirks in the calendar this year will also factor in.""We expect a negative impact due to the shift in Jewish holidays from September to October and Halloween falling on a Monday,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a recent research note. ""Business traffic the week of Oct. 31 shifts into November. We are also hearing that December might be challenged by Christmas falling on Sunday, resulting in return traffic being in January.""Unit revenue, an important metric that tallies revenue in relation to capacity, has fallen as airlines added flights and cut fares to compete with each other after oil prices fell. The stronger dollar and a basic imbalance of supply and demand haven't helped.As for the third quarter, earnings per share fell 2% to $1.70. That marked the first EPS decline in two years, but it wasn't as bad as anticipated; analysts expected EPS of $1.65. Overall revenue fell 6% to $10.48 billion.Q3 also suffered from an outage in August that resulted in 2,300 flight cancellations, and management during the call again apologized for the disruption.Delta's results come after a solid September for many airlines, and they appeared to raise prospects for its rivals. United reports quarterly results Oct. 18, American reports Oct. 20, and Southwest reports Oct. 28.RELATED:Alaska Air Sees Stronger Q3 Unit Revenue, JetBlue Holds OutlookCould Brexit Actually Help Airlines?

OPEC oil production jumped by 220,000 barrels per day in September, from August's rate of 33.39 million barrels per day. The Energy Information Administration reported that U.S. oil inventories surged by 4.85 million barrels in the prior week, well above the 300,000-barrel increase analysts expected. But gasoline supplies fell. U.S. crude production dipped 0.2%.Diamondback Energy (FANG) raised its 2016 production guidance and sees 2017 production up 30% vs. its updated 2016 expectations. Diamondback said it had been in acquisition talks, but no longer. Diamondback had been reported near a deal for Permian Basin-heavy Silver Hill Energy Partners, which on Thursday agreed to a $2.4 billion sale to RSP Permian (RSPP). Diamond stock rose nearly 7% for the week, hitting a record high.Extraction Oil & Gas (XOG)  became the first exploration and production company to go public in two years and rallied 15% in its trading debut. The company raised net proceeds of $594.1 million after offering 33.3 million shares, priced at 19 each, above the 15-18 range expected.Ulta Beauty raised its third-quarter and fiscal 2016 earnings estimates and predicted growth in the low 20s percentage range for 2017, 2018 and 2019. Ulta said only one-tenth of its online sales come from online-only shoppers, meaning that most still manage to find a way into a brick-and-mortar Ulta store, even if they're able to order items online. That may explain why Ulta is Amazon-resistant.Ulta Beauty shares soared 11% on Thursday, rebounding above their 50-day line for the first time since August, when Ulta gave slightly cautious earnings guidance.Delta Air Lines (DAL) forecast improved unit revenue for the fourth quarter and tighter capacity growth in 2017, while suggesting it would take a closer look at ways to compete internationally with low-cost carriers in Europe. American Airlines (AAL), United Airlines (UAL), which report next week, and Alaska Air Group (ALK) also got a lift from guidance that indicated more operational discipline after concerns about overexpansion. Solid monthly traffic results also came from Southwest (LUV) and Spirit Airlines (SAVE).RELATED:Delta Eyes Trans-Atlantic Battle Vs.

Shares plunged 25% the next day, to a five-month low. That follows big warnings on Q3 2015 and Q1 2016. Canaccord Genuity analyst Mark Massaro didn't help Illumina's cause when he said that after speaking with Illumina executives, they were ""still searching for answers to explain the miss."" He said a delayedsale of its high-end HiSeq X5 or X10 genome-sequencing system, likely to a China customer was one reason. These systems can cost $1 million-plus, so the sales cycles are long, often longer than expected. U.S. sales of the company's 2500/4000 line also drove the miss, says Massaro, who calls the weak U.S. outlook ""troubling.""The aluminum giant's Q3 EPS rose 52% to 32 cents, missing forecasts by 3 cents, as revenue dipped 6% to $5.21 billion, below expectations for $5.31 billion.

492,DAL,"After years of bargain fares and low fuel prices, U.S. airlines are likely to follow the lead of the second-largest carrier and curb growth next year in a tried-and-true effort to boost ticket prices.Delta Air Lines (DAL) will extend its modest capacity growth of 1% in the fourth quarter to all of 2017, with Chief Executive Ed Bastian citing ""the weakest revenue environment in recent memory.""Given that the U.S. economy continues to expand, albeit sluggishly, the meager seat growth anticipated next year is reminiscent of the industry's capacity slowdown after the 2008 financial crisis. For several years, U.S. carriers checked their growth as they maneuvered through the shoals of recession, high oil prices, and a wave of mergers.Keeping a tight grip on seat capacity is an airline's key to boosting airfares and overall financial returns. If the trend begun by Delta is writ large across the U.S. industry, 2017 capacity growth of about 3% will be the tightest in three years, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) analyst Jamie Baker wrote on Thursday in a client note.U.S. carriers are keen to reverse almost two years of declines in an industry metric known as passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM), a trend driven by capacity expansion and a profusion of low fares. (A seat mile is one seat flown one mile, the standard capacity gauge.) Delta's choice of a slow-growth 2017 will ""turn up the heat on American and United to demonstrate similar conviction"" to reverse unit revenue declines, Baker wrote.Delta shares have declined more than 21% this year, a steeper drop than those of its domestic rivals. The broader Bloomberg U.S. Airlines Index has slipped nearly 10% this year.Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research said Delta's quarterly report on Thursday was ""the first of a few positive earnings season data points we expect where network airlines guide to capacity growth of less than 2% next year. That is the core of the entire bull case on the sector.""Atlanta-based Delta closed up 74 cents, to $40.01, on Thursday in New York trading.IBD'S TAKE: Delta shares are trading below their 200-day moving average, free-falling after cracking a buy point in March off a cup-with-handle base. Delta holds a paltry 39 composite rating from IBD, putting it 14th the list of airline stocks, an industry that is ranked 143rd out of 197. But top-ranked carrier Hawaiian Airlines (HA) has managed to score a 91 composite rating out of a possible 99.With sales adjustments over the summer, Delta said it has already begun seeing fares rise for so-called ""close-in bookings"" made 21 days or sooner before travel. The widespread collapse of fare rules for tickets sold shortly before a flight — predominantly the domain of business travelers — has been one of the chief culprits in the industry's sliding unit revenues.The airlines also need higher fares as they confront new pressures in 2017 on their two biggest costs: fuel and people.Crude oil now trades around $50 per barrel, twice the price of just eight months ago. Delta and other carriers are expecting to pay even higher prices in the future. On top of that, several carriers will probably have higher wage costs if labor groups approve pending deals. Delta and its pilots recently concluded negotiations for a new four-year contract, with a 30% raise, Bloomberg News reported.Pilots at Southwest Airlines (LUV) are voting on a new agreement with a 29% pay hike, while pilots at United Airlines (UAL) have a contract provision that ties their income to whether their peers at Delta achieve more. Also this summer, Southwest and United reached tentative deals with flight attendants.For passengers, more storm clouds may be gathering next week, when American and United report their quarterly results and are likely to preview capacity plans for 2017.

493,DAL,"Domestic-focused airlines like Southwest (LUV) and JetBlue (JBLU) may largely evade an expected downturn in corporate travel that looks set to hit larger rivals like American Airlines (AAL), Delta Air Lines (DAL) and United Continental (UAL).In a Friday research note, Deutsche Bank analyst Michael Linenberg downgraded American, Delta, United and Hawaiian Holdings (HA) to hold from buy due to a slowdown in corporate profits that is typically a leading indicator of economic activity, as well as corporate travel.""The prevailing view is that we are in the latter stages of an economic cycle (April marks the 83rd month of U.S. GDP expansion, fourth longest on record) which is typically a period of underperformance for U.S. airline stocks,"" Linenberg said.Also, UBS analyst Darrly Genovesi said his Q1 EPS estimates are below analyst consensus, and cited data that books imply a 7% Q1 decline in carriers' unit revenue.United shares closed down 5.25% in the stock market today, despite falling oil prices. American lost 3.6%, Delta fell 3.4% and Hawaiian slipped 2.5%. Southwest dipped 0.5%, but JetBlue rallied 1%.On a brighter note, ""Consumer spending and housing, on the other hand, have fared better,"" Linenberg wrote, ""which should bolster demand for discretionary and leisure travel, at least through the summer.""Accordingly, Deutsche Bank analysts have favored ""domestic names that are less reliant on corporate travel"" -- specifically, Southwest, Alaska Air Group (ALK), JetBlue, Spirit Airlines (SAVE) and SkyWest (SKYW).Shares of Spirit fell 2%, Alaska Air Group ended flat, and SkyWest slumped 1%.Image provided by Shutterstock.

494,DAL,"Ahead of the anticipated release of March traffic data, several airline stocks -- including United Continental (UAL), Delta Air Lines (DAL), Southwest Airlines (LUV), Virgin America (VA)  and Ryanair (RYAAY) -- are all at or near buy points.Delta, often the first to release monthly traffic and capacity data, fell 1.3% to 48.68 in the stock market today. The stock tried but failed to stage a breakout from a cup-with-handle base with a 49.55 buy point earlier in the month, but it is presenting a new entry point at 50.60.The company said last week that Delta customers were among those killed in the March 22 terror attack at Brussels' Zaventem Airport. The airport said Thursday that it is ""technically ready"" to open again, according to an AFP report.European budget carrier Ryanair remains squarely in buy territory Thursday after breaking out last week from a cup-with-handle base with a 84.97 entry point, falling fractionally to 86.04 intraday. It uses Charleroi Airport, located an hour south of Brussels, which has become a key stop for air travelers while Zaventem remains closed, said Bloomberg. More than 90 of Ryanair's Thursday flights were canceled, however, due to strikes by French air traffic controllers.United shares rose less than 0.1% to 59.86, having formed a long, choppy base over the last year or so, with no clear entry point. But 61-62 has been a resistance area for the last several months.Meanwhile, Southwest shares were just shy of a 45.49 buy point mid-afternoon, down 0.4% to close at 44.80 after forming a cup-with-handle base since December. The carrier said Thursday that it is partnering with Lyft to reward Southwest loyalty program members who use the ride-sharing service for the first time.Virgin America rose as much as 39.18 intraday, edging it closer to an entry point of 39.30 from a cup base, though shares cooled to 38.56 at the close, up 0.2%. The stock has surged in recent days on reports that Virgin America has put itself for sale, and that JetBlue (JBLU) or Alaska Air Group (ALK) are suitors. Alaska Air broke out on March 11 and dipped 0.4% Thursday to 82.02, just below the top of the buy range at 82.52.

However,the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average remain poised above their 200-day moving averages and are trading near 2016 highs.Besides Alcoa, 14 other S&P 500 companies are expected to report results this week, including JPMorgan (JPM), BlackRock (BLK) and Delta Air Lines (DAL).Alcoa advanced 3.95% in regular trade on the stock market today. The bauxite miner and aluminum producer is a top-15 stock holding in Materials Select Sector SPDR (XLB). The company's products include fasteners used in the aerospace industry.Aggregate S&P 500 earnings per share for the first quarter are estimated at $26.17, representing a decline of 8.1% from the prior-year period; it's the third quarterly decline in a row, Lindsey Bell, senior analyst with S&P Global Market Intelligence, wrote in a Friday note.""Such a steep decline in growth hasn't been recorded since Q2 2009,"" she said.One analyst described Alcoa as less relevant to the U.S. economy and stock market than it once may have been.""The bottom line is that the relevance of Alcoa's results and outlook is fairly limited; it doesn’t tell us much beyond what may be useful for the broader industrial metals space,"" Sheraz Mian, research director at Zacks Investment Research, said in a Monday note.Results this week from railroad operator CSX (CSX) and industrial nuts-and-bolts supplier Fastenal (FAST) have a lot more relevance to the economically sensitive parts of the U.S. economy, he added.Mining stocks, including precious metals, shone Monday.

497,DAL,"Airline stocks on Thursday continued to falter for a third day after the terrorist attacks in Brussels. Oil prices were edging lower once again, which usually gives a boost to airlines, but the oil benefit wasn't strong enough to outweigh the current global travel fears.Let’s take a look at the charts of Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL), United Airlines (UAL), Southwest Airlines (LUV) and Alaska Air Group (ALK).Delta’s 2.2% drop put the stock further away from a cup-with-handle buy point it cleared in strong volume on Friday. Thursday’s volume was lighter than average. Shares are now trading 9% below their December peak.American fell 3.4% in above-average turnover. The stock breached support at the 200-day line and is now looking for support at the 50-day line. Shares are trading 24% below their 52-week high.United gapped down 3.2% in above-average volume. Shares are above their 200-day line, but the stock has moved more or less sideways for many months. It’s 15% below its 52-week peak.Southwest was also down for a third straight day, falling 0.8%, but it was able to pare its losses. Volume was light. The stock was trading 14% below its high and a potential buy point.And Alaska dropped 0.65% in lighter-than-average trade. Shares are still trading in buy range from a cup-with-handle base the stock broke out of earlier this month. Alaska is 7% below its December high.
"
498,DAL,"Most airline stocks were down on Wednesday, yet not by much, following Tuesday's terror attacks in Brussels. Airline stocks in general are making their way through -- or trying to emerge from -- consolidations.United Airlines (UAL) fell 1.2% to 59.74 in the stock market today, after finding resistance above 61 once again on Monday. The buy point is 61.97. Shares over the past month have moved above their 50-day and 200-day lines, both key tests of investor support. The all-time high was 74.52 on Jan. 26, 2015.Delta Air Lines (DAL) dropped below a 49.55 buy point on Tuesday following the Brussels attacks and continued to slip Wednesday. Shares lost 1% to 48.91, so the stock could still retake the buy point. On Friday and Monday, the shares started to break out from a cup-with-handle base begun in December.A week before Delta's attempt at a breakout, Alaska Air Group (ALK) delivered an uppercut through a 78.55 buy point of a cup-with-handle base and rose most of the way until dipping Tuesday and losing 1.1% to 81.12 on Wednesday. The stock is in buy range until 82.48. As with Delta, Alaska Air Group first began carving out the base in December. The stock still maintains a solid cushion from its 50-day and 200-day lines.Virgin America (VA) shares bolted 13.2% to 34.72 on reports that it might put all or part of itself up for sale, Bloomberg reported. Shares have consolidated since December, when they hit a 52-week high of 39.20.Southwest (LUV) is currently making its way through a cup base. Shares fell 0.3% to 44.43. That's still distant from a 51.44 buy point, though the stock could form a handle and thus create a lower buy area.Hawaiian Airlines (HA) cleared a consolidation last month and has been trading tightly since March 8. Shares rose 0.8%.Low-cost carrier Ryanair (RYAAY), which is based in Ireland and has flight routes throughout Europe, continues to work on a cup-with-handle base with an entry point of 84.71. Shares rose 1% to 83.75.While Tuesday's attacks and concerns about the impact on air travel going forward are negative factors for airline stocks, oil prices fell Wednesday amid higher inventories. That bodes well for carriers' jet fuel costs. S&P Capital IQ analysts see oil staying depressed in a new research note.""We think that oil prices are likely to remain lower for longer than many investors and experts are currently thinking. ... This is a great cost environment for the U.S. airline industry.""

499,DAL,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) could consider all types of fare levels and new cabin setups on lucrative trans-Atlantic flights to compete with low-cost European carriers, but won't launch a new airline, the company said Thursday.The carrier said it's cutting trans-Atlantic capacity 3%-4% due in part to the competition from those low-cost rivals.When asked during a conference call if Delta's response would include offering a basic economy option on international flights, the company indicated that ""all kinds of fare products"" and ""cabins we don't have today"" could be on the table.The comments came amid what Delta characterized Thursday as its ""weakest unit revenue environment in recent memory"" and intensifying challenges for U.S. airlines in the trans-Atlantic market.Just a few years ago, the top U.S. airlines were complaining about high-end Persian Gulf airlines like Emirates and Etihad taking market share unfairly on U.S.-Europe flights. Now, the threat is increased long-haul offerings from discount overseas carriers. And in the U.S., JetBlue (JBLU) is also entertaining the idea of flying to the Continent.But Delta ruled out creating a new airline that might be devoted to stepping up competition overseas, similar to the way Lufthansa's Eurowings airline competes in the low-cost market.""We have no intent to create an airline within an airline,"" CEO Ed Bastian said in response to a question from an analyst.Delta shares rallied 1.9% to close at 40.01 on the stock market today. United Airlines (UAL) rose 1.5%, and American Airlines (AAL) jumped 5%. JetBlue added 2.5%.IBD'S TAKE: In addition to capacity concerns, analysts say the labor deals airlines have made recently with employees could weigh on profits in the coming year.In the U.S., low-cost carriers moved into markets left vacant by rivals after a big merger wave a decade ago. Last year, no-frills Spirit Airlines (SAVE) dragged rivals into an airfare war that hurt unit revenue industrywide.But rather than cede that segment of the market, all three U.S. network carriers — Delta, United and American — have rolled out or plan to roll out a basic economy fare class to compete head on.Delta's management declined to speculate on how broader U.S. competition with ""basic economy"" would affect pricing trends.Basic economy was a focus elsewhere during the call. JPMorgan analyst Jamie Baker, saying that his employer does not permit him to buy basic economy tickets, asked if that was common for large corporations.""It's not uncommon for employers to wall that fare product off,"" Delta President Glen Hauenstein said, later characterizing it as ""a significant number ""of major U.S. corporations.RELATED:Alaska Air Sees Stronger Q3 Unit Revenue, JetBlue Holds OutlookCould Brexit Actually Help Airlines?

"
501,DAL,"When Delta Air Lines (DAL) reports third-quarter results on Thursday, Wall Street's focus, as it has been for much of this year, will likely be on unit revenue and when exactly the carrier can push the key metric into positive territory.Meanwhile, as the benefits from cheap oil fade, analysts expect Delta's earnings per share to fall 3% to $1.68, which would be the first year-over-year drop since Q3 2014. Revenue is expected to be down around 5% to $10.6 billion.The carrier has said it wants to be the first network carrier to return to positive unit revenue growth this year. But management has pushed back the date for when it expects to do that.Unit revenue measures revenue as it relates to an airline's flight coverage, seats on flights and distance traveled. After cheap oil provided a massive cost windfall for airlines, that measure has fallen as airlines expanded -- too much so, at times -- and cut fares in some markets while the dollar also strengthened.In September, however, Delta said that passenger unit revenue in September strengthened from the prior two months. That month, Delta's CFO also said that potentially higher fuel costs in the fourth quarter could prompt the industry to pass on more costs to travelers.Delta has said it expects a Q3 unit-revenue decline of around 7%, with around 1 percentage point coming from an outage in August that resulted in more than 2,000 flight cancellations. Three months ago, Delta projected a 4%-6% drop in unit revenue for the quarter.Delta's traffic results in July and August was hurt by the outage, weakness in close-in bookings, and overcapacity in the Transatlantic. Airlines have vowed to tighten capacity growth in an attempt to align it with passenger demand.But on Monday, Delta said it will begin daily nonstop service from Los Angeles International Airport to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in April.IBD'S TAKE: In addition to capacity concerns, analysts say the labor deals airlines have made recently with employees could weigh on profits in the coming year.Broader concerns about terrorism and the Zika virus have also hurt shares of Delta and industry rivals like American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL). Southwest's (LUV) Q3 guidance also got dinged by its own issues with flight cancellations.But after a tumultuous summer, October has presented its own problems for the industry. Hurricane Matthew has prompted around 4,500 airline flight cancellations, Cowen & Co. said in a research note on Monday, citing data from FlightAware.However, such storms have actually helped passenger unit revenue but not earnings, Cowen said.""If the market were to be true to recent trading patterns an improved near-term unit revenue outlook as a result of the storms should be beneficial to stocks,"" the firm said.Delta shares closed up 2.1% at 39.77 in the stock market today. American rose 3.1%, United added 2.6%, and Southwest rallied 3.4%, nearing its 200-day average.United reports quarterly results Oct. 18, American reports Oct. 20 and Southwest reports Oct. 28.RELATED:Here's How Much 'Brexit' Will Hurt American, Delta And United AirUnited Airlines 'Aggression' Seen With Kirby; Hawaiian Tries Breakout

502,DAL,"Alaska Air Group (ALK) forecast third-quarter unit revenue that was better than the prior two quarters, making the company the latest airline to signal improvement in the key metric.In an investor update dated Tuesday, the carrier forecast a unit-revenue drop of 4.5%, stronger than the second quarter's 6.4% slide and a first-quarter decrease of 6.1%. The company also forecast slightly lower unit costs.Unit revenue measures an airline's revenue in relation to flight capacity. It has fallen after airlines aggressively expanded during the oil crash.Meanwhile, JetBlue (JBLU) on Wednesday reported improved preliminary unit revenue for September but held to its third-quarter unit revenue forecast for a 3%-4% decline.Preliminary unit revenue for the month fell around 2%, JetBlue said, compared to a roughly 5.5% drop in August. Traffic in September rose 10.8%, outpacing capacity growth of 7.9%.Shares of Alaska Air Group rose 1.6% to 70.43 on the stock market today, emerging above their 200-day line.JetBlue fell 0.5% to 17.79 after rising as high as 18.29 intraday. JetBlue has been trying to regain its 200-day line after finding support at the 50-day line through much of September. JetBlue reports third-quarter results on Oct. 25.The figures from Alaska and JetBlue come after more upbeat forecasts issued Tuesday from American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL). Southwest (LUV) and Spirit Airlines (SAVE) on Tuesday also reported traffic growth in September that outpaced capacity growth.Wall Street has wanted airlines to align their flight capacity with passenger demand, hoping that doing so would keep unit revenue from falling.IBD'S TAKE: With concerns related to terrorism, the Zika virus and capacity, most airline stocks have had a bumpy ride this summer and haven't had a chance to form bases from which to break out.

504,DAL,"American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) on Tuesday forecast improved third-quarter unit revenue, sending shares higher as the industry heads into earnings season.The figures come after Delta Air Lines (DAL) last week also reported unit revenue for the month of September that strengthened from a rough prior two months, which included an outage in August that forced the carrier to cancel 2,300 flights. Delta kicks off third-quarter earnings for the industry on Thursday.Wall Street will now be looking for airlines to carry September's momentum into the fourth quarter, after nearly two years of decreasing unit revenue as airlines used a cheap-oil windfall as an opportunity to expand.American Airlines said it expected Q3's total unit revenue to fall roughly 2%-3%, better than a 3%-5% decline forecast last month. The company also boosted its pretax margin forecast for the quarter — it now expects 13%-15% margins, as opposed to 12%-14% margins forecast in September.The carrier said it expects full-year carrying capacity — an airline's supply of seats and flights — to be up roughly 1.5%. In July, the carrier forecast 2% growth and, in April, forecast a 2.5% increase.Investors have hoped that airlines would trim capacity growth to align it more with demand, a move that would help airlines get more money out of passengers and improve unit revenue, which measures revenue in relation to capacity.American said it expected full-year unit costs for to be up roughly 5%-7%, reflecting labor deals struck with employees.For September, passenger traffic fell 1.7%, while capacity fell 0.4%.American Airlines' shares reversed lower after early gains, closing down 1.7% in the stock market today. The stock recently found support at its 50-day line. American reports third-quarter results on Oct. 20. Delta shares dropped 2.1%.Meanwhile, United Airlines said it expected a third-quarter consolidated unit revenue drop of 5.5%-6.0%, compared to an outlook for a 5.5%-7.5% decline given in September.The improvement, the company said, was largely helped by ""better than expected September close-in bookings driven by the timing of certain holidays."" Still, the stronger dollar, competition, weaker demand and ""travel reductions from customers impacted by lower oil prices"" weighed on unit revenue.United fell 1.25% on Tuesday, also giving up early gains.Southwest (LUV), which like Delta suffered from infrastructure problems during the quarter, said it continues to expect third-quarter unit revenue to fall 3.5%-4.5%. Around 0.5 percentage point of that drop is expected to come from an outage in July that caused around 2,000 flight cancellations.However, traffic rose 7.9% in September, outpacing a 6% rise in capacity. Southwest's stock got a lift last month after it said it would constrain capacity next year.Shares finished less than 0.1% higher.IBD'S TAKE: With concerns related to terrorism, the Zika virus and capacity, most airline stocks have had a bumpy ride this summer and haven't had a chance to form bases from which to break out. Things could be a bit better in the medical sector.Spirit Airlines (SAVE), the ultra-low-cost carrier that helped draw its bigger U.S. rivals into an airfare war last year that damaged unit revenue, said September traffic rose 15.2%, outpacing capacity growth of 14.4%.Shares dropped 1.8% on Tuesday.Hurricane Matthew's financial impact on the airlines this month is not yet clear, but November is expected to be a good month due to Thanksgiving travel. But the timing of some holidays remains a concern.""In recent discussions with airlines, they cited concerns over a calendar shift,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note.""We expect a negative impact due to the shift in Jewish holidays from September to October and Halloween falling on a Monday,"" she continued. ""Business traffic the week of Oct. 31 shifts into November. We are also hearing that December might be challenged by Christmas falling on Sunday, resulting in return traffic being in January.""RELATED:United Airlines 'Aggression' Seen With Kirby; Hawaiian Tries BreakoutCould Brexit Actually Help Airlines?

506,DAL,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) on Tuesday said consolidated passenger unit-revenue in September improved from the quarter's prior two months, and the carrier said adjusted unit costs for the third quarter were likely better than anticipated.The month's results come as third-quarter earnings season looms for the airline industry. The industry for some two years has contended with falling unit revenue, which measures revenue from passengers as it relates to available seats on flights and distance traveled.The numbers also cap a quarter in which Delta and other airlines dealt with concerns over terrorism, the Zika virus and their own technology. Delta Air Lines had to cancel 2,300 flights in August after a small fire at a power switch caused a massive outage. Southwest Airlines' (LUV) third-quarter unit-revenue forecast also took a hit after an outage prompted the cancellations of some 2,000 flights in July.Delta on Tuesday said September consolidated passenger unit revenue fell 3%. The company said ""close-in domestic yield pressures moderated slightly with the implementation of lower Fall capacity levels."" Delta also said it continues to deal with ""a supply-demand imbalance"" in the trans-Atlantic region.Investors have wanted airlines to rein in flight-capacity growth to align more with demand. Expansion and fare competition during the cheap-oil boom, along with a stronger dollar that has hurt international demand, have weighed on unit revenue.At the beginning of the quarter, a 7% unit-revenue drop in July made some investors wonder if Delta could hit the unit-revenue target it gave when it reported second-quarter earnings. Then the outage, in part, brought a 9.5% drop in August.But Delta on Tuesday said ""cost discipline and productivity efforts"" enabled it to deal with cost issues associated with the outage. Delta said it expects unit costs excluding some expenses to be roughly flat for the third quarter, compared with an earlier forecast for ""flat to up 1%.""The company on Tuesday also stuck with its third-quarter unit-revenue forecast -- a decline around 7%, with around 1 percentage point of that coming from the outage. In July, Delta had forecast a Q3 unit-revenue decline of 4%-6%.The company said carrying capacity likely rose around 1.5% during the quarter, with operating margin at 18%-19%. Those forecasts were also in line with guidance given last month.Passenger traffic during September rose 1.4%, with capacity up 1.8%, Delta said.Delta shares ended the trading day up 0.4% to 40.15 on the stock market today, still well off 52-week highs.United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) also got an early boost from the numbers. United Airlines rose 0.9% to 53.73 while American Airlines reversed to trade down 0.2% to 37.63.Southwest fell 1.5% 39.16.Recent labor pacts with other airlines could upend Southwest's less-generous tentative pact with its pilots. Delta on Friday announced an agreement in principle with its pilots union for a pay raise that was higher than the one negotiated at Southwest, Southwest's union said, according to Bloomberg.IBD'S TAKE: Analysts say the labor deals airlines have made recently with employees could weigh on profits in the coming year.

508,DAL,"United Airlines (UAL), American Airlines (AAL), Priceline (PCLN) and other travel-related stocks dropped Tuesday after terrorist attacks at Brussels' Zaventem airport and a subway station killed more than 30.There weren’t creditable threats to any U.S airport but security was heightened in New York, Washington and other major cities.Some train stations around Brussels reopened late Tuesday but the airport will remain closed until Thursday, as one suspect remains at large. The Islamic State took responsibility for the attacks, which seriously wounded at least three Americans.United said that its flight from Washington Dulles to Brussels deplaned normally at the gate and a second flight from Newark Liberty was rerouted to another location. All remaining flights were canceled.United shares closed down 1.1% in the stock market today, paring back steeper, early losses. American shares fell 1.6%. Travel booking site Priceline lost 2.3%. Cruise lines Carnival (CCL), Royal Caribbean (RCL) and Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) all sold off 2% or more.Ryanair (RYAAY) canceled all flights to Zaventem, but flights were still operating to Charleroi Airport near Brussels with delays, while Delta Air Lines (DAL) diverted a flight to Amsterdam.U.S.-listed shares of Ryanair shares fell 1%. Delta shares dropped 1.5%.Savanthi Syth, a vice president of equity research at Raymond James, said in a note that it was too early to tell the impact the attacks will have on air travel but that the attacks came during peak Easter travel and ahead of summer travel.Syth said Ryanair has the greatest exposure to the Brussels market while United has the largest exposure of U.S. carriers followed by Delta.“While domestic U.S. airlines are not directly exposed, there may be knock-on impacts via code-share partners and potential pressure on domestic pricing from any fall off in connecting demand.”Starwood Hotel (HOT) said all of its hotels in the city were on lockdown. Starwood shares dipped 0.4%.Travel stocks had a similar reaction after the Paris attacks last year. But analysts didn’t expect overall travel demand to take a long-term hit.Airlines were busy again within a few weeks after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, the 2002 nightclub bombing in Bali, Indonesia, as well as the transit bombings in Madrid in 2004 and London in 2005.Still, the current refugee crisis and ramp-up in the fight against the Islamic State could weigh on travelers’ decisions.
"
509,DAL,"Alaska Air Group's (ALK) takeover of Virgin America (VA) allows it to expand on the West Coast, where it competes aggressively with Delta Air Lines (DAL) in Seattle, but it also inherits Virgin's struggles to stay abreast of an industry unafraid to cut fares or borrow from its in-flight panache.Alaska Air on Monday said it would buy Virgin for $57 a share, or $2.6 billion, beating out rival bidder JetBlue (JBLU). The deal is expected to close by Jan. 1, 2017.Virgin America shares soared 41.7% to 55.12. Alaska fell 3.8%, and JetBlue dropped 4.3%.Analysts said the lesson for Virgin, which launched nearly a decade ago with plans to restore glamour to a utilitarian, consolidation-prone industry, is that in-flight atmosphere isn't everything.""This was an airline that never really found its footing in terms of profitability,"" said Seth Kaplan, managing partner at Airline Weekly. ""It's been sustainable over the past few years just because the tide is so high in the U.S. that you can be the least profitable airline and still be profitable in global terms.""The deal comes after Virgin's profitability has soared on low fuel costs. But earnings still lagged other carriers' as Virgin struggled to compete against lower-cost airlines. For example, it had said it would not lower fares in the highly competitive Dallas region.But despite the popularity of Virgin's mood-lighting and in-flight entertainment, the lounge-like setting was perhaps a bit too lavish for customers who just wanted more affordable airfares.""That made it impossible for them to ever be all that profitable in short-haul markets,"" Kaplan said.It's unclear what will become of Virgin America. Alaska Air said on a conference call that the Alaska brand would stay and that they wanted to ""learn more"" about the Virgin America brand for potential future use.Kaplan said that Alaska's stronger balance sheet gives it flexibility to step up its business-class offerings or stick with what it has. Alaska is unlikely to bring premium products to shorter flights, he said, but it's also unlikely to gut what's made Virgin a well-liked airline.For Alaska, which has been growing capacity aggressively in recent years, the deal expands its West Coast transcontinental flights. Kaplan also called it a defensive move to keep JetBlue at bay in the region.The deal boosts Alaska's scale, negotiating power and efficiency, and aligns with its broader plans to expand coverage, Loizos Heracleous, a professor at Warwick Business School and airline researcher, told IBD.Regulatory concerns are likely to be minimal, given the carriers' similarities and relatively small sizes, he added.But the deal raises questions about whether Alaska overpaid. Alaska's agreement to buy Virgin at $57 a share is 46% higher than Virgin's closing price Friday and 86% higher than the price on March 22, a day before Bloomberg reported Virgin was considering putting itself up for sale.Kaplan said that the price tag is ""very high for an airline that's not all that successful compared to most of its peers."" Heracleous said the bidding war raised the price to levels that will make it hard for Alaska to garner benefits that can justify the price, at least in the short-term.The move would also present challenges in Dallas, where Southwest (LUV) reigns supreme, American Airlines (AAL) has struggled to compete, and Virgin has gotten killed.""Alaska's going to have to make some decisions about whether to double down or do something different there, or tolerate it or get out and find somebody else to take the gates,"" Kaplan said.Still, analysts say it was the right time to cash in. While most profitable airlines had either a strong network or low costs, Virgin had neither of those.""If you don't have very low costs, you're just not going to generate the revenue premiums from the corporate travel community that you need when your network is inferior, when you don't have as many flights,"" Kaplan said. ""I don't care how much mood-lighting you have.""Image provided by Shutterstock.

510,DAL,"The two hedge funds that criticized United Airlines’ (UAL)  board appointments last week decided to air their complaints publicly after the air carrier resisted making former Continental Airlines CEO Gordon Bethune its chairman, derailing months-long negotiations between the parties, according to a Reuters report Monday.Those funds, Altimeter Capital Management and PAR Capital Management, also object to United's plans to make CEO Oscar Munoz chairman by next year and felt that the board’s move to give Munoz a $12 million signing bonus ""should have been tied to performance goals,"" Reuters said.The talks between United and the funds broke off this month, Reuters said. The fight over United's board, if it continues, could complicate Munoz's full-time return to his duties as CEO, which was set for Monday.After only weeks on the job, Munoz suffered a heart attack last year and was put on medical leave. Munoz became CEO after Jeff Smisek stepped down from the post in September amid a U.S. investigation into possible corruption involving United's relationship with the former chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.The report comes after United last Monday added three new independent directors to its board -- including a former COO of Delta Air Lines (DAL) and a former CEO of Air Canada -- with plans to add a fourth soon. The appointments expanded the board to 15 members, from 12.A day later, the two hedge funds, which combined have a roughly 7.1% stake in United, wrote the board a letter that called the appointments ""desperate ... a transparent and cynical attempt to maintain your official privileges and power."" The funds said that they would nominate six board candidates, headed by Bethune, at United's 2016 annual shareholder meeting.The funds said that they intended their decision to ""give United stockholders the opportunity to elect the board they deserve.""The funds also said, “Meaningful change to United’s existing board of directors is urgently required in order to reverse long-standing poor board governance and the resulting many years of substantial and inexcusable company underperformance relative to United’s competitors.”United has called the funds' planned nominations ""hostile,"" said that it had “repeatedly” expressed willingness to change its board, and added that the funds “refused to cooperate in making their nominees available to be interviewed.”Despite their conflicts, the funds and United would consider a settlement to head off a vote on the funds' board nominees, Reuters reported Monday.Bethune was Continental's CEO from 1994 to 2004. United agreed to merge with Continental in 2010. Low fuel costs have padded the company's profits, and United has touted improvements in its on-time performance. But the company had struggled to keep pace with rivals Delta and American Airlines (AAL).United shares are down 13% over the past 12 months but have risen since February, finding support at their 50-day and 200-day lines. Shares rose 1.1% to 58.98 in the stock market today.Delta rose 0.4% to 47.89. American ticked up 0.3% to 42.59.

They also come as United's front office tries to keep investors happy and reverse a pattern of being upstaged by rivals American Airlines (AAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL).The three new directors bring with them considerable experience in the finance, airline and tech industries.James Kennedy is a former CEO of T.

Delta dipped 0.6%, and  American rose 1.2%.Munoz, who suffered the heart attack after only about a month on the job, ""has already been participating actively in all major corporate decisions,"" the company said in a statement Sunday. He had been meeting with investors as of at least February, according to a Cowen research note.Brett Hart had been serving as acting chief executive. Jeff Smisek, Munoz's predecessor, stepped down last year amid a U.S. investigation into potential improper favor exchanges between United and the former chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.United last month said that it had expected to accelerate its share repurchase program in the first quarter, a day after Delta announced a similar move. United also recently changed its board-nomination process to give some shareholders more power to nominate board members -- something that only board members had the authority to do in the past, according to Wolfe Research.""We are always looking at ways to enhance corporate governance at United,"" Henry L. Meyer, non-executive chairman, said in a statement Monday. ""For some time, the board has been evaluating potential director candidates with the assistance of a leading search firm and with the benefit of shareholder input.""""It is obvious there is a newfound sense of urgency at UAL, which we could clearly see when we went out there two weeks ago with investors,"" Wolfe Research analyst Hunter Keay said in a research note last month.""CEO Oscar Munoz was fired up about making changes not only by bringing in fresh blood but creating a sense of urgency and transforming UAL into a ‘meritocracy’ where people get promoted based on merit, not familiarity.""In announcing the board changes, United also touted what it said were ""significant improvements"" in on-time performance in recent months despite harsh winter weather -- an area where it has lagged behind its other major rivals. United, like others, has also made small improvements to in-flight experience. Also like others, its profits have been greatly assisted by low oil prices.Still, labor relations remain contentious. United's mechanics rejected a proposed contract last month, although the air carrier had reached a tentative contract-extension deal with its dispatchers.

""To meet the extra demand, airlines are deploying new and larger aircraft on many flights.""Airlines also increased staff last year by more than 10,000 vs. the prior year, according to the group.The airline industry has attempted to tame capacity growth after low fuel prices and Southwest's (LUV) expansion last year drove aggressive competition, pushing down airfares and unit revenue and increasing concern among investors who worried the trend was unsustainable.But many airlines reported higher capacity for last month and lower load factor -- a measure of an airline's ability to fill seats. Capacity growth has largely outpaced traffic growth for many airlines.On Wednesday, Virgin America (VA) said February capacity leapt 21.3% as traffic jumped 20.9%. Load factor dipped to 78.9% from 79.2% a year ago.Shares of JetBlue closed up 0.9% in the stock market today after sinking 9% Tuesday. United rallied 2%, American rose 2.2%, Delta added 1.1%, and Southwest climbed 1.8%. Virgin America rose 1.5%.Image provided by Shutterstock.

518,DAL,"Activist investors Altimeter Capital Management and PAR Capital Management on Tuesday said they would nominate six candidates to United Airlines’ (UAL) board of directors later this year, blasting the airline's directorship appointments a day earlier as a rushed, ""cynical attempt to preserve power by this entrenched board.""The wrangling over United's board is the latest jolt in what has been a bumpy ride at the company's corporate level, and comes amid the company's attempts to better compete with rivals Delta Air Lines (DAL) and American Airlines (AAL).United called the funds' move a ""hostile action"" that could take focus away from CEO Oscar Munoz's plan to turn the company around as he prepares to return to work full-time on March 14. Munoz suffered a heart attack in October, forcing him to take medical leave.United shares closed down 2.2% in the stock market today. Delta dropped 4.5%, and American slipped 3.2%.The two hedge funds -- longtime United investors that, combined, own around 7.1% of the company's stock -- said in a letter Tuesday that ""meaningful change to United's existing board of directors is urgently required in order to reverse long-standing poor board governance and the resulting many years of substantial and inexcusable company underperformance relative to United's competitors.""They also said that despite weeks of talks over changes to the board, United ""hurriedly added"" three new directors and expanded the board to 15 from 12.United argued that it ""repeatedly"" expressed an openness to changing the company's board, offered to extend its March 12 director nomination deadline, and said the funds ""refused to cooperate in making their nominees available to be interviewed.""The company also defended the three independent directors named yesterday as having ""deep relevant experience"" and backed the airline, citing last year's sky-high profits and improved on-time performance.Altimeter and PAR said they would nominate their candidates at United's annual stockholder meeting this year. They are Gordon Bethune, a former CEO of Continental Airlines and a board member of aerospace tech firm Honeywell (HON); Altimeter founder Brad Gerstner; Tina Sharkey, the CEO of SherpaFoundry; Barney Harford, former CEO of travel site Orbitz; Rodney O'Neal, ex-CEO of Delphi Automotive; and Brenda Yester Baty, the strategic initiatives chief at Lennar (LEN).Even as the fight among the suits escalated, United continued, as other airlines have, to quietly reinvest in making flying more pleasant.The company on Tuesday said it would retire its 747 fleet from scheduled service by the end of 2018. It also ordered 25 Boeing (BA) 737-700 planes, adding to an earlier order of 40 such aircraft. United is set to have the planes delivered at the end of next year.United seeks to shrink its regional fleet of 50-seat aircraft, and the 737s are bigger and more fuel-efficient planes.Those will have bigger overhead bins, along with an interior that ""creates a larger sense of space through sculpted sidewall panels and LED cabin lighting that mimics soft blue skies and sunset colors.""The orders continue a shift among the bigger carriers away from smaller jets. That trend, the Wall Street Journal noted, contributed to regional carrier Republic Airways’ (RJET) filing for bankruptcy protection last month.Image provided by Shutterstock.

Southwest Airlines (LUV) and United Continental (UAL) are the fresh faces. The carriers' shares are recovering from sharp price declines that began around the end of last year. All started climbing back…

522,DAL,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) shares fell as the major carrier said consolidated passenger unit revenue (PRASM) fell 5.5% in February. Meanwhile, Alaska Air (ALK) initially dipped after reporting that capacity growth is still outstripping traffic growth.But Delta and Alaska stock charts are still acting well.Delta shares fell 0.7% on the stock market today to 48.55, closing near session highs. The stock is still working on a handle in its cup-with-handle base with a 49.55 buy point. Shares retook their key 50-day moving average on Feb. 22. Prior to that, shares had largely been in a period of consolidation following two failed breakouts in late 2015.Traffic rose 5.3% for the month, slightly less than the 6% capacity growth it logged in February. Load factor fell from 80.3% to 79.7%.Delta also reported an 86.4% on-time performance rate and mainline completion factor of 99.6%.""Across all entities, booking trends into the peak leisure season are strong and corporate demand remains solid as higher volumes continued to offset lower yields,"" said the company in a release.Delta, American Airlines (AAL), United Continental (UAL) and JetBlue (JBLU) have all recently hiked airfares.Separately, Alaska Air on Wednesday reported a 13.8% increase in traffic -- i.e., revenue passenger miles (RPM). But capacity swelled 18% as measured in available seat miles (ASM). Load factor fell 3 points to 80.4%, said the company.Several other carriers, including Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines (LUV), late last year trimmed ambitious expansion plans amid capacity concerns.Alaska Air stock fell in the morning, but rose 0.25% at the close. The stock has been forming a deep cup base since December, with shares climbing comfortably above the key 200-day level on Tuesday after finding support at the 50-day moving average on Feb. 24.United shares fell 0.8%, JetBlue shares rose 0.45% and Southwest Air 1.3%.RELATED:Why Delta Air Lines Is Accelerating Its Stock Buyback In Q1
"
523,DAL,"Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL), and United Airlines (UAL) sold off after Air France-KLM became the latest air carrier to express caution over potential lower airfares and unit revenue.The French-Dutch carrier warned Wednesday of a ""a high level of uncertainty"" amid broader industry concerns about oil prices and a tough foreign exchange environment.On Tuesday, German carrier Lufthansa said it could face lower airfares and that it would rein in its expansion.Delta slid 3.5% in the stock market today. American dropped 4%, and United fell 3.35%. Irish budget carrier Ryanair (RYAAY), however, crept up less than 0.1%.The declines come after a round of similar warnings during the airline industry's earnings season, much of which took place last month.Delta, for instance, expressed uncertainty over how long cheap oil -- and thus the industry's recent wave of quarterly profits -- could last. The company said it would cut carrying capacity if needed to improve unit revenue, a measure of how much an airline makes relative to how much capacity it has.The key metric is often a window into ticket prices and has generally fallen as airlines expanded over the last year or so. Investors and analysts have been watching for signals as to when airlines might be able to turn unit revenue around.Elsewhere, American also said last month that it expected lower unit revenue following “competitive capacity growth,” while United also said it would temper its growth plans.Other discount and regional carriers sold off as well. Southwest (LUV) dropped 3.4%, while low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines (SAVE) fell 4.2%. JetBlue (JBLU) eased 3%. Alaska Air Group (ALK), which recently announced the purchase of Virgin America (VA), was down 1.9%.
"
524,DAL,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) and Alaska Air (ALK) saw traffic gains outstrip capacity growth last month, as the airline sector tries to weather renewed warnings on over-expansion.Delta said Tuesday that consolidated passenger unit revenue fell 4% in April. But total system traffic, as measured by revenue passenger miles, rose 2.7%, while as capacity, measured by available seat miles, grew 2.5%.Delta Air Lines had last month projected a year-over-year 2.5%-4.5% passenger unit revenue decline in its second quarter, which would mark an improvement from its Q1 decline of of -4.6%. Capacity is expected to rise 2%-3% during the June quarter.Delta shares closed up 1.8% on the stock market today. The carrier's stock has been sinking since reporting March-quarter results on April 14, breaking support at both its 50-day and 200-day key levels.Alaska, which is buying Virgin America (VA) for $2.6 billion, said April traffic climbed 11.% as capacity grew 10.4%.Shares of Alaska ended virtually unchanged. American Airlines (AAL) edged up 0.2%. United Airlines (UAL) rose 1.2%. Southwest (LUV) shares slipped 2%. American, United and Southwest are all due to report April traffic figures over the next couple of weeks.Oil prices retreated again on Tuesday. That should be good news for airlines, absent fuel hedges, but crude futures are falling in large part on global growth concerns that could affect travel.Meanwhile, Deutsche Lufthansa said Tuesday that it is seeing ""significant pricing pressure"" at its passenger and cargo lines, but that unit cost cuts have ""more than made up for pricing declines."" The German carrier is in the midst of restructuring.RELATED:Delta Air Lines Eyes End Of Cheap Oil, Capacity Cuts.

525,DAL,"Billionaire George Soros prepared last quarter for gloomy times, dialing back his U.S. stock investments by more than a third, betting against the equities while banking on gold.The value of Soros Fund Management’s publicly disclosed holdings dropped by 37% to $3.5 billion as of the end of March, according to a government filing Monday. The firm disclosed owning bearish options contracts on 2.1 million shares of the SPDR 500 ETF Trust (SPY), an exchange-traded fund that tracks the Standard & Poor’s 500 index, with a face value of $431 million as of March 31.Soros also bought bullish options contracts on 1.05 million shares in the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD), which tracks the price of bullion. What’s more, the fund took a stake in the world’s biggest producer of the metal, Barrick Gold (ABX), worth $264 million at the end of March, the filing showed. Soros acquired 1.7% of Barrick, making it the fund’s biggest U.S.-listed holding.Soros, who built a $24 billion fortune through savvy market wagers, has warned of risks stemming from China, arguing that its debt-fueled economy resembles the U.S. in 2007-08 at the onset of the global financial crisis. In January, the former hedge fund manager turned philanthropist said a hard landing in the Asian nation was “practically unavoidable,” adding that such a slump would worsen global deflationary pressures, drag down stocks and boost U.S. government bonds.Soros’ former chief strategist, billionaire investor Stan Druckenmiller, is also bullish on gold. Earlier this month he called the yellow metal his largest currency allocation as central bankers experiment with the “absurd notion of negative interest rates.”Gold for immediate delivery jumped 16% in the first three months of the year, the biggest quarterly surge since 1986, according to Bloomberg generic pricing. Shares of Toronto-based Barrick have more than doubled this year as the miner accelerates cost-cutting efforts and reduces debt. Barrick is up 39% since March 31.Soros returned money to outside investors five years ago and his New York-based firm now manages his own wealth. Michael Vachon, a spokesman for Soros, declined to comment on the firm’s holdings.Soros sold a stake in Level 3 Communications (LVLT), which was worth $173 million as of Dec. 31, and a holding in Dow Chemical (DOW) that was worth $161 million, according to the filing. The family office also divested its stakes in Endo International (ENDP) and Delta Air Lines (DAL).Glenview Capital Management, the hedge fund run by Larry Robbins, Citadel Advisors and Millennium Management also cut investments of U.S.-listed stocks last quarter. The value of Glenview’s equity holdings fell by 22% to $13.6 billion; Citadel’s dropped by 29% to $38.8 billion and Millennium’s declined by 17% to $36.5 billion, filings show.Money managers who oversee more than $100 million in equities in the U.S. must file a Form 13F within 45 days of each quarter’s end to list those stocks as well as options and convertible bonds. The filings don’t show non-U.S. securities, holdings that aren’t publicly traded or cash.

526,DAL,"American Airlines' (AAL) first-quarter earnings beat analyst estimates, but revenue took a hit from ""competitive capacity growth"" and economic issues in Latin America, prompting the carrier to forecast a sharp drop in unit revenuePer-share earnings fell 27.7% to $1.25. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting $1.19. Revenue fell 4% to $9.435 billion, under views for $9.44 billion.Capacity rose 3.6% while passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) fell 7.5%, and American sees a 6%-8% decline in PRASM in Q2.Management said Q2 capacity remains elevated in all regions and that capacity is growing faster than the economy in all areas of the world. But capacity growth rates are expected to moderate in the back half of the year.Meanwhile, the Dallas region is still competitive, and American doesn’t see growth moderating in the region until September.Also, fuel costs are expected to rise the rest of the year.American Air stock closed down 4.5% in the stock market today, despite American's board announcing a $2 billion buyback that will end in 2017. Hawaiian Holdings (HA) plunged 11.4%, undercutting its 50-day line.

Q1 PRASM fell 7.4%, and United predicts Q2 domestic PRASM will drop 3.5%-5.5%, with international PRASM down 11%-13%.Delta Air Lines (DAL)  management said last week that if fuels prices go up and economies don’t grow, that will be an indication the industry would need to pull back on capacity to increase margins.United shares fell 3.8% Friday after diving 10% Thursday. Delta shares lost 0.8%. Alaska Air, which fell 2.7% on Thursday, lost 3.2% on Friday, dropping below a buy point, its 50-day line and 200-day line.

527,DAL,"Most airlines court business customers -- or more accurately their business expense accounts -- but Hawaiian Airlines is finding success catering primarily to vacationers in the U.S., Asia and elsewhere in the Pacific Rim.Mai Tais and pupus, truly friendly skies and an on-time record that’s the envy of the industry: these are the competitive advantages of the airline and its parent, Hawaiian Holdings (HA). Its unique model focuses sharply on bringing an island-like experience to its patrons.“It really caters to the leisure customer,” CRT Capital analyst Michael Derchin told IBD. “Maybe 1% of their market is business.""Derchin, who has a buy rating on Hawaiian, says he initiated coverage with a buy rating back in February 2014, when the stock was trading around 11. Now it's approaching 50.“It’s been a grand slam home run,” he said.Hawaiian, which expanded into Australia in 2004 and began daily service to Tokyo’s Haneda airport in 2010, has been growing its long-haul business. This year, it will begin service to Tokyo’s Narita airport. Hawaiian says it flew a record 10.7 million passengers in 2015, a 4.7% increase from 2014.“The allure of Hawaii is really pretty universal,” Hawaiian Chief Commercial Officer Peter Ingram told IBD. As the middle class grows in Korea and China, the airline expects to fly more Asian tourists to Hawaii, he said.Ingram notes that Japan has always had a big presence in Hawaii and that tourism from Japan is rising with the strengthening yen. The airline currently flies from Hawaii to Australia, New Zealand, American Samoa, Tahiti, Japan, South Korea and China.He also said that Hawaiian offers service to smaller cities on the Pacific Rim, such as Auckland in New Zealand, Brisbane in Australia, and Japan's Sapporo, that “don’t register on the map of the big carriers.” Though, after Hawaiian began service to Auckland, American Airlines (AAL) started flying there too, says Ingram.And of course, the airline outpaces everyone on inter-island flights within the Hawaiian chain, with about 160 daily departures.“We understand travel to Hawaii better than anyone. We’re prepared to take on any competitor who enters the market,” said Ingram.All of the big three U.S. carriers, American, United Airlines (UAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL) compete with Hawaiian for the mainland-to-Hawaii business. Alaska Airlines (ALK) and Virgin America (VA) also offer flights. And Japanese carrier All Nippon Airways also flies to Hawaii from Japan.Additionally, wags have predicted for years that Southwest Airlines (LUV) would enter the Hawaii market. But it won’t happen this year, says Helane Becker, an analyst with Cowen & Co., who spoke with IBD.“Southwest doesn’t have any aircraft with extended over-water operations certification,” she said. “It would take about a year to get ... certified from the FAA on the existing fleet. And we would know if they applied for it. … They haven’t, so we don’t view Southwest as a short-term threat.”Becker rates Hawaiian at market perform. She says the stock is at a high valuation, but adds, “They’re a very strong competitor on the West Coast, and they’ve been growing aggressively.”For each of the past 12 years, Hawaiian has led U.S. carriers in on-time performance, according the U.S. Department of Transportation. And the airline is noted for its top-notch service; it even still serves food, included in the fare on mainland-to-Hawaii flights.It’s also adding luxury to its liners. In October 2015, Hawaiian said it will put lie-flat seating in its Airbus (EADSY) A330 premium cabins.“Those airplanes do all our long-haul flying outside Hawaii,” said Ingram. Hawaiian’s customers are couples or families, he said. And unlike business travelers, they don’t necessarily want isolation.“We’ve worked to custom design” the seats to accommodate our customers, he said. “We will have planes with these seats in the second or third quarter of this year.”Ingram says the majority of Hawaiian's A330s will be retrofitted by the end of 2017.The airline is also adding the A321 NEO to its fleet this year -- a single-aisle, smaller long-haul aircraft. It will enable Hawaiian to fly more cost-effectively from smaller locations on the West Coast of North America to Hawaii, said Ingram.The airline's net income for its fourth quarter, ended Dec. 31, more than tripled to $37.9 million from $11.1 million in the year-earlier period. Similarly, diluted earnings per share rocketed up to 66 cents from 17 cents in the year-earlier quarter.Yet, total revenue declined slightly in the fourth quarter to $574.2 million from $574.8 million. For the full year, total revenue grew a bit to $2.32 billion from $2.31 billion. The company’s revenue took a hit from foreign-currency impacts, reduced fuel surcharges (from lower fuel costs) and thus lower total fares, as well as higher capacity from competitors, which put pressure on the fares in North America, Ingram said.So what’s fueling the jump in income and earnings on declining revenue? Well, cheap fuel. For the fourth quarter, Hawaiian’s aircraft fuel costs dropped 41.4% to $88.4 million from $150.8 million.Asked if Hawaiian would stockpile or hedge fuel at the current low prices, Ingram demurred: “We do hedge fuel, but we’re not speculators.”Zack’s puts Hawaiian’s first-quarter 2016 earnings at 73 cents a share and full-year 2016 earnings at $4.57 per share. But both Derchin and Becker estimate Hawaiian will earn $5 per share for 2016.Not long ago, its stock price was at 5. Hawaiian (in business for 87 years) went through its second bankruptcy in 2003-2005, and its stock was still bumping along at a dismal 5 to 6 from 2011 through early 2013, when it finally started climbing. In the past year, the stock has jumped up from a low of 19.66 in mid-March 2015 to 52-week intraday high of 46.98 on Wednesday.“We’re feeling very optimistic about our prospects for 2016,"" Ingram said. ""We’re seeing flatter comparisons on foreign exchange, and we’re seeing continued strong demand throughout our network.”

529,DAL,"Some familiar names were winners in the week ended Feb. 18.With U.S. diversified stock mutual funds posting a gain in the week -- after losing ground in the prior week and in eight of the previous 11 weeks -- the top-performing fund with $100 million or more in assets that does not rely on shorting, hedging or borrowing was $1.4 billion Legg Mason Opportunity (LMNOX), managed by Bill Miller and Samantha McLemore.Miller and McLemore steered Opportunity to a 12.03% gain for their investors in the week, according to Lipper Inc.That shaved the fund's trailing 12-month return to a 23.94% setback. It boosted the fund's three-year average annual gain to 9.55%.With Miller and McLemore at the helm, Opportunity was the top-performing U.S. diversified stock fund with more than $200 million in assets tracked by Morningstar Inc. in 2013.And Miller earned his spot in the fund-manager hall of fame by topping the S&P 500 as manager of the now-$2.1 billion ClearBridge Value Trust (LMVTX) for 15 straight years starting in 1991.Lipper has Opportunity in its multicap core category. It had 85% of its money at work in U.S. stocks as of Dec. 31, Morningstar says. Nearly 13% of its money was in foreign stocks.Its largest sector was consumer cyclicals, with a 35% weighting. Financial services were next, with a 19% weighting. Technology was third, with a 16% weighting.Priceline (PCLN) skyrocketed 19% in the week. The online travel-booking service released its fourth-quarter earnings report on Wednesday, and the results topped expectations by Wall Street analysts.Earnings per share rose 16%. They rose 0% and 14% the prior two stanzas.Priceline looked much stronger than rival Expedia (EXPE). In fiscal 2015, Priceline customers booked 432 million room nights through its platform. That was more than double the number booked through Expedia in the same period.Delta Air Lines (DAL) flew up nearly 9% in the latest week.Delta was largely carried on the wings of cheap aviation fuel. Last month it reported EPS growth of 51% in the latest quarter, the second quarter in a row of accelerating EPS growth.Alibaba Group (BABA) climbed nearly 10% in the latest week.On Friday, one day after the close of the latest week in funds, Alibaba said its revenue would grow faster than its gross merchandise volume (GMV) for the foreseeable future. Investors watch GMV as a proxy for consumer engagement and an indicator of possible spending patterns.China region funds were hot in the week. Their 5.76% gain on average was second best among foreign-stock fund categories. Chinese stocks showed strength coming out of the lunar new year holidays.Alibaba also said it had bought 33 million shares, or a 5.6% stake, in Groupon (GRPN). The online discount deal provider itself -- also a holding of Legg Mason Opportunity -- gained 71%.Still, investors should proceed cautiously around Groupon. It is trading well below 10 at around 4. Also, it has a weak Composite Rating of 69 from IBD. The Composite Rating combines IBD’s five stock-performance ratings, including Earnings Per Share and Relative Strength Ratings, with 99 being the highest.And shares are less than half of their value compared with their 8.37 52-week high of Feb. 26, 2015.U.S. diversified stock funds overall gained 4.85% in the latest week. That reversed their skid from the prior week.Midcap value funds led the surge, gaining 5.76% in the week.Global natural resources funds led sectors by gaining 6.34%.European region funds paced foreign stock funds, advancing 5.94%.Taxable bond funds on average gained 0.44% in the week. With investors willing to take on risk in equities, U.S. Treasury funds fell 1.11%.Tax-exempt bond funds gave back 0.30% in the week.

530,DAL,"With epic profits from cheap fuel, Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Continental (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) have found themselves more able than they have in years to treat passengers to free snacks, more legroom and other amenities that could survive a recession and force the hands of budget carriers.How much further airlines can go with their extra cash remains a question, though analysts don't expect too much of a hit to earnings from improvements in service.As airlines try to please passengers, they’re also trying to accommodate employees and investors who rode out bankruptcies, the financial crisis, surging oil prices, layoffs and other cost cuts.“Overall, they’re growing in the right way, which is a hard thing to say historically about airlines,” Argus Research analyst David Coleman said. “I think this is more important than getting a week-old turkey sandwich.”He also stressed that airlines are likewise investing in things passengers don’t always notice: profit-sharing, reducing debt and investing in fuel-efficient planes. Those moves aim to keep carriers competitive in the long term, when oil prices come back up.“If you’re making a whole bunch of money right now, and you start giving everyone free meals and drinks, they’re going to get used to that,” Coleman said. “So then when you cut them away when fuel prices go back up, they’re going to be screaming, ‘Why don’t I get my free rum and Coke?’ ”Improved service would come as complaints from passengers jumped 30% in 2015, according to Transportation Department data.Free snacks have largely returned on the major airlines after years of austerity, but free meals on shorter flights likely won't come back.
"
531,DAL,"Carriers are also investing in new planes, including ones from Boeing (BA) that have more overhead space. Delta Air Lines and United Continental are trying to draw more business travelers with on-time commitments. American Airlines and Alaska Air Group (ALK) are planning more comfortable ""premium economy""-style seating. JetBlue (JBLU) is exploring ways to improve customer and operational service through Big Data and artificial intelligence.Delta also has tested pre-loading carry-ons into overhead bins to hasten the boarding process. Cowen analyst Helane Becker sees airlines reconsidering how they approach boarding and fees this year, saying airlines probably have their current fees backwards.“They should have charged for overhead bin space and let you check your bag for free,” she said.
"
532,DAL,"Still, checked-bag and other fees, which began when oil prices jumped, almost certainly aren’t going anywhere despite today's low prices, as customers grow accustomed to fees, analysts say. (Southwest Airlines (LUV) still allows two checked bags for free as long as they are within certain weight and size limits.)And as more passengers bring their own mobile devices aboard, some industry watchers say airlines could move away from in-seat entertainment. That would free up seat space for passengers -- plus remove weight from planes and save fuel.The new perks come as bigger airlines try to differentiate themselves from carriers like Spirit Airlines (SAVE), which grew by offering cheap airfares, tacking on fees elsewhere, and doing so with a bit more irreverence than many would expect from a public company.But in May, American Airlines’ CEO Doug Parker told Bloomberg the airline would “compete aggressively” with low-cost airlines, after they pushed airfares lower and moved in on territory the bigger airlines left amid the recent merger wave.The efforts seem to have had some success. Increased competition, along with abysmal on-time performance and complaints of minimal customer service, have weighed on Spirit’s profit and share price.The bigger airlines are now feeling safe enough to raise airfares again, hiking them in some key markets this month and last.“If you’re a low-cost or ultra-low-cost guy, and American, Delta, United compete against you, and they offer a better product, you have to think about stepping up your game and at least offer a comfortable seat or an on-time or operationally effective product,” Becker said.In the company’s most recent earnings call, Bob Fornaro, Spirit’s new CEO, said the company would make customer service a priority this year but added that no sweeping changes would take place.“In the era of higher oil prices, SAVE got away with being an unpleasant travel option with poor operational reliability because they materially undercut competitors on price,” Wolfe Research said in a note discussing Spirit’s Q4 earnings. “And they were irreverent about it. It was funny at the time, but in hindsight it was also an unsustainable way to do business.”Wolfe added: “So maybe the upshot of lower oil prices is that low oil prices will force change that will be better for SAVE in the long run. And, after that, SAVE will have better growth options.”As speculation of a recession intensifies, JPMorgan, which believes airlines’ profit margins would stay strong in a downturn, doesn’t see in-flight improvements going away.“Only in the event of multi-year profit pressures would we expect recent amenities to be scaled back,” JPMorgan analyst Jamie Baker told IBD via email.Cowen's Becker, however, said that what airlines cut depends on the downturn’s causes and impact.“Certainly the rhetoric has been ‘This time it’s different, and they will be profitable,’ ” she said. “But if you’re adding cost by offering new products, you’re increasing your labor costs, and fuel costs rise, you better raise your ticket prices pretty quick.”

534,DAL,"Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) has been loading up on shares of Phillips 66 (PSX) and now owns about 14%, fueling speculation that Buffett may buy the oil refiner outright.If so, it would likely be among his largest takeovers ever. Phillips 66 has a market cap of $40 billion. Last month, Berkshire closed its $37.2 billion purchase of Precision Castparts, its biggest acquisition to date.Berkshire began buying big lots of Phillips 66 stock in August, when it purchased $4.5 billion worth of the shares to boost its stake to 10.8%. Berkshire bought more shares last month to give it a 13.7% stake. Additional purchases this month put the stake over 14%.Phillips 66 CEO Greg Garland was asked about the big Berkshire purchases on a Jan. 29 earnings call but only said, ""We don't comment on conversations with shareholders.""Berkshire didn't respond to requests for comment.Shares of Berkshire closed up 2.4% on the stock market today. Phillips 66 rallied 3.2%.Buffett's pattern of Phillips 66 stock purchases is reminiscent of his transactions leading up to his $9.7 billion acquisition of lubricant and chemical maker Lubrizol in 2011, said S&P Global Markets Intelligence analyst Cathy Seifert.""He bought an equity stake and then bought the company,"" she told IBD.Seifert said she doesn't have knowledge of a specific plan by Buffett to buy Phillips 66, but his purchases of its stock follow a well-trodden path.""You have to think what his patterns tend to be,"" Seifert said. ""This move lately was an opportunity to, No. 1, diversify holdings and, No. 2,  gain opportunistic exposure to the space at an attractive price. It's a function of diversification and a long-term macro view of an opportunity to get in.""Any purchase of Phillips 66 would come at a tricky time for the sector. While integrated giants like Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) are suffering amid low oil prices, pure-play refineries generally benefit, as they enjoying reduced input costs and fatter profit margins.But the good times may be nearing an end.Earlier this week, a Delta Air Lines (DAL)-owned refinery, Monroe Energy, prepared to reduce output by 10%, according to Reuters. It followed Valero Energy (VLO), which slashed gasoline output by 25% at a Tennessee refinery.Analysts expect more output cuts by refiners who will try to avoid flooding the already saturated market, Reuters said.Shares of Delta Air Lines rose 0.7% Friday, and Valero climbed 3.9%. Exxon rose 1.8%, and Chevron gained 2.9%.

535,DAL,"Republic Airways' (RJET) stock collapsed Friday, sinking 73% after the company and some subsidiaries said a day earlier they had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.The Indianapolis-based carrier, whose planes serve Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) for their shorter routes, said flights were continuing as planned and that the company was ""doing business as usual across its locations"" as it restructures.But the filing followed several quarters of plunging revenue after disagreements with labor, a pilot shortage across the U.S., difficulties related to ""out-of-favor aircraft"" and an apparent impasse with major stakeholders, the company said.Republic's stock closed below 1 in the stock market today. A year ago, the stock was trading above 12. Delta fell 2.7%, United dipped 0.5%, American Airlines fell 1.2%.“We worked hard to avoid this step,” Republic Airways CEO Bryan Bedford said in a statement Thursday.He added: ""Our filing today is a result of our loss of revenue during the past several quarters associated with grounding aircraft due to a lack of pilot resources, combined with the reality that our negotiating effort with key stakeholders shows no apparent prospect of a near-term resolution.""The company also Thursday named Lars-Erik Arnell as chief restructuring officer to manage the turnaround.While other, bigger airlines have expanded amid low fuel costs -- to the concern of some investors last year -- Republic's traffic and capacity have fallen in recent months. The company has also struggled to attract pilots amid years of contract disputes, the Wall Street Journal noted.Meanwhile, Southwest (LUV) has expanded its regional coverage after federal restrictions fell away in 2014, and low-cost carriers like Spirit Airlines (SAVE) have moved into flight areas left vacant after their larger rivals began consolidating several years ago.Republic Airways' pilots in October ratified a three-year contract. The company, in a statement at that time, said the agreement ""includes significant improvements in work rules and pilot quality of life,"" but it said there were still ""many challenges to overcome to achieve a successful consensual restructuring of our business.""

539,DAL,"American Airlines (AAL) could cut its annual share buybacks more sharply next year, easing from capital returns that have been more aggressive than rivals, Raymond James said in a research note Wednesday.American in the second quarter returned more than $1.7 billion to shareholders through buybacks and quarterly dividend payments. In 2015, American returned $3.9 billion in dividends and buybacks.The prediction for smaller repurchases came a day after Microsoft (MSFT) OK'd a repurchase program of up to $40 billion and an 8% dividend increase to 39 cents.Overall, firms in the S&P 500 spent $125.1 billion on share buybacks during Q2, the smallest quarterly total since Q3 2013, FactSet said. This comes after Q1 set a post-recession high.Apple (AAPL) led the S&P 500 in buybacks last quarter, followed by General Electric (GE), Microsoft (MSFT) and drugmaker AbbVie (ABBV), FactSet said in a report Tuesday.American shares fell 1.4% in the stock market today, rebounding from intraday losses as the major averages rebounded after the Fed left rates unchanged. Delta Air Lines (DAL) closed 1.1% higher while United Airlines (UAL) dipped 0.2%.IBD'S TAKE: Companies have been taking advantage of low interest rates to borrow money for stock repurchases, which also help boost a company's earnings per share by thinning its supply of outstanding shares.
"
540,DAL,"Raymond James also downgraded American Airlines to market perform from outperform due to its valuation relative to rivals and slashed its earnings per share target to $4.35 from $5.30, largely due to a new labor agreement that was bigger than expected. The firm cut its 2016 EPS target to $5.20 from $5.25.American's labor deal announced in August provides ""significant pay increases"" to 30,000 maintenance, fleet service and other employees, the carrier said at the time. Other airlines have attempted to strike deals with their workers after the oil glut in 2014 lowered fuel costs and cushioned carriers' profits.""While labor cost pressures are being felt across the industry and y/y unit cost (CASM) headwinds at American in 2017 is unlikely to be among the highest, it follows two years of above industry increases,"" Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth wrote in the note.Lower oil prices prompted a wave of competitive growth that hurt unit revenue, or how much money an airline makes compared to available seats, flights and flight coverage. However, Delta and Southwest (LUV) have signaled more operational discipline could be on the horizon, potentially improving the much-watched metric.American's unit revenue is also likely to improve, and a recent credit-card deal and better results from its Latin American region are also likely to help, Raymond James added.""However, we expect similar favorable trends at its legacy peers,"" Syth said.""Additionally, following the departure of Scott Kirby, considered the architect of last year's (ultra low-cost carrier) pricing strategy, we believe investors will question American's pricing strategy moving forward,"" Syth wrote. ""We expect the roll out of a product similar to Delta's Basic Economy to remain the priority with potential upside to our estimates beyond 1Q17.""Southwest shares rose 0.2%.

541,DAL,"American Airlines (AAL) said Thursday that it continued to expect second-quarter consolidated passenger unit revenue to fall 6% to 8% after releasing May traffic results.The company also said it still expected a Q2 adjusted pretax margin of between 14% to 16%.The carrier said May traffic rose 0.5%, while carrying capacity rose 1.7%. Load factor, or how effectively airlines put people in seats, fell 0.9 percentage point to 81.9%.Shares closed up 2.7% on the stock market today.Investors have been hoping airlines will keep capacity growth more in line with passenger demand after two years during which low oil prices have prompted the industry to expand flight coverage and cut fares to compete.Higher capacity, lower airfares, weaker passenger demand and a stronger dollar have hurt airlines' unit revenue, which measures how much money airlines make relative to available seats on planes. Airlines have vowed to turn the key metric around.Delta Air Lines (DAL), which hopes to be the first to get unit revenue back on track this year, said Wednesday that it would ""hopefully"" produce Q2 unit revenue within the low range of its guidance of a 2.5%-4.5% decline. The carrier also said Q2 operating margin would be near the low end of its forecast of 21%-23%.Still, Delta said unit costs would likely come in better than expected. Falling unit revenue is easier on a carrier when unit costs also drop.Also Thursday, Virgin AmericaVA, which is being acquired by Alaska Air GroupALK, said May traffic rose 18.1%, with capacity up 15.5% and load factor up 1.9 percentage points to 86.1%.Airline stocks got a boost this week after an analyst report found that airfare hikes have held.Delta Air Lines gained 1.3%.

545,DAL,"Boeing (BA) rival Airbus (EADSY) and Siemens (SIEGY) have agreed to work together on developing an electrically powered aircraft, with a plan of ""demonstrating the technical feasibility"" of hybrid or electric propulsion systems by 2020, the companies said Thursday.Boeing has also put its weight behind efforts to develop electric aircraft, and Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has also entertained the idea of making an electric jet.Airbus in 2014 ran its first public test flight of the E-Fan, a two-seat electric aircraft intended for pilot training. Siemens has been at work on an electric aircraft engine since sometime around 2011, when Airbus, Siemens and Austrian aviation company Diamond Aircraft introduced a hybrid aircraft.For their latest effort, Airbus and Siemens have assembled some 200 employees who will focus on the project. The companies will focus on propulsion systems for smaller, short-haul aircraft with 100 seats or less.The aviation industry in recent years has sought ways to conserve fuel and keep the skies cleaner and quieter amid more ambitious environmental goals across a variety of nations. Europe is targeting 75% lower CO2 emissions by 2050 as compared to 2000 levels, the companies noted in a statement.""Electric and electric-hybrid flight represent some of the biggest industrial challenges of our time, aiming at zero-emissions aviation,"" Airbus CEO Tom Enders said in the statement, adding that the company believed hybrid aircraft with 100 seats or less ""could be propelled by hybrid propulsion systems"" by 2030.Airbus shares closed down 0.6% in the stock market today, with shares briefly emerging above the handle of a cup-with-handle base last month but failing to advance higher. Siemens eased 2.9%.Boeing fell 0.7% as it reported a 4.3% drop in Q1 commercial aircraft deliveries. Tesla shares fell 3%.Airbus and Siemens' plans come even as low oil prices continue to free up room for more profit for airlines. However, several airlines, including some unidentified bigger ones, ""moved last week to place significant oil price hedges for 2017, 2018 and even 2019,"" Reuters reported Wednesday, citing sources.The hedges, used by airlines to lock in fuel prices in attempt to guard against fluctuations in those prices, were smaller than in years past, Reuters said. But they could be a sign that airlines are more convinced the bottom for oil prices might be near.Airlines, however, don't exactly have a great track record in predicting fuel prices. Wolfe Research, in a research note Wednesday, estimated that the four largest U.S. airlines may have suffered an aggregate loss of $5 billion in hedging fuel over the past 10 years.""Hedging to cover fuel costs over the period it takes to cut capacity in the event of a change in the demand environment is understandable,"" Wolfe analyst Hunter Keay wrote. ""Hedging beyond that, into 2018-19, for example, isn’t hedging -- it’s gambling.""Delta Air Lines' (DAL) shares closed down 3%; American Airlines (AAL) lost 1.4%, United Airlines (UAL) fell 3.6% and Southwest (LUV) ended virtually flat.Image provided by Shutterstock.

546,DAL,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) on Monday said the terror attacks in Brussels hurt its March results by $5 million. But the carrier said ""demand remains solid,"" with forward bookings set to outpace those a year ago, and it sees first-quarter operating margin improving.Delta expects Q1 operating margin of 18%-19%, a year-over-year improvement of around 10 percentage points. Unit revenue for the quarter fell around 4.5%, hurt by foreign exchange, and it sees carrying capacity rising roughly 2.7%.The company said its fuel costs were likely $1.33-$1.37 per gallon during the quarter.Consolidated passenger unit revenue in March fell 5%. Foreign exchange also weighed. The airline logged an on-time performance of 87.8%. Carrying capacity rose 1.5%, outpacing a traffic increase of 1.2%. Load factor, a measure of an airline's ability to fill seats, edged down.Delta shares closed up 0.3% in the stock market today. The stock cleared a cup-with-handle base in March but has failed to pick up steam since.

551,DAL,"The U.S. airline industry's profit margins would be just as good as in prior peaks in a potential recession, even though a downturn was not ""the most probable outcome"" in the future, JPMorgan said in a research note Thursday, calling Delta Air Lines (DAL) and Southwest (LUV) its best picks.However, broader skittishness has weighed on stock prices, prompting the investment firm to cut its price target on Delta to 66 from 74, on Southwest to 52 from 56, on United Continental (UAL) to 66.50 from 77 and on American Airlines (AAL) to 50.50 from 66.JetBlue's (JBLU) was left unchanged, and Virgin America's (VA) was raised to 35.50 from 31.""The market multiple has contracted 1 to 2 times, hence we made similar revisions to our airline target multiples,"" JPMorgan analyst Jamie Baker said in an email to IBD. ""While our earnings estimates broadly rose, it’s true that lower multiples drove downward revisions to most price targets.""But JPMorgan added Delta and Southwest to its focus list. Delta, Baker said, could bring investors 50% EPS growth this year, saying the company was set to benefit from the falling-away of its costly fuel contracts and that it had the ""most returns-oriented management team.""Southwest's stock, he said, represented a good value pick, citing the company's ""best-in-class balance sheet"" and resilient demand for leisure travel.Airline stocks over the past year sank on worries of overexpansion and the low-fare competitive landscape weighing on results. Air carriers pared back their growth plans accordingly, but broader anxieties persist.In the note, Baker wrote that ""we believe the main concern standing between investors and heady potential gains in U.S. airline equities is uncertainty around a recession.""But Baker said the industry's annual margins would likely fall to around 10.5% in a recession. That's still better than the 10% peak the industry reached in years past. The annual industry revenue decline in a recession would likely be 10%, he said, compared to 13% in prior recessions.Besides, conditions for airlines have changed since the 2007-2009 recession that crippled the industry. Fuel prices surged during that time, but the oil-price crash in 2014 has helped keep airline fuel costs low, allowing for the return of free snacks, spending on improved seating options and sturdier finances overall.""Regardless of one’s view on recessionary revenue reversal,"" Baker wrote, ""there’s no escaping that the industry’s collective balance sheet has never been stronger, and individual airlines are in materially better shape than YE08.""Delta rose 0.55% in the stock market today, while Southwest rallied 1.9%. United Continental gained 1.8%, and American added 1.9%. JetBlue slid 0.4% and Virgin America climbed 2.6%.

553,DAL,"Boeing (BA) said Wednesday the aircraft market remains strong, but its 2016 forecast for fewer deliveries and weak earnings stoked fears that demand may be slowing down after airlines splurged earlier on new planes.The aerospace giant sees 2016 core earnings per share of $8.15-$8.35, well below the $9.43 analysts expect. The company sees revenue of $93 billion-$95 billion, below views for $97.2 billion. Commercial aircraft deliveries are seen at 740-745, down from 762 last year.But management said on a conference call that it continues to see passenger growth outpacing economic growth, adding that 60% of the market for new aircraft are still aimed at fleet expansion and 40% for replacements.""All of that is telling us continuing to ramp up production to keep supply and demand in balance is the right thing to do,"" Boeing said. ""We make decisions with a long-term perspective.""The company will boost 737 production to 57 a month in 2019 vs. 42 a month now and up from previously announced increases to 47 in 2017 and 52 in 2018. As expected, output on the 777 will slow to seven a month, ahead of the 777X's production start.Boeing shares closed down 8.9% in the stock market today, falling intraday to the lowest since late 2013. Rival Airbus (EADSY) fell 4.3%. Aerospace suppliers also sold off. Spirit AeroSystems (SPR) lost 7.8%, B/E Aerospace (BEAV) 1.7%, and TransDigm (TDG) 1.9%.The plunge in oil prices has made it more economical for airlines to fly older, less efficient planes. Boeing maintains cheap fuel isn't affecting demand significantly and said Wednesday that lower maintenance and fuel costs, better range, and improved customer satisfaction with newer planes and their amenities make new aircraft attractive.But in December, Delta Air Lines (DAL) reached a deal to buy a used 777 for just $7.7 million. And earlier this month, British Airways parent company said it may lease some used jets rather than buy new ones.Ivan Feinseth, chief investment officer for Tigress Financial Partners, drew a parallel with Apple's (AAPL) disappointing sales and guidance Tuesday as well as signs that demand for new cars will come down from record highs.“We are seeing a peak in auto sales, a peak in travel, a peak in iPhone sales,” he told IBD.Meanwhile, Boeing's Q4 core earnings dropped 31% to $1.60 per share, easily topping views for $1.27 per share. Revenue dipped 4% to $23.57 billion, above views for $23.52 billion.Revenue from the commercial airplane division unit fell 4.4% to $16.1 billion. Defense, space and security revenue rose 2.6% to $7.8 billion.On Jan. 21 Boeing said it will cut the production rate on its 747-8  to half a plan a month in September from 1 plane a month, and booked a $569 million after-tax charge in Q4.On the defense side, the Air Force and Boeing completed the first aerial refueling test of the KC-46 tanker on Sunday. Like other military planes, the KC-46 program is behind schedule. The plane made its first test flight in September. The test was originally set for 2014.Boeing took a $536 million after-tax charge in Q2 on the plane due to higher estimated engineering and manufacturing costs. The Air Force plans to buy 179 tankers, and under the current contract Boeing must deliver 18 tankers by August 2017.

554,DAL,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) warned on two key operating metrics Wednesday, while Southwest (LUV) said it continues to expect a ""modest increase"" in second-quarter operating unit revenue, based on May traffic results.After the close, United Airlines (UAL) said traffic fell 1.2%, while capacity edged up 0.5% and load factor dipped 1.4 percentage points. Discount carrier Spirit Airlines (SAVE) said traffic jumped 24.8% as capacity surged 24%. Load factor edged up 0.6 point.Delta CFO Paul Jacobson, speaking at a conference, guided Q2 passenger unit revenue to the low end of its expected range, saying it will be closer to a 4.5% decline vs. prior views for a 2.5%-4.5% drop. He also said Q2 operating margin will be near the low end of its 21%-23% outlook.The warning comes just a few weeks after Delta said it will become “the first network carrier to return to positive unit revenue growth later this year.”Shares of Delta closed down 0.6% in the stock market today. United dipped 0.3%, and American Airlines (AAL) edged up 0.5%. Southwest rallied 1%.Southwest said traffic rose 6.4% last month, compared to an increase in carrying capacity of 4.6%. Load factor, a way to measure how effectively an airline puts passengers in seats, rose 1.4 percentage points to 85.8%.On Tuesday, the carrier offered a three-day low-fare sale for some domestic and international fall travel.But it and other airlines -- including JetBlue (JBLU), Alaska Air Group (ALK) and Virgin America (VA) -- got a bump in stock price Tuesday on an analyst report indicating the industry had slightly raised fares. Alaska Air signed a deal earlier this year to buy Virgin America, pending regulatory approval.Wall Street has been concerned about the lower airfares that have characterized much of the industry since 2014. Over the past two years, cheap oil has kept fuel costs thin and margins fat, prompting flight expansions and discounting, with investors worrying airlines could overestimate demand.In Europe, meanwhile, Air France-KLM said Wednesday that May traffic rose 0.8%, while capacity increased 1.8%. Load factor fell 0.8 points to 84.1%.Air France pilots plan to strike beginning on Saturday, a day after the Euro 2016 soccer championship is set to start in France, drawing huge crowds, the Financial Times noted this weekend.Air France executives called the strikes ""deplorable"" and said they would hinder the airline's recent turnaround, the Times said. The pilots want better pay and more resources devoted to operations in France, as opposed to KLM, a Dutch airline and Air France subsidiary, according to reports in the Times and the Independent.The demonstrations would be in keeping with a wave of strikes -- including by air traffic controllers -- that threaten to overtake the nation. Many workers in France are protesting measures that would allow employers to hire and fire workers more easily.Irish budget carrier Ryanair (RYAAY) has called the air traffic controller strikes ""unjustified"" and said they caused dozens of flight cancellations.Ryanair shares fell 1.3%.
"
555,DAL,"Financial markets and the Federal Reserve have been giving a preview of the fallout from a U.K. vote to leave the European Union: lower stock prices, lower Treasury yields and a higher dollar.The vote tally late Thursday pointed to the Leave camp winning. U.S. stock futures are selling off very hard overnight, but analysts generally agree that U.S. stocks would likely be much more attractive under Brexit than U.K. or European equities.Morgan Stanley has said it expects European equities to sink 15% within six months of a Brexit vote, while the euro sinks 11.5% vs. the dollar.""While the U.S. won't be immune if the world turns more nationalistic and protectionist, it will be less adversely affected than most other countries,"" wrote Ed Yardeni, chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research. ""That's because the U.S. economy is more resilient, diversified and self-contained than all other ones.""Retail, food and utility stock groups have been among the market's top-performing industries in recent weeks. Some homebuilder stocks are near breakouts, with lower-for-longer rates providing support to the housing sector.Health care can be attractive as a steady growth sector. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) is trading near highs, outperforming the general market for months.More domestic-focused companies may be an even surer bet for two reasons.First, upward pressure on the dollar is a drag on the earnings of multinationals such as General Electric (GE) that derive a large percentage of sales and profits from exports and overseas operations.As Citigroup strategists noted: ""The dollar's relative weakness in 2016 has been important for broader (second-half of 2016) S&P 500 EPS expectations, and thus a strengthening of the buck would imply that downward earnings pressures could be revived and act as a new restraint on share prices.""Further, a Brexit vote is seen as possibly tipping the U.K. into recession and acting as a drag on already-tepid growth in the EU and around the globe.Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said earlier this month that if Brexit becomes a reality, the firm will cut its 2017 growth forecast from 2.4% to zero for the U.K., and to 1.0% from 1.8% for the euro zone.That would mean ""another year of the global economy being stuck in low gear,"" Behravesh said.With emerging markets, commodities prices and U.S. multinationals' foreign earnings taking a hit from Brexit, Ram Gandikota, senior portfolio manager at Ativo Capital Management, expects U.S. consumer-focused stocks and defensive areas like utilities to benefit. Gold is likely to rise as investors ""flock to safety assets in the short term,"" he said.Gold and gold-related stocks and ETFs also have done well.The severity of the economic consequences from the pro-Brexit vote are hard to predict. One concern is that Brexit reflects broader discontent with centralized European institutions, including the euro monetary regime that the U.K. never joined.The economic and financial market disruption from the Brexit the will put more pressure on remaining EU members to make their fiscal, banking and immigration agreements more effective and palatable. Otherwise, anti-European-establishment political parties may continue to strengthen and follow the U.K.'s lead.Without the U.K. paying its membership dues, countries like Spain and Germany will be called on to pay more, Gandikota said. He sees prospects for further European integration ""getting worse and worse"" as public sentiment deteriorates. If the U.K. manages to endure Brexit without much hardship, the outlook for the eurozone will become even worse, because it would make leaving the EU seem less scary, he said.A Brexit vote would put more pressure on central banks to do more. The European Central Bank reportedly has promised to backstop financial markets if U.K. votes to ""Leave."" Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen noted last Wednesday that a pro-Brexit vote would likely impact Fed policy in the months to come. The Bank of Japan may also have to take more extreme measures to limit an expected further rise in the yen.Lower interest rates for longer may be a positive for the U.S. housing and auto sectors. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged just 3.56% in the past week, Freddie Mac said on Thursday.But automaker stocks have been weak, partly on global sales concerns but also on fears that U.S. demand is near a peak.Housing looks a like a more attractive opportunity than autos, Yardeni said. Health care is another domestic-focused area where investors can find healthy growth relative to ""a world of secular stagnation,"" he said.On the other hand, U.S. banks will continue to face a tough environment with low rates contributing to narrow net interest margins. Bank of America (BAC) reportedly will lay off as many as 8,000 employees in its consumer division.Analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods expect an earnings hit to JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS) and other big banks from weaker capital markets activity in the U.K.A pro-Brexit vote would likewise hurt American Airlines (AAL) and other global carriers, such as United Continental (UAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL). It would disrupt business travel in the short run as companies put decisions on hold. Slower economic growth in Europe would be a longer-term problem.

556,DAL,"Airlines are rallying Tuesday, with United Continental (UAL), American Airlines (AAL), Southwest Airlines (LUV), Delta Air Lines (DAL), JetBlue (JBLU) and Hawaiian Airlines (HA) all taking off.Carriers are having more luck raising fares, JPMorgan analyst Jamie Baker wrote in a research note Tuesday. JetBlue hiked one-way fares by $3 on Monday, with American, Alaska Air (ALK), Delta, Southwest, United and Virgin America (VA) all matching on similar routes.However, Southwest also announced Tuesday the start of a three-day low-fare sale, with one-way domestic fares beginning at $49 and international fares starting at $99.Earlier signs of rapid capacity gains had sent airline stocks lower amid fears that the additional seats will weigh on airfares and profits.Late Monday, Hawaiian Airlines reported 4.9% in May passenger traffic growth that outpaced 0.3% capacity growth.Earlier Monday, American announced a change to its rewards program, with members now earnings 5 miles per dollar spent, and higher-status members earnings more miles per dollar.Shares of United closed up 2.9%. American climbed 3.5%, Delta rallied 2%, Southwest gained 3.3% and Hawaiian surged 5%. JetBlue rose 3.3%, and Spirit (SAVE) added 3.2%. But Alaska Air lagged somewhat with a 1.7% increase. Virgin America, which has agreed to a takeover by Alaska, edged up 0.4%.Shares of IBD's Transportation-Airline industry group collectively rose about 3%, though they remain well below their 50-day and 200-day moving averages after breaking support in April.RELATED:Delta Unit Revenue Slide Worsens; United Debuts ‘Polaris’
"
557,DAL,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) reported more weakness in a key revenue metric, while United Airlines (UAL) unveiled a new business-class seating option, amid an industry group's forecast for capacity outpacing demand.Delta said its consolidated passenger unit revenue fell 5% in May, worse than April's 4% drop, due to an unfavorable foreign-exchange environment and weaker airfare pricing power domestically for bookings made closer to flights' departure times.The carrier last month said it seeks to be the first big airline to return to positive unit revenue growth later this year.Delta's May traffic rose 3.3%, just under 3.5% capacity growth. Load factor, or seats filled, inched down to 85.3% from 85.4%.Shares closed down 2.4% on the stock market today.Meanwhile, United Airlines introduced a new international business class called Polaris, which features wall-partitioned seats that lie flat and offer direct aisle access.The seating option, United's attempt to compete more substantially with Delta and American Airlines (AAL) for business travelers, is set to become available in December.It also comes as the big three U.S. airlines resegment their cabins with ""basic economy"" and other offerings to compete with low-cost carriers like Spirit Airlines (SAVE).United shares dipped 0.2%, and American fell 0.9%, and Spirit added 0.8%.Ryanair (RYAAY), meanwhile, said traffic jumped 12% in May, while load factor rose 2 percentage points to 94%. Those results, the carrier said, came despite air traffic controller strikes in France, which have prompted scores of flight cancellations.Shares ended flat, remaining in buy range after breaking out from a cup base on Tuesday.The results come amid growing economic uncertainty worldwide. Ryanair has warned the economy could suffer and airfares could increase if the U.K. votes on June 23 to leave the European Union, although some argue such warnings are overstated. The carrier, known for its more-than-occasional irreverence, has offered a “Fly Home to Vote Remain” special, which some ""Brexit"" proponents have likened to bribery.More broadly, the International Air Transport Association, in conjunction with its Annual General Meeting this week, predicted that passenger demand would ease to 6.2% growth in 2016 from 7.4% growth last year.The industry group also predicted that carrying capacity growth of 6.8% would outpace demand.Investors have been looking for airlines to pare back capacity -- the carriers' supply of flights and available seats -- to be more aligned with actual demand.And the group's CEO, Tony Tyler, said ""we are probably nearing the peak of the positive stimulus from lower (oil) prices,"" echoing remarks made several months ago.Still, the group raised its 2016 airline-industry profit forecast Wednesday to $39.4 billion from an earlier estimate for $36.3 billion, helped as ever by cheap fuel, which has spurred aggressive industry expansion and competition since 2014.Airlines expect another three years of cheap oil, Bloomberg reported Wednesday. Wall Street, however, has been more cautious and sought more disciplined growth from the airlines.""The market is starting to price in margin deterioration as a result of higher jet fuel costs and the inability of airlines to offset increased costs with higher airfares,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker wrote in a research note Wednesday. ""We believe the next three months are crucial for airlines to prove that things have changed and that there is a correlation between jet fuel and unit revenue.""Airlines also came out against a proposal to screen passengers just before entering airports, saying they would increase traveler waiting times and wouldn't prevent terrorist attacks like the March 22 bombing of Brussels' Zaventem airport.

"
560,DAL,"Shares of Virgin America (VA) spiked 10.4% Monday after Bloomberg reported that JetBlue (JBLU) and Alaska Air Group (ALK) have offered to buy the air carrier.A deal could be announced as soon as next week. But analysts differ broadly on which airline would benefit more.Virgin America stock finished at 37.71 on the stock market today, its highest close since early December and near a breakout from a cup base. JetBlue rose 2.7%, and Alaska Air gained 1.1%.The news comes after Bloomberg on Wednesday reported that Virgin America was considering putting up all or part of itself for sale after receiving ""takeover interest."" Whether others would attempt to buy Virgin America was not known, Bloomberg said Monday, but speculation has swirled over who was among the possible bidders and whether the airline industry was ripe for more consolidation.Many analysts have seen JetBlue as a likely bidder for Virgin, given the carriers' similarities in fleets -- Airbus (EADSY) A320s and A321s -- and other services.""JetBlue would gain access to Hawaii, as Virgin America started flying there in the 2015 fourth quarter,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a note last week. ""Alaska Air Group could also play a role in industry consolidation; however, given Alaska relies on the (Boeing (BA)) 737 and loves the aircraft, we believe it is a bit unlikely they would be a bidder for the company.""However, competition in Dallas from Southwest (LUV) has proven to be stressful for Virgin and American Airlines (AAL), which means that it could be stressful for JetBlue.Airline Weekly said in its March 28 issue that JetBlue is ""the most obvious fit on paper, given what a Virgin merger would do to improve its lot on (transcontinental) markets, where the New York-based airline can still use some help. Then again, does it really want a big increase in transcon exposure while inheriting Virgin’s short-haul problems in Dallas and elsewhere?""An acquisition of Virgin by Delta Air Lines (DAL), which owns 49% of Virgin Atlantic, could boost its operations out of Los Angeles, Becker said. But she and others think the regulatory climate is a bit too frigid for Delta, United Airlines (UAL) or American Airlines to pull off an acquisition. Regulators' resistance could make a private-equity acquisition more likely. VX Holdings and Cyrus Capital Partners hold more than half of Virgin's shares.""United would surely love to eliminate its San Francisco competitor, but antitrust regulators are in no mood to let the Big Three get any bigger,"" Airline Weekly said. ""Southwest or Alaska wouldn’t mind getting bigger in California, but their B737 fleets don’t mesh well with Virgin’s A320s.""Hawaiian Holdings (HA), Becker also noted, ""could be an interesting player, as the company will be taking delivery of A321s beginning in 2017 and will use those aircraft to fly to more cities in the mid-continent area.""Wolfe Research, meanwhile, speculated last week that Etihad, a carrier based in the United Arab Emirates, might be interested in snapping up assets of Virgin America.""Etihad has equity ownership in seven global airlines -- none in the U.S.,"" Wolfe Research analyst Hunter Keay wrote last week. ""Cyrus Capital Partners owns 24% of VA. Cyrus tried to sell its stake last year but pulled its offering because of a low stock price. A sale of that entire stake to Etihad would be feasible, we believe, given it would comply with foreign ownership caps of 25% of voting stock. Note Etihad also has a 24% ownership stake in Virgin Australia.""Either way, any sale of Virgin America would follow the carrier's plans to boost future carrying capacity, a factor in the industry's merger wave several years ago. It would also come as signs of weakness in Europe's airlines invite more consolidation. And Wolfe Research this month forecast that Spirit Airlines (SAVE) and Frontier would eventually merge ""to avoid eating into each other’s growth prospects""""We do not believe U.S. airline industry consolidation is over,"" Becker said in a note on Monday. ""We expect there are likely to be more consolidating events especially at the (ultralow-cost carrier) and regional level. We also expect US airlines to continue to invest in foreign airlines (think Delta's investments in Virgin Atlantic and Aeromexico) as well as entity sales (think slot swaps / transactions).""
"
561,DAL,"Ryanair (RYAAY) debuted initiatives Tuesday meant to improve customer service, and JetBlue (JBLU) said it would expand its transcontinental Mint premium service.European budget carrier Ryanair is known for its no-frills pricing and amenities but the carrier announced plans to revamp aircraft interior for more legroom, offer auto check in, and lower ticket prices by passing on ""on lower oil savings"" to travelers.So far major U.S. carriers like American Airlines (AAL), Delta Air Lines (DAL) and United Airlines (UAL)  haven't passed on fuel savings to travelers as base fares have remained the same over the past two years despite oil's plunge from over $100 a barrel to about $40.Ryanair's U.S.-listed shares rose 0.45% in the stock market today.Meanwhile, U.S. discount carrier JetBlue said it would start offering its Mint premium service to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Las Vegas, San Diego and Seattle in 2017 and 2018.Mint launched in 2014, offering amenities like seats that fully recline into beds, to customers flying between New York and California. It also has flights out of Boston to destinations in the Caribbean.JetBlue used to fly passengers in coach-only cabins, similar to Southwest Airlines' (LUV) business model, but its Mint service turned the carrier into a sort of hybrid that  looks to capture high-margin business travelers and lower-margin vacationers.JetBlue shares fell 0.2%.After the market close, JetBlue said March traffic rose 12.1% vs. a year earlier, while capacity climbed 12.5%.The expansion of Mint comes a week after Alaska Air (ALK) beat out JetBlue to buy the high-value, low-fare Virgin America (VA) in a deal with a total equity value of $2.6 billion. The transaction is valued at $4 billion, including debt and aircraft operating leases, according to the airlines.On Tuesday, Alaska Air said its Horizon Air unit is buying 30 three-class Embraer (ERJ) E175 jets, in a deal valued at $2.8 billion. Horizon plans to use the jets for ""long, thin routes"" that are too far for its current Bombardier Q400 turobprops.Alaska Air shares rallied 1%, while Embraer climbed 0.9%.Image provided by Shutterstock.

562,DAL,"Delta Air Lines, graphics processor king Nvidia and deep-discount chain Ollie's Bargain Outlet were among a rather colorful array of highly rated growth stocks that pushed past buy points even as the main indexes lost some momentum with oil prices turning lower.The Dow Jones industrials rose 0.4%, the S&P 500 0.2% and the Nasdaq 0.1%. Gains faded as oil prices reversed from above $41 a barrel to back below $40.Volume was surging on both exchanges, boosted largely by the expiration of stock options, index options and related equity and equity-index futures.From the angle of industry groups, numerous medical groups rebounded to lead the market's upside in the stock market today, including systems and equipment, services, wholesale drug supply and hospitals.Delta (DAL) helped spearhead airlines higher into one of the leading groups of the day: up 2%. Delta rose 2.1% to 49.63, just past a 49.55 entry within a cup-with-handle base. Volume was running 7% above average pace; one would ideally like to see turnover zoom at least 40% above normal levels. Delta trades on average 10.4 million shares each day.The high within the cup is 52.77. The buy point is found by adding a dime to the highest price within the three-week handle, or 49.45. Delta's cup with handle also passes the midpoint test -- that is, the mathematical midpoint within the handle (47.73) is higher than the cup's midpoint (46.40). This is good news. It means Delta rebounded strongly enough during its latest correction to begin building a downward-slanting handle at prices near its 52-week high, suggesting healthy institutional demand for shares.Delta scores strong ratings from IBD, including a 92 Composite Rating and a 98 Earnings Per Share Rating. The global airline is benefiting from lower fuel prices and even operates its own oil refinery to cut operating costs. Wall Street sees Q1 profit soaring 189% to $1.30 a share, on top of a 36% jump in earnings per share in the same quarter in 2015. Analysts also see full-year profit up 48% to $6.82 a share. Nvidia (NVDA) (99 Composite) throttled 3.7% higher, sailing past a 33.16 cup-with-handle entry.  The 5% buy zone from that buy point extends to 34.82.Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI) (99 Composite), which has been featured several times in IBD's market columns over the past few weeks, including IBD Industry Themes, rallied more than 7%, surging past a 22.63 buy point in what appears to be a six-week cuplike structure that sits within a longer, deeper IPO base.Ollie's, which has a commanding presence in the mid-Atlantic region, went public July 16 at 16 a share. On its debut, the stock rallied as much as 44% to a high of 22.99 before quickly settling back.

594,DAL,"With a major order from Delta Air Lines (DAL), Canada's Bombardier is ready to disrupt the Boeing (BA)-Airbus (EADSY) duopoly, according to a report Tuesday from Moody's.Earlier this year, Bombardier scored an order for 75 narrow-body CS100 jets from Delta, with an option for 50 more. It was the largest-ever order for Bombardier's commercial aircraft business, and Delta is expected to become the biggest C Series customer, Moody's said.Delta likely chose the Bombardier jets over Boeing and Airbus models, as Bombardier ""has the earliest availability for planes of this type, given the huge backlogs of Boeing and Airbus,"" and the Canadian company offered a steep pricing discount.Bombardier also ""likely has the most technically proficient model in this class of aircraft,"" focused on the 100-150 seat market. The plane features a new geared turbofan engine from United Technologies’ (UTX) Pratt & Whitney division that Moody's says offers a cost advantage over its peers.Airbus ended 2015 with a backlog of 6,787 aircraft with a total value of $996.3 billion at list prices, beating Boeing for the second straight year. Boeing’s year-end backlog was 5,795 commercial jets, but it didn’t give a list-price value.Boeing shares closed down less than 0.1% in the stock market today. Airbus jumped 2.7%. Delta added 1.6% and United Tech rose 1%.Meanwhile, Boeing faces a growing threat from its main rival. While its market share has topped Airbus' 60% to 40% for the past 10 years, Airbus has been winning more narrow-body orders and will catch Boeing in total deliveries by 2018, Moody's said.
"
595,DAL,"Irish budget carrier Ryanair (RYAAY) on Monday said it was ""cautious"" on airfare guidance heading into fiscal 2017 and warned of weaker financial results due to expansion from rivals, the fallout from the Brussels terror attacks, and the U.K.'s referendum next month on whether to stay in the European Union.The carrier expects 13% profit growth for its fiscal 2017, well down from 2016's 43% surge. The forecast, the company said, depends on the U.K. currency's strength, winter yields -- a reflection of airfare pricing power -- and close-in summer bookings, or flights booked closer to their departure date.Shares closed up 1.2% at 80.31, hitting resistance at their 200-day moving average, as they form a flat base with a 87.04 buy point. Delta Air Lines (DAL) fell 0.35%, American Airlines (AAL) lost 0.9% and United Airlines (UAL) dropped 0.65%.Still, Ryanair said forward bookings were getting stronger and fuel hedges were cheaper for this year and next. The company also said it expected 9% traffic growth this year and sees load factor, or seats filled, staying similar to 2016's 93%.""Our competition can no longer compete with Ryanair's low costs, and the gap is widening between ourselves and themselves,"" CFO Neil Sorahan said in a company earnings presentation.Nonetheless, Ryanair said pricing would be ""softer, particularly in Q1 & Q4,"" which won't benefit from the Easter holiday. Greater flight capacity from competitors, who like the rest of the industry, have benefited from cheap fuel amid a worldwide oil glut, are also likely to weigh on airfares.As European rivals and even Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and United Airlines compete more aggressively on economy offerings, the company touted the success of its Always Getting Better service.Ryanair said it had improved schedules, passenger options and added leg room on flights, and said it would work on enhancing its business travel options. The company also said it would work on easier mobile payment options and offer lower checked bag fees.""While AGB Years 1 & 2 were about fixing things that our customers disliked and improving our offering, Year 3 will be about digital acceleration and innovation, particularly through Ryanair Labs,"" Ryanair said in its earnings release.Revenue rose 16% to 6.5 billion euros ($7.3 billion), just missing analyst forecasts. Net income jumped 43% to 1.242 bil euros, as unit costs fell 6% during the year.The company said the fourth quarter took a hit from 500 flight cancellations following the attacks in Brussels in March.It also said that recently, ""unjustified strikes"" from air traffic controllers have resulted in more than 200 additional flight cancellations, which would likely hurt yields for the first quarter.""Sterling weakness in the run up to the Brexit referendum on June 23"" could also harm Ryanair's results, the company said.Ryanair said it was ""actively campaigning for a 'Remain' vote,"" saying that the UK's departure from the EU would hurt the economy over the next two to three years.

Bristol-Meyers stock fell 0.3% for the week, while Merck rose 0.3%.Bristol's Opdivo-Yervoy combo also succeeded against small-cell lung cancer, to the detriment of AbbVie (ABBV), whose recent $5.8 billion buyout deal with Stemcentryx was questioned when Stemcentryx’s lead drug Rova-T missed expectations in a trial treating the same disease. AbbVie fell 6.1% during the week.Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) hit a six-year low Tuesday when its Q1 earnings missed consensus and it cut its guidance again.

"
598,DAL,"Salesforce.com (CRM) is fortifying its kingdom on a cloud, but now the question is whether that automatically comes with an acquisition-proof moat.Salesforce's $2.8 billion buyout last week of e-commerce platform Demandware (DWRE) beefs up its arsenal as Silicon Valley continues to engage in turf battles atop virtual thunderheads. The rumored bidding war over Demandware is said to have included Oracle (ORCL) and Adobe (ADBE), which both compete -- to varying degrees -- with Salesforce’s cloud-based customer-relationship-management software.But few players now seem to have the full suite of enterprise tools that Salesforce offers. By adding an enterprise cloud e-commerce platform to its product lineup, it allows Salesforce to ""own the entire customer journey,"" as Piper Jaffray analyst Alex Zukin put it. Salesforce's products involve the first contacts with customers to sales and transactions and on to service issues.""That’s the holy grail,"" Zukin told Investor's Business Daily.Is it enough to put Salesforce out of reach? With Salesforce's market cap at well over $56 billion, and with an increasing number of acquisitions under its belt, it might be getting too formidable to be a takeover target.The Demandware buy comes on the heels of Salesforce’s announcement that it has chosen the web services unit of Amazon (AMZN) as its ""preferred public cloud infrastructure provider,"" expanding its existing partnership and using Amazon’s cloud provider in certain markets abroad to ""help bring new infrastructure online more quickly and efficiently.""Deutsche Bank analyst Karl Keirstead called the agreement a ""big deal.""""It is a major endorsement of (Amazon Web Services), and Salesforce becomes the first of the larger 'incumbent' (software-as-a-service) vendors to give up on the idea that they need to own/control their own data center infrastructure footprint,"" he wrote. Keirstead added, though, that the deal materially shrinks the chances of Microsoft (MSFT) acquiring Salesforce, a rumored partnership in years past.Piper Jaffray's Zukin isn't so sure. He recalled chatter of years past that has included not only Microsoft but Oracle as a potential Salesforce buyer.""I think Salesforce is a unique strategic asset and I wouldn’t put it past someone else from buying them over the next couple of years,"" Zukin said.Zukin speculated in early May that a separate deal, in which Salesforce would build its new Internet of Things service on Amazon’s cloud, could lead to a ""cozier"" relationship between the two, perhaps in the form of a strategic sales partnership. Amazon also could spin out its web services unit and merge it with Salesforce, or even acquire the company outright, with the latter being the least likely, he speculated.""Fundamentally we view (Salesforce) as a clear beneficiary of a larger 'Cloud Game of Thrones' being waged among (Oracle, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet (GOOGL)'s Google) for the Cloud Platform 'Iron Throne,'"" Zukin wrote on May 12. (Coincidentally, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff is a distant cousin of ""Game of Thrones"" co-showrunner David Benioff.)Zukin still thinks Amazon could annex Salesforce in some capacity, though. When asked if the Demandware acquisition put Salesforce at odds with Amazon -- given that Demandware builds e-commerce solutions for individual businesses, ostensibly guiding them away from selling their wares on Amazon -- he demurred.""You could almost argue the opposite case,"" he said. ""It almost makes Salesforce an interesting acquisition to Amazon.""While Amazon is the rumored Salesforce acquirer du jour, Zukin’s money is on Google’s name being added to the mix next year.""Depending on who bought them, it would make tremendous sense,"" said Zukin. ""A combination of (Amazon Web Services) and Salesforce.com is a killer combination that would put (others) on the defensive.""""That would make Amazon the new IBM (IBM),"" he said.Salesforce’s deal with Amazon Web Services is believed to clock in at $400 million through 2020, according to a Wall Street Journal report citing someone familiar with the matter, plus a recent SEC filing that refers to a purchase commitment with an unnamed third-party provider for ""certain infrastructure services for a period of four years.""""As Salesforce looks to leverage their services internationally, I think they’re going to do so utilizing that Amazon infrastructure rather than going out and leasing data centers in international markets,"" said Morningstar analyst Rodney Nelson. ""It’s a lot easier to just rent capacity from Amazon, where they already have a presence overseas.""He called the deal the ""right move,"" but said it’s hard to predict how that relationship could expand down the road.At the very least, Salesforce's moves are well-timed. More businesses are feeling comfortable moving their data to the public cloud as well as looking to save on technology costs, Nelson says. That has resulted in an accelerated migration to cloud services.Salesforce, which is seen hitting the $8 billion mark in revenue this year, is largely expected to benefit as Amazon, Google, Microsoft and others stake out their space in cloud computing.And for its part, Salesforce right now sees itself as more the hunter than the hunted.""The M&A season right now is the most intense, most exciting I have ever seen,"" Salesforce Chief Executive Marc Benioff said last week on CNBC. ""I have never seen more deals and more things happening. We’re not winning every deal; this is just a deal that we were actually able to get done. We’re excited that we could actually get Demandware, and it’s tough to get deals done in this environment because everybody’s positioning for growth for next year.""Still, it wouldn’t be a true game of thrones unless more land grabs were on the horizon.""I think we’re already seeing the M&A market heat up,"" said Nelson, noting Oracle’s acquisitions in recent weeks of Opower, which provides cloud services to utilities, and Textura, a construction software firm.""We’ve also already seen the privatization market intensify,"" said Nelson, highlighting Marketo and Qlik’s recent moves to go private, ""So I think we’re going to see activity remain high for a while.""The service and app clouds are Salesforce’s fastest-growing products, say analysts, and Zukin says its new Demandware-based ""commerce cloud"" could become its fastest grower. The company says it expects to create ""yet another billion-dollar cloud"" with the purchase.Salesforce’s clients span across industries and include the likes of GE (GE), Delta Air Lines (DAL) and Comcast’s (CMCSA) NBCUniversal.Shares now trade in the lower end of buy territory after breaking out of a period of consolidation with an 83 entry point and recovering from an early February dive that sent the stock tumbling 20% over the course of two trading sessions to a 16-month low.The plunge was prompted by Tableau’s (DATA) disappointing full-year earnings guidance that sliced Tableau’s shares nearly in half on Feb. 5, which weighed heavily on software stocks, including ServiceNow (NOW) and Splunk (SPLK).Tableau’s shares have only recovered slightly, while Salesforce shares came back to hit a new high of 84.48 on May 26. Shares rose 0.7% to 83.10 in morning trading on the stock market today.

601,DAL,"Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) dropped Thursday after the disappearance of an EgyptAir flight raised new fears of terrorism.Egypt's civil aviation minister said the cause was more likely terrorism than any technical problems, but the exact reasons for the flight's disappearance were still unclear. U.S. intelligence officials said there is evidence an explosion took place on the plane, NBC News reported. Debris from a plane was found near Greece.Shares of Delta closed down 1.7%, American lost 1.4%, and United slid 2.8% in the stock market today. It wasn't much better for other national carriers: Southwest (LUV) fell 1.7% and JetBlue (JBLU) eased 1%, while Spirit Airlines (SAVE) dipped 0.4%.Sixty-six people were aboard the plane, EgyptAir Flight 804, which was headed to Cairo from Paris and lost radar contact early Thursday. The Airbus (EADSY) jet ""swerved and then plunged"" toward the Mediterranean, Greece's defense minister said, according to CNN.The big aircraft companies felt the pinch as a result, though the jet's maker Airbus wasn't hit as hard as Boeing (BA). Shares of Boeing fell 2.2%, while Airbus rose 0.4%.Shares of Delta, American and United fell by about the same level following the November attacks in Paris and the Brussels attacks in March. But neither of those attacks involved the use of jetliners or resulted in any extended sell-off, perhaps because investors anticipated that travel demand would rebound. Some airlines have recently suggested the impact of the attacks in Brussels was largely short-lived or offset by other factors.While German carrier Lufthansa this month reported a first-quarter net loss, Chief Financial Officer Simone Menne said the attacks in Brussels had not weighed significantly on the company's financial performance, according to the Wall Street Journal. However, the newspaper said, bookings made well in advance were less common.And Delta and American have said demand has held up despite the attacks.""In our core European markets, U.S. point-of-sale demand was strong and recovered quickly following the events in Brussels,"" Delta President Glen Hauenstein said on the carrier's first-quarter conference call in April.""Demand across the trans-Atlantic though, particularly in light of the Brussels tragedy, has remained pretty strong and pretty resilient,"" American Airlines President J. Scott Kirby said during the company's Q1 call last month.But the sentiment hasn't been as positive elsewhere. United said the after-effects of those attacks would likely weigh on the second quarter, but it added that demand generally tends to rebound after such incidents.""I think the recent events and the tragedy in Brussels has impacted bookings,"" Chief Revenue Officer James Compton said on United's Q1 call in April. ""What we generally see is a slowdown in bookings after events like that. Those begin to pick back up, but quite frankly you lose days, even weeks of the booking curve.""And Air France said this month that for its long-haul flights, ""it was a mixed story, with, of course, a negative impact of the geopolitical unrest and the aftermath of the Paris attacks and what happened in Brussels at the end of March.""The parent of British Airways, International Airlines Group (ICAGY), also said it would pull back on its expansion plans after the attacks in Brussels hurt travel demand.

629,DAL,"A winter storm bearing down on the East Coast will likely have a significant impact on sales at publicly traded restaurants with a large exposure to the area, with Darden Restaurants (DRI) and Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) considered to be two of the most vulnerable.Winter Storm Jonas is expected to unload heavy snow and possible blizzard conditions on large swaths of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, including major metro areas like Washington, D.C., New York and Philadelphia. Because the storm will hit over the weekend, when a lot of eateries see heavy traffic, restaurant operators are bracing for a big slowdown in revenue.""We see the snowstorm headed for the East Coast, which to date has had a rather uneventful winter, as a significant weather event for this weekend,"" Maxim Group analyst Stephen Anderson noted in a Thursday morning report. That's especially true for full-service restaurant chains that depend on weekend traffic for a big chunk of their business, he said.""Casual-dining restaurants with a significant exposure to weekend traffic in the Northeast, particularly Darden and Texas Roadhouse, will be most affected by the storm,"" Anderson said, adding that both companies have more than 20% of their units in the affected states.Anderson sees a more limited impact on quick-service and fast-casual chains, with the most affected there expected to be Dunkin' Brands (DNKN), Panera Bread (PNRA) and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG).""However, we contend that these chains can take some solace in the fact that they are more dependent on weekday traffic than on weekend traffic, and that temperatures in the area are forecast to rebound above freezing for the work week, thereby minimizing the potential impact for these names,"" Anderson said.Shares of Darden, whose holdings include the Olive Garden and Capital Grille chains, rose 1.1% on the stock market today. Texas Roadhouse fell 1.25%, Dunkin' rose 1% and Panera fell 0.65%. Chipotle fell 0.9% as it attempted to crawl back up from the pounding it has taken following E. coli and norovirus outbreaks at some of its restaurants.Meanwhile, airlines have issued warnings due to the storm. Southwest Airlines (LUV) announced a travel advisory stating that its Friday and Saturday services will likely be delayed, diverted or cancelled.

637,DAL,"American Airlines (AAL) on Friday said its carrying capacity growth this year would accelerate from last year's, while it anticipates higher costs due to a recent five-year labor deal struck with employees.The carrier, which flies more passengers than any other U.S. rival, forecast about 3% capacity growth this year, targeting the high end of the 2%-3% growth view given in October. Capacity rose 1% last year.The forecast follows a year of concerns over whether airlines' expansion plans, inspired by much cheaper fuel, had reached a boiling point. As airlines like American lowered airfares to compete with lower-cost carriers such as Spirit Airlines (SAVE) and Southwest (LUV), they took a hit on passenger unit revenue.American's passenger revenue per available seat mile fell 6% in the fourth quarter, the midpoint of its forecast given last month.Shares closed up 2.2% in the stock market today.American's capacity growth has been restrained compared to some of its competitors. Earlier this month, Southwest, with which American is locked in a fierce rivalry in Dallas, said it sees capacity growth of 5%-6% in 2016.American's Q4 earnings per share surged 31.5% to $2.00, topping consensus by 3 cents, as fuel costs sank by 41%. Revenue slid 5.2% to $9.6 billion, matching views.During Q4, American booked a $592 million write-down on ticket sales proceeds held by Venezuela, which has placed restrictions on converting sales made in its currency into dollars and put off repatriating the money to American Airlines.American expects Q1 pretax margin of 12%-14%, stronger than the forecast United Continental's (UAL), whose performance has lagged Delta and American on many fronts.American, which has opted out of fuel-hedge contracts that commit it in advance to certain fuel prices, expects to pay $1.19-$1.24 a gallon for fuel this year, down from its 2015 average cost of $1.72 a gallon.Cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other items, is seen rising 0.5%-2.5% in 2016 due to the new contract with pilots, customer service staff, flight attendants and others.During its earnings call, management said the spread of the Zika virus in the Americas had not yet affected travel demand.Shares of United rose 4.7%, and Southwest gained 4%. Delta Air Lines (DAL) climbed 2.5%.

"
640,DAL,"Shares of Boeing (BA) rival Airbus (EADSY) tumbled after Qatar Airways said it scrapped its first order for one of Airbus' A320neo planes and could cancel more following months of software and engine-related problems with the jet.That's bad news for United Technologies (UTX), who owns Pratt & Whitney, which produces many of the engines for the single-aisle, fuel-efficient planes. But it could represent an opportunity for Boeing and General Electric (GE) and French engine-maker Safran, who run a joint venture that also produces an engine for jet.Qatar Airways said it would think about purchasing A320neos with the engine from the joint venture and could also go with Boeing's 737 Max, according to the Wall Street Journal.U.S.-listed shares of Airbus closed down 1.8% in the stock market today. Boeing rose 0.4%. United Technologies dipped 0.4%, and GE also lost 0.4%.Qatar Airways' decision to abandon the order follows months during which the carrier publicly aired its dissatisfaction with the A320neo delays.“It is making a huge impact on my bottom line,” Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker said, according to the Journal. “We are quite frankly screaming.”In April, Al Baker was more subdued, but not by much.""We have talked to Airbus, they know very well that we're a very unhappy, very unhappy customer,"" he said, according to Reuters.Near the end of last year, Qatar Airways, who was set to be the first to receive the planes, decided not to take the first A320neo order until Pratt & Whitney removed some operational restrictions on the engines. German carrier Lufthansa, who was next in line to receive the first jet, also didn't get it when promised. Other problems with the engines have followed.Meanwhile, Delta Air Lines (DAL) and United Airlines (UAL) are among the possible suitors who could fund and then eventually buy Panama-based carrier Avianca, the Journal also reported.If a merger agreement takes hold, it would continue the worldwide trend in recent years of airline consolidation. Such consolidation has helped filter out competition and temper capacity growth in an industry that has been plagued by bankruptcies over the decades and often accused by Wall Street of undisciplined expansion.Alaska Air Group (ALK) in April said it would buy Virgin America (VA). That combination could help box rival JetBlue (JBLU) out of the West Coast but present challenges given Virgin's struggles to compete on profitability and lower fares.Delta shares were down 1.9%, with United also down 1.9%. American Airlines (AAL) gapped down 3.4%.
"
641,DAL,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) on Monday raised its dividend 50% and said it would cut its expected carrying-capacity growth to ""below 2%"" for the second half of the year, part to become ""the first network carrier to return to positive unit revenue growth later this year.""The carrier also said it would shave a percentage point off its fourth-quarter capacity growth plans, with a focus on cutting its expansion in ""underperforming markets"" domestically and in the Pacific region.Delta Air Lines rose 3.4% on the stock market today, helped by the increase in its annual payout to 81 cents. Delta rose back above its 200-day average, moving just above or below that key line over the  last  several sessions.American Airlines (AAL) rose 1.9%, United Airlines (UAL) added 1.7% and Southwest (LUV) also rallied 1.6%.Delta's forecast, included in an SEC filing, follows the company's promise last month to ""be disciplined with our business in the face of volatile fuel prices"" and turn around ever-falling unit revenue. Delta also said then that it would modify fall capacity levels if unit revenue did not show signs of improvement.""While lower fuel costs are providing huge benefits for our business, there is a lot of uncertainty in the global environment and we know fuel won’t stay low permanently,"" CFO Paul Jacobson said on the company's Q1 conference call in April.But the industry's inability to pull unit revenue into positive territory and pare back expansion plans have continued to irritate investors. While low oil prices have helped polish the bottom line for airlines -- and allow them to shower investors with buybacks and dividend increases -- Wall Street has remained concerned about airlines' ability to operate more efficiently.Delta's stock has fallen since last month's earnings season, when the company and rivals issued disappointing forecasts for capacity growth and unit revenue. American, United, Southwest and others have followed suit.Passenger unit revenue -- or how much money an airline makes from passengers compared to flight capacity -- is often used as a way to assess an airline's efficiency and profitability. But the metric has fallen in tandem with the drop in oil prices.Low fuel costs inspired airlines to expand -- or overexpand, some might say -- since 2014. But competition from low-cost rivals like Spirit Airlines (SAVE), weaker demand and a stronger dollar have caused unit revenue to fall across the business. Airfare wars in some markets haven't helped.Some analysts have said Delta could be the first airline to turn out positive unit revenue growth since the drop in oil prices. But the company's own target for a unit-revenue increase has been delayed.""While we are not there yet, we understand the importance of getting back to positive revenue,"" President Glen Hauenstein said on Delta's Q1 call. ""Volatility and closer yields and challenges in Europe may mean we achieve our goal a few months later than we previously had expected, but we continued to target reaching the inflection point this year.""In the filing Monday, Delta said it would defer the delivery of four widebody aircraft from 2018 to 2019-2020. The decision, Cowen said in a research note, was also intended ""to address the current weakness in the international market, where there is still too much capacity on the north Atlantic.""Delta also said that volumes remained positive for many corporate travelers, but noted that ""fares continue to be depressed.""
"
642,DAL,"It turns out that Dubai-based Emirates -- the world's biggest international airline best known for its ultracosmopolitan plane interiors and aggressive overseas expansion -- has to deal with the same problems that less flashy rivals like Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) face.The carrier -- whose growth plans have been a headache for the U.S. carriers -- said Tuesday that a measure of how full its seats were fell to 76.5% during its most recent fiscal year from 79.6%. The slide came amid a 13% jump in seating capacity and ""lingering economic uncertainty and strong competition in many markets.""What's more, Emirates' overall revenue fell 4% to $23.2 billion, with a tough currency exchange environment costing the company $1.6 billion. Passenger revenue fell by 3%. The stronger dollar also prompted a 10% decline in the carrier's passenger yield -- a measure of how much an airline gets from airfare as it relates to distance flown.Shares of Delta closed up 1.3% on the stock market today, United climbed 2.8%, and American added 2.5%. Southwest (LUV) rallied 1.6% and Alaska Air Group (ALK) rose 0.8%. JetBlue (JBLU), which has a codeshare agreement with Emirates, fell 0.6%.American also stuck to its forecast Tuesday for a 6%-8% drop in second-quarter consolidated passenger unit revenue and said that April traffic fell 0.2% year over year, with capacity up 1.3%.""Looking at the year ahead, we expect that the low oil prices will continue to be a double-edged sword – a boon for our operating costs, but a bane for global business and consumer confidence,"" Emirates CEO Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum said in a statement. ""The strong U.S. dollar against major currencies will remain a challenge, as will the looming threat of protectionism in some countries.""The results follow a year in which Emirates expanded its fleet to 251 aircraft and broadened its passenger flight coverage to eight new areas, including Orlando, Fla. Those moves have posed stiffer competition stateside and abroad for Delta, American and United.The carrier now operates in many major U.S. cities, and has drawn attention over the years for its in-cabin bars, spas and state-of-the-art entertainment options on some flights. But terror attacks in Europe, where Emirates gets nearly a third of its revenue, and elsewhere dampened travelers' spirits.The results also come as U.S. airlines continue to try investors' patience over ever-growing capacity and falling unit revenue, a much-watched metric that is often a reflection of an airline's efficiency and ability to draw as much money as possible from passengers.Many analysts feel airlines have lacked sufficient restraint in their expansion plans, and worry they'll end up with too many seats compared to passengers who want to fly. Some airlines during last month's earnings season said they would pull back capacity growth to improve unit revenue, which has fallen due to inadequate demand and a stronger dollar.
"
643,DAL,"Southwest (LUV) said Monday it still expects a ""modest increase"" in second-quarter operating unit revenue, while Delta Air Lines (DAL) and Spirit Airlines (SAVE) reportedly raised fares.Southwest's April passenger traffic rose 4.7% from a year earlier, outpacing a capacity increase of 4.3%. Load factor, a measure of seats filled, edged up to 83.4%.Shares closed up 1.1% in the stock market today and continued to find support at their 200-day line. Airlines stocks sank last month after giving a disappointing Q2 outlook on unit revenue, which measures how much money airlines take in compared to available capacity.Delta shares rose 1.2%. Rivals United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) were flat and down 0.3%, respectively. Spirit fell 0.6%.With massive cheap-fuel-induced profits essentially a given over the past two years or so, investors have increasingly turned their attention toward airlines' ability to pull back on capacity growth and wring more profit from passengers.Passenger unit revenue, often a way to look at how effectively airlines do just that, has fallen over that time as airlines expanded, lowering prices to compete with low-cost carriers like Spirit. The stronger dollar has also hurt unit revenue, and investors have been concerned about airlines' capacity growth, overshooting actual demand.Airlines have said they would pare back capacity if needed to improve unit revenue. The question has been when, exactly, the key metric will get out of negative territory.Delta and Spirit both boosted some fare prices last week, Cowen & Co. noted in a report today, adding that traffic results for April so far ""appear to be better than anticipated.""Delta last week said passenger unit revenue fell 4% in April. Traffic rose 2.7%, while capacity climbed 2.5%. Delta is expected to be the first airline to turn unit revenue around. But the carrier has pushed back its target to achieve flat-or-better revenue from this summer to the fall.""A key question is whether carriers will remain disciplined and remove capacity if demand deteriorates in an environment where returns are still elevated relative to history because of low fuel,"" Credit Suisse analyst Julie Yates wrote in a report last week.

645,DAL,"Stocks moved into Wednesday's session toting narrow losses in weak trade. The Nasdaq sagged 0.4%, the S&P 500 took a 0.3% hit, and the Dow Jones industrial average pared off 0.2%.Volume was sharply lower — down about 17% on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq vs. trade at the same time Tuesday.Early losses on the stock market today pulled the S&P 500 back toward a test of its 50-day moving average. The Nasdaq is further above that line of support but still a bit too close for comfort.Weak pending home sales numbers from the National Association of Realtors didn't help. November sales dipped 0.9%, the group said, below October's 0.2% increase and well below consensus forecasts for a 0.5% gain.Oil prices eased up from early losses, but they still remained down by about 2%, with both West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude hovering around the $37 mark, ahead of the release of Energy Information Administration's inventories data at 10:30 a.m.Most of the Dow industrials opened lower. Apple (AAPL) led the downside with a 1.2% decline.Airlines were under early pressure, with Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Continental Holdings (UAL), American Airlines Group (AAL) all down between 1% and 2%.Among leaders, Universal Display (OLED) rose 3.6% and pulled out to an early lead among IBD 50 stocks. The stock was apparently lifted by an Electronic Times article naming LG Display (LG) and Samsung — both Universal customers — as suppliers of new screen technology for upcoming versions of Apple's iPhone. The gain put Universal just below its Dec. 7 high, with the stock moving briefly back above a 55.93 buy point earlier in the session.

755,DAL,"In an industry of vanished perks, JetBlue Airways (JBLU) has long stood out from its peers for offering everyday amenities, such as generous leg room and free baggage checks, at no extra cost.
"
756,DAL,"It famously led the way in placing TVs in front of passenger seats, now ubiquitous on most airlines.
"
757,DAL,"But going the extra mile for passengers didn't translate into extra dollars, analysts and investors complained. Unit revenue and ancillary sales, which include baggage fees, lagged peers.
"
758,DAL,"""The fact of the matter is, customers have not shown a willingness to pay more for a better product,"" said Jim Corridore, airline equity analyst with S&P Capital IQ.
"
759,DAL,"JetBlue isn't lagging peers anymore. ""It's clearly outperforming at this point,"" said Helane Becker, an analyst with Cowen & Co.
"
760,DAL,"""Unit revenue has outperformed the industry. Their balance sheet has improved dramatically. You can see that in the stock price,"" up about 63% year-to-date.
"
761,DAL,"What changed? JetBlue's relatively weak financial and stock performances led to a series of changes that cut away some perks and added a premium business class at a price below rivals.
"
762,DAL,"Several executives left last year, followed by the announcement in September that CEO Dave Barger would leave when his contract expired in February of this year.
"
763,DAL,"New Captain, New Initiatives
"
764,DAL,"He was replaced by company executive Robin Hayes, a former British Airways executive, who also holds the title of president.
"
765,DAL,"Under Barger's final months, the firm implemented some new initiatives to get customers to pay up for more, such as a premium ""Mint"" business-class service launched in mid-2014 on flights between New York and the West Coast. It'll be expanded to flights between Boston and San Francisco in March.
"
766,DAL,"At the end of June, JetBlue started charging for bags that used to fly free, part of ""Fare Options,"" a new tiered pricing scheme that still includes free checked bag options.
"
767,DAL,"For this past September, Deutsche Bank projects that JetBlue will have been the only airline of the top six U.S.-based carriers to show a year-over-year increase in passenger revenue per available seat mile — up an estimated 2%. It forecast declines of 3.5% at Southwest Airlines (LUV) and up to 7% declines at American Airlines (AAL). 
"
768,DAL,"On Friday, Delta Air Lines (DAL) was the first of the carriers to report on September: unit revenue was down 5%.
"
769,DAL,"Beginning in mid-2016, JetBlue will add 15 more seats to A320 aircraft, for a total of 165 seats. But analysts say that its leg room will still be more generous than the competition's.
"
770,DAL,"JetBlue says that all of the new initiatives will add $450 million in operating income, starting in 2017.
"
771,DAL,"In a research note last month, the Buckingham Research Group estimated that the current Mint service alone likely generates an incremental $120 million in revenue and 10 cents per share annually. If expanded to the airline's other routes of 2,000 miles or more, the report noted, it could translate to $500 million in incremental revenue and 40 cents in earnings.
"
772,DAL,"JetBlue is the fifth largest U.S.-based airline by revenue, after Delta, American, United Continental (UAL) and Southwest.
"
773,DAL,"The New York-based carrier flies to more than 90 cities in the U.S., the Caribbean and Latin America. Its leading markets are New York, Boston, Fort Lauderdale, Los Angeles, Orlando and San Juan, Puerto Rico. Service to Mexico City launched on Oct. 1 from Orlando and Fort Lauderdale.
"
774,DAL,"JetBlue is essentially positioned between the consolidated legacy carriers, with their extensive routes, and ultralow-fare airlines such as Spirit Airlines (SAVE) and Allegiant Travel (ALGT), which boost cheap fares with add-on fees.
"
775,DAL,"""It still has lower costs than peers, but it is not a low-fare carrier in the traditional sense,"" Corridore said.
"
776,DAL,"While changes made so far have already had a positive impact on JetBlue's financial performance, so have lower fuel costs and easing competition in key markets.
"
777,DAL,"JetBlue is benefiting from rivals' relatively low-capacity increases in its key markets New York, Boston and Fort Lauderdale, Becker says.
"
778,DAL,"While capacity increases are up around 3% in JetBlue markets, she adds, the airlines' average is somewhat higher, and some markets such as Seattle and Dallas are up in the double digits.
"
779,DAL,"""Nobody's really been growing aggressively in New York and Boston and to some extent Fort Lauderdale, which are all big markets for JetBlue,"" she said.
"
780,DAL,"Operating income in the second quarter doubled from a year earlier to $282 million. Per-share earnings jumped 132% to 44 cents per share.
"
781,DAL,"Passenger revenue per available seat mile — a closely watched metric in the airline industry — increased 1.4%. Revenue passenger miles rose 8.7% on a capacity increase of 7.5%, for a load factor of 85.6%, up 1 percentage point.
"
782,DAL,"Meanwhile, JetBlue's operating expense per available seat mile decreased 8.6%. Excluding fuel and profit sharing, it rose a slight 0.6%.
"
783,DAL,"With lower oil prices and only 19% of its fuel consumption hedged, JetBlue's realized fuel price in the quarter fell 31% to $2.13 per gallon.
"
784,DAL,"Oil Eases Slower Sales Growth
"
785,DAL,"Lower-priced oil — down more than 60% from a year ago — is a ""good trade-off"" to slower growing airline-industry revenue this year, Corridore says. Jet fuel accounts for a third of an airline's costs.
"
786,DAL,"With domestic revenue growth slowing, capacity growth in the industry will remain tempered, analysts say. That's unlike past stretches following oil-price declines, when airlines would order new planes using their excess cash.
"
787,DAL,"Now U.S. carriers (JetBlue included) have been using excess cash to buy back shares and pay down debt, noted Goldman Sachs analysts in a report on Sept. 30.
"
788,DAL,"Still, JetBlue expects capacity to increase at the high end of its 7%-to-9% range for the full year. It sees operating expenses per available seat mile rising 0% to 1.5%, excluding fuel and profit-sharing.
"
789,DAL,"The airline's earnings for the year are seen as growing 170% over last year to $1.89 per share, according to Thomson Reuters.
"
790,DAL,"More tailwinds could be ahead for JetBlue. The carrier's strong presence in Florida, especially South Florida, should put it in a favorable competitive position when travel to Cuba opens, Corridore says.

822,DAL,"So JPM reported results last night and it appears that assets are 'shrinking' (which hits the bottom line) - but that is not a bad thing (in this case).....they WANT to shrink in order to simplify ahead of new capital rules that would raise expenses for the bank with new surcharges......so everyone in the pool! Now yes - revenue fell 7% - but some of that is by design as they shed businesses. Analysts were quick to put the positive spin on it....Steven Chubak at Nomura had this to say -
"
823,DAL,"""It's reassuring to see JP Morgan make progress in getting smaller and simpler,"" emphasizing the fact that 'shrinking' could help increase their dividend and/or share buyback program by billions of dollars
"
824,DAL,"On first blush the reported number was $1.32/sh vs. exp of $1.37....But if you add back in the tax benefit (some $2.2 bil) of shrinking their business then the reported number goes to $1.68 share. Revenues in the fixed income part of the business took a hit, but revenues from equity trading were up - given all the volatility of late. Return on equity ROSE to 12% vs. the 10% last year (this is a big positive).

All in all - this report was not bad and not unexpected....Based on the chart - I would expect to see JPM stabilize right here at the $60.50 level - but I suppose we will have to see how the others report.....

It is not uncommon to see the mkt rally as we go into earnings but then stumble when earnings are released, especially in a volatile, uncertain economic environment, hence will we get a ""buy the rumor, sell the news"" trading environment? Will we realize that the S&P is a bit 'overvalued' given the possible deterioration in earnings that we could see?

852,DAL,"Whatever the Federal Reserve decides on Thursday, the market seems to already be making this point: Don't lose confidence in the American consumer. Judging by the makeup of the weekly Big Cap 20 list (there was no list in the Sept. 8 edition, due to the long Labor Day weekend), institutional money appears to be flowing nicely into various stocks that reflect the state of consumer spending in the world's No. 1 economy.They include Mohawk Industries (MHK). The flooring specialist was No. 19 in the Aug. 18 edition. Today, it ranks in the top 10.The consumer sector contingent also includes Priceline Group (PCLN), which has gotten a lot bigger via acquisitions and entry into new travel-related markets; video game software giant Activision Blizzard (ATVI); Delta Air Lines (DAL), which scored $40.9 billion in sales in the most recent four quarters and has averaged 26% EPS growth in the past three quarters; and Under Armour (UA), the Baltimore-based sportswear and shoemaker that has become a global brand just like its top rivals Adidas and Nike (NKE).The large contingent of health care stocks in the list also bespeaks the strengthening confidence of American households as jobs are more plentiful and joblessness has come down to 5.1% vs. 10% in October 2009.Mohawk represents the rebound in the home improvement and housing industries as home owners and sellers update their flooring. Acquisitions have boosted growth in the past. However, top line growth has slowed to a low single-digit pace in four of the past five quarters. In the second quarter of this year, sales were flat at $2.04 billion.So why has Mohawk been able to grow its earnings per share 20% or faster over the same five-quarter period?According to an RBC Capital Markets analyst quoted by IBD in August, Mohawk enjoyed improved productivity, lower raw material costs and synergies from its June 2015 merger with companies such as IVC Group, which specializes in sheet vinyl, luxury vinyl tile and laminate.In May, Mohawk completed its buy of KAI to attain the leading position in the Bulgarian and Romanian ceramic tiling markets.Priceline has expanded its online travel booking business from hotels and airline flights into rental cars and private driver services. More recently, it's grabbed space quickly in the online restaurant reservations field with its 2014 buy of OpenTable and an announcement Sept. 3 to acquire AS Digital. The Melbourne, Australia-based firm has seated 250 million diners through its software.Priceline CEO Darren Huston noted that in Q2, the firm saw a second straight quarter of accelerating growth in both hotel room nights and rental car days booked.

854,DAL,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) and United Continental (UAL) are taking a page out of American Airlines' (AAL) playbook and are cutting back on fuel hedges as airlines expect oil prices to stay lower for longer.During the last three quarters, Delta, United and Southwest Airlines (LUV) have collectively lost nearly $3 billion in hedges, with Delta's loss alone at $1.95 billion, according to a Bloomberg tally.Airlines typically use hedges to lock in lower fuel prices, but jet fuel has continued to decline and undercut earlier expectations. Jet fuel has fallen 43% during the year to $1.40 a gallon, Bloomberg said, but most carriers are stuck paying higher prices.American doesn't use fuel hedges, however, and other airlines are taking note.In October, Delta said it would hedge only 5% of its fuel for 2016, down from prior guidance for 20%-25%. Delta also has its own refinery in Pennsylvania that it bought three years ago to help keep fuel costs lower.United said it would hedge only 17% of its fuel for 2016, down from the 35% it hedged in October 2014 for the next 12 months.Delta shares closed down 0.8% to 46.87 in the stock market today. United shares fell 1% to 56.22. American shares edged up 0.25 to 41.31.Southwest is going in the opposite direction, increasing its hedges to 35% for next year vs. 10%, it said in February.Shares were closed down 0.8% to 45.88.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter @IBD_GRich.

890,DAL,"Airlines have been raising capacity in the second quarter but industry experts say carriers have learned from past expansion missteps. S&P Capital analyst Jim Corridore said in a report Tuesday that he expects a record profitable year for airlines in 2015 on revenue growth and lower oil prices.
"
891,DAL,"He said fare increases, fewer fare discounts and more business travelers helped revenue growth in the first half of the year, even as capacity increased.Last week American Airlines (AAL) reported an increase in Q2 capacity and profit that topped analyst estimates. Spirit Airlines (SAVE) reported Q2 earnings above Wall Street estimates as capacity increased 30%. Delta Air Lines' (DAL) Q2 earnings and revenue beat estimates while the carrier's domestic capacity rose 6%. Alaska Air (ALK) boosted flights by 11% out of its home airport in Seattle this spring. Southwest (LUV) is boosting flights out of Dallas.On Tuesday, Alaska said traffic rose 6.4% last month, with capacity up 6.9% vs. a year ago. Load factor fell 0.4 point to 88.1%.Delta said July consolidated passenger unit revenue (PRASM) fell 3% on pressure from foreign exchange, lower surcharges in international markets and continued yield pressure in domestic markets.Revenue passenger miles rose 4.7% last month, and available seat miles, a measure of capacity, grew 4.2%.The increases in capacity come at a time when airlines say they are trying not to let growth spiral out of control and hurt fares. At the same time, the Justice Department is looking into whether airlines conspired to constrain capacity and keep fares high.Corridore says capacity increases shouldn't worry investors.Lower oil prices are also helping airlines post profits this year. The report said the U.S. airline industry uses 19 billion to 20 billion gallons of jet fuel each year. Oil prices are down nearly 50% vs. a year ago. Delta has its own refinery to help curb fuel prices even further.Unbundling ticket prices has also helped airlines boost revenue as travelers now have to pay extra for food or a checked bag.By late morning, Delta shares edged up 0.3% in the stock market today.

983,DAL,"Airline capacity continued to be big a issue in the second quarter as carriers announced plans to expand routes, while at the same time the Justice Department is looking whether airlines conspired to constrain capacity and keep fares high.Delta Air Lines (DAL) leads off airline earnings and is scheduled to report Q2 results on Wednesday. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Delta to report a 17.3% increase in earnings to $1.22 per share. Revenue is seen rising just 0.1% to $10.63 billion.Delta has reported that total available seat miles, a measure of capacity, rose 2.6% in June to 22.3 billion. Revenue passenger miles, a measure of traffic, rose 3.2% to 19.7 billion. Load factor edged up 0.6 point to 88.1%.In late June, Delta said it would increase cross-country capacity out of New York's JFK airport, expanding to 10 daily flights to Los Angeles from the nine it has currently. Six of the flights will use refurbished Boeing (BA) 757 aircraft. Delta will also upgrade three of its eight daily flights to San Francisco to Boeing 767 widebody aircraft.The move comes as United Continental (UAL) shifts its transcontinental flights to Newark from JFK.American Airlines (AAL) may follow suit and add flights out of JFK, according to Seth Kaplan, managing partner with Airline Weekly, an industry publication, in an earlier interview with IBD.The increases come at a time when airlines say they are being capacity conscious, trying not to let growth spiral out of control and hurt fares.Industry consolidation had limited growth in seats, keeping fares up, while the drop in fuel prices provided another boost to earnings. But some discount and regional carriers have been expanding rapidly, adding to pressure from Persian Gulf airlines that are boosting service in the U.S.Top U.S. airlines have trimmed capacity forecasts in response, and Southwest, which has been adding flights out of Texas, also pulled back from more aggressive plans.But the Justice Department has launched a probe to look into possible ""unlawful coordination"" among airlines to keep ticket prices high by containing capacity expansion and asked airlines to turn over intra-airline communications.Delta, American, United and Southwest Airlines (LUV), which have acknowledged they've been contacted by the DOJ, control about 85% of air traffic in the U.S.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.

985,DAL,"JetBlue (JBLU) on Friday cut its full-year carrying-capacity forecast and offered a dimmer outlook for second-quarter unit revenue, following Delta Air Lines' (DAL) weaker outlook this week as higher fuel costs loom.JetBlue now sees full-year capacity growth of 8%-9.5% vs. an earlier forecast for 8.5%-10.5%, as it seeks to ""assess the fuel and revenue environments.""Meanwhile, the carrier now expects Q2 unit revenue to drop 7.5%-8.5%, ""toward the lower end of prior expectations."" In April, JetBlue predicted a decline of around 7%.For May, unit revenue fell roughly 7%, which is an improvement from April's 12.5% tumble. Traffic rose 10.7% in May, while capacity rose 12.1%. Load factor fell 1.1 percentage points to 84.6%.JetBlue shares fell 1.8% in the stock market today. Delta dipped 0.85%.The results cap an eventful week for the industry, which has tried to balance the needs of shareholders, passengers and employees amid a period of huge profits brought by two years of cheap oil.Pilots picketed Delta's shareholder meeting on Friday to demand higher pay and ""raise the sense of urgency in concluding the ongoing negotiations.""“All other stakeholders – management, the other employees, investors – have now been rewarded ... except for the pilots,"" a pilots' representative said in a statement this week.Also this week, Delta guided Q2 unit revenue toward the lower end of an earlier forecast, while American Airlines (AAL) held to its forecast for a 6%-8% decline in consolidated passenger unit revenue but said it would change its frequent-flier program in August to reward miles based on ticket price paid, as rivals have done. Southwest (LUV) said it expected a ""modest increase"" in unit revenue.Airlines have added flights and slashed airfares in some markets to stay competitive, but the dollar has remained strong and travel demand has been shaky at times. Those factors hurt unit revenue through 2015, but a JPMorgan report this week found airlines have had better luck hiking ticket prices this year.

1075,DAL,"Southwest (LUV) sees 2016 capacity growth slowing from 2015's pace, but gains will still be elevated and fares will be pressured in the near term.The discount carrier, whose added flights have sparked oversupply fears and a selloff in airline stocks, said Tuesday it intends to cap its 2016 capacity increase at about 6%, citing weaker-than-expected economic growth.Last month, Southwest discussed growth of 6%-7% for next year. The more cautious stance comes just over a week after it backtracked from plans to boost 2015 capacity by 8% and instead grow it by 7%.Shares closed down 4.2% at 34.59 on the stock market today to their lowest level since October. United Continental (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) reversed earlier losses and finished up 1.2% and 1.6%, respectively, despite a jump in oil prices. Delta Air Lines (DAL) pared steep losses ended down less than 0.1%.Despite Southwest's retreat from more aggressive targets, it still expects a key measure of unit revenue growth to suffer. On Tuesday, it said Q2 passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) should fall 4%-5% vs. a year ago.But Edward Jones analyst Logan Purk doesn't expect Southwest to lower its capacity guidance again, as any further reductions would require the airline to cancel new routes.""I think this was a bit of a minor tweak,"" he said of the latest move.While Southwest's planes were fuller in May, with the load factor rising to a record 84.4%, and traffic growth (8.5%) exceeded capacity gains (7.6%), PRASM sank 6% last month.""That was the point that scared the market,"" Purk added. ""Why add more capacity if it's not helping overall profitability?""The prospects for the U.S. airline industry have shifted dramatically from earlier this year, when low oil prices and a recent history of strict capacity discipline sent earnings and stock prices soaring.But while American, Delta and United have kept a tighter hold on capacity to boost pricing power, discount and regional airlines have been expanding service with new routes at more airports, sparking fare wars.Southwest's added flights out of Dallas in particular have been rippling through the industry. Competitive capacity in that market is increasing about 25% since last year's repeal of the Wright Amendment, which restricted nonstop U.S. service out of Southwest's Love Field hub, noted Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth in a research report issued Monday.The carrier's daily departures from Love Field have jumped to 166 from 118 in October, with plans to reach 180 later this year, Syth said.Such growth is hurting American Airlines, which has been responding on price and seeing unit revenue suffer as well. Last month, CEO Doug Parker told Bloomberg News that it will ""compete aggressively"" against discounters.On Tuesday, American lowered its Q2 PRASM forecast and now sees it falling 6%-8%, down from a previous outlook for a 4%-6% slide. May traffic edged up 0.7%, lagging its 2.1% capacity gain, and the load factor dipped 1.2 percentage points to 82.8%.Late Monday, United said it sees Q2 PRASM falling 5%-6% vs. its earlier guidance for a 4%-6% drop. May traffic rose 0.5%, with capacity up 2.1%. Load factor decreased 1.4 points.Although the big domestic airlines haven't been adding flights as quickly as Southwest has, they are trimming capacity views too.On Thursday, Delta said it was ""reassessing domestic capacity levels for the Fall — current bias is for a downward revision,"" and United reaffirmed its 2015 capacity growth target of 1%-2%, which the airline lowered in April from its earlier forecast for 1.5%-2.5%.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.

In January, fuel costs for airlines were down nearly 50% vs. September as oil prices plunged 60% from a high in June.Also Thursday, French prosecutors said Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz may have deliberately crashed the plane after locking the captain out of the cockpit. The black box revealed that the pilot tried to break down the door.The FAA required updated security on planes after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. The Germanwings Airbus A320 most likely featured a revamped cockpit door that is strong enough to withstand gunfire. If the door is locked from the inside a crew member can unlock it with a a two- to seven-digit code on a keypad. If prosecutors are correct that the co-pilot crashed the Germanwings flight deliberately, the vulnerability of cabin safey systems may weigh on all involved, including investors.The crash is the latest of several high-profile incidents in the last 12 months.

Southwest is also heading overseas, with flights to Mexico, Costa Rica and Belize starting in October.Vowing To CompeteAmerican Airlines (AAL) President Scott Kirby said at the conference that his carrier would keep a tight hold on capacity growth.Still, American's stock fell 10% to 43.06, under its 200-day line, after Kirby said American's 2016 margins would be smaller than 2015 but still better than 2014.American CEO Doug Parker told Bloomberg News that it will ""compete aggressively"" against discounters like Southwest.""We're not going to lose customers on price,"" he said. ""We're not going to give anyone else an advantage and allow them to expand at a rate that takes away customers and is not good for our shareholders.""McKenzie thinks that the capacity competition will hurt revenue outlooks for airlines.""We're seeing the competitive backdrop worsen and lean competitors are vowing to compete aggressively looking ahead, which suggests a more cautious revenue outlook is warranted,"" he wrote.In April, Delta Air Lines (DAL) said it would cut international capacity by 3% for the winter schedule, which should flatten system capacity in Q4. But Delta has projected capacity growth of 2% annually from 2015 to '17, with flat growth internationally and 2.5% to 3% growth domestically. This month, Wolfe Research's Hunter Keay said much of Delta's growth is coming from markets where it heavily competes.Delta Vs. Alaska In SeattleLast year, Alaska Air Group (ALK), the parent of Alaska Airlines, and Delta started battling for the Seattle market. Delta added flights to London, Tokyo, Hong Kong and domestic destinations to turn Seattle into a major hub.Alaska responded by adding flights to Hawaii and the eastern U.S. to boost flights out of its home airport by 11% this spring.Alaska Air shares fell 4.5% to 63.96 Wednesday.But Stifel Nicolaus' Joseph DeNardi said Wednesday that Delta can handle its capacity growth.Delta shares fell 5.6% to 43.62.Airlines have been flying high on lower fuel prices, but the strong dollar and lower international surcharges hit April passenger revenue. Last month, Deutsche Bank downgraded Delta, American and United Continental (UAL), citing exchange rates and foreign capacity increases.United shares dived 10.3% to 54.54 Wednesday.Non-U.S. carriers are boosting capacity to America to benefit from the strong dollar. Because fuel, financing and insurance costs are denominated in dollars, foreign carriers need to ""garner as much USD-denominated sales as possible,"" Deutsche said.Domestic airlines expect summer travel this year to break records, with 222 million passengers taking to the skies, topping the industry's 2007 peak.

Fuel peaked at $4.16 per gallon in 2008, and Delta Air Lines (DAL) expects to only pay $2.25 to $2.35 per gallon this year.When oil was up at over $100 per barrel, airlines ordered more efficient planes because the fuel savings can total half the cost of ownership, according to Goldman.

Total production in 2015 is likely to be nearly double the production in 2008, according to Goldman, which warned the market may moving into an over-supply situation.The downgrade comes after Boeing CEO Jim McNerney said last week that his company will continue to return significant cash to shareholders and said he is confident that Boeing won't cut production of its 777 jetliner while it moves to the new 777X later this decade, according to a Reuters report.But analysts at Stifel Nicolaus raised their price target on Boeing to 175 from 160 on Monday and have a buy rating on the stock.Goldman also downgraded aerospace supplier Precision Castparts (PCP) to neutral from buy, as it's growing slower than the overall supply-chain market and could remain that way for the next few quarters due to its exposure to the oil markets.Shares fell 2.2% to 214.70.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.

1834,DAL,"The prospect of another production-rate boost for Boeing's (BA) 737 has fueled further debate over how many more narrow-body planes the market can handle.Boeing has already increased production rates for the 737 to 42 per month and is scheduled to ramp up to 47 per month in 2017. Executives are mulling raising the rate to 52 per month or even up to 60 per month in 2018 or 2019.Analysts at Canaccord Genuity released a note earlier this week saying that they don't think the production increase is sustainable and that raising the rate would saturate the market for narrow-body planes.In June, Delta Air Lines (DAL) CEO Richard Anderson warned of a ""huge bubble"" for single-aisle models like the 737, making the planes less lucrative.But Jim Corridore, an analyst at S&P Capital IQ, sees Boeing's potential production increase as a positive.""In emerging markets, there is huge demand for aircraft of all sizes, and that trend is going to be present for years to come,"" he said in an interview. ""There is more of a market in more places for single aisles vs. widebodies.""The 737 is a hugely popular plane among established and fledgling carriers around the world, and Boeing has sold out all of its delivery slots for the next ten years.So even if an airline with financial problems backs out of an order, others are eager to jump in and grab the newly available delivery slot, Corridore noted.A faster production rate is also a way for Boeing to improve revenue and margins, he added.Boeing shares were up 0.3% on the stock market today.Right now, only Boeing and its European rival Airbus have planes to fill the demand for short- to medium-range aircraft. Canada's Bombardier Aerospace wants its CSeries jets, which can seat 100 to 149 people, to capture some market share, though it has seen delays and tepid demand so far.The 737 can seat 126 to 220 people, depending on the model and class seating configuration.Edward Jones analyst Christian Mayes believes that order growth is close to peaking but that aerospace firms should continue receiving more orders and need to boost production in order to shrink rapidly expanding backlogs.In the long term, though, he sees more competition for Boeing from plane makers in China and other parts of the world.Mayes added that Boeing's production ramp-up will be good for suppliers like Precision Castparts (PCP) and Woodward (WWD).The Aerospace/Defense group is ranked No. 124 out of the 197 industry groups that IBD tracks.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter at @IBD_GRich.

1835,DAL,"Cups and saucers go together on the dinner table — and in the stock market.The cup-with-handle base is the most common launching pad for winning stocks. A saucer and handle is less common but based on the same logic.A stock corrects, recovers, has one final shakeout to eliminate weak holders, then blasts into new high territory. The buy point now provides support to the stock.Different From A CupSaucers with handles tend to last longer, up to a year, and correct less, maybe 12% to 30%, where a cup could correct 40% to 50% in a volatile market.The stock market has two ways to shake you out: It can scare you out or it can wear you out. Cups with handles scare you out. Saucers wear you out. It takes great patience to watch a saucer with handle develop. But it can be very rewarding.It often occurs with big-cap household names that move slowly anyway.Examples of saucers with handles are Delta Airlines (DAL) in 1965, General Electric (GE) in 1982, Precision Castparts (PCP) in 2005 and AutoZone (AZO) in 2010. You can see more examples in William O'Neil's book, ""How to Make Money in Stocks.""Because stocks sculpting saucer-with-handle bases move sideways for so long, they sometimes have low Relative Price Strength Ratings.Such was the case with AutoZone in February 2010. The stock set up in a 41-week saucer-with-handle base that corrected 21%. The proper buy point was 161.43.A seven-week handle corrected just 6%, within the normal decline for a handle.The general market was in the middle of a bull market that began in March 2009 (1). But at AutoZone's breakout, the Relative Price Strength Rating was a below-average 47. Low RS ratings are a common feature of many stocks that build long saucer bases. Keep in mind that the RS Rating compares a stock's 12-month price performance with the rest of the market.A positive feature of the base was the eight straight weeks of gains that made the right side of the base (2). The handle was nicely proportioned to the rest of the base.It broke out Feb. 16. At the time, AutoZone's Composite Rating was decent at 82. AutoZone also boasted a 92 EPS Rating and an A for its SMR (Sales + Profit Margins + Return on Equity) Rating. Volume was only 33% above average, but the stock went on to rally numerous times in heavy turnover.Remarkably, it rose for 10 straight weeks after its breakout.Fundamental TailwindAutoZone had a major trend on its side. Consumers were keeping their cars longer, because of both a sluggish economy and better-engineered cars. The average car on the road was 11 years old.In May, AutoZone had its first test of its 10-week moving average (3). The stock found support, then pressed higher.The stock rose 55% until it gave a sell signal on Jan. 7, 2011, by closing the week below its 50-day moving average on big volume. AutoZone had advanced from its first test of the 50-day line without again venturing below the support line.

Steve Scalise, incoming House Majority Whip, is also against renewing the bank's charter, which expires in September.Ex-Majority Leader Eric Cantor supported the bank and helped raise its loan limits to $140 billion from $100 billion.Most Democrats support the Ex-Im Bank.

"
1920,DAL,"Top brand builder Christine Day has simple advice for corporate managers and executives:
"
1921,DAL,"Once you've reached the top of your game, don't flaunt it while on the job. Never act like you've earned it.
"
1922,DAL,"Instead, she says, become a ""servant leader,"" one who inspires employees toward the top while turning customers into repeat shoppers.
"
1923,DAL,"That principle has helped Day shine at Starbucks (SBUX) — where she joined the coffeehouse giant in the mid-1980s as employee No. 3 — and at Lululemon Athletica (LULU), where she served as the company's first woman CEO from July 2008 to the end of 2013 and oversaw a stock rise of 3,700%.
"
1924,DAL,"Now she's trying to cook up a winner as CEO of food maker Luvo.
"
1925,DAL,"At Starbucks, Day knew a senior executive who took an expensive limousine car to the airport and meetings, rather than a simple taxi. When the exec went on business trips, he stayed only at five-star hotels.
"
1926,DAL,"It was obvious to Day that her colleague felt the status of the hotel and other perks properly telegraphed his status within the company. But ""this mattered more than the quality of the work and the quality of the relationships he was generating,"" Day, 52, told IBD. ""He treated it as his due rather than understanding he served the organization and the people.""
"
1927,DAL,"The Day Way
"
1928,DAL,"She tried to greet each workday with humility.
"
1929,DAL,"Her first job: office manager of Howard Schultz's new five-store company. Over a 20-year stint through the mid-2000s, she rose all the way up to president of Starbucks' Asia-Pacific group.
"
1930,DAL,"By 2007, the company operated several hundred stores across China, Thailand, Australia, Japan and Singapore.
"
1931,DAL,"Throughout that journey, Day made a point of learning vital skills from mentors.
"
1932,DAL,"At Starbucks, she had three major ones — current CEO Howard Schultz, former CEO Orin Smith and former Starbucks International head Howard Behar. Day took the first letter of each man's first name and called them her H-2-O.
"
1933,DAL,"Schultz taught her how to create a vision, how to build a brand and how to develop a product ""that is so good and combining it with a purpose so that it causes market disruption,"" she said while attending the Expo West natural products industry show this past March in Anaheim, Calif.
"
1934,DAL,"Smith gave Day lessons on how to turn a business model into delivering 20% growth in return on capital and 5% increases in same-store sales quarter after quarter.
"
1935,DAL,"He taught her how to run business units and maintain disciplined accounting at overseas units.
"
1936,DAL,"Behar brought Day on board with the concept of the servant leader.
"
1937,DAL,"Day said that along the way she grasped the importance of becoming an ""effective people coach"" and ""how to develop internal talent by creating mentoring programs.""
"
1938,DAL,"In 2008, Day made her most dramatic career move when she took over Lululemon. Fulfilling her dream of heading a high-growth company, she helped build the yoga-inspired firm, started by Chip Wilson in 1998 in Vancouver, British Columbia, into a multinational powerhouse in athletic apparel.
"
1939,DAL,"The company's results were as fit as its products.
"
1940,DAL,"From fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2014, ended in January, Lululemon's earnings per share jumped 730%. Sales rose 489% over the same time frame, from $270 million to $1.6 billion. Along the way, its stock soared from a 2009 low of 2.17 to as high as 82.50 in June 2013.
"
1941,DAL,"Born in Northern Ireland, Day moved to Western Canada in 1964 after her father, a former pro soccer player, changed course after a sports injury and pursued a career in mechanical engineering.
"
1942,DAL,"Going to America for college, Day got a business degree at Central Washington University in 1984 and quickly joined a firm in the Evergreen State that specialized in private placement investments.
"
1943,DAL,"While working in a state that would turn into America's coffee hub, she met Starbucks' Schultz on the job and joined his fledgling company, then known as Il Giornale, in 1986. A year later, Schultz acquired the Starbucks company.
"
1944,DAL,"At Lululemon, Day worked hard on brand-building campaigns that inspired professional yoga instructors and world-class athletes to work for the company as product ambassadors.
"
1945,DAL,"""They have an incredible sponsorship program that radiates their self-improvement culture out into the community and impacts the best athletes' lives in a huge way,"" Chandra Crawford, a Canadian gold medalist in women's cross-country skiing at the 2006 Turin Winter Olympics, told IBD.
"
1946,DAL,"Crawford met Day in the late 2000s, when the skier became one of what Lululemon calls their elite ambassadors. That tag gave Crawford and fellow athletes a chance to join Lululemon-hosted retreats and share ideas for product innovation. She paddled a two-woman kayak with Day through the inlets of Vancouver Island and developed a strong personal relationship.
"
1947,DAL,"Top Training
"
1948,DAL,"""I learned two things (from Christine): One, we share practices like yoga to balance and sustain our drive. Two, the level of understanding people in order to be successful in business is equivalent to multiple Ph.D.s,"" said Crawford, who now runs Fast and Female, a nonprofit organization based in Alberta that promotes well-being through sport for girls 9 to 19.
"
1949,DAL,"Day grasps that good store managers have a huge impact on building brand loyalty among customers.
"
1950,DAL,"With Lululemon, she made sure a store-based community was more than where staff talked with customers or gave free yoga lessons.
"
1951,DAL,"She wanted managers to have unparalleled knowledge about the product — be it yoga pants featuring high-tech fibers, a tank top for exercise or a cold-weather running jacket — and customer needs.
"
1952,DAL,"Day resisted excessive shifting of store managers among locations, as it would undermine continuity at a store. So she created rules:
"
1953,DAL,"• 1. A store manager had to work at Lululemon at least six months before opening a new store on his own at a different location.
"
1954,DAL,"• 2. Assistant managers should be promoted in their store if the top gun moves to a new store.
"
1955,DAL,"Homey
"
1956,DAL,"""Your store is a community,"" Day said. ""When a manager moves too often, it breaks down the relationships with the community, the staff and the operating results of the store."" The firm's in-house studies showed that having the same manager for two years increased profitability by 20% on average.
"
1957,DAL,"Two weeks ago, on June 12, Lululemon shares dropped 16% in heavy volume after the company reported quarterly earnings and sales that reflected an ongoing slowdown in growth. Earnings beat the consensus estimate, but rose just 6% year over year.
"
1958,DAL,"The stock has rebounded in recent days, but analysts have shaved their full-year profit estimates.
"
1959,DAL,"When Day announced she would leave Lululemon in 2013, Stephen Sidwell, the founder of Luvo, pounced. He contacted Day and asked her to take the CEO post. His goal: Find the right person to take the young firm to the next level.
"
1960,DAL,"""She had had two phenomenal brand-building experiences,"" he said. ""At Starbucks, she really helped Howard (Schultz) build the organization to what it is today. What she did for beverages is what we're doing for food.""
"
1961,DAL,"Sidwell, a former investment banker, says it was easy to convince Day about his company's mission. The harder part: asking Day to give up plans to take a year off from the corporate grind. She signed up, taking the new CEO post on a full-time basis this past April 1.

1965,DAL,"In January 2013, the firm started distribution to 91 grocery stores owned by Safeway (SWY). That has swelled to 6,500 stores, including top retailers Kroger (KR), Target (TGT) and Publix, plus the Home Shopping Network. Also, Luvo meals are featured on select Delta (DAL) flights.Top brand builder Christine Day has simple advice for corporate managers and executives:Once you've reached the top of your game, don't flaunt it while on the job. Never act like you've earned it.Instead, she says, become a ""servant leader,"" one who inspires employees toward the top while turning customers into repeat shoppers.That principle has helped Day shine at Starbucks (SBUX) — where she joined the coffeehouse giant in the mid-1980s as employee No. 3 — and at Lululemon Athletica (LULU), where she served as the company's first woman CEO from July 2008 to the end of 2013 and oversaw a stock rise of 3,700%.Now she's trying to cook up a winner as CEO of food maker Luvo.At Starbucks, Day knew a senior executive who took an expensive limousine car to the airport and meetings, rather than a simple taxi. When the exec went on business trips, he stayed only at five-star hotels.It was obvious to Day that her colleague felt the status of the hotel and other perks properly telegraphed his status within the company. But ""this mattered more than the quality of the work and the quality of the relationships he was generating,"" Day, 52, told IBD. ""He treated it as his due rather than understanding he served the organization and the people.""The Day WayShe tried to greet each workday with humility.Her first job: office manager of Howard Schultz's new five-store company. Over a 20-year stint through the mid-2000s, she rose all the way up to president of Starbucks' Asia-Pacific group.By 2007, the company operated several hundred stores across China, Thailand, Australia, Japan and Singapore.Throughout that journey, Day made a point of learning vital skills from mentors.At Starbucks, she had three major ones — current CEO Howard Schultz, former CEO Orin Smith and former Starbucks International head Howard Behar. Day took the first letter of each man's first name and called them her H-2-O.Schultz taught her how to create a vision, how to build a brand and how to develop a product ""that is so good and combining it with a purpose so that it causes market disruption,"" she said while attending the Expo West natural products industry show this past March in Anaheim, Calif.Smith gave Day lessons on how to turn a business model into delivering 20% growth in return on capital and 5% increases in same-store sales quarter after quarter.He taught her how to run business units and maintain disciplined accounting at overseas units.Behar brought Day on board with the concept of the servant leader.Day said that along the way she grasped the importance of becoming an ""effective people coach"" and ""how to develop internal talent by creating mentoring programs.""In 2008, Day made her most dramatic career move when she took over Lululemon. Fulfilling her dream of heading a high-growth company, she helped build the yoga-inspired firm, started by Chip Wilson in 1998 in Vancouver, British Columbia, into a multinational powerhouse in athletic apparel.The company's results were as fit as its products.From fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2014, ended in January, Lululemon's earnings per share jumped 730%. Sales rose 489% over the same time frame, from $270 million to $1.6 billion. Along the way, its stock soared from a 2009 low of 2.17 to as high as 82.50 in June 2013.Born in Northern Ireland, Day moved to Western Canada in 1964 after her father, a former pro soccer player, changed course after a sports injury and pursued a career in mechanical engineering.Going to America for college, Day got a business degree at Central Washington University in 1984 and quickly joined a firm in the Evergreen State that specialized in private placement investments.While working in a state that would turn into America's coffee hub, she met Starbucks' Schultz on the job and joined his fledgling company, then known as Il Giornale, in 1986. A year later, Schultz acquired the Starbucks company.At Lululemon, Day worked hard on brand-building campaigns that inspired professional yoga instructors and world-class athletes to work for the company as product ambassadors.""They have an incredible sponsorship program that radiates their self-improvement culture out into the community and impacts the best athletes' lives in a huge way,"" Chandra Crawford, a Canadian gold medalist in women's cross-country skiing at the 2006 Turin Winter Olympics, told IBD.Crawford met Day in the late 2000s, when the skier became one of what Lululemon calls their elite ambassadors. That tag gave Crawford and fellow athletes a chance to join Lululemon-hosted retreats and share ideas for product innovation. She paddled a two-woman kayak with Day through the inlets of Vancouver Island and developed a strong personal relationship.Top Training""I learned two things (from Christine): One, we share practices like yoga to balance and sustain our drive. Two, the level of understanding people in order to be successful in business is equivalent to multiple Ph.D.s,"" said Crawford, who now runs Fast and Female, a nonprofit organization based in Alberta that promotes well-being through sport for girls 9 to 19.Day grasps that good store managers have a huge impact on building brand loyalty among customers.With Lululemon, she made sure a store-based community was more than where staff talked with customers or gave free yoga lessons.She wanted managers to have unparalleled knowledge about the product — be it yoga pants featuring high-tech fibers, a tank top for exercise or a cold-weather running jacket — and customer needs.Day resisted excessive shifting of store managers among locations, as it would undermine continuity at a store. So she created rules:• 1. A store manager had to work at Lululemon at least six months before opening a new store on his own at a different location.• 2. Assistant managers should be promoted in their store if the top gun moves to a new store.Homey""Your store is a community,"" Day said. ""When a manager moves too often, it breaks down the relationships with the community, the staff and the operating results of the store."" The firm's in-house studies showed that having the same manager for two years increased profitability by 20% on average.Two weeks ago, on June 12, Lululemon shares dropped 16% in heavy volume after the company reported quarterly earnings and sales that reflected an ongoing slowdown in growth. Earnings beat the consensus estimate, but rose just 6% year over year.The stock has rebounded in recent days, but analysts have shaved their full-year profit estimates.When Day announced she would leave Lululemon in 2013, Stephen Sidwell, the founder of Luvo, pounced. He contacted Day and asked her to take the CEO post. His goal: Find the right person to take the young firm to the next level.""She had had two phenomenal brand-building experiences,"" he said. ""At Starbucks, she really helped Howard (Schultz) build the organization to what it is today. What she did for beverages is what we're doing for food.""Sidwell, a former investment banker, says it was easy to convince Day about his company's mission. The harder part: asking Day to give up plans to take a year off from the corporate grind. She signed up, taking the new CEO post on a full-time basis this past April 1.""She is an incredibly collaborative leader and has a really wonderful demeanor when it comes to leadership,"" Sidwell said. ""She really gets the vision of what we're trying to do, and has been able to put that vision into plans and organize it in an efficient way. People can see it and understand it.""Luvo, which has drawn an investment from New York Yankees superstar Derek Jeter, aims to raise the quality of frozen food by using ingredients such as quinoa, kale and whole grains.Luvo's frozen chicken chile verde won a Best of the West press award at this year's Expo West.In January 2013, the firm started distribution to 91 grocery stores owned by Safeway (SWY).

1989,DAL,"By opening new markets for drillers, lifting the ban would increase domestic crude production from 8.2 million barrels per day to 11.2 million barrels per day in 2022 and create 1 million jobs by 2018, according to a recent IHS report.
"
1990,DAL,"That boost would save U.S. drivers an average of 8 cents per gallon on gas, or $265 billion from 2016-30, IHS reckons, as the flood of new crude on world markets lowers international benchmarks used for gas prices.

Delta completed 95.5% of February flights and had an on-time arrival rate of 77.5%. It sees first-quarter adjusted fuel price of $2.99 to $3.04 per gallon.Shares soared 4.5% to 34.07 in the stock market today.But the bad weather hit other airlines harder. Last week, Chicago-based United announced it had canceled more than 22,500 flights since the start of the year due to severe winter weather, four times the amount it canceled in early 2013. The weather caused the carrier's regional completion factor to fall nearly 9 points to 87.1%, to what it called an ""extraordinary low level."" The cancellations caused United's Q1 passenger revenue per available seat mile to fall 1.5 percentage points.The airline also warned that passengers are pushing back travel from March to April as the cold winter continues, which is expected to impact Q2 results. Easter will also fall later this year, in mid-April, compared to the end of March in 2013.The news sent airline stocks down but United shares rebounded Tuesday rising 2.6% to 45.19, bouncing up from its 50-day line.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter at @IBD_GRich.

2355,DAL,"Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) has announced several new domestic and international services. Likewise, the carrier has extended its bookable schedule until Jan 6, 2019.The new schedules are part of the busy holiday season.Domestic ExpansionThe low-cost carrier will initiate non-stop services connecting New York (LaGuardia) with New Orleans, West Palm Beach and Orlando. The flights between New York and New Orleans will begin on Nov 4, 2018 while that connecting New York with West Palm Beach and Orlando will start from Nov 10 onward and will be a Saturday-only service.The airline will further bump up the existing New York service with an additional weekday non-stop flight to Dallas, Denver and Kansas City. Each flight will be operational from Nov 4 onward.It is to be noted that at the end of this November, the airline will offer a total of 35 flights per day from LaGuardia.Keeping the upcoming holiday season in mind, the airlines are perhaps on an expansion spree, especially with focus on the densely populated New York. Given the heavy traffic during the time and a major chunk of travelers coming from New York, it is unsurprising that the carriers would want to best utilize this opportunity to draw larger profits. Earlier in May, United Airlines, the wholly owned subsidiary of United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report) and Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) announced several new routes from the East coast region.Coming back to Southwest, the carrier plans to widen its base across the nation’s capital with new flights from Washington, D.C.

2356,DAL,"Oil prices have been on the rise this year, shooting up more than 20% so far. Apart from the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, the economic crisis in Venezuela — a major oil exporter — and OPEC’s recent plans of a lower-than-expected output raise have backed the rally in oil prices. Since fuel expenses are significant for airlines, an increase in oil prices is unfavorable for the space.According to the recent commentary by Ed Bastian, CEO of Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report), the carrier is likely to incur additional costs to the tune of $2 billion in 2018 due to an increase in oil price.In fact, it is not only Delta but the entire airline space that is likely to suffer due to a rise in fuel costs. In April, another airline heavyweight — American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) — had trimmed its current-year earnings per share projection due to high fuel costs.Rise in fuel costs is likely to dent Delta’s profitability in the second quarter as well. This Atlanta, GA-based carrier slashed its second-quarter earnings per share guidance earlier this month, due to rising fuel costs. The metric is now likely to be in the range of $1.65-$1.75, much lower than the previous estimate between $1.80 and $2.Capacity-Related WoesApart from high fuel costs, woes related to capacity overexpansion have also been a thorn in the flesh for airline stocks. Highlighting the capacity-related woes, load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers), which is an important indicator of profitability and efficiency for airline companies declined in May for major U.S. carriers, namely Delta and Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report). A fall in load factor indicates inefficient capacity utilization that creates more vacant seats.Capacity expansion may lead to oversupply in the market even as fuel costs remain well below the highs of mid-2014, despite the recent resurgence. Moreover, airfares have remained low, with the metric declining in April as well as May. Low air fares are favorable for fliers but a drag on the top line of carriers due to their lesser profits.Other HeadwindsCustomer-related issues have been hurting airlines for quite some time. The unfortunate Apr 17 mid-air engine explosion on a Southwest Airlines Dallas-bound flight from New York resulted in the demise of one passenger and injured many.Computer glitches are also hurting airline operations. American Airlines’ regional carrier PSA Airlines was the latest victim of such disruptions. In June, a computer failure at PSA Airlines adversely impacted its crew scheduling system. As a result of the disruption, the carrier’s operations were thrown haywire as it had to call off multiple flights. Needless to say, the cancellation of flights caused unwarranted harassments to its passengers.Industry Underperformance in 1HJudging by shareholder returns in the first half of the year, it seems that headwinds like high fuel and labor costs, capacity-related issues and technological glitches have contributed to investors’ pessimism surrounding the space.The  Zacks Airline industry, which is part of the broader Zacks Transportation Sector, has underperformed both the S&P 500 and its own sector year to date.While the stocks in this industry have collectively lost 19.5%, the Zacks Transportation Sector has shed 7% of its value. Meanwhile, the Zacks S&P 500 Composite has rallied 1.9% in the first half of the year.1H Price Performance  Zacks Industry Rank Highlights the StrugglesThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates continued underperformance in the near term.The Zacks Airline industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #230, which places it at the bottom 10% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Our proprietary Heat Map shows that the industry’s rank has been bearish over the past five weeks.What’s in Store in 2H?The bearish forecast by the International Air Transport Association (“IATA”) on current-year airlines’ profitability highlights the fact that the woes are likely to continue for carriers. The research firm predicts global net profit for the industry to be $33.8 billion, much lower than the 2018 profitability forecast of $38.4 billion, unveiled in December 2017.Global net profit margin is expected to contract to 4.1% in 2018 from 5% a year ago. The firm projects that jet fuel prices are likely to escalate around 27.5% to $70 per barrel this year. The fuel bill is likely to account for 24.2% of total costs in 2018 (21.4% in 2017). Escalating oil prices apart, labor and interest costs also weighed on the profitability forecast.Dump These Carriers from Your Portfolio NowIn view of the above challenges confronting the space, we have zeroed in four carriers that investors would do well to get rid of from their respective portfolios as chances of favorable returns in the near term appear bleak. This is because, similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns.All the stocks have an unfavorable Zacks Rank and have witnessed negative earnings estimate revisions recently.(You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here).JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) is a low-cost carrier based in Long Island City, New York.

2357,DAL,"It is a well-known fact that airline stocks are inversely related to oil prices. This is because expenses on fuel represent one of the most significant input costs for an airline company. Much to the anguish of airlines, oil prices have been on the rise, up more than 20% so far this year. Apart from the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, the economic crisis in Venezuela — a major oil exporter and OPEC’s recent plans of a lower-than-expected output raise have backed the rally in oil prices.Generally, the rise in oil prices induces significant increase in operating expenses of carriers and limits bottom-line growth. According to the recent commentary by Ed Bastian, CEO of Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report), the carrier is likely to incur additional costs to the tune of $2 billion in 2018 due to increase in oil prices.In fact, it is not only Delta but the entire airline space that is likely to suffer due to rise in fuel costs. This is quite evident from the International Air Transport Association’s (“IATA”) bearish forecast for current-year airlines’ profitability. According to the research firm, global net profit for the industry is expected to be $33.8 billion, much lower than the 2018 profitability forecast of $38.4 billion, unveiled in December 2017.In April, another airline heavyweight — American Airlines Group Inc.

The metric is now likely to be in the range of $1.65-$1.75, much lower than the previous estimate between $1.80 and $2.In fact, high fuel costs have contributed to the 11% year to date decline in the Delta stock price. Apart from Delta, other carriers like Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) and JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) are likely to witness bottom-line decline, respectively, due to upsurge in  oil prices.Also, JetBlue and Southwest’s unfavorable Zacks Ranks can be primarily attributed to increase in oil prices.

Following the resolution of the dispute with Gulf carriers, Delta said that it intends to commence non-stop flights to Mumbai from 2019. In a bid to facilitate air travel on the route, Delta aims to expand its codeshare relationship with Mumbai-based Jet Airways. Expansion of the deal would allow passengers to fly to other Indian cities.Other details pertaining to the resumption of the operation will be disclosed by Dec 31, 2018. Service will, however, start following government clearances (Read more: Delta to Resume Flights to India & Expand Jet Airways Deal).2. Allegiant took a significant step toward fulfilling its objective of transitioning to an all-Airbus fleet by year-end by taking delivery of its first US-produced Airbus A320 plane. The aircraft was delivered from the Airbus' U.S. production facility located in Mobile, AL. Additionally, the carrier reached a tentative agreement with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents its flight dispatchers (Read more: Allegiant a Step Closer to Maintaining All-Airbus Fleet).3. In a bid to expand further, Spirit Airlines has started flying to St. Croix from Fort Lauderdale. This non-stop service is operational thrice a week and complements the existing service to St. Thomas. Notably, the new route is the carrier’s 13th destination to the Caribbean island and the 65th destination in its network. It is also the only non-stop flight from Fort Lauderdale to the region (Read more: Spirit Expands Caribbean Base With New Flights to St. Croix).Spirit Airlines carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.4 United Airlines has seen several management changes of late, highlighting the lack of stability in its management team. The most recent change saw the carrier appointing Jane Garvey as the leader of its board. In fact, Garvey is the first woman to be at the helm of the company's board. Previously, she was the head of the Federal Aviation Administration.5. On May 23, a disturbing incident involving a passenger named, Jason Felix, reportedly took place on an American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) flight (1293). According to the report, Felix abused the flight attendant besides fighting with some of his co-passengers on the Miami-bound flight from Saint Croix. All this happened merely because the flight attendant refused to serve him beer. Felix has since been arrested and might face 20 years imprisonment.Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months.  The table above shows that most airline stocks traded in the green in the past week. However, the gains were muted in nature. Consequently, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index increased marginally to $106.03 in the period. Shares of Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report) have appreciated the most (4.4%). Over the last six months, the sector tracker shed 6.6% with shares of Latin American carrier, GOL Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes S.A. (GOL  -  Free Report), depreciating the most (16.3%).What's Next in the Airline Space?Investors would keenly await May traffic reports from the likes of Delta in the coming days. Focus will also remain on the price movement of airline stocks, given the volatile nature exhibited by oil prices lately.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2359,DAL,"Airline stocks have been laid low this year, mainly due to concerns about rising fuel costs. However, this headwind was put on the back burner last Friday as oil prices declined, resulting in airlines experiencing a field day.It is a well-documented fact that the health of airline stocks is inversely related to oil prices. This is because fuel costs denote one of the most significant expenses for carriers. Consequently, the fall in oil prices leads to a significant decrease in the airlines’ operating expenses, thereby aiding the stocks’ bottom-line growth.On May 25, oil prices decreased significantly to around $67.88 per barrel following reports that OPEC and Russia were discussing an increase in oil production.  In fact, oil prices had been on the downside over the past four days, thanks to the above issue.Airlines Lead Dow Transports' Rally on FridayThe Dow Jones Transportation Average — a price-weighted average of 20 U.S. transportation securities — ended the May 25 trading session at 10,900.06, up 0.4%.  The index includes railroads, truckers, marine transportation, delivery services and logistics companies apart from airlines. Hence, the Dow Jones Transportation Average Index can easily be deemed the true representative of U.S. transportation division.The Dow Jones Transportation Average Index includes six airline stocks, namely Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report), United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report), American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report), JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report), Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report)     and Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report).The fact that airlines heaved a sigh of relief on May 25 is evident from the index’s top six gainers being airline stocks with shares of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) Alaska Air Group registering the maximum rise of 3.3%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The above impressive performance resulted in the NYSE ARCA Airline Index gaining 2.3% to close Friday’s trading session at $108.81. Additionally, the 34-member U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS  -  Free Report), which provide exposure to the global airline industry, grew nearly 2% on May 25, ending the day at $31.19. Oil Price Plunge Follows A4A’s Bullish Summer Travel Projection  The drop in one of the largest input costs for airlines could not have come at a better time for sector participants. This is because the summer travel season is round the corner and marks the busiest time for airlines.According to Airlines for America (‘A4A’) — the largest airline trade association in the United States — the upcoming summer season (Jun 1-Aug 31) is expected to be the most hectic period for U.S. carriers in terms of air travel. Per the forecast, approximately 246.1 million passengers (2.68 million flyers daily) will be transported by U.S. airlines this summer, up 3.7% year over year.In fact, to meet the surge in travel demand, the U.S. carriers are increasing the number of available seats by 116,000 each day. Also, with the U.S. economy improving and consumer confidence remaining strong, more Americans are taking vacations. Moreover, a much-improved job market and rising disposable income have added an incentive for consumers to opt for air travel.Driven by the above tailwinds, the three-month phase is likely to see 96,000 additional passengers taking to the skies each day on various U.S. carriers.With the upbeat guidance already in place, the waning oil prices provide further good news to airlines. No wonder, airline stocks concluded the previous week on a high.Valuation Signals More UpsideThe attractive valuation for the Zacks Airline industry suggests that the rally on May 25 is not a one-off phenomenon and that stocks in the space remain attractive investment bets. Going by the EV-to-EBITDA (enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) ratio —often used to value airline stocks — given their significant debt levels, and high depreciation and amortization expenses, the industry does not look expensive at this point.The industry currently has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 6.3 (near the lowest point of 5.8 in a year’s time), comparing favorably with the market at large as the current EV/EBITDA ratio for the S&P 500 stands at 11.3. The industry’s favorable positioning compared with the overall market certainly hints at more upside.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2362,DAL,"In the past week, key airline players like SkyWest Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report), Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report) and Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY  -  Free Report) unveiled their respective traffic numbers for June. Impressively, all the three reports showed increase in load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) as traffic growth outweighed capacity expansion.   Alaska Air Group, Inc.’s (ALK  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Alaska Airlines, also featured in the headlines by virtue of its expansion-related update. Meanwhile, JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) took a significant step toward upgrading its fleet and improving the flying experience of its passengers, when it placed an order for 60 Airbus A220-300 planes (previously known as Bombardier CS300). The new, more efficient planes are scheduled to be delivered to JetBlue in the 2020-2025 timeframe. JetBlue has the option of buying 60 more planes from Airbus from 2025 onward. (Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Jul 05, 2018)Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1. Ryanair, which is struggling with labor-related issues, reported a 7% increase in traffic for June. Load factor came in at an impressive 96% buoyed by solid demand for air travel. The metric improved from the May 2018 reading of 95% (read more: Ryanair Holdings' June Traffic Rises 7% Amid Labor Unrest).2. SkyWest reported a 6.2% (9,900) year-over-year decline in block hours (a measure of aircraft utilization) to 149,300 in June 2018. The regional carrier, which remains focused on streamlining its operations, stated that the fall in the metric was in sync with its fleet transition plans. The company intends to reduce the 50-seat jets in its fleet and add new E175 aircraft (read more: SkyWest's June Block Hours Decline, Load Factor Up).3. At Allegiant, June traffic (for the total system) increased 9.5% and capacity expanded 8.8%. With traffic growth outpacing capacity expansion, load factor inched up 60 basis points year over year to 85.2%. Allegiant’s passenger count rose 11% in the month (read more: Allegiant's Traffic & Load Factor Increase in June).Allegiant carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.4. At Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes S.A., traffic — measured in revenue passenger kilometers (RPK) — increased 4.6% to 2.81 billion. While domestic RPK rose 6.7%, international RPK plunged 16.6%. On a year-over-year basis, consolidated capacity (or available seat kilometers/ASKs) expanded 4.7% to 3.61 billion. Domestic ASK ascended 5.9%, while international ASK slid 5.8%. The carrier expects operating margin between 1% and 1.5% in the second quarter of 2018, flat year over year. EBITDA margin is estimated to be in the 8-8.5% range. Also, operating cash flow is envisioned in the R$500-550 million band (read more: Gol Linhas Posts a Rise in June Traffic, Guides for Q2).5. Alaska Airlines has launched a non-stop service between Mineta San Jose International Airport and New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK). In fact, the daily roundtrips have been operational since Jul 6. Currently, the carrier is utilizing the A320 aircraft to ply on the routes. With the expanded JFK service, Alaska Airlines now operates 15 flights per day to the airport from six West Coast cities (read more: Alaska Air Unit Begins New York-San Jose Operation).6. In a bid to modernize its fleet, JetBlue has agreed to buy at least 60 A220-300 jets from Airbus. This multi-billion dollar deal further strengthens the carrier’s association with Airbus. Following the arrival of the new jets, JetBlue plans to do away with its existing fleet of Embraer E-190 planes in the 2020-2025 timeframe. Per the agreement, JetBlue has also agreed to convert its order for 25 A320neos to A321neos, which are comparatively bigger.7. At United Continental Holdings Inc.’s (UAL  -  Free Report) subsidiary, United Airlines, consolidated traffic for June was 21.74 billion, up 7.2% from the year-ago figure. On a year-over-year basis, consolidated capacity rose 4.2% to 24.66 billion. With traffic growth outpacing capacity expansion, load factor expanded 250 basis points (bps) to 88.2%. The company also posted an on-time performance (mainline) of 63.2% and a completion factor of 99.5% for the month.Price Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the last week and during the past six months.   The table above shows that all airline stocks traded in the green over the last week leading to a 2.7% increase in the NYSE ARCA Airline Index. Over the course of six months, the sector tracker has decreased 15.9% due to multiple headwinds like rising fuel costs.What's Next in the Airline Space?Investors are looking forward to the second-quarter earnings report of Delta Air Lines, Inc.

2363,DAL,"The airline industry is benefiting from strong demand for air travel. Declining air fares along with a much-improved job market and rising disposable income have provided consumers an added incentive to opt for air travel. The bullish projection by the Airlines for America (A4A) for the ongoing summer season confirms the robust demand. The association expects the season to be the busiest one for U.S. carriers in terms of air travel.However, the rise in fuel costs has hurt airline stocks big time. Oil prices have risen roughly 10% year to date. Since expenses on fuel are significant for airlines, an increase in oil prices is unfavorable for the space.In fact, the bearish forecast by the International Air Transport Association (“IATA”) on current-year airlines’ profitability highlights the fact that the woes are likely to continue for carriers. The research firm predicts global net profit for the industry to be $33.8 billion, much lower than the 2018 profitability forecast of $38.4 billion, unveiled in December 2017. Escalating oil prices apart, labor and interest costs also weighed on the profitability forecast.Industry Underperforms on Shareholder ReturnsJudging by shareholder returns over the past year, it seems that solid demand for air travel and the improving unit revenue scenario weren’t enough for instilling investors’ confidence as far as the industry’s growth prospects are concerned.Headwinds like high fuel and labor costs, capacity-related issues and technological glitches have contributed to investors’ pessimism surrounding the space.The  Zacks Airline industry, which is a 25-stock group within the broader Zacks Transportation Sector, has underperformed both the S&P 500 and its own sector over the past year.While the stocks in this industry have collectively lost 12.1%, the Zacks S&P 500 Composite and Zacks Transportation Sector have rallied 13.4% and 0.8%, respectively.One-Year Price PerformanceAirline Stocks Trading CheapThanks to the industry’s underperformance over the past year, the valuation looks really cheap now. One might get a good sense of the industry’s relative valuation by looking at its EV-to-EBITDA (enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) ratio, which is often used to value airline stocks, given their significant debt levels and high depreciation and amortization expenses.This ratio is essentially utilized by buyers to come to a conclusion regarding the reasonability of a target's valuation.The industry currently has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 6.07, near the lowest level over the past year. When compared with the highest level of 7.29 and median level of 6.31 over that period, there is apparently plenty of upside left.The space also looks inexpensive when compared with the market at large, as the trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio for the S&P 500 is 11.49 and the median level is 11.36.Enterprise Value/EBITDA (TTM) However, as transportation stocks have unique characteristics, a comparison of the group’s EV/EBITDA ratio with that of its border sector is probably the best approach. Such a comparison ensures that the group is trading at a decent discount. The Zacks Transportation Sector’s trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 10.09 and the median level of 7.66 for the same period are significantly above the Zacks Airline Industry’s respective ratios.Enterprise Value/EBITDA (TTM) Underperformance May Continue Due to Bleak Earnings OutlookThe strong balance sheets of major carriers have enabled them to engage in shareholder and employee-friendly activities. Additionally, strong demand on the back of a buoyant U.S. economy coupled with low air fares may help airline stocks in delivering improved shareholder returns in the near future.But what really matters to investors is whether this group has the potential to perform better than the broader market in the quarters ahead. The above ratio analysis already shows that there is hardly any value-oriented path ahead and one should not really consider the current price levels as good entry points unless there are convincing reasons to predict a rebound in the near term. One reliable measure that can help investors understand the industry’s prospects of a solid price performance is the earnings outlook for its member companies. Empirical research shows that a company’s earnings outlook significantly influences the performance of its stock.One could get a good sense of a company’s earnings outlook by comparing the consensus earnings expectation for the current financial year with the last year’s reported number, but an effective measure could be the magnitude and direction of the recent change in earnings estimates.While the consensus earnings estimate for the Zacks Airline industry of $3.59 per share shows a year-over-year deterioration, the trend in earnings estimate revisions is not favorable either.Price and Consensus: Zacks Airline IndustryLooking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group’s earnings potential.The consensus EPS estimate for the current fiscal year has been revised 11.4% downward since Mar 31, 2018.Current Fiscal Year EPS Estimate Revisions Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates continued underperformance in the near term.The Zacks Airline industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #244, which places it at the bottom 5% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Our proprietary Heat Map shows that the industry’s rank has been bearish over the past five weeks.  In fact, the basis of this bearish outlook could be the downward trend, albeit some fluctuations, in top line that airlines have been showing since the beginning of 2015.  Airline Stocks Promise Long-Term GrowthWhile the near-term prospects look unwelcoming for investors, the long-term (3-5 years) EPS growth estimate for the Zacks Airline industry appears upbeat. The group’s mean estimate of long-term EPS growth has been showing an upward trend since January 2018 to reach the current level of 13.4%. This compares to 9.8% for the Zacks S&P 500 composite.Mean Estimate of Long-Term EPS Growth Rate In fact, the basis of this long-terms EPS growth could be an increase in free cash flow for the industry since the beginning of the current-year.  The increase in free cash flow bodes well for airline stocks, as far as their dividend-paying capacity is concerned. This is because dividends are paid from a company's cash flow. We note that airline stocks like Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) have raised their dividend payouts this year. Moreover, an uptick in such shareholder-friendly activities in the space is likely due to the massive savings resulting from the new tax law.Investors prefer dividend-paying stocks, as these are financially stable and mature, and can also generate steady cash flow irrespective of market conditions. Therefore, our anticipation that airlines will fly high in the long run is justified.Bottom LineEven though factors like an improving unit revenue scenario, increased demand for air travel, cheap valuation and infrastructural developments to attract more passengers are positives for the sector and might contribute to long-term growth, we believe that that airlines will fly low in the short term mainly due to the surge in fuel costs. According to IATA, jet fuel prices are likely to escalate around 27.5% to $70 per barrel this year. Fuel bill is likely to account for 24.2% of total costs in 2018 (21.4% in 2017).Overall, the industry might not be able to tide over the challenges in the near term and therefore none of the stocks in our airline universe currently hold a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). However, below is a stock that has been witnessing positive earnings estimate revisions and carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).(You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.)SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report) is a regional carrier operating in the United States. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year EPS has been revised 5.2% upward over the last 60 days.Price and Consensus: SKYWAs mentioned throughout, there are a number of reasons to worry about the industry’s performance in the near to medium term. So, it would be prudent to stay away from some weak airline stocks for now. Stocks carrying an unfavorable Zacks Rank are particularly expected to underperform.Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report): The stock of this Atlanta, GA-based airline behemoth has shed 2.9% of its value over the past six months.

2364,DAL,"The deals inked by the U.S. administration with Qatar (in January) and the United Arab Emirates (in May) on massive subsidies to Gulf carriers seem to be paying off. Following the deal with the UAE, Delta Air Lines, Inc.'s (DAL  -  Free Report) CEO Ed Bastian had said that he intends to resume services to destinations, where the likes of Etihad Airways, Etihad and Emirates have had an advantageous position earlier.In keeping with his words, this Atlanta-based carrier announced that it will resume non-stop flights to Mumbai from next year. In fact, to facilitate air travel on the route, Delta aims to expand its codeshare relationship with the Mumbai-based Jet Airways. Expansion of the deal would allow passengers to fly to other Indian cities. Other details pertaining to the resumption of the operation will be disclosed by Dec 31, 2018. Service will, however, start following government clearances.Assuming that the requisite approvals are obtained, Delta would return to Mumbai after a gap of 10 years. The airline behemoth had last operated on the route (non-stop) in 2009. Currently, United Airlines — the wholly-owned subsidiary of United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report) — is the only U.S.-based carrier to offer non-stop services connecting India and the United States.Why Did Delta Stop Indian Service in the First Place?According to an Associated Press report, Delta had pulled out of India in 2015. The carrier had blamed the massive government subsidies enjoyed by its Gulf counterparts for this decision in the otherwise lucrative market. As a result, Delta’s operations to India were negatively impacted and became unviable. The company was unable to compete effectively with the Gulf carriers in India due to the massive subsidies enjoyed by the latter. Operations to certain other Asian markets were also similarly hurt.In 2015, Delta along with American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental had alleged that state-owned carriers like Etihad Airways and Emirates gained from the massive subsidies and other benefits. Per U.S. carriers, the government subsidies were unfair in nature, which denied a level playing field to them. The issue snowballed into a major dispute between U.S. carriers and their Gulf counterparts.In a bid to resolve the long-standing dispute, the Trump administration inked deals with Qatar and the UAE. The deals require the likes of Qatar Airways, Emirates and Etihad Airways to increase financial transparency.ConclusionWith the Indian market offering significant commercial potential, it is of little wonder that Delta has decided to resume services to India immediately after the resolution of the crisis.

2365,DAL,"It is a well-known fact that expenses associated with oil are considered to be one of the major input costs for any transportation company. Therefore, the recent upsurge in fuel costs does not augur well for stocks in the space.So far this year, oil prices have increased roughly 10% and are currently trading at around $66 a barrel. Various reasons like the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East contributed to the rise in oil price. In fact, this marks a phenomenal turnaround for the commodity, which was trading at around $30 a barrel in 2016. Transports Feeling the PinchWith fuel costs on the rise, it is natural that transportation stocks would be hit hard. This is because an upsurge in oil prices induces significant increase in operating expenses of transports, thus limiting bottom-line growth.In fact, the first-quarter earnings season witnessed many stocks in the space suffering due to rise in fuel costs. Notably, oil prices were up approximately 8% in the January-March period. This uptrend continued in the April-June period as well.Highlighting its struggles, the Zacks Transportation Sector is currently ranked 14th among the 16 Zacks Classified sectors.The unfavorable rank places the sector in the bottom 13% of the Zacks sectors.Turbulence Likely to Continue in Q2 The fact that high fuel costs will restrict bottom-line growth of transports in the second quarter can be made out from our latest Earnings Preview. Even though, the top and bottom line of S&P 500 companies in the Transportation sector are projected to grow year over year to the tune of 7.6% and 12.3%, respectively, the figures compare unfavorably to the readings in the first quarter. Revenues and earnings had displayed growth of 9% and 21.3% for transports in the January-March period.Key transportation players like American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) and Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) expect second-quarter results to be affected by high fuel costs. Currently, Delta envisions second-quarter fuel costs per gallon between $2.20 and $2.25 compared with $2.07 and $2.12 projected earlier. This airline behemoth has also slashed its earnings per share guidance for the soon-to-be reported quarter due to the cost headwind. The bottom line is now anticipated in the range of $1.65-$1.75, lower than the prior estimate between $1.80 and $2.Apart from high fuel costs, expenses on the labor front are expected to weigh on transportation stocks’ bottom-line performancein the second quarter.Sector Lags on the Price FrontThe turbulence in the space can be gauged from the fact that the Zacks Transportation Sector has underperformed the S&P 500 on a year-to-date basis. While the sector has shed 1% of its value, the Zacks S&P 500 Composite has increased 3.9%. YTD Price Performance                 Adding Shareholder Value — The Road AheadIn view of the turbulence plaguing transports, we believe that it would be prudent for investors interested in the space to invest in companies that not only pay consistent dividends but also raise the same. This is because such companies are financially stable and mature and can also generate steady cash flow irrespective of market conditions.Moreover, the new tax law (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act), which came into force late last year, is a boon for transports as far as shareholder-friendly activities like dividend payments are concerned. The significant reduction in corporate tax rate, under the new law, has boosted cash flow as well as earnings of transportation stocks.Due to the significant reduction in tax bills, more cash remains in the hands of these companies to fund capital expenditures, buybacks and dividends among others.Dividend Paying Transports — A Prudent ChoiceGiven the backdrop, targeting dividend-paying transportation stocks and combining them with a favorable Zacks Rank is a judicious way to increase the chances of beating the market besides ensuring a steady stream of cash heading to your portfolio.In this regard, we have zeroed in on four transportation stocks, which have raised their dividend payouts this year. All the chosen stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Year to date, these stocks have also outperformed the sector on the price front.Key PicksFedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report) offers customers a one-stop source for global shipping, logistics and supply chain solutions. This Zacks Rank #2 company has a market capitalization of $70.43 billion.In June 2018, FedEx’s board of directors cleared a 30% hike in its quarterly dividend to 65 cents a share (or $2.60 annually) from 50 cents (or $2 annually). The new dividend will be paid on Jul 9, 2018 to stockholders of record as of Jun 25. The stock has gained 5.6% on a year-to-date basis.The raised dividend highlights FedEx’s commitment toward creating value for shareholders and underscores the company’s strong financial condition and bright prospects going ahead. Also, it has an impressive record with respect to dividend payments.Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (EXPD  -  Free Report) is a leading third-party logistics provider. In May, Expeditors' board of directors approved a 7.1% hike in semi-annual cash dividend to 45 cents per share (annualized 90 cents per share). This Zacks Rank #1 company has a market capitalization of $13.51 billion. The stock has gained 18.7% on a year-to-date basis.  GATX Corporation (GATX  -  Free Report) is a leading global railcar lessor that specializes in railcar and locomotive operating leasing, aircraft operating leasing, information technology leasing, and venture finance for customers in diverse industrial sectors worldwide.On Jan 26, 2018, the company’s board of directors cleared a 5% hike in its quarterly dividend to 44 cents per share ($1.76 annually). Also, this Zacks Rank #2 company has an impressive record with respect to dividend payments. It has been paying dividends regularly since 1919. GATX has a market capitalization of $2.64 billion. The stock has gained 15.7% so far this year.  Finally, SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report) is a regional carrier operating in the United States. In February, the company’s board of directors cleared a 25% hike in its quarterly dividend to 10 cents a share (or 40 cents annually) from 8 cents (or 32 cents annually). This Zacks Rank #2 company, with a market capitalization of $2.88 billion, has an impressive record with respect to dividend payments. The stock has gained 5.9% so far this year.  Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2366,DAL,"Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) has its share of positives, despite a cloud of pessimism revolving around the rising fuel costs.Let’s analyze the upsides.The recent deal between the United States and UAE seems in great favor of Delta. Some major U.S. carriers, namely American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report) besides Delta had alleged that their gulf counterparts such as Emirates, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways stand to gain unfairly due to massive subsidies obtained from their respective governments. However, the deal is to resolve this long-standing feud.In the wake of this new deal, Delta’s CEO Ed Bastian has announced his intention to introduce new international routes. The move is likely to draw traffic on the routes, thereby boosting passenger revenues. High passenger revenues will in turn drive the carrier’s top line.Strong demand for air travel has been aiding the airline stocks for a while now and Delta is no exception. Notably, Delta performed impressively in the first quarter of 2018 owing to the same reason. The top line increased 8.9% from the year-ago figure.Moreover, unit revenues improved substantially in the reported period. Passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) was up 4.3% year over year while total revenues per available seat miles (TRASM: adjusted) grew 5%.The company is likely to perform well on the unit revenue front in the second quarter as well. Total unit revenues excluding refinery sales, are anticipated to rise in the 3-5% range. In addition, the company claims that robust top-line growth coupled with an improved in the cost-related scenario is expected to mitigate the impact of the rising fuel prices.Delta Air Lines, Inc. Price and Consensus  Delta Air Lines, Inc. Price and Consensus | Delta Air Lines, Inc. QuoteThe new tax law has also been supporting Delta immensely. Changes to the tax code are expected to contribute to 2018 earnings per share significantly. The company projects current-year earnings in the band of $6.35-$6.70 per share, higher than the 2017-level of $4.93.The company’s shareholder-friendly measures are also impressive. To this end, Delta returned $542 million to its investors through dividends ($217 million) and share buybacks ($325 million) in the first quarter of 2018. The company intends to maintain the same level going forward.In light of the above tailwinds, we believe that the stakeholders would do better to retain the Delta stock for now.Zacks Rank & A Key PickDelta carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2367,DAL,"Over the past five trading days, there have been quite a few updates in the airline space. Low-cost carrier Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) grabbed headlines with an announcement of hike in its quarterly dividend and approval of a new buyback plan.Southwest Airlines’ investor-friendly updates apart, the past week saw Airlines for America (‘A4A’) — the largest airline trade association in the United States — unveiling a bullish projection for the upcoming summer season (Jun 1-Aug 31).

Meanwhile, JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU  -  Free Report) announced the appointment of a new chief operating officer (COO).On the earnings front, European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY  -  Free Report) reported modest results in fiscal 2018 (ended Mar 31, 2018) and issued a cautious outlook for fiscal 2019.Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return(Read the last  Airline Stock Roundup for May 16, 2018). Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1.

According to a projection by A4A, companies in the airline space will make hay in the upcoming summer season. Per the forecast, approximately 246.1 million passengers (2.68 million fliers per day) will be transported by U.S. airlines this summer, up 3.7% from the 2016 levels.In fact, to meet the surge in travel demand, the U.S. carriers are increasing the number of available seats by 116,000 per day. Also, with the U.S. economy improving and consumer confidence remaining strong, more Americans are taking vacations.Further, declining air fares in addition to a much-improved job market and rising disposable income have provided added incentive for consumers to opt for air travel. Driven by the above reasons, the three-month period is likely to see 96,000 additional passengers taking to the skies per day on various U.S. carriers.6. Ryanair Holdings reported financial and operating numbers with net profit for fiscal 2018 up 10% year over year at €1,450 million despite a 3% decline in average airfares. The top line expanded 8% to €7,151 million on the back of a 9% rise in traffic to 130 million. Meanwhile, lower costs aided the bottom line. Moreover, load factor came in at 95%.The carrier also issued an outlook for fiscal 2019, which was “on the pessimistic side of cautious” with oil prices rising. Unit costs are projected to increase by 9%. Average fares are expected to be flat in fiscal 2019. Traffic is anticipated to grow by 9%, with load factor remaining flat. The carrier remains concerned about a Brexit-related impact.Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months. CompanyPast WeekLast 6 monthsHA0.3%-0.4%UAL-0.1%5.1%GOL2.7%-1.1%DAL0.0%1.8%JBLU-3.1%-4.9%AAL-2.6%-6.8%SAVE-1.9%-4.7%LUV-4.9%-2.3%CPA-0.5%-8.2%ALK-2%6.8%                  The table above shows that most airline stocks traded in the red in the past week leading to the 1.6% decline in the NYSE ARCA Airline Index.

2368,DAL,"Market indexes are blossoming over the past week or so, even as global uncertainties begin to pile up regarding trade tensions with China and other important commerce partners, leadership issues in the U.K. ahead of tomorrow’s NATO meeting in Brussels, and elsewhere. But there is a bright, shining beacon markets appear to be attracted to currently: Q2 earnings season.Q2 may be among the strongest we’ve seen in our entire multi-year economic recovery (though Q1’s +24.6% year over year earnings growth will be tough to surmount), with a possible 4-handle on GDP for the quarter expected by a plurality of analysts later this month.

2370,DAL,"It is a well documented fact that that high oil prices have prevented airline stocks from flying high this year. In fact, oil prices have increased more than 20% year to date. Notably, high oil prices do not bode well for companies in the airline space as fuel costs account for a significant chunk of their expenditures.Like all other airlines, high fuel costs are hurting Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) too. We remind investors that even though this Atlanta, GA-based company marginally surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the first quarter, the metric declined 3.9% year over year. The bottom-line contraction can be mainly attributed to high fuel costs. Moreover, the first-quarter earnings beat failed to translate into any strength for its stock, as evident from its year-to-date plunge of over 11%. Year- to- Date Price Performance With oil prices continuing to move northward, the stock might disappoint after the company releases second-quarter results on Jul 12. In fact, the stock could lose further value on dismal results.However, an earnings beat doesn't look very difficult for Delta in the second quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pretty conservative at $1.75, after a number of downward revisions over the last couple of months.Our quantitative model too points at an earnings beat in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Here's why:Delta has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — for increasing the odds of an earnings surprise.Zacks ESP: Delta has an Earnings ESP of +1.36% as the Most Accurate estimate is $1.77 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged 2 cents lower. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Delta carries a Zacks Rank #3. Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Delta’s Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Delta Air Lines, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Delta Air Lines, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Delta Air Lines, Inc. QuoteFactors Likely at PlaySimilar to the last reported quarter, high fuel costs are likely to act as the key dampener to Delta’s earnings in the second quarter. We note that oil prices increased 14% in the April-June period. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter average fuel price (mainline: net of hedging gains) stands at $2.14 per gallon, much higher than the $2.01 reported by the carrier in the first quarter of 2018.In fact, Delta anticipates fuel costs to be even higher and lie in the $2.20- $2.25 range in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Apart from high fuel costs, expenses on the labor front are expected to limit bottom-line growth. The carrier envisions non-fuel unit costs to rise approximately 3% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter non-fuel unit costs stands at 10.25 cents, more than 10.24 cents reported a year ago.However, the company is expected to perform well on the unit revenue front. The airline behemoth expects total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) to increase between 4% and 5% year over year in the second quarter. The bullish forecast is based on the strong demand for air travel across all entities in the leisure and the business segments.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) is pegged at 15.27 cents, above 14.74 cents reported in the first quarter of 2018.Stocks That Warrants a LookInvestors interested in the broader Transportation sector may check out CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report), SkyWest, Inc.

2371,DAL,"Shares of United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report) have gained 4.2% since the company reported better-than-expected first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 17. Also, management’s trimmed capacity growth outlook for 2018 has dismissed fears pertaining to capacity overexpansion.We expect United Continental's top line in the second quarter to be driven by robust growth in passenger revenues owing to solid demand for air travel. Additionally, its projection on unit revenues for the same period is encouraging. The company anticipates pre-tax margin between 9% and 11%. Passenger unit revenues are expected to increase 1-3% year over year. Detailed results are expected to be out later in the month.A glance at the company’s share price performance shows that it has outperformed the industry on a year-to-date basis. The stock has gained 4.1% against the industry’s 19.7% decline.YTD Price Performance  We are also impressed by the carrier’s efforts to modernize its fleet. Evidently, United Continentalis constantly adding more efficient planes to its fleet and removing outdated ones.Additionally, the stock has a  VGM Score of A, which highlights its attractiveness. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.Such a score allows investors to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score.Despite these key driving factors, we advise investors to wait for a better entry point before buying shares of this airline heavyweight. Here's Why:HeadwindsWe remain concerned about the various setbacks pertaining to customer service at United Continental over the past year. Earlier in 2018, a dog died in one of its flights resulting in severe criticism from all possible quarters. In fact, United Continental earned the dubious distinction of recording the maximum number of animal deaths on its flights in 2017.Furthermore, high labor costs are likely to hurt United Continental's bottom line in the second quarter as was the case in the first quarter of 2018. This apart, increased fuel costs are anticipated to dent this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) carrier’s bottom-line growth in the second quarter. Consolidated average aircraft fuel price per gallon is anticipated between $2.18 and $2.23 in the same period. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Apart from United Continental, the rise in oil prices is likely to weigh on the second-quarter earnings of other airline operators like Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) and American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report).The frequent management changes at United Continental also highlight the lack of stability in its management team. Such changes at short intervals generally do not go down well with investors, shaking their confidence in the stock. United Continental’s high debt levels raise concerns as well.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

Per the claim, Southwest has not made sufficient efforts to repair damaged aircraft and/or replace the unsafe ones for a safer travel (read more: Southwest Bumps Into New Trouble Due to Flight 1380 Incident).4. Delta invited criticism from trainers and users of service dogs, following its decision to prevent a passenger from carrying more than one emotional support animal on a flight. Pit bull dogs will no longer be classified as support/service animals. The new rules, designed to take effect in a fortnight, are in addition to the existing rules on support animals, already effective from Mar 1.On a separate note, Delta inked a deal with Bombardier to purchase 20 CRJ900 planes, in a bid to modernize its fleet. The new planes are expected to be delivered from late 2018 to 2020.5. JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) plans to offer customers more options for travelling to Havana. To this end, the carrier has announced a new service from Boston to Havana. Simultaneously, it will add more flights on the existing route from Fort Lauderdale to Havana.The airline will begin a Saturday service connecting Boston Logan International Airport with Havana’s Jose Marti International Airport from Nov 10, 2018 onward. Notably, JetBlue is the only U.S. airline to serve the Cuban capital from Boston.Price Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months. CompanyPast WeekLast 6 monthsHA-6%-9.4%UAL-4.1%5.8%GOL-11.1%-37.3%DAL-5.1%-9%JBLU-2.7%-16.7%AAL-7.1%-25.4%SAVE-8.2%-20.9%LUV-1.6%-22.4%CPA-5.1%-30.1%ALK-4.1%-18.5%                  The table above shows that all airline stocks traded in the red over the past week, following the spike in oil prices. Shares of Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes S.A. (GOL  -  Free Report) have declined the most (11.1%) in the period.We note that the health of airline stocks is inversely proportional to oil prices. The rise in oil price was owing to OPEC’s plans (after intense negotiations in Vienna) for a smaller-than-expected output raise. Macro issues (trade war-related fears) have also been hurting the market over the past week.Consequently, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index declined 4.7% in the period. Over the course of the last six months, the sector tracker has lost more than 14% of its value mainly due to high fuel costs and other headwinds. Gol Linhas again was the primary laggard with its shares declining 37.3%. Shares of fellow Latin American carrier, Copa Holdings S.A.’s (CPA  -  Free Report), have also decreased 30.1% in the same period.What's Next in the Airline Space?Stay tuned for usual news updates in the space.

2373,DAL,"On Jun 13, 2018, we issued an updated research report on Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report). The stock has been downgraded to a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) from a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Going by the Zacks proven model, the Sell-rated stocks (4 or 5) are likely to underperform the broader market over the next one to three months.Reasons Behind the DowngradeDelta has been grappling with troubles for quite some time now. The winter storm, Grayson, in January 2018 and the back-to-back hurricanes in 2017, wreaked havoc for the carrier, forcing it to cancel multiple flights. This hurt the carrier’s top line significantly. In fact, the company’s first-quarter 2018 results were also hampered due to these natural calamities. Notably, Delta’s bottom line also contracted 3.9% on a year-over-year basis. High fuel costs have also added to the downturn.The fuel cost burden is still a major headwind for the company as oil prices have been trending up lately with almost 10% increase so far this year. Rising fuel prices are anticipated to affect the company’s bottom-line growth in the second quarter of 2018. As a matter of fact, the carrier recently raised its second-quarter view on fuel costs per gallon. The metric is now projected between $2.20 and $2.25. Previously, the estimate was in the $2.07-$2.12 range.Apart from fuel prices, high labor costs are expected to hit the company’s bottom line in the current quarter. Notably, non-fuel unit costs are likely to rise approximately 3% year over year, up from the prior forecast of a climb in the 1-3% range.Further, due to cost concerns, the company slashed its earnings per share guidance for the second quarter. The metric is now anticipated in the range of $1.65-$1.75, much lower than the former prediction between $1.80 and $2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings stands at $1.77. Moreover, pretax margin is now projected between 13% and 14% in the concerned quarter. Earlier outlook was in the band of 14-16%.Further adding to the company’s woes are its fears of capacity overexpansion. This is because load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) at the carrier contracted 40 basis points in May as capacity expansion of 3.5% exceeded traffic growth (of 2.9%. This key metric also declined 20 basis points in April. Moreover, load factor decreased 10 basis points on a year-to -date basis. This drop in load factor is worrisome and does not bode well for the stock.Shares of Delta have declined 3% in the last three months due to these downsides. Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the broader Transportation sector are GATX Corporation (GATX  -  Free Report), SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report) and Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (EXPD  -  Free Report). While GATX and SkyWest carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), Expeditors sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

2374,DAL,"Rising fuel costs have caused volatility throughout the airline industry recently, and one particularly worrisome stock is Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report).Shares of Delta have slumped over the past few months as fuel costs put pressures on its margins and earnings per share expectations. The company recently raised its fuel costs per gallon outlook, ushering in a number of negative earnings estimate revisions and earning the stock a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Rising oil prices are exactly the type of thing that trigger estimate revisions in the airline industry, and this helps show the power that recent revisions have in terms of signaling near-term business trends. In this case, negative revisions confirm harsh business conditions, which is not a good sign for the stock.What’s interesting, however, is that Delta’s slumping earnings consensus has not yet had its full effect on the stock. Here’s a look at the stock’s price performance overlaid with its EPS consensus:Movements in consensus EPS estimates have had a noticeable effect on DAL shares over the past year, but the most recent dip in the company’s 2018 and 2019 projections has not been completely realized by the stock just yet. This should cause hesitation as it could spell trouble once investors do catch on to Delta’s current challenges.Meanwhile, Delta has faced additional headwinds that should cause concern. In May, capacity increased 3.5% year over year, outpacing traffic growth of 2.9%. This meant that load factor—the percentage of seats filled by passengers—declined in the month, just as it did in April.Delta’s load factor has decreased about 10 basis points on a year-to-date basis. This underscores a concern about capacity-related troubles that extend beyond industry trends.Investors might note that Delta is now trading at just 9.3x forward 12-month earnings, which is a slight discount “Transportation – Airline” industry average of 11.9x. But we must remember that this discount is buying a sluggish stock with a concerning earnings outlook several headwinds of its own.It feels like now is the time to sit on the sidelines and wait for Delta to make a noticeable rebound. This is obviously an iconic brand in the industry, so hopefully it will not be too long.Want more market analysis from this author?

2375,DAL,"Last week, Atlanta, GA-based airline behemoth Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) raised its projection for second-quarter fuel costs per gallon owing to the upsurge in oil prices. Moreover, the carrier trimmed its earnings per share view due to the same reason.Along the same lines, Hawaiian Holdings, Inc.’s (HA  -  Free Report) wholly owned subsidiary, Hawaiian Airlines, raised its outlook for second-quarter jet fuel consumption and economic fuel cost per gallon.On the traffic front, the likes of SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report) and United Continental Holdings Inc.’s (UAL  -  Free Report) subsidiary, United Airlines, released their respective May traffic reports over the past five trading days.Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return(Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Jun 6, 2018).Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1. Delta has raised its second-quarter view owing to rise in oil prices. It now expects the metric between $2.20 and $2.25 per gallon. Previously, the estimate came in between $2.07 and $2.12. Non-fuel unit costs are likely to rise approximately 3% year over year, up from the prior forecast of a climb in the 1-3% range.Due to the cost headwind, the company slashed its earnings per share guidance for the concerned quarter. The metric is now likely to be in the range of $1.65-$1.75, much lower than the former estimate between $1.80 and $2 (read more: Delta's Q2 TRASM View Bullish, Costs Guidance Bearish).2. Hawaiian Airlines now estimates a rise of 6-7% jet fuel consumed for the second-quarter (prior forecast had called for an increase of 5-7%). Economic fuel cost per gallon is projected between $2.05 and $2.10. Past forecast was in the $2-$2.10 band.The company has raised its outlook for fuel costs per gallon in 2018. It now predicts the metric in the $2.05-$2.15 range, higher than the earlier projection of $1.97-$2.07 (read more: Hawaiian Holdings Unit's May Traffic Up, Q2 View Bleak).3. At United Airlines, consolidated traffic — measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs) — was 19.73 billion, up 6.7% from the year-ago figure. On a year-over-year basis, consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) climbed 4.2% to 23.62 billion. Also, load factor (percentage of seats occupied by passengers) expanded 200 basis points (bps) to 83.6% as traffic increase outpaced capacity expansion (read more: United Continental Arm Posts Robust Traffic Results in May).4. SkyWest reported a 6.7% (10,500) year-over-year decline in block hours (a measure of aircraft utilization) to 145,300 in May 2018. The regional carrier, which remains focused on streamlining its operations, stated that the fall in the metric was in sync with its fleet transition plans. The company aims to reduce the 50-seat jets in its fleet and add new E175 aircraft (read more: SkyWest's May Block Hours Decline, Load Factor Up).SkyWest carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). However, you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.5. Although fuel costs have been increasing, air fares in the United States declined in May. Seasonally-adjusted ticket prices in the same month decreased 1.9% on a month-on-month basis, according to data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Also, average air fares (unadjusted) in May declined 6.6% from the comparable figure a year ago. Notably, the May reading marks the second consecutive month of a decrease in airfares. The decline in airfares has been attributed to the intense competition in key markets. Even though, low air fares spell good news for fliers, it is likely to hurt the top line of airline companies.6. At Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), traffic rose 4.2% while capacity expanded 5.2%. Load factor contracted 80 basis points (bps) to 84.6% in the month as traffic growth was exceeded by capacity expansion. Additionally, passenger count grew 5.3% to 14.43 billion (read more: Southwest Airlines May Traffic Up, Load Factor Down).Price Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months.  The table above shows that most airline stocks traded in the red over the past week, although the gains were muted in nature. Consequently, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index appreciated marginally in the period. Over the course of the last six months, the sector tracker has lost more than 7% of its value mainly due to high fuel costs and other headwinds.  Shares of Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes S.A. (GOL  -  Free Report) have declined the most (30.5%) in the period.What's Next in the Airline Space?We expect May traffic reports from the likes of Alaska Air Group, Inc.

2376,DAL,"Shares of American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) have lost 17.5% so far this year, underperforming its industry's decline of 11.8%.YTD Price PerformanceReasons Behind the Lackluster Price PerformanceHigh fuel costs have been the primary reason behind the company’s dismal performance.In fact, oil prices have increased roughly 10% on a year-to-date basis.In the second quarter, high fuel costs are expected to limit bottom-line growth at American Airlines as was the case in first-quarter 2018. Average fuel price per gallon rose 23.6% year over year to $2.10 per gallon in the first quarter. Fuel prices are anticipated to be even higher (between $2.18 and $2.23 per gallon) in the second quarter.Apart from high fuel costs, expenses pertaining to labor are expected to weigh on the bottom line in the second quarter. Consolidated cost per available seat miles (excluding special items and fuel) is anticipated to increase 3.5% in the second quarter of 2018.American Airlines’ high debt levels are added concerns. Apart from American Airlines, the rise in oil prices has also hurt other airline operators like Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report).Other Unfavorable ReadingsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter and full-year 2018 earnings moved south 8.5% and 7.9%, respectively, in the last 60 days. This reflects investor’s pessimism surrounding the stock. Furthermore, the company’s Momentum Score of D highlights its short-term unattractiveness. Undoubtedly, the above negatives substantiate the company’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

2377,DAL,"Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) reported traffic results for May. Traffic (measured in revenue passenger miles or RPMs) rose 4.2% to around 11.71 billion while capacity or available seat miles (ASMs) expanded 5.2% to 13.84 billion.Load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) contracted 80 basis points (bps) to 84.6% in the month as traffic growth was exceeded by capacity expansion. Additionally, passenger count grew 5.3% to 14.43 billion.In the first five months of 2018, Southwest Airlines witnessed a 3% rise in RPMs to 53.35 billion. Also, ASMs inched up 2.5% to 64.78 billion. As a result, the load factor increased 50 bps to 82.4%. Moreover, passenger count climbed 4.8% to 65.76 billion on a year-to-date basis.Southwest Airlines Co. Price  Southwest Airlines Co. Price | Southwest Airlines Co. Quote With the entire airline industry embroiled in trouble pertaining to high fuel costs, the company recently trimmed its 2018 capacity view for the above reason. The company now projects capacity in the low 4% range compared with its prior forecast in the low 5% range. Additionally, the company now anticipates second-quarter 2018 available seat mile (ASM) or capacity to ascend approximately 3.5%. Earlier, the company had called for 3.5-4% growth in the metric.Further adding to the woes, Southwest Airlines’ demand is still low due to the fatal Flight 1380 incident in April. Hence, the company now expects operating revenue per available seat mile (RASM) to decline around 3% year over year (earlier guidance saw a fall in the 1-3% range). The company cited soft bookings following insufficient marketing initiatives post the unfortunate incident as the reason behind the downside.The fuel cost headwind being a common problem plaguing all airlines, other carriers too seem to follow suit. Most recently, Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) lifted its view for fuel costs. It now estimates the same between $2.20 and $2.25 per gallon.

2379,DAL,"Last week, Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report)   — one of leading players in the airline space — announced a 28% hike in its quarterly dividend payout to 16 cents per share (annualized 64 cents per share). The first installment of the raised dividend will be paid on Jun 27, 2018 to shareholders of record as of Jun 6.This latest move highlights Southwest Airlines’ commitment to create value for shareholders and underscores the company’s strong financial condition as well as bright prospects, going forward. Moreover, a look at past records reveals Southwest Airlines’ stable dividend payment history. Notably, this marks the low-cost carrier's 167th straight quarter of dividend payment.Shareholder-Friendly Measures Highlight Strong Balance SheetsApart from Southwest Airlines, its fellow airline companies like SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report) and Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report) have raised their dividend payouts this year. Moreover, Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. (HA  -  Free Report), the parent company of Hawaiian Airlines, started paying dividends from October, 2017.Southwest Airlines’ board of directors also cleared a new share buyback program worth $2 billion. The new program is set to begin on completion of the existing $2-billion share repurchase authorized in May 2017.These investor-friendly measures clearly highlight the financial prosperity of stocks in the airline space. The strong balance sheets of sector participants have made them invest substantially for promoting safety and enhancing productivity.While Alaska Air Group carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), SkyWest has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Uptick in Shareholder-Friendly Activities LikelyWith the advent of the new tax law (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act), the financial health of airline players is likely to improve further. This is because, more cash is expected to remain in the hands of these companies to fund their capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases among others due to the significant reduction in tax bills.Consequently, an increase in the shareholder-friendly measures (dividends, buybacks) is very much in the cards for the airline space. For example, we expect Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) to hike its dividend shortly. This bodes well for shareholders who will gain in the form of dividend hikes and more buybacks.As investors prefer an income generating stock, a high dividend paying one is much coveted. Needless to say, investors are always on the lookout for companies that have a track record with respect to dividends/buybacks.Solid Demand for Air Travel Bodes Well with Approaching Summer Airlines’ robust financial health has allowed them to make investments for improving onboard experience. Strong demand has also prompted airlines to add routes. For example, United Airlines — the wholly-owned subsidiary of United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report) — recently added routes from New York/Newark and Washington-Dulles.Given higher demand for travel from New York, the carrier aims to attract traffic on the routes. Improvement in domestic economy has contributed to the upside. With consumer confidence remaining upbeat, more and more Americans are taking vacations.With demand remaining strong, we expect airlines to rake in significant profits in the upcoming summer season despite the rise in oil prices. Summers usually represent a very busy time for airlines and this year is likely to be no different. In fact, despite high fuel costs air fares had declined sharply in April, according to data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Valuation Attractive Despite High Fuel CostsGoing by the EV-to-EBITDA (enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) ratio — which is often used to value airline stocks — given their significant debt levels, and high depreciation and amortization expenses, the industry does not look expensive at this point.The industry currently has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 6.2 (the lowest point in the last six months), which compares favorably with the market at large as the current EV/EBITDA for the S&P 500 is at 11.2. The industry’s favorable positioning compared with the overall market certainly signals more upside. Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

2380,DAL,"In the past week, Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) received good news on the labor front. The low-cost carrier inked a provisional labor deal with the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association. Notably, the association represents 2,400 of its employees involved in the aircraft mechanics workgroup.However, labor troubles continue at European low-cost carrier, Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY  -  Free Report).  The airline pilots, based in Ireland, are scheduled to go on a 24-hour strike on Jul 12 in protest against management’s approach toward transfers between the carrier’s European and African bases. Meanwhile, June load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) at Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) remained flat at 88.5% as both traffic and capacity grew at 3% each, during the month. An expansion-related update from Hawaiian Holdings, Inc.’s (HA  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Hawaiian Airlines, also grabbed headlines over the past five trading days.(Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Jun 27, 2018)Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1. Apart from the tentative labor deal with its aircraft mechanics, Southwest Airlines, which is undergoing turbulence due to the Flight 1380 accident earlier this year, was in the news again when it extended its bookable schedule through Mar 6, 2019. As part of its domestic expansion initiatives, the low-cost carrier announced several additional non-stop services connecting North Texas with important cities across the United States. It will also increased frequency to the popular destinations from Dallas Love Field (read more: Southwest to Add Flights for Domestic Expansion).2. While releasing its June traffic numbers, Delta stated that it still expects second-quarter earnings per share in the $1.65-$1.75 range. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings stands at $1.75 per share. Adjusted pre-tax margin is still anticipated in the band of 13-14% for the same period. Also, fuel price per gallon is projected to be between $2.20 and $2.25. System capacity is envisioned to expand approximately 3.5%. Additionally, total revenue per available seat mile is expected (TRASM) to increase between 4% and 5% year over year.Delta carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Ryanair’s pilots, represented by the Irish Airline Pilots' Association and directly employed by the company, will go on strike next Thursday against management inaction as far as their demands are concerned. The strike, if it materializes, might hamper travel plans of many passengers as Jul 12 marks the beginning of the traditional holiday fortnight in Northern Ireland. What is worse is that more strikes may follow if the labor unrest is not resolved.5. Despite rising fuel costs, average air fares continue to drop in the United States. The metric declined 6.6% year over year in June mainly due to intense competition in key markets. Moreover, air fares in the country are projected to be down 9% year over year for travel on Jul 4, 2018. The figure of $171 round-trip is projected to be the lowest since Jul 4, 2013.  Although favorable for passengers, low air fares are a drag for airline companies.Price Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the last week and during the past six months. CompanyPast WeekLast 6 monthsHA-0.4%-7.8%UAL1.2%2.4%GOL4.5%-44.8%DAL-2.2%-12.8%JBLU1.1%-10.6%AAL-1.3%-28.3%SAVE4.7%-15.1%LUV2.3%-19.9%CPA3.6%-28.6%ALK2.8%-16.4%                  The table above shows that most airline stocks traded in the green over the last week leading to a 1.2% increase in the NYSE ARCA Airline Index.

2381,DAL,"Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) reported traffic figures for June. Traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs), came in at 21.45 million, up 3% year over year. Consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) also expanded 3% to 24.23 million on a year-over-year basis.As traffic growth was commensurate with capacity expansion, load factor in the month remained flat. Additionally, the Atlanta, GA-based airline recorded an 81.5% on-time performance and 99.9% completion factor (mainline) for the period under review.At the end of the first six months of 2018, the carrier generated consolidated RPMs of 108.68 million (up 3% year over year) and ASMs of 127.97 million (up 3.1% year over year). Load factor for the time frame was 84.9% as compared to 85% recorded at the end of the first six months of 2017.Delta Air Lines, Inc. Price  Delta Air Lines, Inc. Price | Delta Air Lines, Inc. QuoteQ2 GuidanceThe company has reiterated its outlook for the second quarter of 2018. It continues to expect earnings per share of $1.65-$1.75. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings stands at $1.75 per share. Additionally, pre-tax margin is anticipated between 13% and 14%. Total unit revenues are still expected to increase 4-5% as demand remains strong across all entities in leisure and business segments, aiding the company in countering the approximate 50% spike in fuel prices.Meanwhile, non-fuel unit costs are likely to rise approximately 3% year over year. The company also continues with its objective of delivering non-fuel unit growth of less than 2% in the year. Fuel prices are projected between $2.20 and $2.25 per gallon.However, system capacity is now anticipated to grow approximately 3.5%, the previous forecast was an increase in the 3-4% range. Tax rate in the to-be-reported quarter is estimated to be around 23%.Zacks Rank & Key PicksDelta carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2382,DAL,"Last week, Latin American carriers — GOL Linhas Aereas Inteligentes S.A. (GOL  -  Free Report) and Copa Holdings, S.A. (CPA  -  Free Report) — reported contrasting financial numbers for the first quarter of 2018. While Copa Holdings outperformed with respect to earnings per share and revenues driven by the improvement in the Latin American economy, GOL Linhas posted in-line earnings and lower-than-expected revenues.On the non-earnings front, JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU  -  Free Report) reported impressive traffic numbers for April. Load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) increased at this low-cost carrier as traffic growth outpaced capacity expansion. JetBlue was also featured in the news by virtue of its agreement in principle with its pilots’ union — Air Line Pilots Association.Meanwhile, average airfares in the U.S. declined the most in four years according to data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Even though, low air fares spell good news for fliers, it is likely to hurt the top line of airline companies. The deal inked by the United Arab Emirates with the United States also invited attraction and should go a long way in resolving the long-standing dispute between U.S. carriers and their Gulf counterparts.In 2015, leading U.S. carriers — American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report), United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report) and Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) — had alleged that state-owned carriers like Etihad Airways and Emirates gained from the massive subsidies and other benefits. Per U.S. carriers, the government subsidies were unfair in nature, which denied a level playing field to them. The above agreement aims at allaying such fears, with the United Arab Emirates agreeing to increase financial transparency.Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return(Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for May 09, 2018).Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1. GOL Linhas’ earnings (excluding 16 cents from non-recurring items) of 42 cents per share were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the year-ago figure. Net revenues came in at $862.2 million (R$3.0 billion), missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $919.1 million. However, the top-line figure increased on a year-over-year basis.Passenger revenues accounted for bulk of the top line and improved significantly year over year. The upside was driven by the solid demand for air travel owing to improvement in the Latin American economy (Read more: GOL Linhas Q1 Earnings In Line, Revenues Miss Estimates).2. Copa Holdings’ earnings per share of $3.22 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.78. The bottom-line figure surged 32.5% on a year-over-year basis. Quarterly revenues too increased 15.9% year over year to $715 million and outpaced the consensus mark of $692 million. The year-over-year improvement in the top line was primarily owing to 16.3% growth in passenger revenues.While passenger unit revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) climbed 7.2%, yield per passenger mile improved 5.3%. Passenger traffic (on a consolidated basis) rose 10.4% and capacity was up 8.4% in first-quarter 2018. Load factor expanded 150 basis points to 83% as traffic growth outweighed capacity increase.Additionally, unit revenue per available seat mile (RASM) improved 7.2%. This apart, operating cost per available seat mile (CASM), excluding fuel, increased 1.1% in the reported quarter. The metric, including fuel costs, was up 5.6%.On a separate note, the carrier unveiled its traffic report for April. Load factor declined 10 basis points to 82.7% as capacity expansion (12.1%) outpaced traffic growth (10.8%) in the month for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) carrier. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.3. At JetBlue, traffic — measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs) — rose 5.7% year over year to 4.3 billion. On a year-over-year basis, consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) expanded 5.3% to 5.02 billion (Read more: JetBlue's Traffic & Load Factor Increase in April).Also, JetBlue moved a step closer to finalizing a pay-related deal with its pilots, after it inked an agreement in principle. However, the deal needs to be ratified before it becomes effective. On implementation, the same will lead to significant increase in labor costs. This, in turn, will limit bottom-line growth further as fuel costs are already on the rise.4. Although fuel costs have been increasing, air fares in the United States declined in April. In April, ticket prices decreased 2.7% on a month-on-month basis, thus making it the sharpest fall in four years. Moreover, in April, average air fares (unadjusted) declined 6.9% from the comparable figure a year ago. Notably, the April reading comes after two successive months of increase in airfares (Read more: Air Tickets Get Cheaper in April Despite High Fuel Costs).5. At Alaska Air Group (ALK  -  Free Report), RPMs came in at 4.6 billion, up 5.8%. ASMs rose 8.7% to 5.46 billion. Load factor contracted 230 bps to 84.6% as capacity expansion outpaced traffic growth.On a separate note, Alaska Air Group’s subsidiary, Alaska Airlines, is reportedly aiming to do away with its New York pilot base in September. The move will see more than 100 pilots relocating to California as the carrier aims to strengthen its West Coast fleet.Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months. CompanyPast WeekLast 6 monthsHA2.8%-1.2%UAL3.4%15.9%GOL-4.5%1.3%DAL1.5%3.8%JBLU1.6%-6.2%AAL2.7%-9.4%SAVE0.5%-2.9%LUV0.3%-6.5%CPA-0.6%-10.7%ALK-3.1%-10.9%                  The table above shows that most airline stocks traded in the green in the past week.

"
2383,DAL,"Load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) is an important indicator of profitability and efficiency for airline companies. Higher load factor implies the company is more profitable. This is because a high load factor means that the heavy fixed costs of airlines can be spread across more passengers.Load Factors Deteriorate in AprilThis key metric declined in April for major US carriers, namely United Continental Holdings, Inc.’s (UAL  -  Free Report) wholly owned subsidiary, United Airlines, Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report), Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) and Hawaiian Holdings, Inc.’s (HA  -  Free Report) unit, Hawaiian Airlines. Fall in load factor indicates inefficient capacity utilization inducing vacant seats.Each of these stocks except Southwest Airlines carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Southwest Airlines carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Load factor at Alaska Air Group fell 230 basis points (bps) as capacity expansion (8.7%) outpaced traffic growth (5.8%). The same decreased 150 bps, 10 bps, 80 bps and 20 bps at Southwest Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, United Airlines and Delta, respectively.Capacity over growth due to contraction in load factor often causes lower airfares, thereby eroding revenues and profitability of the airline companies. In fact, air fares in the United States decreased in April per data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Per the report, ticket prices reduced 2.7% on a month-to-month basis, registering the sharpest fall in four years.Apart from declining load factors, let’s have a look at the other headwinds plaguing the airlines.Fuel CostsFuel costs have been on the rise lately due to various reasons such as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Oil prices increased 5.6% in April. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from a nuclear deal with OPEC-member Iran has further spiked oil prices.Currently oil prices are hovering at around $71 a barrel. As expenses on fuel comprise a significant portion of airlines’ operating expenses, rise in the metric inflates costs, thereby limiting bottom-line growth.In fact, high fuel costs hurt American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) results substantially in the first quarter, resulting in the stock losing value post the earnings report, despite outperforming on the bottom-line front. Such exorbitant costs are expected to hamper results in the coming quarters as well. Moreover, the company trimmed its current-year earnings guidance mainly due to high fuel costs.Southwest Airlines' bottom line in the second quarter is also likely to be affected on the same ground. Economic fuel costs are projected at $2.20 per gallon, much higher than the year-ago figure. Also, at JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU  -  Free Report), fuel cost is anticipated to be $2.23, way above $1.61 reported a year ago.Labor CostsWith labor deals very much in vogue in the airline space, such costs are also on an upswing. The airline employees claim that despite the airlines generating record profits, they lag in terms of employee remuneration. This has in turn propelled frequent new labor deals across the airline industry.Moreover, per International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecast, labor cost will comprise the major portion of airline expense this year. Labor costs are predicted to account for 30.9% of total expenses in the year compared with 20.5% of fuel costs. Most recently, JetBlue reached an agreement in principle with its pilots. Final ratification of the agreement by the pilots is still pending. The airline currently estimates non-fuel unit costs between 2% and 4% in the second quarter. The measure is likely to go up following ratification of the new contract. Earlier in March, Spirit Airlines, Inc. ratified its five-year deal with pilots, pertaining to wage increase.In-Flight GlitchesThe airlines have also grabbed headlines of late due to several unpleasant cases on board. Southwest Airlines made maximum headlines in this regard. A tragic incident in April sparked large-scale dissatisfaction among customers with the carrier having made an emergency landing at the Philadelphia International Airport due to an engine failure, which resulted in a passenger’s death with seven others sustaining injuries.Southwest Airlines has been struggling with low bookings ever since this fatal incident. In fact, the carrier issued a bearish view on unit revenues for the second quarter, thanks to the same reason. It expects revenue per available seat mile (RASM: a key measure of unit revenue) to decline between 1% and 3%. Similar occurrences took place this May as well. Earlier in the month, the carrier made an abrupt landing when one of its window panes broke.  Further adding to the woes, another Southwest Airlines flight was forced to make an emergency landing only a few days ago due to a pressurization issue, throwing the passengers in a tizzy.In April, a CBS News report titled ""60 Minutes"" leveled allegations against Allegiant Travel Company that the company is afflicted with a large number of mechanical problems. The report, aired on Apr 15, further stated that the poor safety standard was responsible for around 100 serious mechanical events in the January 2016-October 2017 time frame. The charges are being investigated.United Airlines also kicked up a controversy, resulting in the tragic death of a black French bulldog puppy on one of its flights in March.These untoward incidents have been dampening the airline companies’ reputation and certainly do not bode well for the sector participants.Price PerformanceThe Zacks Airline Industry fared poorly due to the headwinds, massively underperforming the broader market on a year-to-date basis. The S&P 500 index gained 2.1% against the industry’s decline of 12.9%. ConclusionDespite an air of prevalent pessimism revolving around airline stocks, we expect the companies to make a turnaround soon, buoyed by strong demand for air travel and rising air fares. With soaring oil prices, the carriers will most likely pass on the high-cost burden to passengers’ pockets. Notably, during first-quarter 2018 earnings release, American Airlines CEO Doug Parker warned of dearer ticket prices.Thriving U.S. economy augurs well for travel-focused stocks like airlines. With consumer confidence remaining strong, more and more Americans are resorting to vacations. Demand for air travel is expected to remain robust, courtesy of a much-enhanced job market and an increasing disposable income.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2384,DAL,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 1.7% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is DAL due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Recent EarningsDelta’s first-quarter earnings (excluding 3 cents from non-recurring items) of 74 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. However, the bottom line contracted 3.9% on a year-over-year basis. High fuel costs led to the year-over-year decline. The winter storms, which led to multiple flight cancellations, have also hurt results in the reported quarter.Operating revenues came in at $9,968 million, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9,881.2 million. The top line increased 8.9% from the year-ago figure. Strong demand for air travel boosted revenues.In the quarter under review, passenger revenues, cargo revenues and others increased 7%, 23% and 32%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. Average fuel price (adjusted) was up 18% to $2.01 per gallon.Operating StatisticsRevenue passenger miles (a measure of air traffic) increased 2.8% on a year-over-year basis. Additionally, capacity or available seat miles expanded 2.7%. Load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) came in at 82.9%, flat year over year.Passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) was up 4.3% year over year.  In addition, passenger mile yield grew 4.3%. Total revenues per available seat miles (TRASM: adjusted) also increased 5% (on a year-over-year basis) in the first quarter.Operating ExpensesTotal operating expenses, including special items, were up 13% year over year to $9,128 million. Cost per available seat mile (excluding fuel and profit sharing) rose 3.9%, owing to wage increases and other factors.LiquidityAt the end of the first quarter, Delta had $1.45 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $6.36 billion long-term debt and capital leases. Operating cash flow and free cash flow in the quarter were $1.3 billion and $173 million, respectively.GuidanceFor the second quarter of 2018, the carrier expects earnings per share between $1.80 and $2. It anticipates pre-tax margin in the range of 14-16% for the same quarter. Also, the estimated fuel price, including taxes and refinery impact, is expected in the range of $2.07-$2.12 per gallon. Robust top-line growth coupled with an improvement in the cost-related scenario is expected to mitigate the impact of rising fuel prices.Total unit revenue, excluding refinery sales, is anticipated to increase in the 3-5% range in the second quarter. System capacity is expected to be up approximately 3-4% on a year-over-year basis. Cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and profit sharing, is projected to increase in the band of 1-3% in the quarter.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates flatlined during the past month. There have been three revisions higher for the current quarter compared to three lower.Delta Air Lines, Inc. Price and Consensus  Delta Air Lines, Inc. Price and Consensus | Delta Air Lines, Inc. QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, DAL has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate that the stock is more suitable for value investors than growth investors.OutlookDAL has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

2385,DAL,"Although fuel costs have been increasing, air fares in the United States declined in April according to data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Per the report, ticket prices decreased 2.7% on a month-on-month basis, making it the sharpest fall in four years.Moreover, in April, average air fares (unadjusted) fell 6.9% from the comparable figure a year ago. Notably, the April reading comes after two successive months of increase in airfares. Even though, low air fares spell good news for fliers, it is likely to hurt the top line of airline companies.Excessive Competition Pressurize Air FaresThe decline in airfares has been attributed to the intense competition in key markets. In fact, the low-cost carrier, Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), had cited the competitive fare scenario as a reason for its disappointing first-quarter unit revenues.Moreover, the significant growth of low-cost carriers like Spirit Airlines, Inc. (SAVE  -  Free Report) and Southwest Airlines has not gone unnoticed by legacy carriers including American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report). Both these companies carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. In a bid to combat the threat of low-cost carriers and attract budget-conscious travelers, both the above-mentioned legacy carriers have been selling cheaper tickets (Basic Economy Fares) for quite some time. In a price-conscious economy, it is not just the survival of the fittest, but of the cheapest. Keeping this in mind, big airline players are now looking to attract budget-friendly travelers.Capacity OverexpansionCapacity overexpansion may lead to oversupply in the market and is one of the significant factors behind suppressed air fares. Fears that airline capacity would grow at a rate higher than the U.S. GDP, thereby resulting in an oversupplied market, have been one of the main challenges in the airline space.Moreover, the April traffic reports of most carriers, including the likes of Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines, United Continental and Hawaiian Airlines, the subsidiary of Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. (HA  -  Free Report), have revealed that capacity expanded at a higher pace than traffic. Consequently, load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) declined in the month at the above-mentioned carriers.Airfares to Increase in Future?Despite the significant decline in April airfares, we expect ticket prices to go up in the coming months. The obvious reason is the upsurge in expenses on fuel. Oil prices had increased 5.6% in April. U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from a nuclear deal with OPEC-member Iran has further boosted oil prices.Currently, oil prices are hovering at around $71 a barrel. It is a well-documented fact that the health of airline stocks is inversely related to oil prices. This is because fuel costs represent one of the most significant expenses for carriers. Evidently, the rise in oil prices induces significant increase in operating expenses of carriers, thus limiting bottom-line growth.In fact, the first-quarter earnings season, which is over for airlines, witnessed many stocks in the space suffering due to rise in fuel costs. Notably, oil prices were up approximately 8% in the January-to-March period.In a bid to counter the challenges posed by surging oil prices, airlines are likely to increase air fares. Also, American Airlines’ CEO, Doug Parker, has hinted at higher ticket prices. ConclusionGiven the present scenario related to the increase in one of the largest input costs of airlines, we believe that the drop in April ticket prices is an isolated event. In the coming months, air travel in the country is expected to get more expensive as airlines look to pass on the increased costs to consumers, so that their profits are not dented.Whatever be the actual outcome, we anticipate investor focus to remain on this burning issue of air ticket prices, going forward.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

2386,DAL,"Oil price has zoomed to the highest levels in more than three and a half years buoyed by potential export disruptions in Iran and falling production in Venezuela. Additionally, the historic output cut deal by OPEC, Russia and other producers to curb production is paying off, paving the way for a rebalancing of the oil market despite rising U.S. production.The global benchmark Brent crude and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI  -  Free Report) rallied above $77 and $71 per barrel, respectively. The bullish trend is likely to continue given that Trump has decided to restore sanctions on Iran, which will disrupt oil supplies in the major Middle East oil producer Iran, resulting in further tightening of the global glut.Additionally, seasonality will continue to support a price surge in the coming months. This is because demand generally picks up in a summer driving season (which starts with Memorial Day at the end of May and lasts until Labor Day in September), leading to higher prices.A BlessingHigher oil price is big boon to energy stocks, especially producers and explorers, which get most of their revenues from selling the crude that they extract. This is because the cost of oil production or extraction remains low as companies look to lock in supply contracts at higher prices. The gap between production cost and selling price keeps on rising when oil price surges even higher, leading to fat profit margins and thus a spike in company’s share price.As a result, the S&P Energy Index has gained 13.6% so far this quarter, easily outperforming the other sector. The Zacks Oil and Energy sector has gained 11% over the past month with some of the outperforming stocks including EP Energy Corporation EPE, Pioneer Energy Services Corp. (PES  -  Free Report), Rex Energy Corporation , Transglobe Energy Corp (TGA  -  Free Report), Penn Virginia Corporation PVAC, and W&T Offshore, Inc. (WTI  -  Free Report). All these have soared more than 50% in a month.The optimism in the energy sector has pushed up gains from Wall Street, which was struggling amid a series of woes. In fact, the major broad indices have turned green from a year-to-date look with the surge in oil prices.Further, rising oil prices coupled with rising interest rates are acting as catalysts to the financial sector given that most banks are highly exposed to the energy space. This is because rising oil price alleviates the default risks for banks’ exposure to oil and gas companies, and creates additional credit demand that could result in improving credit quality. In particular, big banks like Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) could be the largest beneficiaries with their direct exposure to the energy sector. These stocks climbed 2.4%, 0.8%, 3.7% and 0.6%, respectively, over the past month and have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A CurseWhile almost every corner of the energy segment is shining, oil refiners might be hit. This is because the players in this industry use oil as an input for processing refined petroleum products. Hence, higher oil prices would crimp margins for refiners, leading to weak stock prices.Higher oil price has also resulted in a spike in gasoline and jet prices that would make summer driving most expensive in four years, per the Energy Information Administration. According to AAA, the average price at the pump is about $2.83, up 21% year over year, with drivers in nine states paying $3 a gallon for regular gasoline. As such, transportation stocks could see rough trading with airline stocks such as American Airlines (AAL  -  Free Report), Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report), and United Continental (UAL  -  Free Report) being the biggest losers, as high fuel price may cut their profit margins.Rising pump price is threating Trump’s tax cut benefits, which is the major pillar for future America. According to Morgan Stanley, higher gas prices are on track to cost Americans an extra $38 billion in 2018, wiping out about one-third of the benefits from the reduced tax rates. Per the analyst at Moody’s, sustained increase in the gasoline price would cost the average American $450 a year, offsetting about half the tax benefit.Added to the woes is the resultant inflationary pressure that would raise the price of the products leading to a reduced consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economic activity. The discretionary and retail sectors would thus bear the brunt. However, these are the biggest gainers of the improving American economy and record consumer confidence. As a result, investors seeking to remain invested in these sectors should focus on the top-ranked stocks having Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Some of these include Sony Corporation (SNE  -  Free Report), Ralph Lauren Corporation RL, Michael Kors Holdings Limited KORS, Dollar General Corporation DG, Kohl's Corporation KSS and Urban Outfitters Inc.

2387,DAL,"JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) recently announced the expansion of its existing Mexico City and Havana service from its northeast and south Florida focus cities.The carrier will initiate operations connecting Havana’s Jose Marti International Airport with Boston’s Logan International Airport and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. Flights between Boston and Havana will be offered on Saturdays, beginning Nov 10, 2018 while the same between Fort Lauderdale and the Cuban capital will be available thrice daily from Sunday to Friday, starting Nov 11. Notably, JetBlue had commenced US-Cuba service a couple of years ago in 2016.Government approval for the new routes is pending and tickets will be put up for sale in a few weeks’ time. These new services are prompted by the U.S. Department of Transportation’s (DOT) nod for additional frequencies to the capital city of Cuba.JetBlue Airways Corporation Price  JetBlue Airways Corporation Price | JetBlue Airways Corporation QuoteWe remind investors that in March-end, the DOT granted a tentative clearance for new U.S.-Cuba scheduled flights to five US airlines namely, United Airlines, the wholly owned subsidiary of United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report), American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report), Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) and Southwest Airlines Co. including JetBlue. The DOT’s decision followed after many carriers like Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines terminated their operations among specific nations on lower-than-expected demand.Further, the low cost carrier intends to begin two new daily nonstop services to Mexico City from Boston and New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport, effective Oct 25 this year. The new routes, for which government approval is pending, are an addition to the existing Mexico City service from Orlando International Airport and Fort Lauderdale. Following the new service, JetBlue will run a total of six daily flights between the United States and the Mexican capital.The additional Mexico City service is a result of the DOT’s requirement for a few carriers to divest airport slots to boost competition at the Mexico City International Airport.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company will operate the new services to Cuba and Mexico on an Airbus A320 aircraft featuring comfortable seating, complimentary snacks, high-speed internet and other high-end amenities.

2388,DAL,"With the Q1 earnings season at the tail end, April traffic reports from airlines dominated headlines over the past five trading days. Evidently, key airline players like United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report), Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) and GOL Linhas Aereas Inteligentes S.A. (GOL  -  Free Report) unveiled their respective traffic reports during the week.While Latin American carrier GOL Linhas reported an increase in load factor (percentage of seats filled with passengers) as traffic growth outpaced capacity expansion, this key metric declined at its U.S. counterparts — Delta, United Continental and Southwest — due to capacity overexpansion.Another downside over the past five trading days was the decline in the stock price of Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. (HA  -  Free Report), the parent company of Hawaiian Airlines. Shares of the company declined on fears of intensifying competition in Hawaii as Southwest Airlines unveiled a detailed plan to offer flights connecting Hawaii and California. Subsequently, the Dallas-based carrier intends to offer inter-island flights, which will be a bigger blow to Hawaiian Airlines.American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) also dominated headlines by virtue of its decision to discontinue flights connecting Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport and Beijing, from October this year.  Lack of profitability on the route led to the carrier’s decision.Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return(Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for May 2, 2018).Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1. At Delta, consolidated traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs), came in at 18.26 billion, up 3.7% year over year. Consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) climbed 4% to 21.45 billion on a year-over-year basis. Additionally, the carrier recorded an on-time performance (mainline) of 86.4% and completion factor (mainline) of 99.7% for April. Approximately, 15.9 million passengers flew on Delta during the period (Read more: Delta's April Traffic Increases, Load Factor Down).2. April traffic growth (5.1%) was outpaced by capacity expansion (6.1%) at United Airlines as well. Consequently, load factor declined 80 basis points to 82.3%. The company posted an on-time performance of 73% and a completion factor of 99.8% for the month.3. American Airlines introduced several other routes, apart from deciding to terminate its Chicago-Beijing service. In a customer-friendly move, the company announced the launch of multiple new flights (seasonal as well as year-round) to the Caribbean and Hawaii. For example, the carrier intends to start seasonal service from Chicago to Honolulu, which will run through the annual spring break season (Read more: American Airlines to Pull the Plug on Chicago-Beijing Service).American Airlines carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

However, passenger count increased 6.3% at the carrier in April. Passenger count of this Honolulu County, HI-based carrier may decline drastically in the event of Southwest Airlines entering Hawaii. 5. At GOL Linhas, consolidated traffic, measured in revenue passenger kilometers (RPK), nudged up 1.9% to 2.76 billion. The metric rose 3% on the domestic front, while the international figure declined 7.2%.On a year-over-year basis, consolidated capacity (or available seat kilometers/ASKs) inched up 0.8% to 3.46 billion, primarily on the back of 1.3% growth in domestic capacity. The carrier further witnessed 3.5% increase in passenger count in April (Read more: Gol Linhas' Traffic & Load Factor Increase in April).6. Southwest Airlines has been going through tough times lately. Late last month, the carrier gave a lackluster outlook for the second quarter due to weakness pertaining to bookings following a mid-air tragedy in one of its flights. Continuing the dismal trend, one of its flights was diverted during the week owing to a broken window.Moreover, the carrier reported dismal traffic numbers for April. As expected, traffic for the month declined but capacity expanded. Consequently, load factor declined to the tune of 150 basis to 82.5% in the month.Price Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months. CompanyPast WeekLast 6 monthsHA-10.1%11.4%UAL-0.3%15.9%GOL-7.8%11.6%DAL0.02%6.5%JBLU-0.5%2.2%AAL1.8%-6.1%SAVE2.9%5.2%LUV0.2%-2.1%CPA-1.3%-6.5%ALK-2.8%-1.3%                  The table above shows that majority of the airline stocks traded in the red over the past week leading to the NYSE ARCA Airline Index declining 1.7% in the period.

2389,DAL,"Oil prices have been on an uptrend this year, thanks to various reasons like the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. In fact, oil prices have climbed more than 17% on a year-to-date basis. In line with the upsurge, oil prices jumped above $70 a barrel on May 4 due to concerns pertaining to the economic crisis in Venezuela— a major oil exporter— and the possibility of fresh sanctions on Iran by the United States. This marks a phenomenal turnaround for the commodity, which was trading at around $30 a barrel in 2016. Airlines: Feeling the HeatIt is a well-documented fact that the health of airline stocks is inversely related to oil prices. This is because fuel costs represent one of the most significant expenses for carriers. Evidently, the rise in oil prices induces significant increase in operating expenses of carriers, thus limiting bottom-line growth.In fact, the first-quarter earnings season, which is almost over for airlines, witnessed many stocks in the space suffering due to rise in fuel costs. Notably, oil prices were up approximately 8% in the January-to-March period.The gloomy picture for airlines in this respect can be gauged from the fact that shares of American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) and Spirit Airlines, Inc. (SAVE  -  Free Report) declined after the companies unveiled their respective first-quarter earnings results late last month. This was despite the carriers reporting better-than-expected earnings. High fuel costs were primarily responsible for the stocks shedding value. While average fuel price (consolidated and inclusive of taxes) increased 23.6% year over year at American Airlines, the metric surged 21.5% at Spirit Airlines.Moreover, American Airlines trimmed its current-year earnings projection mainly on high fuel costs. The likes of Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) and Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report) also saw their respective bottom line contract on a year-over-year basis mainly due to high fuel costs.All the above-mentioned stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.  Disappointing Price PerformanceThe struggles of airline stocks chiefly due to surge in oil prices can be gauged from the fact that the Zacks Airline industry has shed 10.8% of its value so far this year. Oil Price Surge Likely to Hurt in Q2  The upsurge in oil prices due to the above-mentioned reasons is likely to limit bottom-line growth for airlines in the second quarter as well. This is evident from the forecasts of various carriers on fuel costs for the current quarter.For the second quarter, United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report) expects average fuel price per gallon (on a consolidated basis) between $2.18 and $2.23, which is higher than the first-quarter figure of $2.11. At Delta, the same is expected between $2.07 and $2.12 in the second quarter, higher than the first-quarter figure of $2.01.American Airlines too expects to incur a higher amount in the second quarter on consolidated jet fuel (inclusive of taxes) compared with the first-quarter figure of $2.10 per gallon. Other carriers like JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) and Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) also expect to incur significantly higher costs on fuel in the second quarter of 2018.Will Air Travel Become More Expensive?In a bid to counter the challenges posed by surging oil prices, airlines are likely to increase air fares. They might pass on the increased costs to passengers to prevent profits from being dented. In fact, American Airlines’ CEO, Doug Parker, too has hinted at higher ticket prices. Some market watchers believe that fuel surcharges may be added to tickets.Already, Spirit Airlines has increased ticket prices (one-way) to the tune of $3. Also, other carriers are anticipated to follow suite.According to data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, average airfares (adjusted) in the United States have already increased in two successive months this year — February and March. With fuel costs eating into the profits of airlines, fares are anticipated to increase further in the current year.However, according to Parker, even if air fares rise, they will not hurt the strong demand for air travel. An improving economy, a much-improved job market and rising disposable income have been the factors supporting the strong demand in the space. Also, consumer confidence remains strong resulting in more Americans going on vacations.This optimism can be gauged from American Airlines' bullish second-quarter outlook on total revenue per available seat miles (TRASM: a key measure of unit revenues), despite fuel cost woes. TRASM is anticipated to increase in the band of 1.5-3.5%. Moreover, according to some market watchers this phase of higher fuel costs might promote capacity discipline. This a boon for carriers as woes related to capacity overexpansion had plagued airlines for quite some time.With so many possibilities in the cards, we expect investors to remain focused on updates from the space as sector participants look to devise ways to eliminate threats from rising oil prices.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2390,DAL,"Airlines companies reported Q1 earnings in the last 20 days, which came in mixed. The pure-play aviation ETF U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS  -  Free Report) did not show any improvement in this time frame. Let’s take a look at some of the key first-quarter 2018 earnings results in the industry and see if the fund can attain altitude ahead.Q1 Results in DetailOn Apr 12, Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) kicked off the first-quarter earnings season in the airline space, with in-line earnings and a top-line beat. Its first-quarter 2018, earnings per share (excluding 3 cents from non-recurring items) of 74 cents beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 73 cents. Earnings however decreased 3.9% on a year-over-year basis. Operating revenues of $9,968 million also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9,881.2 million. Also, it compared favorably with the year-ago number of $9,148 million.In mid-April, United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected results in the first quarter of 2018. The company’s earnings (excluding 2 cents from non-recurring items) of 50 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 49 cents. Moreover, the bottom line climbed 25% year over year owing to higher revenues. Operating revenues of $9,032 million in the first quarter also came in ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9,012.5 million and increased 7.3% year over year. Strong demand for air travel boosted revenues.Low-cost carrier Southwest Airlines Co.’s (LUV  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings per share (excluding 4 cents from non-recurring items) of 75 cents came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Operating revenues of $4,944 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,017.6 million. However, the company’s Q2 guidance was bleak.American Airlines Group Inc.’s (AAL  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings (excluding 36 cents from non-recurring items) of 75 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Quarterly earnings increased approximately 23% on a year-over-year basis despite higher costs. Revenues of $10,401 million fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10,411.9 million. Strong demand for air travel led to the year-over-year improvement in the top line.Low-cost carrier JetBlue Airways Corporation’s (JBLU  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings per share of 27 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 22 cents. The bottom line also increased 8% year over year backed by higher passenger revenues. However, total operating revenues of $1,754 million fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,757.6 million. Nevertheless, the top line increased more than 9% from the year-ago figure.Alaska Air Group Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 earnings (excluding 11 cents from non-recurring items) of 14 cents, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents. However, the bottom line declined 86.7% on a year-over-year basis due to high costs. Revenues came in at $1,832 million, marginally above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,830.6 million. The top line improved 5% year over year.Should You Buy JETS on the Dip?By now, one must have understood from the beat ratios that the fundamentals are mixed. Oil prices play a crucial role in the airlines’ cost structure. If oil prices manage to see an uptrend in the coming days on the extension of the OPEC output curb deal, airlines may suffer on profit margins. Rising geopolitical risks related to trade war and chaos in Middle East are the other threats (read: Top Performing Energy ETFs of 2018).Nevertheless, investors having a strong stomach for oil-related risks, faith in the compelling valuation of airline stocks and seeking to play the sector on the expected benefit of the tax reform and “pricing discipline (per Bernstein)”, may target it in the ETF form. Below we highlight the fund in detail:JETS in FocusThe $99.3 million-fund holds more than 33 securities in its portfolio and is concentrated on a few individual securities. United Continental (12.54%), Delta Airlines (12.00%), Southwest Airlines (11.53%) and American Airlines (10.51%) are the top four elements in the basket. Alaska Air Group and JetBlue hold the sixth and ninth positions in the fund with 4.38% and 3.97% weights, respectively. The product charges 60 bps in fees.

2391,DAL,"The already struggling airline stocks suffered further blow yesterday when the key sector participant — American Airlines Group, Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) — trimmed its view for second-quarter unit revenues. The bearish view for the key metric naturally disappointed investors. Consequently, the American Airlines stock was pummelled following the bleak guidance, closing the trading session on Jul 11 at $35.96, down 8.1% over the Jul 10 close.However, the damage was not limited to American Airlines and other key sector participants like Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report), United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report) also felt the heat and declined significantly yesterday. Consequently, the sector tracker — the NYSE ARCA Airline Index — shed 2.4% of its value on Jul 11.What Did American Airlines Say?American Airlines revealed the damaging forecast at an Investor Update. Citing softer-than-expected yields in the domestic market, the airline behemoth trimmed its guidance for total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM: a key measure of unit revenue) in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.The carrier now expects the metric to grow approximately between 1% and 3% on a year-over-year basis. The earlier guidance had called for the metric to grow approximately in the 1.5 - 3.5% range. Heightened competition in key domestic markets was primarily responsible for weak prices. Moreover, with oil prices on an uptrend, with a 14% increase in the April-June period, American Airlines increased its second-quarter forecast for average fuel prices per gallon. The metric is now expected between $2.24 and $2.29 (previous guidance: $2.18 - $2.23).Additionally, the carrier expects its pre-tax income to be hurt to the tune of $35 million due to the computer failure at American Airlines’ regional carrier PSA Airlines, last month. The carrier’s operations went haywire as a result of this disruption and it had to call off more than 2, 500 flights.Pre-tax margin is expected in the band of 7.5% to 9.5%.The only favorable part of the update was regarding the second-quarter guidance on cost per available seat miles, excluding fuel and other special items. The metric is now expected to increase in the range of 1.5% to 3.5% year over year. The earlier guidance had called for the metric to grow approximately in the 2.5-4.5 % range. Lower-than-expected maintenance costs primarily led to the new projection.Gloomy Sectoral PictureAmerican Airlines’ bearish projections on TRASM and fuel costs further highlight the fact that the overall sentiment pertaining to airlines is anything but positive ahead of the earnings season. This is mainly because oil prices have been on the rise this year, shooting up more than 20% so far. Apart from geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, the economic crisis in Venezuela — a major oil exporter — and OPEC’s recent plans of a lower-than-expected output raise have backed the rally in oil prices. Since fuel expenses are significant for airlines, an increase in oil prices is unfavorable for the space.Apart from high fuel costs, expenses on the labor front are likely to limit bottom-line growth for carrier in the second quarter. Also, capacity-related woes might prevent airlines from flying high in the current earnings season. Capacity expansion may lead to oversupply in the market even as fuel costs remain well below the highs of mid-2014 despite the recent resurgence.Moreover, airfares have remained low, with the metric declining in April, May and June. Although favorable for passengers, low air fares are a drag for airline companies. Customer-related issues represent another headwind for airlines.For example, the flight 1380 incident on Apr 17 is still hurting Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report). In fact, this Dallas-based low-cost carrier trimmed its unit revenue view for the soon-to-be reported quarter mainly due to soft bookings on its flights after the unfortunate mid-air incident, which claimed one life and injured many.Zacks Industry Rank Highlights the StrugglesThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates continued underperformance in the near term.The Zacks Airline industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #213, which places it at the bottom 17% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Industry Underperformance YTDJudging by shareholder returns so far this year, it seems that headwinds like high fuel costs, capacity-related issues and technological glitches have contributed to investors’ pessimism surrounding the space.The  Zacks Airline industry, which is part of the broader Zacks Transportation Sector, has underperformed both the S&P 500 and its own sector year to date.While the stocks in this industry have collectively lost 18.2%, the Zacks Transportation Sector has gained 3.5% of its value. Meanwhile, the Zacks S&P 500 Composite has rallied 4.7% on a year-to-date basis.YTD Price Performance  Dump These Carriers from Your Portfolio NowIn view of the above challenges confronting carriers, we believe the second quarter earnings season can turn out to be more of a disappointment for airline players.Given this gloomy background, we pinpoint four airline players which investors would do well to get rid of. All the stocks have an unfavorable Zacks Rank and have witnessed negative earnings estimate revisions recently.(You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here). Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY  -  Free Report) is a low-cost carrier based in Ireland. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). This European carrier has been suffering from unrest on the labor front for quite some time. Moreover, rising fuel costs are anticipated to limit bottom-line growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2019 and 2020 earnings moved south 6.8% and 7%, respectively, in the last 60 days. This reflects investor’s pessimism surrounding the stock.  Furthermore, the stock has a VGM Score of C, which highlights its unattractiveness. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.Such a score allows investors to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score. The stock has shed 7.8% of its value in the last three months.  Alaska Air Group (ALK  -  Free Report), the holding company of Alaska Airlines, is based in Seattle, WA. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). High costs have been putting pressure on the company’s bottom line for quite some time, and the second quarter of 2018 is unlikely to be an exception.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter and current-year earnings moved south 6.3% and 7.9%, respectively, in the last 60 days. The stock has shed 18.1% of its value year to date. SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report) is based in St. George, UT and operates as a regional airline in the United States through its subsidiaries. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #4. High operating expenses are likely to hurt SkyWest’s bottom line in the second quarter of 2018.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings moved south 0.9% in the last 90 days. Moreover, the company’s Momentum Score of D further highlights its short-term unattractiveness. The stock has shed 2.1% of its value over the last six months. Azul SA (AZUL  -  Free Report) is the largest airline in Brazil in terms of the number of cities served. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of loss for the second quarter has widened significantly at Azul over the last 60 days.Additionally, the stock, carrying a Zacks Rank #4, has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 37% downward in the last 60 days and has shed 32.2% of its value year to date. Moreover, the company’s Momentum Score of D further highlights its short-term unattractiveness. The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

2392,DAL,"Last week, Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) kick-started the first-quarter earnings season for the airline space. This Atlanta, GA-based carrier reported better-than-expected revenues and earnings per share. However, high fuel costs contributed to a year-over-year decline in earnings.United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) also reported better-than-expected results in the quarter. Results were aided by strong demand for air travel and higher ticket prices. This Chicago-based carrier’s decision to trim its capacity growth plans in the current year is also encouraging.On the non-earnings front, Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report) grabbed headlines for a wrong reason. Shares of the carrier tanked following a news report aired on television, which questioned the safety standards on its flights. Currently, the allegations are being investigated by Kaplan Fox & Kilsheimer LLP.Meanwhile, Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) invited the attention of regulators, after an engine on one of its planes (Boeing 737-700) exploded mid-air. To make matters worse, one of the passengers on that ill-fated flight expired.JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) also featured in the headlines by virtue of its bullish view on first-quarter unit revenues. The company was in the news due to labor-related issues as well. Flight attendants at this low-cost carrier voted in favor of joining the Transport Workers Union. By doing so, they have become the second labor group to be unionized at JetBlue. In 2014, the carrier’s pilots joined the Air Line Pilots Association.On the price front, the NYSE ARCA Airline index increased 1.1% to $113.60 over the past five trading days.Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  (Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Apr 11, 2018).Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1.

2394,DAL,"An earnings season keeps investors busy in comparing estimates with actual outcomes. Prior to the releases, investors look to add stocks that have the potential to surpass earnings expectations. This is because more often than not, an earnings beat positively impacts the stock price. However, the million-dollar question is how to pick the potential winners?Through this write-up, we intend to help investors zero in on airline stocks that are likely to report better-than-expected earnings per share in second-quarter 2018 despite headwinds like increasing fuel costs. We remind investors that airline stocks are an integral part of the Zacks Transportation sector.Notably, the second-quarter earnings season will be kicked off by Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) on Jul 12. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Dull Sectoral PictureThe overall sentiment pertaining to airlines is anything but positive ahead of the earnings season. This is mainly because oil prices have been on the rise this year, shooting up by more than 20% so far. Apart from the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, the economic crisis in Venezuela — a major oil exporter — and OPEC’s recent plans of a lower-than-expected output raise have backed the rally in oil prices. Since fuel expenses are significant for airlines, an increase in oil prices is unfavorable for the space.Apart from high fuel costs, expenses on the labor front are likely to limit bottom-line growth for carrier in the second quarter. Also, capacity related woes might prevent airlines from flying high in the current earnings season. Capacity expansion may lead to oversupply in the market even as fuel costs remain well below the highs of mid-2014 despite the recent resurgence.Moreover, airfares have remained low, with the metric declining in April, May and June. Although favorable for passengers, low air fares are a drag for airline companies. Customer-related issues represent another headwind for airlines.For example, the flight 1380 incident on Apr 17 is still hurting Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report). In fact, this Dallas-based low-cost carrier trimmed its unit revenue view for the soon-to-be reported quarter mainly due to soft bookings on its flights after the unfortunate mid-air incident, which claimed one life and injured many.Zacks Industry Rank Highlights the StrugglesThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates continued underperformance in the near term.The Zacks Airline industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #230, which places it at the bottom 10% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Not Thorns Alone, Some Roses TooDespite the above-mentioned headwinds, the space is not totally bereft of positives. The airline industry is benefiting from strong demand for air travel. Declining air fares along with a much-improved job market and rising disposable income have provided consumers an added incentive to opt for air travel.The bullish projection by the Airlines for America (A4A) for the ongoing summer season (Jun 1 – Aug 31) confirms the robust demand. The association expects the season to be the busiest one for U.S. carriers in terms of air travel. In keeping with the bullish projection, Delta and United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL) transported record number of passengers in June. While Delta carried 17.7 million passengers, 15.2 million passengers flew on United Continental flights in the month.Furthermore, the solid financial health of most carriers has prompted them to indulge in shareholder-friendly activities (dividends and buybacks). For instance, Southwest Airlines raised its dividend payout during the second quarter of 2018. We expect an uptick in these shareholder-friendly activities from carriers following the new tax law. This is because with significant reduction in tax bills, more cash is expected to remain in the hands of these companies to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases among others.In view of their strong balance sheets, carriers have been making significant investments to upgrade their fleet, to improve the flying experience of passengers. For example, JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) recently agreed to buy at least 60 A220-300 jets from Airbus.Airlines Likely to Face Turbulence in Q2The above write-up clearly suggests that the negatives will easily outweigh the positives in the airline space as we head into the second-quarter earnings season. In fact, the above-mentioned headwinds are likely to prevent stocks in the space from flying high this earnings season.However, some airline stocks are still likely to report better-than-expected earnings per share in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Moreover, the conservative nature of the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings following multiple downward revisions due to the above headwinds may not make earnings beat too difficult for carriers this earnings season.Selection of OutperformersWith the airline space being densely populated, the task of selecting the right stocks is by no means an easy one. Given the numerous stocks in the sector that almost always muddle one’s stock-picking prowess, the Zacks methodology might provide some relief.Our research shows that for stocks with the combination of a Zacks Rank #1, 2 (Buy) or 3 and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.4 Airline PicksBased on the above methodology, we have zeroed in on four airline stocks that are likely to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings. In fact, an earnings beat boosts investors’ confidence in the stock, which is reflected in its rapid price appreciation. These stocks should therefore turn out to be great additions to your portfolio ahead of their earnings releases.Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) is headquartered in Atlanta, GA. The company has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.57%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 1 cent above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.76. The favorable combination makes an earnings beat likely in the quarter.Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report) is the parent company of Allegiant Air. This Las Vegas-based stock has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +1.29%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 3 cents above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.72. The favorable combination makes an earnings beat likely for this low-cost carrier, which will unveil its second-quarter earnings report on Jul 25.JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) is a Long Island City, NY-based low-cost carrier. The company, which will report earnings on Jul 24, has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +2.74%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 1 cent above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 38 cents. The favorable combination makes an earnings beat likely in the quarter.LATAM Airlines Group S.A. (LTM  -  Free Report) is the final member in our list of potential outperformers. It is a provider of passenger and cargo air transportation services in South America, North/Central America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Oceania.

2395,DAL,"The Q1 earnings season is off to a solid start with big names like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) and Citigroup reporting better-than-expected results. Per the latest Earnings Preview , the impressive performance is likely to continue. On a year-over-year basis, both the top and bottom line (for S&P 500 companies) are projected to improve 16.6% and 7.5%, respectively, in this reporting cycle.The report further predicts that 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors will end the Q1 earnings season with a year-over-year increase in the bottom line. Of which, 11 are anticipated to exhibit double-digit earnings growth.     One of those sectors is the transportation sector, wherein earnings are anticipated to increase 15.4%. Notably, this highly diversified sector includes airlines, railroads, truckers, equipment and leasing companies, among others. We believe that the favorable economic indicators along with the new tax law bodes well for the sector participants.Already, key sector participants from the transportation sector namely, United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report), CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) and Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report), posted better-than-expected earnings per share and revenues in the current reporting cycle.However, rise in fuel costs does not augur well for transportation stocks. This is because expenses pertaining to fuel represent one of the major input costs for any transportation company. Of late, oil prices have been on an uptrend and were up approximately 8% in the Q1 (January-March period).Given this backdrop, investors interested in the transportation space will keenly await Q1 reports from key players like Werner Enterprises, Inc. (WERN  -  Free Report), GATX Corporation (GATX  -  Free Report) and Marten Transport, Ltd. (MRTN  -  Free Report) on Apr 19.According to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Werner Enterprises is one of the country’s leading carriers and logistics operators, headquartered in Omaha, NE. Although the company carries a Zacks Rank #3, it is unlikely to report better-than-expected earnings in the quarter. This is because it has an Earnings ESP of -1.64% (the Most Accurate estimate of 36 cents per share comes in a penny lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate).

2398,DAL,"Thursday, July 12, 2018Matching yesterday’s Producer Price Index (PPI) figures, this morning we see results for the Consumer Price Index (CPI): a headline read of +0.1% is a tick below expectations (PPI numbers came in 10 basis points hotter than anticipated), but +0.2% when we strip out volatile food & energy costs. The PPI and CPI numbers are not always in real-time lock-step, but do show trends continuing with inflation seeping further into the economy.Pull out the focus a bit to look at the year-over-year numbers: CPI reached 2.9% — 10 basis points ahead of expectations. Ex-food & energy, we see this figure drop to 2.3%, in line with estimates. This also compares to the PPI’s “core” read of 2.8%. To give even more perspective here, by way of explaining these seemingly tepid numbers are actually historically pretty hot, the last time we saw year-over-year headline CPI north of 2.9% was back in December of 2011; ex-food & energy year over year was last higher than 2.3% in September 2008, a month prior to the Great Recession.Initial Jobless Claims continued their winning ways ahead of the bell this morning as well, falling 18,000 claims back to historic lows of 214K for last week. We had begun to think our labor market was having trouble sustaining the sub-225K range, but looking back at the 4-week average, we’re still at 223K. Keep in mind these claims reflect the week with Independence Day in the middle of it, so these figures are probably showing some near-term seasonality.Continuing Claims also sank lower, by 3,000 to 1.74 million last week. Again, consider the holiday-shortened time period, but there’s simply no denying that we are in excellent shape with this few continuing jobless claims week over week. We have been under 1.8 million for months now, and it hasn’t been too long since we breathed a collective sigh of relief that we’d finally sunk below 2 million claims per week.Also, while we await Q2 earnings from some of Wall Street’s biggest banks tomorrow morning, Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) is out with new quarterly numbers, topping estimates on both top and bottom lines. Earnings of $1.77 per share outperformed the Zacks consensus by a nickel, while revenues of $11.78 billion in the quarter beat the $11.68 billion analysts were expecting. PRASM, an important metric for airline companies, rose 4.4% year over year, and Delta also announced a 15% rise in its dividend yield. Shares are up 1.5% a half-hour before the opening bell.

2399,DAL,"Shares of Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) have lost 22.2% so far this year, underperforming its industry's decline of 11.1%. Why the Lackluster Price Performance?Southwest Airlines has faced multiple headwinds this year. In April, a passenger on its flight (1380) died due to the mid-air engine explosion. This incident adversely impacted travel demand at Southwest Airlines, resulting in soft bookings.Moreover, Southwest Airlines, like its fellow-airline operators Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report), American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) and JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU  -  Free Report), has been hit hard by the rise in oil prices.This low-cost carrier issued a lackluster view for second-quarter unit revenues due to weak bookings and rising fuel costs. The company expects operating revenue per available seat mile (RASM) to decline around 3% year over year (the earlier guidance had called for a decline in the 1-3% range).With fuel prices on the rise, the Dallas-based carrier trimmed its capacity (measured in available seat mile or ASMs) growth view.  It now anticipates second-quarter capacity to increase approximately 3.5%. Earlier, the company had called for 3.5-4% growth in the metric.Additionally, the company projects ASM in the low 4% range compared with its prior forecast in the low 5% range. Also, for the latter half of the year, ASM is anticipated to expand approximately 6% year over year, lower than its earlier view of a rise in the low 7% range.Other Unfavorable ReadingsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter and full-year 2018 earnings moved south 14.7% and 9%, respectively, in the last 60 days. This reflects investor’s pessimism surrounding the stock. Furthermore, the stock has a VGM Score of C, which highlights its unattractiveness. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.Such a score allows investors to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score.Undoubtedly, the above negatives substantiate the company’s Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6% and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

2400,DAL,"The Q1 earnings season is in the nascent stage with a handful of S&P 500 participants having reported results so far. In fact, this reporting cycle has started on a strong note courtesy of earnings beats from big names in the banking space like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report). The current week is also going to be a busy one with several companies reporting their quarterly results. This week alone will see 156 companies, including 53 S&P 500 participants, revealing their Q1 numbers.In fact, the projection for Q1 earnings season is very encouraging. Per the latest earnings preview, the bottom line for S&P 500 companies is expected to expand at a highly impressive rate of 16.6% on a year-over-year basis. Total revenues for the same set of companies are projected to grow 7.5%. The report further predicts that 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors will end the Q1 earnings season with the bottom line improving year over year. Out of which, 11 are anticipated to exhibit double-digit earnings growth.One of those sectors is the transportation sector, wherein earnings are anticipated to increase 15.4%. Notably, this highly diversified sector includes airlines and railroads, among others. We believe that the favorable economic indicators along with promising fiscal and regulatory policies from the current administration bode well for the sector.Already, the transportation sector has seen one of its key members — Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) — reporting better-than-expected earnings per share and revenues in Q1. However, high fuel costs contributed to a year-over-year decline in earnings. The trend is likely to continue through the current reporting cycle as fuel costs are on the rise and expenses pertaining to fuel represent one of the major input costs for any transportation company.Of late, oil prices have been on an uptrend and were up approximately 8% in the Q1 (January-March) period. In fact, the first quarter of 2018 witnessed U.S. oil benchmark reach its highest settlement since December 2014.Given this backdrop, investors should keenly await earnings reports of key transportation companies —  the Jacksonville, FL- based railroad operator, CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) and the Chicago-based airline heavyweight, United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report) —  on Apr 17.UAL vs. CSXWe have assessed these transportation companies on the following parameters.Price PerformanceIn the first quarter of 2018, United Continental clearly outpaced CSX in terms of price performance. United Continental rallied 3% compared with CSX’s 1.2% rally. ESP and Earnings HistoryEarnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in their upcoming earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Our research shows that for stocks with the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.United Continentalis likely to beat earnings in the quarter to be reported. This is because the stock has an Earnings ESP of +2.50% and a Zacks Rank #3. Previously too, our model conclusively showed an earnings beat as the Earnings ESP was +7.00% with a same Zacks Rank (Read more: United Continental's  Q1 Earnings: A Beat in the Cards?)However, the picture is opposite for CSX as it has an Earnings ESP of -1.71% and a Zacks Rank of 3. (Read more: CSX to Report Q1 Earnings: What's in Store for the Stock?)You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Even with respect to earnings surprise history United Continental holds the edge over CSX. This is because the airline has managed to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 4.6%. On the other hand, CSX outpaced the consensus mark in three of the past four quarters by an average of 10.3%.Projected Earnings GrowthWe expect year-over-year earnings growth for the soon-to-be-reported quarter to be 29.4% for CSX, higher than 22.5% for United Continental.Bottom LineOur comparative analysis shows that United Continental is poised for a better first quarter, as the company clearly scores higher than CSX with respect to most of the considered parameters.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs Pending A medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

2403,DAL,"The past week was dominated by updates from the International Air Transport Association (“IATA”). The monthly data released by the IATA showcased a 6.2% year-over-year increase in demand for air travel across the globe for April 2018.Another significant update from the trade association emerged recently, when it trimmed its 2018 profitability outlook for the airline industry to $33.8 billion from $38.4 billion anticipated earlier. Notably, high fuel costs were primarily responsible for the view cut. Bulk of the global profits ($15 billion) are expected to come from the North American region.The IATA updates apart, the Atlanta, GA-based airline behemoth Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) was in the news by virtue of its May traffic report. In the month, load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) declined as traffic growth was outpaced by capacity expansion.Meanwhile, Dallas-based Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) continues to feel the pinch of the deadly accident on its flight in April, which claimed one life. Due to low ticket sales as a result of the accident apart from the spike in oil prices, this low-cost carrier issued a second-quarter unit revenue view, which was at the lower end of its previous forecast. Operating revenue per available seat mile (RASM) is anticipated to decline around 3% year over year (the earlier guidance had called for a decline in the 1-3% range).Furthermore, JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU  -  Free Report) joined fellow-carriers like American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) in revamping its policy pertaining to emotional support animals on its flights.Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return(Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for May 30, 2018).Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1. At its 74th Annual General Meeting in Sydney, Australia, the IATA stated that due to rising fuel costs and other factors like the ongoing geopolitical tensions, airline companies are expected to be less profitable in 2018 than previously anticipated. Global net profit margin is expected to contract to 4.1% in 2018 from 5% a year ago. However, the top line is projected to increase 10.7% on the back of higher passenger and cargo revenues.Even though, passenger air travel growth in 2018 (7%) is anticipated to be slower than the phenomenal 8.1% growth witnessed last year, it compares favorably to the 20-year average growth rate (Read more: IATA Trims 2018 Airlines Profit Forecast Due to High Costs).Earlier in the week, IATA also released its global traffic numbers for April. Although global travel demand (measured in revenue passenger kilometers or RPKs) increased year over year, the metric compared unfavorably to the March reading when traffic expanded 9.7% — the highest growth rate in 12 months. With fuel costs on the rise, air fares are likely to increase in the remainder of the year.On a year-over-year basis, traffic growth was evident in both international (4.8%) and domestic (8.5%) markets, which resulted in a rise in the overall figure. Total capacity ((available seat kilometers or ASKs) increased 5.9% in the month. Load factor also improved 20 basis points to 82.3% owing to higher traffic growth. In fact, the reading on load factor was a record as far as the month of April was concerned.2. At Delta, consolidated traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs), came in at 19.69 billion, up 2.9% year over year. Consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) climbed 3.5% to 22.83 billion on a year-over-year basis (Read more: Delta May Traffic Shows a Rise, Load Factor Drops).Meanwhile, Delta and Korean Air extended their codeshare agreement on flights in the United States as both the companies aim to boost traffic in the highly lucrative trans-Pacific market. This customer-friendly move followed the launch of a joint venture partnership between the two earlier this year. A codeshare deal allows sharing of flights, which implies that a passenger has the free will to avail any flight operated by either of the companies under the agreement, irrespective of the flight number.Delta carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). However, you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.3. Southwest Airlines trimmed its capacity outlooks for second-quarter and full-year 2018 due to increasing fuel prices. The company now anticipates second-quarter available seat mile (ASM) or capacity to rise approximately 3.5%. Earlier, it had called for 3.5-4% growth in the metric. Also, for the latter half of the year, ASM is anticipated to expand approximately 6% year over year, lower than its earlier view of a rise in the low 7% range (read more: Southwest Trims View on Soft Bookings & Spike in Oil Prices).4. Ireland-based Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY  -  Free Report) reported solid traffic data for May, courtesy of low air ticket prices. The carrier’s traffic improved 6% year over year in the month. Load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) rose to 96% from 95% a year ago on the back of decline in air ticket prices. The impressive traffic figures came despite the carrier having to cancel more than 1,100 flights in May due to staff shortages, inclement weather and other factors.5. From Jul 1, passengers will only be allowed to carry cats, dogs and miniature horses as emotional support animals on JetBlue flights. As part of tightening its policy, this low-cost carrier will ask the relevant passengers to provide extensive documentation pertaining to the animal’s health and behavior.In addition, the person has to provide proof related to its vaccinations and other factors within 48 hours before the flight. Under the stricter rules, the concerned passenger will also have to sign a document taking full responsibility for any injury caused by the animal he/she is carrying on the flight.Price Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months. CompanyPast WeekLast 6 monthsHA-0.9%-9.9%UAL-0.9%-1.7%GOL-1.1%-25.5%DAL0.6%-1.5%JBLU-0.8%-3.7%AAL1.7%-14.8%SAVE0.9%-3.8%LUV-0.7%-4.5%CPA-2.4%-4.8%ALK1.1%6.9%                  The table above shows that most airline stocks traded in the red over the past week, leading to the NYSE ARCA Airline Index depreciating almost 1% in the period.

2404,DAL,"Warren Buffett is one of the world’s most respected investors. He and Berkshire Hathaway  have long favored companies that offer reasonable valuations, mixed with growth opportunities, which sounds simple enough. Here’s a look at some of Berkshire’s top holdings to see if they currently present investors solid value.The last time Berkshire disclosed its holdings it boasted a massive $170 billion stock portfolio. The top five holdings represented roughly 68% of the aggregate fair value. The list featured Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) at $40.7 billion, Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) at $25.2 billion, Bank of America (BAC) at $21.0 billion, Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) at $17.4 billion, and American Express (AXP  -  Free Report) at $14.1 billion. The conglomerate’s other holdings included Kraft Heinz (KHC  -  Free Report), Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report), and dozens of other stocks, which they owned much smaller amounts of.So now that we have covered some of Berkshire’s top holdings, let’s take a look at what kind of value Buffett’s top three holdings currently present.Apple Price - Performance/ Valuation Apple is Berkshire’s biggest holding, a spot that is recently took over. In fact, at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017 the company owned $28.2 billion worth of Apple stock. Therefore, Berkshire bought roughly $12.5 billion worth of shares in a very short amount of time.Shares of Apple have skyrocketed nearly 95% over the last two years, outpacing the S&P 500’s roughly 30% surge. Apple stock has also climbed over 14% since the start of the year, which helped it hit a brand new all-time high on Tuesday.Coming into Wednesday, Apple stock was trading at 15.7X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates. Over the last year, Apple has traded as high as 17.2X, with a one-year median of 14.9X. Apple stock has also traded as low as 13.2X during this time period, yet investors should note that Apple stock is trading at a discount to the S&P 500’s 16.9X. Over the last decade, Apple stock has traded as high as 30.8X. Therefore, it is not much of a stretch to say that Apple’s valuation is far from stretched at this time and remains attractive compared to the S&P while remaining relatively in line with its year-long median.Wells Fargo - Price Performance/ Valuation Shares of the embattled banking giant are up just 35% over the last five years, which is far worse the S&P 500’s 71% surge. WFC stock is up 6.6% over the last year but has sunk 8.4% since the start of the year. With that said, Wells Fargo stock currently presents solid value.WFC is trading at 11.3X, marking the slightest of discounts compared to its industry’s 11.4X average—which includes Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), and other banking powers.Investors should note that Wells Fargo has traded as high as 15.6X over the last year, with a one-year median of 12.4X. Therefore, WFC’s current valuation appears more than fair at the moment.Bank of America - Price Performance/ ValuationBank of America has seen its stock price climb nearly 124% over the last five years, which tops the S&P 500’s 71% surge while also beating its industry’s 67% charge. Narrowing the focus a bit more, BAC stock is up over 32% during the last year, nearly doubling its industry’s gains.One might think that these gains would make BAC’s valuation look a little stretch at the moment, but that hardly seems to be the case. Bank of America stock is currently trading at 10.9X, which is just a hair above its year-long low and also represents a discount compared to its year-long median of 12.4X.Investors will note that Bank of America stock is presenting its best value since the fall of 2016. It is also worth pointing out that AAPL, WFC, and BAC are all currently Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

2405,DAL,"Airline stocks have been flying low on the bourses this year with the US Global Jets ETF (JETS  -  Free Report) having lost about 8% year to date (as of Jun 1). The first-quarter earnings season was a mixed bag for major airlines, a tick-up in oil prices being a downer.Oil prices play a crucial role in the airlines’ cost structure. Since crude prices have steady this year as evident from the 9.8% year-to-date jump in WTI crude ETF United States Oil (USO  -  Free Report), airlines should be on guard.  Probably, this is why global airlines recently cut their forecast for industry profits in 2018.The International Air Transport Association (IATA) indicated that the industry is expected to register $33.8 billion in profits this year, down 12% from the prior forecast of $38.4 billion. Other factors that led to the guidance cut were increasing interest rates and a spike in geopolitical tensions.Inside the Looming CrisisIATA expects oil price to average $70 a barrel this year, up from $54.90 last year and its earlier guidance of $60. Lower-than-expected crude inventory built, U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela and the result of the ongoing OPEC output cut boosted oil prices significantly this year (read: Trump, Tariff & Geopolitics Lead May: 10 Top ETF Stories).Per IATA, profit forecast for 2018 will likely be 4.1% of about $750 billion sales. Since 4% is not a compelling margin, IATA believes that the industry is in a delicate condition. Moreover, the ongoing trade tensions are another cause of concern as these could result in a drop in passenger count or air cargo. Notably, the United States and China announced tariffs on each other. Plus, U.S. tariffs on metal imports from the EU, Canada and Mexico were put into effect on Jun 1, as exemption offered earlier in the year lapsed. Needless to say, the United States now needs to be prepared for a chain of tit-for-tat tariffs on a range of products (read: Trade War Tensions Flare Up: Must-Watch ETFs & Stocks).Inside Our Earnings PredictionAgainst this backdrop, let’s take a look at how key airline stocks’ earnings prediction is shaping up. According to the our methodology, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) when combined with a positive Earnings ESP increases our chances of predicting an earnings beat, while Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) stocks are best avoided.United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -0.11%, indicating lesser chances of beating estimates in Q2.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Low-cost carrier Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) has a Zacks Rank #4 and an Earnings ESP of -1.85%, which diminish the possibility of a beat this quarter.JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) has a Zacks Rank #4 and an Earnings ESP of -11.39%, implying that a beat cannot be predicted this quarter.Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.53%, indicating reasonable chances of a beat.American Airlines Group Inc.’s (AAL  -  Free Report) has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +2.31%, again showing higher chances of beating estimates.Alaska Air Group Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report) has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.36%, implying fair chances of an earnings beat in Q2.From the afore-mentioned trend, we clearly see that though challenges linger in the space, all airlines do not face heightened risk. Oil prices need to go much higher before posing a serious threat to the industry. In this regard, investors can take a look at the pure-play airline ETF JETS.JETS in Focus The $98.8 million-fund holds more than 30 securities in its portfolio and is concentrated on a few individual securities. United Continental (12.84%), Delta Airlines (12.51%), Southwest Airlines (11.21%) and American Airlines (10.78%) are the top four elements in the basket.

2406,DAL,"Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) reported traffic figures for May 2018. Consolidated traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs), came in at 19.69 billion, up 2.9% year over year.Consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) climbed 3.5% to 22.83 billion on a year-over-year basis. Consolidated load factor or percentage of seats filled by passengers contracted 40 basis points to 86.3% due to capacity expansion exceeding traffic growth.Additionally, the carrier recorded an on-time performance (mainline) of 85% and a completion factor (mainline) of 99.9%. Approximately, 16.8 million passengers boarded Delta in the month.In the first five months of 2018, Delta generated consolidated RPMs of 87.23 billion (up 3% year over year) and ASMs of 103.74 billion (up 3.1% year over year). Load factor in the period was 84.1% compared with 84.2% at the end of May 2017.Last month, the company made headlines with its CEO Ed Bastian announcing his intention to resume flight services to those destinations where the likes of Etihad Airways, Etihad and Emirates had earlier held an advantageous position. His comment followed after the United States and UAE inked a deal to resolve a long-standing feud between the two countries over government subsidies.Keeping with its CEO’s words, this Atlanta-based carrier announced that it will resume  non-stop flight operations to Mumbai, India next year onward. In fact, to facilitate air travel on this particular route, Delta aims at expanding its codeshare relationship with the Mumbai-based Jet Airways. Extension of this contract would thus allow passengers to fly to other Indian cities as well.Delta Air Lines, Inc. Price  Delta Air Lines, Inc. Price | Delta Air Lines, Inc.

2407,DAL,"At its Annual General Meeting in Sydney, the International Air Transport Association (“IATA”) trimmed its forecast for airlines with respect to profitability for 2018. The research firm predicts that the global net profit for the industry to be $33.8 billion. This is much lower than the 2018 profitability forecast of $38.4 billion, which was unveiled by the organization in December 2017.The world’s leading air transport group has attributed the downward revision of the current-year profitability view mainly to the rise in oil prices. Escalating oil prices apart, labor and interest costs have also weighed on the profitability forecast.The profitability forecast for the current year also compares unfavorably to what was achieved by airlines in 2017 ($38 billion).  Moreover, 2017’s profitability figure is much higher than the $34.5 billion that was projected in December.We note that the 2017 figure of $38 billion was a record for airline companies, boosted by one-time items. Due to this reason, IATA believes that the current-year profitability forecast is an impressive one despite being lower than the year-ago figure.2018 Forecast in DetailsPer IATA, bulk of the global net profits ($15 billion) is expected to come from the North American region, which boasts of carriers like Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report), United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report), Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) and Hawaiian Holdings Inc. (HA  -  Free Report). The estimated figure is lower than $18.4 billion in 2017. The unfavorable comparison is again due to high costs.All the above-mentioned carriers, apart from Southwest, carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). However, you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.European Airlines, which includes the likes of Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY  -  Free Report), are expected to be more profitable in 2018 ($8.6 billion) than the previous year ($8.1 billion). More extensive hedging by European carriers compared to their North American counterparts have made them less vulnerable to the rise in oil prices.Other regions, namely, Asia-Pacific, Latin America and the Middle East are expected to generate post-tax net profit of $8.2 billion, $0.9 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. African carriers are expected to continue their dismal performance in 2018, suffering losses to the tune of $0.1 billion.Global net profit margin is expected to contract to 4.1% in 2018 from 5% a year ago. The top line is however projected to increase 10.7% to $834 billion. The top line is likely to be boosted by higher passenger as well as cargo revenues. Strong demand for air travel has contributed to the 10.8% year over year growth in passenger revenues.Even though, passenger air travel growth in 2018 (7%) is anticipated to be slower than the phenomenal 8.1% growth witnessed last year, it compares favorably to the 20-year average growth rate (5.5%).Capacity is projected to increase by 6.7% in 2018, flat year over year. According to the forecast, load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) for 2016 is expected to expand 20 basis points to 81.7% due to capacity expansion being outweighed by traffic growth.Yield and unit costs are projected to increase by 3.8% and 5.8% respectively. Unit revenue growth for 2018 is projected at 4.2%. With unit costs anticipated to outpace unit revenue growth in the current year it is natural for profitability to be hampered.The research firm has also predicted that the average net profit per departing passenger would be $7.80 per passenger in 2018 compared with $9.30 in 2017. The firm projects that jet fuel prices are likely to escalate around 27.5% to $70 per barrel this year.The expectation is also revised upward from $60 a barrel anticipated, while revealing its expectations in December 2017. Fuel bill is likely to account for 24.2% of total costs in 2018 (21.4% in 2017).High Fuel Costs Likely to See Uptick in AirfaresIn a bid to counter the challenges posed by surging oil prices, airlines are likely to increase air fares. They might pass on the increased costs to passengers to prevent profits from being dented.In fact, American Airlines Group Inc.’s (AAL  -  Free Report) CEO, Doug Parker, hinted recently in Sydney that air travel might become more expensive in the long-term in the event of oil prices remaining high.  Some market watchers believe that fuel surcharges may be added to tickets. Capacity growth would also probably be subdued in the era of rising prices.Disappointing Price PerformanceOil prices have been on an uptrend this year, thanks to various reasons like the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. The struggles of airline stocks chiefly due to surge in oil prices can be gauged from the fact that the Zacks Airline industry has shed 12.9% of its value so far this year, whereas the S&P 500 index has gained 2.2% in the same period.ConclusionWhat is worse is that oil prices are anticipated to increase further from the current level of around $65 a barrel, as envisioned by the IATA. With the organisation trimming airlines profitability forecast for the current year mainly due to the upsurge in oil prices, we expect the struggles for airline stocks to continue in the remainder of the year.This is likely to result in an uptick in airfares, as mentioned above. However, some market watchers believe that this phase of higher fuel costs might promote capacity discipline. This a boon for carriers as woes related to capacity overexpansion had plagued airlines for quite some time.With so many possibilities in the cards, we expect investors to remain focused on updates from the space as sector participants look to devise ways to eliminate threats from rising oil prices.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

2409,DAL,"Shares of several major airline stocks moved sharply lower in morning trading Wednesday after domestic giant American Airlines (AAL  -  Free Report) lowered its unit revenue and unit cost guidance for the second quarter.American said it expects unit revenue—the ever-important total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) metric—to improve 1% to 3%, down from its previous guidance of 1.5% to 3.5% growth. This would still mark American’s seventh consecutive quarter of TRASM growth, but the company cited lower-than-anticipated domestic yields as the reason for its lowered guidance.Meanwhile, American lowered its outlook for Q2 capacity to 72.9 billion available seat miles from 73.1 billion and increased its estimate for average fuel prices to $2.24 - $2.29 per gallon from $2.18 - $2.23 per gallon.American also said that a technology issue which resulted in one of its regional carriers, PSA Airlines, cancelling about 3,000 flights last month would reduce pre-tax income by about $35 million.Shares of American Airlines were down more than 6% to touch an intraday low of $36.59 in early morning trading Wednesday. Elsewhere, “Big Three” rivals Delta (DAL  -  Free Report) and United (UAL  -  Free Report) were both more than 3% lower.Budget airlines and regional carriers were also affected by the industry-wide slump. Alaska (ALK  -  Free Report) dropped as much as 5%, Southwest (LUV  -  Free Report) tumbled about 2%, and Spirit (SAVE  -  Free Report) was down roughly 4%.Overall, the U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS  -  Free Report) slumped about 2% in morning trading.The airline industry continues to struggle in the face of rising fuel and labor costs, shifting trends, and global economic uncertainty. Nevertheless, investors will hope that some carriers can report strong summer travel results and help motivate a rebound.Want more market analysis from this author?

2410,DAL,"Shares of Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) have sunk roughly 8% over the last month in a sign that investors might not expect good things from the U.S. airline company’s second quarter financial results, especially with fuel costs on the rise. But let’s take a look at what they should really expect from Delta on Thursday and see if DAL might be worth buying.Recent News Delta announced last week that it flew a record number of passengers during the month of June, noting that it carried 17.7 million customers across its global network, which marked a roughly 3% climb from the year-ago period. Year to date, Delta has boarded a total of 93.3 million passengers, up 2.5%. Meanwhile, the company’s revenue passenger miles also climbed 3%.Closing the quarter on a strong note should be good news for investors. Coupled with the fact that United (UAL  -  Free Report) also reported record-breaking passenger totals last month at 15.2 million, it could signal that airline companies are set for a strong second quarter. But there are concerns that higher fuel costs will hurt the industry’s bottom line.The fear is that Delta, United, American (AAL  -  Free Report), Southwest (LUV  -  Free Report), and other airlines won’t be able to raise their prices quickly enough to make up for the roughly 55% increase in fuel costs from a year ago.With that said, Delta reaffirmed its Q2 earnings guidance of $1.65 per share to $1.75 per share last week. “We’ve made money at fuel prices at $100 and we’ve made money at $40,” Delta CEO Ed Bastian said recently at the National Press Club in Washington. “There’s a resiliency and a stability to our business like never before.”So now let’s look to see what investors should expect from Delta when it reports its Q2 results before the market opens on Thursday, kicking off a wave airline giant’s quarterly earnings releases.Q2 Outlook Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Delta’s quarterly revenues to climb by 8.23% to hit $11.68 billion. Meanwhile, its quarterly earnings are projected to pop by 6.71% to reach $1.75 per share.Investors should note that DAL’s Most Accurate Estimate—the representation of the most recent analyst sentiment—is calling for earnings of $1.76 per share, which is 1 cent above our current consensus estimate.Delta has also topped earnings estimates in five out of the last six quarters. We judge the price effect of these earnings beats by comparing the closing price of the stock two days before the report and two days after the report, and DAL stock climbed 2.8% last quarter and 7.1% in the fourth quarter following its quarterly earnings release.Price Movement/ ValuationMoving on, investors should want to understand how Delta stock has performed. Shares of DAL have climbed 32% over the last two years, just outpacing the S&P 500’s climb. However, Delta stock is down 7.3% over the last year and has sunk 14% during the last six months. This is good news for investors if they are considering buying DAL stock since it currently sits roughly $10 below its 52-week high of $60.79 per share, and could easily climb if the company posts strong results or guidance. Delta’s recent performance has helped its valuation picture look a bit more attractive at the moment. DAL is currently trading at 8.1X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which marks a significant discount compared to the S&P 500’s 17.2X and its industry’s average of 9.8X.For further reference, DAL stock has traded as high as 11.6X over the last year, with a one-year median of 8.6X and currently sits near its year-long low of 7.8X. It is also currently trading below its five-year median of 9X.Bottom LineDelta is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and sports a “B” grade for Value in our Style Scores system and an overall “A” VGM grade. The company is also expected to see both its top and bottom lines expand at relatively solid rates for a company of its age and size.DAL has also seen its shares climb directly following its earnings release in the trailing two periods, which means it might be a stock worth considering before the opening bell on Thursday.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

2411,DAL,"Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) reported traffic figures for April 2018. Consolidated traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs), came in at 18.26 billion, up 3.7% year over year.Consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) climbed 4% to 21.45 billion on a year-over-year basis. Consolidated load factor or percentage of seats filled by passengers contracted 20 basis points to 85.1% due to capacity expansion exceeding traffic growth.Additionally, the carrier recorded an on-time performance (mainline) of 86.4% and completion factor (mainline) of 99.7% for the month. Approximately, 15.9 million passengers flew on Delta during the period.In the first four months of 2018, Delta generated consolidated RPMs of 67.54 billion (up 3% year over year) and ASMs of 80.91 billion (up 3.1% year over year). Notably, load factor was 83.5%, unchanged from the tally in April 2017.Delta Air Lines, Inc. Price  Delta Air Lines, Inc. Price | Delta Air Lines, Inc. Quote Last month, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company reported first-quarter earnings and revenue figures. It surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts. However, the bottom line declined year over year on high fuel costs. Moreover, the winter storms, which caused multiple flight cancellations, hurt results. While the top line improved from the year-ago number on the back of strong demand for air travel.

(UAL  -  Free Report) and Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) also reported their respective financial figures last month. While United Continental posted better-than-expected results in the first quarter, American Airlines’ earnings bettered estimates but delivered lower-than-expected revenues. Meanwhile, Southwest Airlines’ bottom line in the first quarter matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate whereas revenues lagged the same.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

2412,DAL,"The transportation sector is riding high on first-quarter financial results, with total earnings from 97.8% of the sector’s total market capitalization, reported so far, up 20.9% on revenue growth of 8.7%. Both revenue and earnings surprises of 76.9% also seem impressive.This is because most of the key industry players managed to beat our estimates on earnings or revenues or both, while a few lagged.For a better understanding, let’s dig into the earnings results of some well-known industry players:Transportation Earnings in FocusThe world's largest package delivery company United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both fronts. Earnings of $1.55 surpassed the earnings estimate by a penny while revenues of $17.11 billion edged past the estimated $16.44 billion. For fiscal 2018, the company continued to expect earnings per share in the range of $7.03-$7.37. The Zacks Consensus Estimate at the time of earnings release was pegged at $7.22 (see: all the Industrials ETFs here).The major railroads – Union Pacific (UNP  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern Corp (NSC  -  Free Report) – beat on both the top and the bottom lines while Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) missed. UNP and NSC surpassed the earnings estimate by 3 cents and 16 cents, respectively, and revenue estimates by $104 million and $35 million. On the other hand, earnings of $1.30 at KSU lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by five cents while revenues of $639 million were also marginally below our estimated $644 million.Ryder Systems (R  -  Free Report), the leader in supply chain management and fleet management services, beat the earnings estimate by three cents and revenue estimate by $30 million.The two largest U.S. airlines Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental (UAL  -  Free Report) also reported better-than-expected results. Earnings of 74 cents and revenues of $9.97 billion at Delta edged past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 73 cents and $9.91 billion, respectively. For the second quarter of 2018, the carrier expects earnings per share in the range of $1.80-$2.00 (read: ETFs & Stocks to Fly High on Record Spring Travel).At United Continental, earnings per share of 50 cents came above the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny and revenues of $9.03 billion slightly edged past the estimated $9.01 billion. The company raised the lower end of the earnings per share to $7.00-$8.50 for the year from $6.50-$8.50. The Zacks Consensus Estimate at the time of earnings release was pegged at $7.83.Last but not the least, earnings for the leading trucking carrier J.B. Hunt (JBHT  -  Free Report) came in couple of cents below the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues were $76 million above the estimate.ETFs in FocusWhile the string of solid results from industry players made the case for transport ETFs appealing, a jump in oil price and a rise in dollar led to losses over the past month. As such, iShares Dow Jones Transportation Average Fund (IYT  -  Free Report), SPDR S&P Transportation ETF (XTN  -  Free Report) and First Trust Nasdaq Transportation ETF (FTXR) shed 0.8%, 2.5% and 1.8%, respectively. All these funds have a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold).IYTThe fund tracks the Dow Jones Transportation Average Index, giving investors exposure to a small basket of 20 securities. Though the product is heavily concentrated on the top firm FedEx (FDX) at 14.7%, the in-focus eight firms collectively make up for 47% of the portfolio. From a sector perspective, air freight & logistics takes the top spot with 30.2% of the portfolio while railroads, trucking and airlines round off to the next three spots with double-digit exposure each. The fund has accumulated nearly $804.5 million in AUM while sees solid trading volume of around 248,000 shares a day. It charges 44 bps in annual fees (read: Transport ETFs to Ride High on Huge Earnings Beat by FedEx).XTNThis fund tracks the S&P Transportation Select Industry Index, holding 42 stocks in its basket. The in-focus firms account for over 2% share each. Further, about 31.2% of the portfolio is dominated by trucking, while airlines, and air freight & logistics take one-fourth share each. Airfreight & logistics, and railroads also make up for a double-digit allocation each. With AUM of $225.6 million, the fund charges 35 bps in fees per year from investors and trades in a lower volume of around 34,000 shares a day.FTXRThis fund offers exposure to the 30 most-liquid U.S. transportation securities based on volatility, value and growth by tracking the Nasdaq US Smart Transportation Index. The in-focus eight firms account for a combined 24% share. FTXR has accumulated $3.6 million in its asset base and charges 60 bps in annual fees.

2413,DAL,"The past week in the airline space was all about numbers, with several airline companies like American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), Spirit Airlines, Inc. (SAVE  -  Free Report) and SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report) reporting their respective first-quarter 2018 financial numbers.Notably, SkyWest impressed the most as it posted better-than-expected earnings per share and revenues. Moreover, both the metrics increased on a year-over-year basis. Results were aided by the company’s improved fleet mix and a lower tax rate. Shares of this regional carrier appreciated following its robust earnings report.However, shares of American Airlines and Spirit Airlines declined after the companies unveiled their respective earnings results. This was despite the carriers reporting better-than-expected earnings. High fuel costs were primarily responsible for the stocks shedding value. While average fuel price (consolidated and inclusive of taxes) increased 23.6% year over year at American Airlines, the metric surged 21.5% at Spirit Airlines.Moreover, American Airlines trimmed its current-year earnings projection mainly owing to high fuel costs. On the non-earnings front, United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report) hit the headlines by virtue of its decision to increase the company’s stake in Brazilian carrier, Azul S.A. (AZUL  -  Free Report).Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return(Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Apr 25, 2018).Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1.

2414,DAL,"Matching yesterday’s Producer Price Index (PPI) figures, this morning we see results for the Consumer Price Index (CPI): a headline read of +0.1% is a tick below expectations (PPI numbers came in 10 basis points hotter than anticipated), but +0.2% when we strip out volatile food & energy costs. The PPI and CPI numbers are not always in real-time lock-step, but do show trends continuing with inflation seeping further into the economy.Pull out the focus a bit to look at the year-over-year numbers: CPI reached 2.9% — 10 basis points ahead of expectations. Ex-food & energy, we see this figure drop to 2.3%, in line with estimates. This also compares to the PPI’s “core” read of 2.8%. To give even more perspective here, by way of explaining these seemingly tepid numbers are actually historically pretty hot, the last time we saw year-over-year headline CPI north of 2.9% was back in December of 2011; ex-food & energy year over year was last higher than 2.3% in September 2008, a month prior to the Great Recession.Initial Jobless Claims continued their winning ways ahead of the bell this morning as well, falling 18,000 claims back to historic lows of 214K for last week. We had begun to think our labor market was having trouble sustaining the sub-225K range, but looking back at the 4-week average, we’re still at 223K. Keep in mind these claims reflect the week with Independence Day in the middle of it, so these figures are probably showing some near-term seasonality.Continuing Claims also sank lower, by 3,000 to 1.74 million last week. Again, consider the holiday-shortened time period, but there’s simply no denying that we are in excellent shape with this few continuing jobless claims week over week. We have been under 1.8 million for months now, and it hasn’t been too long since we breathed a collective sigh of relief that we’d finally sunk below 2 million claims per week.Also, while we await Q2 earnings from some of Wall Street’s biggest banks tomorrow morning, Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) is out with new quarterly numbers, topping estimates on both top and bottom lines. Earnings of $1.77 per share outperformed the Zacks consensus by a nickel, while revenues of $11.78 billion in the quarter beat the $11.68 billion analysts were expecting.PRASM, an important metric for airline companies, rose 4.4% year over year, and Delta also announced a 15% rise in its dividend yield. Shares are up 1.5% a half-hour before the opening bell. For more on DAL’s earnings, click here.Pre-market indexes are green across the board, looking to wipe out yesterday’s trade-war-fear selloff. However, these indexes were already up prior to the release of Delta’s earnings, CPI and jobless claims. Bullish investors are proving tough to keep down in the face of trade tariff worries.

2415,DAL,"The Q1 earnings season has so far unfolded a promising picture. According to the latest Earnings Preview, this positive scenario is expected to continue in the remainder of the current reporting cycle. The above report also projects S&P 500 companies’ bottom-line growth of 18.3% year over year. Additionally, stocks in the highly sought-after fraternity are anticipated to end the period with the top line expanding 7.7%.The report further predicts that 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors will end the ongoing earnings season with a year-over-year increase in the bottom line. Of which, 11 are anticipated to exhibit double-digit earnings growth.    One of those sectors is the Zacks Transportation sector, wherein earnings are anticipated to increase 19%. Notably, this highly diversified sector includes airlines, railroads, truckers, equipment and leasing companies, among others. We believe that the favorable economic indicators along with the new tax law bodes well for the sector participants.Already, key sector participants from Transportation namely, United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report), CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) and Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) posted better-than-expected earnings per share and revenues in the current reporting cycle.However, high fuel costs have emerged as a major headwind for transports in Q1. Evidently, the same has induced bottom-line contraction of the likes of Delta and the trend is likely to continue for the remainder of the season.Given this backdrop, investors interested in the Transportation space will keenly await Q1 reports from key sector participants like American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) , Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS  -  Free Report) and Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report), which are scheduled for Apr 26.According to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise.

2416,DAL,"The Q1 earnings season for the airline space has taken off on a positive note. Two airline majors — United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report) and Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) — that have reported thus far have outperformed with respect to revenues as well as earnings per share.Contrasting Price PerformancesWe note that Delta kick-started the earnings season for airlines on Apr 12. Prior to that, the Zacks Airline sector had lost 6.8% of its value. However, since Apr 12, the loss is only 0.2%. The reduction in loss clearly highlights the improvement in the fortunes of airlines.  Zacks Industry Rank also Highlights ImprovementThe improving scenario for the airline space is well reflected by the Zacks Industry Rank #108 carried by the 28-member Zacks Airline Industry. Notably, the favorable rank places the industry in the top 44% of the 250+ groups. The current positioning of the industry is much more favorable than a rank of 187 carried a week ago.We put our entire 250-plus industries into two groups: the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Over the last 10 years, using a one week rebalance, the top half outpaced the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Click here to know more: About Zacks Industry RankCatalysts to ImprovementLast week, Delta’s stock surged following its impressive earnings report. The company’s earnings (excluding 3 cents from non-recurring items) of 74 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Operating revenues came in at $9,968 million, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9,881.2 million. The top line increased 8.9% from the year-ago figure. Strong demand for air travel boosted revenues.In the quarter under review, passenger revenues, cargo revenues and others increased 7%, 23% and 32%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis, to boost the top line. The company's performance with respect to unit revenues was also encouraging in the quarter. Delta's unit revenue guidance for the second quarter is also impressive.Adding to the bullish scenario, the Chicago-based United Continental unveiled an extremely impressive earnings report on Apr 17. The company’s earnings (excluding 2 cents from non-recurring items) of 50 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 49 cents. Moreover, the bottom line climbed 25% year over year owing to higher revenues.Operating revenues of $9,032 million in the first quarter were also ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9,012.5 million. Moreover, the top line increased 7.3% year over year. Strong demand apart, increased ticket prices also boosted results.Like Delta, United Continental too performed extremely well on the unit revenue front, with passenger revenue per available seat mile improving 2.7%. The company’s decision to trim its capacity growth guidance for the current-year also found favor with investors. Consequently, the stock gained 4.8% on Apr 18.We note that capacity-related fears had plagued airline stocks ever since United Continental guided on Jan 23 that capacity growth is expected between 4% and 6% year over year. Following the guidance, investors feared that similar actions might be taken by rivals, triggering a price war.However, the carrier’s current decision to trim its expectations pertaining to this year’s capacity growth between 4.5% and 5.5% lays to rest the above fears. Naturally, the report not only led to an upsurge in United Continental’s stock price on Apr 18, but also those of fellow-airline players like American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report). With most sector participants having a field day, it was no surprise that the sector tracker — NYSE ARCA Airline index — increased 2.4% to $116.36 on Apr 18.More Airline Outperformances in Store?With two airline majors having outperformed, it seems that confidence of investors has been restored in the airline sector, as indicated by the strong price performances. We expect most other airline players to follow suit and deliver impressive numbers in the current reporting cycle.Our optimism is backed by improved first-quarter unit revenue forecasts recently unveiled by key players like American Airlines and JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report). American Airlines expects total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM: a key measure of unit revenues) to increase between 3% and 4% year over year in the soon to-be-reported quarter (previous guidance anticipated the metric to grow in the 2-4% band).JetBlue expects revenue per available seat mile (RASM) to increase approximately 6.1% year over year (previous guidance anticipated the metric to grow in the 3.5-5.5% band).3 Airline PicksIn view of the tailwinds mentioned above, we believe that it is prudent to add airline stocks to one’s portfolio now. However, with multiple carriers present, the task of selecting the right ones for handsome returns is not an easy one. In fact, identifying a winning stock is akin to searching for a needle in a haystack for an investor, in the absence of proper guidance.This is where the Zacks Rank, which justifies a company's strong fundamentals, can come in really handy. Markedly, the Zacks Rank is a reliable tool that helps investors to trade with confidence regardless of their trading style and risk tolerance. To learn more about how you can use this proven system for market-beating gains, visit  Zacks Rank Education.Based on a favorable Zacks Rank (#1 or 2), we have zeroed in on three airline stocks that should be present in one’s portfolio for handsome returns.SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report) is the holding company for two scheduled passenger airline operations and an aircraft leasing company. The stock carries a Zack Rank #2 (Buy) and has a market capitalization of $2.91 billion. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Over the last 90 days, the company has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 6.5% upward. Moreover, the company has a VGM Score of B. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score.Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes S.A. (GOL  -  Free Report) is a low-cost and low-fare carrier, headquartered in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The company has a market capitalization of $2.22 billion and carries a Zacks Rank #2.For the current year, the company has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings being revised 25.5% upward over the last 90 days. Increased demand for air travel on the back of an improving Brazilian economy should drive the company’s growth.Azul S.A. (AZUL  -  Free Report) is the largest airline in Brazil based on the number of cities and departures. Azul, which went public last year, sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has a market capitalization of $10.4 billion.The company has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 6.3% upward over the last 60 days.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

2417,DAL,"The diversified transportation sector, which includes airline companies, railroads, truckers and shippers, among others, got off to an impressive start in first-quarter 2018 earnings season. As the U.S. economy continues to grow, demand for carriage is also increasing and this momentum is anticipated to sustain in 2018.Transportation sector is the lifeblood of the economy as it moves freights across the country and offshore. Favorable economic condition along with promising fiscal and regulatory policies from the Trump administration bode well for the sector.Performance to DateSo far, two major airline operators Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report) as well as freight railroad behemoth CSX Corp. (CSX  -  Free Report) delivered highly impressive results. Each of these three companies handily surpassed both the top and bottom line with respect to the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Additionally, transport logistic company J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc. (JBHT  -  Free Report) reported mixed results. The top line outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate while the bottom line missed the same marginally.  All four stocks mentioned above carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Tax Overhaul: A Major BoostThe two pro-growth agendas of President Trump, namely, significant cut in corporate tax and deregulation are major catalysts to the Transportation sector. The corporate tax rate was recently lowered from 35% to 21%., its historic low in 78 years. A large part of transporters book much of their revenues in the homeland. Consequently, a significant reduction in corporate tax rate borne by transporters would be immediately accretive to cash flow.Capital-Intensive Nature of Transportation SectorTransportation companies, mainly railroads and airlines, invest significantly in capital expenditure as the industry is capital-intensive in nature. Under the old law, capital expenditures cannot be tax-deducted in the year they were incurred. Consequently, U.S. corporates needed to plan judiciously regarding their capital expenditure.However, following the U.S. tax overhaul, the companies will be able to deduct their capital expenditures from the taxable income immediately. In fact, going forward if the companies increase their capital expenditures, their tax bills for the year would be lowered significantly due to higher deductions.This in fact will leave more cash in the hands of transporters to fund project expansions, acquisitions and share repurchases among others. Apart from railroads and package delivery companies, stocks belonging to the airline space are also likely to be huge beneficiaries of the new tax law.Robust Demand for FreightA thriving and improving economy supports the overall bullishness of the transport sector, as it implies that more goods are being transported across the United States. Improved global growth prospects, sustained business and consumer confidence have in turn helped the transport sector recover from the sluggishness in 2017 to quite an extent.Economic growth and demand for freight are positively correlated. Healthy growth in manufacturing, construction, mining and automobile production will increase demand for more freight.Moreover, the government has taken a decision to spend a whopping $1.5 trillion on several infrastructure projects like constructing new roads, bridges, highways, railways and waterways across the country over a period of 10 years. This project will generate significant demand for manufacturing sector, which in turn will raise demand for freight, benefiting the transportation sector.  Price PerformanceThe chart below shows year to date price performance of four stocks mentioned above.Bottom LineThe U.S. economy is gathering steam. With the overall economy back on track, things are looking up for the transportation sector as well. A robust U.S. economy, healthy consumer and business confidence, massive tax haul and business friendly policies of the government are anticipated to fuel transportation sector’s growth.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

2418,DAL,"While we look forward to the coming deluge of Q1 earnings numbers for the next several days and weeks, this Thursday morning also brings with it some key data points adding grist to the mill of market expectation. Initial Jobless Claims, Imports and Exports from March and minutes from the latest Fed meeting all have something to contribute. We also see the first of the major airlines reporting earnings, so let’s start there—Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) outperformed expectations on both top and bottom lines ahead of today’s opening bell, posting 74 cents per share on $9,968 million in quarterly revenues. This amounts to a one-penny beat on the bottom line (though down nearly 4% year over year), and +$80 million on the top, well up from the year ago’s $9,148 million reported. For more on DAL’s earnings, click here.Initial Jobless Claims remained in the stout, healthy 225-250K range at 233K for last week, down 9000 claims from the unrevised previous week. Continuing claims stayed relatively in-line at 1.871 million, keeping the long-term narrative of a steadily tightening labor market intact. We are up from the nearly half-century lows in jobless claims from a few weeks ago, but this steadiness can only mean good things for an overall economic outlook.The Import Price Index for March wound up unchanged from the February headline at +0.3%, with the previous month revised down from the +0.4% read initially. However, strip out petrol prices and this figure drops to +0.1%; thus we can see clearly energy prices taking up the bulk of import price increases last month.Year over year, we are at +3.6%, which is actually a bit below expectations. What’s more, this figure will see intensified scrutiny in the months looking ahead based on possible ramifications from trade friction with China. Without making any bold predictions here, we may expect increased volatility for monthly import pricing from this point.Exports month over month hit +0.3%, and +3.4% year over year. The monthly read is 10 basis points lower than last month while the yearly account is a bit higher, but overall it’s pretty academic what we’re seeing here: a roughly in-line trade balance between import and export pricing through the first quarter of 2018. Again, we may see these straightforward metrics throwing us some curveballs in the monthly reads to come.Finally, the Fed minutes from last month's meeting said it was ignoring the slowdown in economic activity for Q1, citing routine seasonality. (Recall a year ago, when Q1 2017 was easily the weakest of last year’s four quarters.) Expectations for Q1 GDP are currently averaging around 2.0%, but the Fed is looking for a big rebound in Q2. This has to do not only with seasonal bias, but the effects of major corporate tax cuts, which are expected to show up in economic growth looking forward into 2018.

2419,DAL,"Joining the likes of Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report), American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report), the low-cost carrier JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) issued an upbeat view on unit revenues for first-quarter 2018.JetBlue is scheduled to unveil its first-quarter results on Apr 24. The company issued the bullish forecast while releasing its March traffic report. Robust Air Travel Demand Boosts TrafficTraffic, measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs), improved 7.3% year over year to 4.38 billion. On a year-over-year basis, consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) also expanded 3.3% to 4.92 billion.With traffic growth outpacing capacity expansion, load factor (percentage of seats filled with passengers) registered a rise of 330 basis points year over year to 89%. Strong demand for air travel contributed to the increase in load factor. In fact, this Long Island City, NY-based carrier transported 3.65 billion passengers in March, reflecting an improvement of 4.7% on a year-over-year basis.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company registered a completion factor (system wide) of 93.6% in the same month, with 64.2% flights on schedule. Notably, completion factor decreased from the February reading of 98.4% as many flights were cancelled in March due to weather-related disruptions. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Upbeat Q1 ForecastJetBlue now expects revenue per available seat mile (RASM: a key measure of unit revenues) to increase approximately 6.1% year over year (previous guidance anticipated the metric to grow in the 3.5-5.5% band). Strong demand for air travel contributed to the bullish view. The metric was boosted to the tune of 2.5 points owing to the timing of Easter in March.Additionally, lower completion factor due to the increase in flight cancellations boosted first-quarter unit revenues to the tune of approximately one point. Lower completion factor implies higher flight cancellations and a reduction in capacity. This, in turn, leads to increase in unit revenues.Consequently, JetBlue slashed its projection on capacity growth to 3.3% from the previously anticipated 3.5-5.5%. The trimming of the capacity growth projection is encouraging.Price PerformanceThe above-mentioned bullish projections failed to please investors. This is quite evident from the 0.2% decline in the JetBlue stock’s closing price on Apr 11. The main reason behind the downside was the spike in oil prices. On Apr 11, U.S. crude prices reached the highest level of $66.82 a barrel since December 2014. Mounting tensions in the Middle East and the resultant fears of supplies being disrupted contributed to the upsurge.We note that high oil prices do not bode well for companies in the airline space as fuel costs account for a significant chunk of their expenditures.In fact, not only yesterday, oil prices have been on an uptrend lately and were up approximately 8% in the January-March period. Given the inversely proportional relation between oil prices and airline stocks, this increase in crude prices is expected to hurt results for carriers, including JetBlue in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Furthermore, JetBlue has not had a healthy run on the bourse lately, with its stock price declining 9.1% in the January-March period. Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

2421,DAL,"Continuing with the trend set by Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) earlier this month, fellow-airline operators — American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report) — issued upbeat first-quarter unit revenue views over the past five trading days.We believe that strong demand for air travel contributed to the bullish projections. This apart, quite a few companies including the likes of United Continental’s subsidiary — United Airlines, Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) and Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report) revealed respective traffic data for March.  American Airlines’ $12 billion fleet modernization deal with The Boeing Company was another highlight of the week.Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return (Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Apr 04, 2018).Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1. Southwest Airlines reported impressive traffic results for March.

American Airlines expects total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM: a key measure of unit revenues) to increase between 3% and 4% year over year in the first quarter of 2018 (previous guidance anticipated the metric to grow in the 2-4% band). Strong demand for air travel coupled with improving yields might have led to the bullish view.Pre-tax margin (excluding special items) is now anticipated between 4% and 5%, reflecting an improvement from the previous guidance of 2-4%.

2423,DAL,"Markets closed lower on Wednesday after two days of gains, following President Donald Trump tweet warning Russia of a possible military strike on Syria. Escalating geopolitical tensions between the United States and Russia saw investors taking a defensive stance, with U.S stocks tumbling and safe havens rallying. The decline was led by bank stocks such as Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. However, shares of Facebook increased as the company’s CEO continued his testimony in front of Congress for the second day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) declined 0.9%, to close at 24,189.45.

Get ready Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and 'smart!' You shouldn't be partners with a Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it!"".Such comments made investors panic and move to safer havens.

2424,DAL,"After a promising start to 2018, major stock indexes forfeited their yearly gains over the past few weeks amid heightened concerns about a looming trade war between the U.S. and China. Now, as investors look to rebound from what has been a tough stretch for many, it could prove prudent to dig deep into the tried-and-true strategies of Wall Street’s top figures.One of those top performers is, of course, the legendary Warren Buffett. Dubbed the “Oracle of Omaha” for his decades of success, Buffett has amassed billions of dollars through a meticulous brand of value investing that touts patience and confidence. Simply put, Buffett and his Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B  -  Free Report) firm are icons of the investing world.Berkshire Hathaway’s U.S. long stock portfolio holds positions in 45 individual stocks, with the five-largest of those positions accounting for roughly 62% of its total value. This portfolio is tracked by a large swath of investors looking to mimic the success of Berkshire’s legendary CEO.But not even Berkshire Hathaway has made it through 2018’s early volatility unscathed, and with most of the public lacking the patience of Buffett, some followers of the portfolio might consider ditching some of its worst-performing stocks. Let’s take a closer look.Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report)Commercial banking giant Wells Fargo has been marred by a fraudulent account scandal that tracked back to upper management, calling the company’s business practices into question and damaging its public reputation. More recently, interest rate uncertainty has caused headwinds for the finance sector. Shares of WFC have slipped more than 13% so this year, lagging the S&P 500’s nearly 2% drop.Buffett has been forced to publicly defend Wells Fargo at times, with the bank remaining one of Berkshire’s largest holdings. On top of that, Wells Fargo has underperformed from an earnings standpoint, missing consensus EPS estimates in the previous quarter and inspiring a significant selloff.The company has an opportunity to turn things around with its new report on Friday. Our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting that Wells Fargo will post earnings growth of 7%, but revenue is expected to be down year over year and could add more pressure to the situation.Still, earnings estimates have trended slightly higher throughout the quarter, indicating that the company’s fortunes could be improving. WFC is holding a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) heading into its report date. Meanwhile, shares are trading at just 10.9x forward 12-month earnings, which is a discount to the stock’s median Forward P/E of 12.5 displayed over the past year.The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report)Kraft Heinz remains one of Berkshire’s largest holdings, but the stock has underperformed amid a continued shift in consumer preferences toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food. The stock has tumbled more than 21% so far this year, and shares are hovering just above their 52-week low.These headwinds are putting pressure on Kraft’s earnings outlook. Within the past 60 days, the company has witnessed seven revisions to its full-year EPS estimates, with 100% agreement to the downside. Analysts now expect the company to post earnings growth of 8% on net sales growth of 1%.This negative estimate revision activity has earned KHC a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Still, the Zacks Rank is only designed to be a one- to three-month indicator, and Kraft’s dividend yield of 4.1% is likely to keep buy-and-hold investors on board.Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report)Southwest was one of Berkshire’s 10-largest holdings at the end of 2017, followed shortly by fellow airline company Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report). Unfortunately, industry-wide headwinds—including lower-than-expected demand for spring travel—have punished these stocks. Heading into the day, LUV was down more than 17% on a year-to-date basis.Management has a bearish view on unit revenues for the first quarter of 2018. The carrier now expects revenue per available seat mile to be flat, down from the previous forecast of growth between 1% and 2% from the prior-year quarter.This negative outlook has put a damper on analyst sentiment for Southwest. Over the past two months, LUV has witnessed six negative revisions to its full-year earnings estimates, with 100% agreement among revising analysts. This negative revision activity has given the stock a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Want more market analysis from this author?

2425,DAL,"Shares of American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) declined 4.7% to close the trading session on Apr 10 at $47.46. The stock lost value despite a bullish outlook on first-quarter unit revenues provided by the carrier at an investor update.The Guidance This Fort Worth, TX-based company now expects total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM: a key measure of unit revenues) to increase between 3% and 4% year over year in the first quarter of 2018 (previous guidance anticipated the metric to grow in the 2-4% band). Strong demand for air travel coupled with improving yields might have led to the bullish view.Notably, American Airlines is not the only carrier to unveil a bullish unit revenue view for the first quarter. Of late, fellow-airline operators like United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report) and Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) had also issued bullish unit revenue projections for the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Coming back to this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s guidance, pre-tax margin (excluding special items) is now anticipated between 4% and 5%, reflecting an improvement from the previous guidance of 2-4%. Detailed results are expected to be unveiled on Apr 26.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Additionally, the carrier reduced its projection for non-fuel cost per available seat miles (CASM), which is another positive aspect of the guidance. The metric is now expected to increase 3% in the first quarter of 2018 compared with the previous projection that had hinted at a 4% increase. However, the metric is still anticipated to increase approximately 2% in 2018.The company also maintained its projection pertaining to an increase in the metric between 1% and 2% in each of 2019 and 2020. In the current year, capacity (system) is still expected to improve 2.5% year over year. Adjusted earnings per share are also envisioned between $5.50 and $6.50 for 2018.Furthermore, American Airlines, which is constantly looking to modernize its fleet, aims to spend approximately $3.7 billion toward capital expenditures in the current year. Out of which, $1.9 billion is expected to be shelled out for aircraft related matters.In keeping with its objective of fleet modernization, American Airlines  recently inked a deal worth $12 billion with The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) (Read more: Boeing, American Airlines Ink $12B Deal for 47 Dreamliners).  Then Why the Decline The above-mentioned bullish projections failed to please investors, which is evident from the decline in stock price on Apr 10.  The main reason behind the downside was the spike in oil prices. On Apr 10, U.S. crude prices hit a three-year high of more than $65 a barrel. Mounting tensions related to Syria contributed to the upsurge. We note that high oil prices do not bode well for companies in the airline space as fuel costs account for a significant chunk of their expenditures.In fact, not only yesterday, oil prices have been on an uptrend lately and were up approximately 8% in the January-March period. In fact, the first quarter of 2018 witnessed U.S. oil benchmark reach its highest settlement since December 2014. Given the inversely proportional relation between oil prices and airline stocks, this increase in crude prices is expected to hurt results for carriers in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.The rise in oil prices can be made out from American Airlines’ projection on the metric. The carrier expects fuel prices (including taxes) between $2.08 and $2.13 per gallon in the first quarter of 2018, which is much higher than the comparable year-ago figure of $1.7 per gallon.Disappointing Price PerformanceThe American Airlines stock’s unsatisfactory price performance was not limited to yesterday only. In fact, the company has not had a healthy run on the bourse lately with its stock price declining 18.8% in the last three months. 5 Medical Stocks to Buy Now Zacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

2428,DAL,"Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 12, before the market opens.Last quarter, the carrier delivered a positive earnings surprise of 9.1%. Moreover, it has an impressive earnings history, having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 3.8%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this earnings season.Factors Likely at PlayDelta is expected to perform well on the unit revenue front. Evidently, the carrier now expects total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) to increase approximately 5%, i.e, in the high end of its previously guided range of a rise between 4% and 5%. This upside has been driven by strong demand and higher yields.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) is pegged at 13.76 cents, better than 13.28 cents reported a year ago.The new tax law, which reduced corporate tax rate significantly, is also anticipated to boost earnings in the first quarter. Notably, the company estimates its bottom line per share between 65 cents and 75 cents. Additionally, the carrier’s tax rate is projected at around 23% for the first quarter while pre-tax margin is likely to increase between 6.5% and 7.5%.However, high costs might hurt Delta’s bottom line in the quarter to be reported. The carrier predicts cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel and profit sharing to augment around 4%. The figure is higher than the past forecast of an increase between 3% and 4%. This bleak outlook is due to wage hikes in April 2017 and a rise in depreciation on aircraft retirements. Weather-related expenses also weigh on costs to the tune of 0.5 points. Also, the airline assumes average fuel price per gallon of $2-$2.05.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter CASM excluding fuel and profit sharing stands at 11.35 cents, more than 10.92 cents reported a year ago. While the consensus mark for average fuel price per gallon net of hedging gains-mainline is pegged at $2.06, above $1.71 reported in the first quarter of 2017.Weather-related destructions have also wreaked havoc since the beginning of the first quarter, thus forcing the carrier to cancel multiple flights. This might also hamper the company’s top line in turn.Delta Air Lines, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Delta Air Lines, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Delta Air Lines, Inc. Quote Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Delta is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

2430,DAL,"Shares of Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) dipped on Friday after the company announced that hundreds of thousands of customers might have had their credit card information compromised as part of a cyberattack. This isn’t good news for investors or Delta as the airline approaches the release of its first quarter 2018 earnings results.Delta said on Thursday that hundreds of thousands of customers’ credit cards could have been hacked via a vendor that operated a chat feature on Delta’s website. In the wake of this breach, investors need to be even more cautious about Delta, as any data-driven selloff, coupled with the current market-wide volatility, could spell trouble.With that said, one of the best ways for investors to elude the possibility of continued volatility would be to avoid Delta if the company is also likely to underperform its earnings estimates.Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Delta’s Q1 earnings to sink by 5.2% to hit $0.73 per share. Delta has also experienced a few downward earnings estimate revisions recently.But this still doesn’t tell investors if Delta is expected to fall short of this earnings estimate. Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to surprise, in one way or the other.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.In contrast, a stock with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or worse, coupled with a negative Earnings ESP, is one that we typically want to avoid during earnings season.Delta is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and is projected to see its revenues climb by 7.3% to $9.82 billion. However, the airline giant also currently sports an Earnings ESP of -0.88%. This means that Delta might be a stock investors should avoid ahead of earnings.Delta is set to report its first quarter 2018 earnings results before the market opens on Thursday, April 12.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

2431,DAL,"Stocks opened lower and stayed in the red throughout early morning trading Friday after reports emerged suggesting that President Trump is doubling down on tariffs and has ordered the U.S. Trade Representative to consider new charges on an additional $100 million in Chinese imports.The move is an extension of trade disputes between the U.S. and China that stretch back to early March, when the Trump administration announced tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum. Concerns that this issue would snowball into a full-blown, tit-for-tat trade war escalated this week as both nations released their own lists of products to target.All of these tariffs are part of ongoing negotiations, and it is unclear exactly how things will unfold just yet. Nevertheless, trade anxiety is high and could control the direction of stocks until earnings season gets cranking over the next few weeks.The upcoming week is not packed with reports, but it does mark the unofficial start of earnings season with the big financials announcing next Friday. With that said, investors can always use the Zacks Earnings Calendar to plan out their schedules for earnings, dividend announcements, and other important financial releases. This handy tool is your perfect one-stop-shop to properly prepare for the market events that will have an impact on your own portfolio.In this piece, we will be taking a look at three of the most-important reports to anticipate before the big financials announce on Friday. Make sure to keep an eye on these companies as they prepare to report during the week of April 9!1. Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (BBBY  -  Free Report)Bed Bath & Beyond is a retailer offering a wide selection of domestics merchandise and home furnishings. The company is slated to announce its latest quarterly financial results after the closing bell on April 11. Shares of BBBY have slumped nearly 4% in the month ahead of its report date.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.41 per share, which would represent a drop of more than 23% from the year-ago period. Our consensus estimate for revenue is calling for net sales of $3.67 billion, which would represent growth of nearly 4%. The stock is sporting a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) ahead of the report. 2. BlackRock, Inc. (BLK  -  Free Report)Investment management behemoth BlackRock is set to report its first-quarter earnings results before the market opens on April 12. BlackRock shares have dipped during recent market volatility, but the stock is still up nearly 36% since this time last year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for adjusted earnings of $6.46 per share, which would represent growth of 23%.Meanwhile, BlackRock’s quarterly revenues are expected to climb 15.5% to touch $3.26 billion, based on our current consensus estimate. Heading into the report, BLK is trading with a Forward P/E of about 17.7, which is a noticeable premium to its industry’s average. Investors will hope that BlackRock can justify that premium with solid results. 3. Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report)Delta is scheduled to release its latest quarterly earnings results before the opening bell on April 12. The company recently issued an encouraging outlook with respect to total revenue per available seat miles for the quarter, with the metric expected to improve by approximately 5%. Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is projecting adjusted earnings of $0.73 per share.This bottom line result would represent a year-over-year dip of about 5%. Meanwhile, our consensus revenue estimate is projecting net sales of $9.82 billion, which would mark a 7% improvement from the prior-year period. Want more market analysis from this author?

2432,DAL,"The Masters’ tagline has been “a tradition unlike any other” for years. The validity of this claim aside, the first major championship of the year at Augusta National Golf Club is unique to the rest of major sports and golf as a whole for the simple fact that it does not pursue the most money possible.Augusta keeps many of its financial dealings under wraps, but the Masters reportedly generated revenues of roughly $115 million in 2015, according to a Golf Digest report. The club also leaves millions of dollars on the table when you consider the relatively cheap ticket prices, insanely inexpensive food, and absence of online merchandise.So where does the money come from and where does all of it go?AugustaThe most basic revenue breakdown is as follows: merchandise ($47.5 million); tickets ($34.75 million); international TV rights ($25 million); and concessions ($7.75 million).Augusta pours millions and millions of dollars into the course every year. Another large chunk of the money goes directly to the players. The Masters will shell out a total of $11million in prize money this year, which is the second-highest on tour.Masters tickets, one of the largest revenue generators despite their relatively low costs, are usually won and purchased through a lottery system. But tickets always end up on secondary markets. Four day badges for the Masters had been selling for about $6,500 right up until the start of Thursday’s first-round, on various ticket sites.One of the most obvious ways that Augusta leaves money on the greens is through its now iconically-cheap food and drink offerings.Once again, the amazing concession prices at the Masters. Important Note: Today’s badge alone is going to cost you about $1,750. pic.twitter.com/DGhfsy4gJN— Darren Rovell (@darrenrovell) April 5, 2018TelevisionCBS (CBS  -  Free Report) will broadcast weekend coverage of the Masters for the 63rd year in a row. The network and Augusta have worked on one-year deals pretty much the entire time, and look as if they will continue this relationship in perpetuity.Interestingly, neither CBS nor Augusta reportedly make money from their relationship. This breakeven partnership is based on mutual prestige, which seems hardly enough when looking at the massive 12-year, $1.1 billion deal Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) and the USGA signed in 2013.  The 2018 Masters also marks roughly 10 years since ESPN (DIS  -  Free Report) took over Thursday and Friday coverage. Details about the deal aren't clear, but ESPN certainly dedicates a lot of resources to its nearly around-the-clock coverage.Fans can also watch nearly all of the coverage on Masters.com, which shows far more total hours than ESPN and CBS.SponsorsDelta (DAL  -  Free Report) became the newest official sponsor of the Masters last October. The airline’s addition brought the overall total to six. UPS (UPS  -  Free Report), AT&T (T  -  Free Report), IBM (IBM  -  Free Report), Mercedes-Benz, and Rolex all spend between $6 and $8 million a year, but have zero signage in view on the property.This investment grants the Masters’ partners the rights to split four minutes of ads per broadcast hour, which is far less time than most other sporting events. Three of the biggest sportswear giants, Nike (NKE  -  Free Report), Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report), and Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) will also all be on full display during the four-day tournament. Lastly, many of the players themselves will have a slew of corporate logos, from KPMG and other financial firms to golf companies such as Callaway (ELY  -  Free Report), all over their bodies.RatingsOf all the mystique surrounding the Masters, one thing that seems all too clear is that both CBS and ESPN hope this year’s tournament grabs better ratings.The Masters suffered it lowest TV ratings in 13 years in 2017. But this year’s event promises to be different because the sport’s biggest star, Tiger Woods, is back at Augusta—and this time he looks healthy.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2433,DAL,"It was a week where there were quite a few updates in the airline space. The most eye-catching development was Delta Air Lines Inc.’s (DAL  -  Free Report) upbeat unit revenue forecast for the first quarter of 2018. Strong demand for air travel coupled with increasing yields contributed to the bullish forecast from this Atlanta, GA-based airline behemoth.Airlines received another piece of good news, when the sector participants scored impressively on the punctuality front in January 2018, per the Air Travel Consumer Report unveiled by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). The DOT was also in the news when it granted tentative permission to five U.S.-based carriers to operate new scheduled flights to Havana. The decision became necessary as many carriers had terminated their operations between the nations due to lower-than-expected demand.Hawaiian Holdings, Inc.’s (HA  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Hawaiian Airlines, was another news maker in the week that had a day less of trading owing to Good Friday. Notably, the company’s new chief executive officer (CEO), Peter Ingram, is reportedly unperturbed by Southwest Airlines Co.’s (LUV  -  Free Report) decision to commence service to Hawaii soon.Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return (Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Mar 28, 2018).Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1. According to the Air Travel Consumer report, most U.S. carriers were more punctual in reaching their destinations in January compared with the year-ago figure. Alaska Airlines, the wholly-owned subsidiary of Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report), secured the top spot with 88.9% of its flights arriving on time in the same month.Moreover, the findings suggest that fliers were pleased as the number of complaints decreased during the month on a year-over-year basis (Read more: Airlines Kick Off 2018 With Impressive Punctuality Data).2.The DOT has proposed that Delta will operate an additional round of daily flights connecting Miami and Havana. American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report), which already operates four daily flights between the cities, has also been granted tentative permission to conduct an additional roundtrip on the route.Meanwhile, JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU  -  Free Report), which already has a significant Cuban presence, has been permitted to operate additional flights on the Fort Lauderdale-Havana route (six times a week), apart from launching service between Boston and Havana on Saturdays.The new allocations, however, have to be implemented within three months of the receipt of the final clearance from the government. Following final approval, Southwest will operate additional daily flights connecting Fort Lauderdale and Havana.Finally, United Airlines and its code-share partner Mesa Airlines have received a tentative approval from the DOT to extend its Houston-Havana Saturday service to a daily operation. However, the decision led to fears of competition intensifying among leading carriers as Havana is popular tourist spot (Read more: Why Airlines Tanked After DOT's Tentative Cuban Clearance).3. Delta issued an encouraging outlook with respect to total revenue per available seat miles (RASM: a key measure of unit revenue) for the first quarter of 2018 and expects the metric to improve by approximately 5% (the earlier outlook on the metric had called for an improvement in the band of 4-5%).The company still envisions first-quarter earnings per share to lie between 65 cents and 75 cents. While pre-tax margin is anticipated to increase in the range of 6.5-7.5%, capacity expansion is still expected to be around 3% for the quarter. The carrier expects higher costs to pressurize its bottom line in the quarter due to weather-related expenses and wage hikes, among other factors.Consequently, the company increased its first-quarter projection for non-fuel unit costs. The metric is now projected to increase around 4% on a year-over-year basis (the highest point of its previously anticipated range of 3-4% increase).On a separate note, Delta reported an increase in load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) for March. The metric was up110 basis points to 86.9% in the month as traffic growth (4.3%) outweighed capacity expansion (3%). Additionally, the carrier recorded an on-time performance of 86.9% and a completion factor (mainline) of 99%.Delta carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

According to Hawaiian Airlines’ CEO, Peter Ingram, that the company is making constant efforts to modernize its fleet. The carrier is also looking to expand its Asian operations. Ingram also stressed on the need to make its presence felt among investors in a bigger way. This is because it operates from remote Honolulu. Moreover, he believes that though airlines are now in a better financial health, they are still vulnerable to economic downturns. 5. European low-cost carrier, Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY  -  Free Report), reported encouraging traffic data for March backed by cheap ticket prices. The carrier transported 10 million customers in the month, up 6% year over year. Load factor increased 100 basis points to 95%.Price PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months. CompanyPast WeekLast 6 monthsHA 4.3% -2.4%UAL1.4%7.3%GOL1.4%39.5%DAL-1.4%4.2%JBLU0.4%4.2%AAL0.6%1.5%SAVE-0.1%4.7%LUV-1.3%-4.1%CPA 0.0%-1.4%ALK-2.2%-25.6%                  Stock prices of airlines fluctuated immensely during the week.

2434,DAL,"The airline companies heaved a sigh of relief post Monday’s dramatic fall. This is because shares of key airline players rose yesterday, signaling a big upside and a healthy first-quarter 2018.Sector participants, namely Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report), United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report), American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report), JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report), Spirit Airlines, Inc. (SAVE  -  Free Report), et al saw a substantial rise in respective stock prices at the close of business on Apr 3. As a result, the sector tracker, NYSE ARCA Airline Index, climbed 3% on the same day.While United Continental carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), the other above-mentioned stocks have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.We remind investors that the likes of Delta, American Airlines, United Continental, Alaska Air Group and Southwest Airlines had suffered sharp declines in stock prices on Apr 2. This downfall was due to fears of intense competition in the Havana route following the U.S. Department of Transportation’s (DOT) decision to grant five U.S.-based leading carriers a tentative approval to operate new scheduled flights in the popular tourist spot.Let’s delve into the factors leading to the stocks’ recovery:The Bounce BackThe price surge of major airlines on Tuesday followed after Delta provided an impressive guidance for the first quarter of 2018. The carrier now expects total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) to increase approximately 5%, i.e, in the high end of its previously guided range of a rise between 4% and 5%. The upside has been driven by strong demand and higher yields. Positive results from all geographic entities and the outperformance of international unit revenues over Delta’s domestic counterpart also contributed to this positive scenario. Additionally, the carrier expects tax rate of around 23% for the first quarter.However, cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel and profit sharing is now anticipated to expand around 4%. The earlier view had called for 3-4% growth in the metric. The downside has been attributable to wage increases in April 2017 and a rise in depreciation on aircraft retirements. Weather-related expenses also weigh on costs to the tune of 0.5 points.The airline maintains its projection for first-quarter earnings per share between 65 cents and 75 cents. Also, its outlook for pre-tax margin remains unchanged at an expansion of 6.5-7.5%. The carrier’s capacity forecast is fixed at 3%. While its prediction for average fuel price per gallon is unaltered at $2-$2.05.Robust March TrafficSimultaneously, the airline reported encouraging traffic statistics for March. Consolidated traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs), came in at 18.95 billion, up 4.3% year over year. Consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) climbed 3% to 21.8 billion on a year-over-year basis. Consolidated load factor or percentage of seats filled by passengers augmented 110 basis points to 86.9% as traffic growth outweighed capacity expansion.Additionally, the carrier recorded an on-time performance of 86.9% and a completion factor (mainline) of 99% in the month.In the first three months of 2018, Delta generated consolidated RPMs of 49.28 billion (up 2.8%) and ASMs of 59.46 billion (up 2.7%). Thus, load factor remained flat at 82.9% in March compared with the year-ago figure.The Near-Term ProspectThe airline industry took off to a bumpy start in the first quarter. Bad weather conditions played a spoiler from the very beginning of the year. Apart from Winter Storm Grayson in January, successive nor’easters in March largely crippled airline operations due to multiple flight cancellations.Weather-related disruptions have continued in the current month as well with a snowstorm forcing airlines to call off many flights. In fact, 466 flights in/out of the United States were cancelled on Monday in the wake of the storm.Moreover, Southwest Airlines’ recent guidance cut for first-quarter unit revenues lead to tumbling of other industry players’ shares. Also, in January, United Continental’s commentary on fourth-quarter 2017 conference call that it will continue to increase capacity for the next three years in order to hold market share in the industry caused a decrease in share prices of other sector players.However, steep demand for air travel and the likely solid first-quarter results are anticipated to ease the pessimism revolving around the industry in the near-term.Notably, first-quarter results will possibly benefit from a shift in the timing of Easter this year. This is because demand for travel is usually high during the Easter week. Last year, Easter celebrations fell in mid-April.Impressive Price PerformanceThe Zacks Airline Industry has gained 1.7% in the last six months, marginally outperforming the S&P 500 index’s 1.3% appreciation. Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2435,DAL,"Investors in Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Apr 6, 2018 $45.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Delta Air Lines shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Delta Air Lines is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Transportation - Airline industry that ranks in the Bottom 31% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, three analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one analyst has revised the estimate downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 76 cents per share to 75 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Delta Air Lines right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

2436,DAL,"Airline stocks made a nightmarish start to this week with key companies like Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report), American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report),United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report), Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report) and Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) witnessing steep declines in stock prices on Apr 2. Naturally, the sector tracker — NYSE ARCA Airline Index — also decreased significantly (to the tune of 3.3%) on the same day.Why the Downturn?While continued fears of a U.S.-China trade war and the tech sell-off played a significant role in the Monday mayhem, there was a sector-specific issue as well. The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) recently awarded (tentatively) five U.S.-based leading carriers to operate scheduled flights to Havana.The DOT decision to allocate new US-Havana frequencies became necessary, following the decision of many carriers like Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines, Inc. (SAVE  -  Free Report) to terminate operations between the nations due to lower-than-expected demand. Spirit Airlines carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.However, the decision led to fears of competition intensifying among leading carriers as Havana is popular tourist spot. In fact, in a bid to attract customers, a price war may emanate between the U.S. carriers.  To match the low fares of carriers like JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) and Southwest, legacy carriers namely Delta and American Airlines might follow suit which is likely to trigger a price war.The Award The DOT has proposed that Delta will operate an additional round of daily flights connecting Miami and Havana. American Airlines, which already operates four daily flights between the cities, has also been granted tentative permission to conduct an additional roundtrip on the route. Meanwhile, JetBlue Airways, which already has a significant Cuban presence, has been permitted to operate additional flights on the Fort Lauderdale-Havana route (six times a week), apart from launching service between Boston and Havana on Saturdays.Following the final approval, Southwest will operate additional daily flights connecting Fort Lauderdale and Havana. Finally, United Airlines and its code-share partner Mesa Airlines have received a tentative approval from the DOT to extend its Houston-Havana Saturday service to a daily operation.The new allocations, however, have to be implemented within three months of the receipt of the final clearance from the government. Notably, the DOT had to reject other applications for additional flights to Havana as the agreement between the United States and Cuba allows only 20 daily roundtrip flights between the nations.Other Headwinds Plaguing Airlines This YearApart from the fears of competition intensifying on the Havana routes, stocks in the airline space have hurt been by other headwinds as well.  Foul weather has been hurting airlines since the beginning of the year. Apart from Winter Storm Grayson in January, successive nor’easters in March disrupted airline operations significantly due to multiple flight cancellations.Weather-related disruptions have continued in the current month too with a snowstorm forcing airlines to cancel many flights. In fact, 466 flights in/out of the United States were cancelled yesterday due to the storm.  Southwest’s bleak view, with respect to operating revenue per available seat miles (RASM), for first-quarter also dented stocks in the space.So far this year, the Zacks Airline industry has declined 6.1% due to the headwinds.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

2437,DAL,"Welcome to the latest episode of the Full-Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research. On this week’s episode, we dive into NCAA March Madness ratings ahead of Monday’s championship game. We then take a look at the money that fuels Major League Baseball, before diving into a Masters preview. Time Warner’s Turner  and CBS (CBS  -  Free Report) have seen their ratings fluctuate throughout the 2018 March Madness college basketball tournament, despite some favorable storylines. Meanwhile, MLB’s opening day has already come and gone in the shadow of college hoops. But as baseball’s popularity on a national level continues to decline, MLB is more profitable than ever. The New York Yankees are worth nearly $4 billion, and the average opening day salary was roughly $4.5 million.These big contracts come from ticket sales, as well as large local and national television broadcast deals. MLB teams around the country consistently post some of the best primetime ratings in their local markets, which is why Fox Sports (FOXA  -  Free Report), Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report), and others spend billions on multi-year deals.MLB has also been on the cutting edge of streaming technology, as demonstrated by Disney’s (DIS  -  Free Report) majority acquisition of BAMTech. Furthermore, the league will continue its partnership with Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) YouTube TV during the 2018 season. Shifting gears one last time, we turn our attention to the Masters. Golf’s biggest tournament tees off this week on ESPN and CBS. The first major of the year has potential to be one of the sport’s biggest events in recent memory due to Tiger Woods’ return.Still, aside from the small amount of commercial time split between Delta (DAL  -  Free Report), UPS (UPS  -  Free Report), AT&T (T  -  Free Report), IBM (IBM  -  Free Report), and Mercedes-Benz, the week-long event at Augusta National is known more for its lack of commercialism.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

2439,DAL,"The first month of the current year appeared impressive for American fliers as far as punctuality is concerned. According to the Air Travel Consumer Report unveiled by the U.S. Department of Transportation for January, most U.S. carriers were more punctual in reaching their destinations compared with the year-ago figure. Moreover, the findings suggest that fliers were pleased as the number of complaints decreased during the month on a year-over-year basis.Punctuality StatisticsAccording to the report, 79.6% flights operated by U.S. carriers touched down on time. This represents a marked improvement from the comparable figure of 76% in January 2017.Alaska Airlines, the wholly-owned subsidiary of Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report) secured the top spot with 88.9% of its flights arriving on time during January. Hawaiian Airlines, which is owned by Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. (HA  -  Free Report), United Airlines, a subsidiary of United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report) , and  Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) were the next three most punctual companies recording on-time arrival rates of 88.3%, 84.7% and 84.3%, respectively. Notably, a total of 18 carriers were considered in the report.However, January’s on-time arrival rate was a tad below the comparable figure of 80.3% recorded in December 2017.Disappointing PerformersPer the report, JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) emerged as the least punctual U.S. airline with only 65.8% of its flights arriving on time during the month. This low-cost carrier has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.American Airlines Group Inc.’s (AAL  -  Free Report) wholly-owned subsidiary PSA Airlines was second from below recording an on-time arrival rate of 70.2%. SkyWest, Inc.’s (SKYW  -  Free Report) ExpressJet Airlines occupied the third-lowest spot, recording on-time arrival rate of 74.6%.Cancellations Rise But Complaints DeclineThe findings also showed that the number of cancellations increased during January 2018. In fact, the rate of cancelled scheduled domestic flights increased to 3% from 2% and 1.2% in January and December 2017, respectively. In this regard, Hawaiian Airlines emerged as the topper, with only 0.2% of its flights being cancelled in the same month.In the meantime, PSA Airlines was the worst performer in this respect, with 7% of its flights cancelled in January 2018. Moreover, the report stated that 12 domestic and 32 international flights had tarmac delays exceeding the permitted duration of three hours and four hours, respectively. Winter storm Grayson, which battered the East Coast in the first week of the year also contributed to the high cancellation rates.However, the brighter aspect of the report came with respect to the significant year-over-year decrease in the number of consumer complaints related to airline service, filed with the government. Evidently, in January 2018, 1,451 complaints were filed, which represents a 12.2% decrease from the comparable figure of 1,653 a year ago.Airlines Hurt by Multiple Cancellations in 2018The rise in the rate of cancellations witnessed in January is likely to continue in the remaining two months of the first quarter of 2018, particularly March. In fact, in March, there were reportedly  more than 10,000 flight cancellations due to successive nor’easters.It is believed to be the worst March in five years in terms of flight cancellations. The increase in the number of flight cancellations in the first quarter resulted in significant revenue losses for airline operators.We believe that the Zacks Airline industry's  disappointing price performance in the first quarter was primarily due to weather-related disruptions and the resultant revenue losses. The industry lost 2.5% of its value in the first quarter.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?

2440,DAL,"It was a week that saw the NYSE ARCA Airline Index declining 4.1% mainly due to the disappointing unit revenue forecast of low-cost carrier Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) for the current quarter. The Dallas-based carrier attributed the downbeat forecast to pricing pressure and lower-than-expected demand for air travel due to the timing of the spring break holidays.Apart from the bleak forecast, airlines were also hurt by the emergence of another nor’easter (Toby) in the Northeast region. In fact, this was the fourth nor’easter to hit the region this month. American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) was also in the news over the past five trading days regarding its fleet upgrade efforts.Moreover, the week saw American Airlines and United Airlines — the wholly-owned subsidiary of United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report)    — issuing updates on their plans to add additional flights in a bid to expand their presence.Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return (Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Mar 21, 2018).Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories1. Southwest Airlines now expects revenue per available seat mile (RASM: a key measure of unit revenue) to be flat, as against the year-ago figure of 13.23 cents. The projection compares unfavorably to the previous forecast of year-over-year growth between 1% and 2%. However, current customer demand remains strong, according to Southwest. The carrier still continues to expect year-over-year RASM growth in 2018.Further, the company has lowered its outlook for first-quarter operating expenses per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel and oil expense plus profit-sharing expense. Additionally, first-quarter fuel costs are expected to be at approximately $2.10 per gallon (Read more: Airline Stocks Decline on Wednesday's Trading: Here's Why).2. Airline operations were disrupted when Toby hit the Northeast, resulting in multiple flight cancellations. In fact, the current month has reportedly seen more than 10,000 flights being called off due to successive nor’easters. Notably, it is believed to be the worst March in five years time in terms of flight cancellations (Read more: Airline Operations Disrupted Due to Another Nor'easter).3. According to a Reuters report  American Airlines has ended its negotiations with Airbus to buy multiple planes, in a bid to upgrade its fleet. Replacing Airbus, as a potential supplier to American Airlines was The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report). American Airlines is reportedly looking to purchase 25-30 new wide-bodied jets. The deal with Boeing might be valued between $7 billion and $8.5 billion.On a separate issue, American Airlines announced its intention to launch flights to four cities — Georgetown, Guyana, Pereira, Colombia, Cordoba, Argentina, Oaxaca, Mexico and Buenos Aires, Argentina. The new routes will be operational subject to government clearance. Tickets will be available from April 2018.American Airlines carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.4. The association between United Airlines and Air New Zealand was strengthened when the carriers announced their decision to operate flights connecting Chicago and Auckland. The non-stop year-round flights, operated by Air New Zealand thrice a week, will commence from Nov 30, 2018. Moreover, United Airlines announced that its flights connecting San Francisco and Auckland, which currently operate on a seasonal basis, will fly throughout the year (thrice a week) from April 2019. The service has been expanded to cater to the increased demand.5. Alaska Air Group’s (ALK  -  Free Report) subsidiary — Alaska Airlines — inked a deal with Irish carrier, Aer Lingus, for providing members of its Mileage Plan more opportunities to earn and redeem miles to Europe. According to the new partnership, the carriers will commence interline availability across their respective networks from April 2018. Aer Lingus currently operates flights connecting Dublin and 13 cities in North America. The carrier will operate flights connecting Seattle and Dublin from May 18, 2018.Price PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months.  The table above shows most of the airline stocks traded in the red over the past week mainly due to Southwest’s bearish guidance. Over the course of six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index appreciated 6.9%, on the back of impressive gains at Gol Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes S.A.

2441,DAL,"Airline stocks have been flying high of late, owing to multiple tailwinds. The new tax law is also a boon for the sector participants. In fact, several airline majors namely United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report), Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) and  Hawaiian Airlines — the wholly owned subsidiary of Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. (HA  -  Free Report) —  recently raised respective unit revenue guidance for the first quarter of 2018.Each stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Per the current scenario, carriers are left with huge savings from the reduced corporate tax rate as a result of the enactment of the new tax law. This in turn has prompted carriers like Alaska Air Group, Inc. and SkyWest, Inc. to announce dividend hikes, indicating the companies’ financial prosperity.Price PerformanceThe positive sentiment surrounding airlines can be gauged from the price performance below. While the Zacks Airline Industry has gained 2.5% in a month, the S&P 500 index has lost 1.3%.  Airlines Grounded on WednesdayCurbing optimism, shares of key airline players tumbled on Mar 21 following Southwest Airlines Co.’s (LUV  -  Free Report) guidance cut for first-quarter unit revenues. Shares of Southwest Airlines declined 4.8% following the bleak outlook. The damage was not limited to Southwest Airlines, as shares of other carriers like American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report), Spirit Airlines, Inc. (SAVE  -  Free Report), Delta and JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) also declined on the day. Consequently, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index slid 1.2% at the close of trading on Mar 21.Southwest Airlines now anticipates first-quarter revenue per available seat mile (RASM) to be flat year over year. The former forecast was an increase of 1-2%.The view was lowered based on the company’s current booking and revenue trends. The airline’s year-over-year RASM trend for non-peak travel periods during March was lower-than-expected mainly due to a competitive fare environment and reduced travel demand. The carrier has cited the timing of spring break holidays as the reason for lower-than-expected travel demand. Lower air fares continue to pressurize passenger revenue yields. Additionally, the metric along with load factors are also being affected by the airline’s sub-optimal first-quarter 2018 flight schedule on account of the retirement of its Boeing 737-300 Classic fleet.However, per the company, current customer demand remains strong. RASM trends are also favorable owing to the peak Easter travel period.  Southwest Airlines thus continues to expect year-over-year RASM growth in 2018.Further, the company has lowered its outlook for first-quarter costs. It now estimates operating expenses per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel and oil expense plus profit-sharing expense to rise 0-1%. Previous guidance had called for a 0.5-1.5% increase in the metric. Additionally, first-quarter fuel costs are assumed at approximately $2.10 per gallon, lower than $2.10-$2.15 expected earlier.Other HeadwindsThe airline companies have been struggling with persistent high costs and lower air fares, denting their profits in the process. Expanding capacity implies exorbitant labor, fuel and operational costs and cheap air tickets. Though reasonable air fares bode well for customers, it reduces unit revenues of carriers, affecting the top line.It is to be noted that on fourth-quarter conference call, United Continental stated that it will continue to augment capacity in a bid to maintain its market share at major airport hubs to tackle competition from carriers offering discounts. Capacity growth between 4% and 6% year over year is expected in 2018. Moreover, a similar increase in the metric is forecast for both 2019 and 2020.Zacks Industry Rank Highlights the Drab PictureThe Zacks Industry Rank of 178 (out of 250 plus groups) carried by the Zacks Airline industry further highlights the negativity revolving around the stocks.

2443,DAL,"Hawaiian Holdings, Inc.’s (HA  -  Free Report) wholly owned subsidiary, Hawaiian Airlines, has issued an updated outlook for first-quarter 2018 and the full year. Moreover, as of Jan 1, this year, the company adopted a new accounting standard, affecting the company’s accounting for frequent flyer mileage sales, passenger revenues, other operating revenues as well as selling costs. Q1 Projection The company has raised guidance for first-quarter operating revenue per available seat mile (RASM) owing to better-than-expected passenger revenue performance in each of its geographies as well as higher cargo demand across the network.

Prior view was an increase in the range of 3.5-6.5%. Additionally, the company has altered its view for available seat miles (ASMs) as well as fuel consumption partly due to adjustments pertaining to aircraft deployments. It now anticipates ASMs to climb between 4% and 5%. Former outlook had called for an ascent of 3-5% in the metric. While fuel consumption is estimated to expand between 5% and 7%, above the past forecast of 4-6% improvement.Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. Price  Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. Price | Hawaiian Holdings, Inc.

2444,DAL,"Stocks in the airline space have been hit by inclement weather repeatedly this year. Weather-related disruptions cripple airline operations, leading to multiple flights being cancelled. In fact, the current month has reportedly seen more than 10,000 flights being called off due to successive nor’easters. Notably, it is believed to be the worst March in five years in terms of flight cancellations.  Another Nor'easter Hits: Multiple Flights CancelledFoul weather continued to hurt airline operations, throwing travel plans haywire, as the fourth nor’easter hit the Northeast this month. Similar to the earlier storms, the current one (winter storm Toby) too has resulted in heavy snowfall accompanied by strong winds in the region.Consequently, travel plans were disrupted causing harassments to passengers. The  severity of the storm can be realized from the fact that more than 4000 flights were cancelled in the United States by various carriers on Wednesday. In fact, flight cancellations hit operations severely at major airports like, LaGuardia, JFK and Newark Liberty, in the New York city area.The Fort Worth, TX-based American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) led the list of cancelled flights, calling off 577 flights on Wednesday. Other airline players like United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report), JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) were not spared of the miseries either and had to cancel multiple flights.While American Airlines holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), the other carriers mentioned above carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Woes Not Yet OverWhat is worse is that the woes are likely to continue, though not as severely as on Wednesday, resulting in more flight cancellations and revenue losses for airline operators. In fact, more than 600 flights into/out of the United States are expected to be cancelled today.Moreover, gusty wind is expected to blow in the affected areas confining people to their homes and disrupting travel plans. Apart from the damaging winds, severe power outages are anticipated in parts of the Northeast.To compensate for the harassment of passengers, who had planned to travel in the affected period, most carriers including United Continental, American Airlines, Delta, Spirit Airlines, Inc. (SAVE  -  Free Report) and Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report) are offering travel waivers.Toby- Related Woes Coincide With Southwest’s Bleak RASM ViewWednesday turned out to be a nightmarish day for airline stocks. This is because, apart from their operations being crippled due to Toby, Southwest Airlines’ disappointing unit revenue forecast for the current-quarter resulted in most sector participants trading in the red.The Dallas-based carrier now expects revenue per available seat mile (RASM: a key measure of unit revenue) to be comparable with the figure of 13.23 cents achieved a year-ago. The projection compares unfavorably to the previous forecast of year-over-year growth between 1% and 2%. Pricing pressures and weaker-than-expected demand for air travel due to the timing of the spring break holidays contributed to the downbeat forecast.As a result of the weak RASM guidance, shares of Southwest lost 4.8% of their value, ending the trading session on Mar 21 at $57.78. The losses were not limited to only Southwest as other major carriers too felt the heat and declined. Consequently, the NYSE ARCA Airline index decreased 1.2% on the day to $119.97.Headwinds to Hurt Q1?Back-to-back natural calamities had hurt airline operations last year as well. However, the sector bounced back post the calamities. In the last six months, the Zacks Airline industry rallied 14.9%, outperforming the S&P 500’s gain of 8.9%.Given this backdrop, it remains to be seen whether the successive storms this month and Southwest’s bleak current-quarter unit revenue forecast dampens the sector’s recovery. The headwinds might hurt revenues significantly, thereby adversely affecting the carriers’ first-quarter 2018 results, which should be announced next month.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

2445,DAL,"In the last five trading days, Airlines for America (‘A4A’) — a premier trade organization — for U.S. carriers unveiled an upbeat forecast for the current spring season. Per the projection, these companies are expected to profit considerably this spring (Mar 1-Apr 30) as travel demand is anticipated to increase 4% year over year.Meanwhile, United Airlines — the wholly-owned subsidiary of United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report) — has halted its service pertaining to the transportation of pets in its cargo section, following the death of a French bulldog on one of its flights. This apart, the transportation of a Kansas-bound German shepherd to Japan also dented its market reputation with respect to its pet handling policy. Markedly, these two mishaps were the reasons behind United Airlines’ decision to suspend its pet cargo travel service.American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) was another newsmaker during the week by virtue of its agreement with United Airlines on the number of gates to be assigned to each at Chicago's O'Hare International airport.Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return (Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Mar 7, 2018). Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1. According to a forecast made by A4A, approximately 151 million passengers are anticipated to opt for air travel in spring. In fact, the spring of 2018 is expected to be the busiest one of all times for American carriers in terms of air travel. The forecast is of 2.47 million fliers per day during the period, up 94,000 a day from the comparable year-ago figure. U.S. carriers are planning to meet the surge in demand through the usage of new routes and larger planes.  The carriers aim to offer 114,000 additional seats per day through these measures.2. The fiasco at United Continental, which resulted in the tragic death of a black French bulldog puppy on one of its flights on Mar 12, 2018, has not gone unnoticed by lawmakers in the United States. According to a Reuters report, U.S. senators — John Kennedy and Catherine Cortez Masto —  have introduced a legislation aimed at preventing airlines from putting live animals in overhead bins. The senators have also proposed the imposition of fines on violations of the animal-friendly measure (Read more: Will United Continental's Dog Fiasco Lead to New Laws?).United Continental carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

A major hurdle pertaining to the proposed $8.5 billion expansion plan at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport was removed when American Airlines and United Airlines resolved their dispute on gate allocation. Both carriers, having major hubs at Chicago’s largest airport, were levelling charges against each other. However, the resolution of the problem is a major step toward the expansion of one of the busiest airports of the world.4. European low-cost carrier, Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY  -  Free Report), has reportedly taken a 24.9% stake in an Vienna-based carrier, LaudaMotion. The carrier was founded by former motor racing champion Niki Lauda and is formed out of bankrupt airline Niki, formerly a subsidiary of Air Berlin. Ryanair aims to increase its holdings in LaudaMotion to 75% as soon as possible, subject to clearance by European regulators. The move by Ryanair might be aimed to reduce the dominance of Deutsche Lufthansa AG  in Germany and Austria. Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the last week and in the past six months.  The table above shows that most airline stocks traded in the red over the past week, though the losses were muted in nature. Consequently, the NYSE ARCA Airline index decreased marginally to $121.28 in the period.

2448,DAL,"In a bid to expand its global footprint, Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) has announced several non-stop flights connecting important cities of the United States. The services are expected to begin this autumn. The carrier’s move is a prudent one as it tries to attract traffic in the locations, which in turn would boost passenger revenues, thus aiding its top line.The airline will add a daily non-stop flight connecting Houston with Columbus, OH and Louisville, KY and Denver with Memphis, TN. The services will commence from Oct 3 onward. Additionally, the airline will initiate a non-stop seasonal service between Albany, NY and Las Vegas from around the same time.

2449,DAL,"It is a well-documented fact that woes related to capacity overexpansion had plagued stocks in the airline space for quite some time. In this context, we note that United Continental Holdings, Inc.’s (UAL  -  Free Report) shares had declined significantly in January 2018, even after reporting better-than-expected results in the fourth quarter due to its commentary related to capacity expansion.United Continental carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.In such a scenario, investors fear that capacity expansion might lead to oversupply in the market even as oil prices are well below the highs touched in 2014. Low ticket prices in the United States also hint at the capacity overexpansion issue. While low air fares attract fliers, it dents profits for carriers.February Traffic Reports Offer a Glimmer of HopeDespite the above-mentioned headwinds, February traffic reports of most carriers seem to be encouraging, thus hinting at a decline in capacity-related woes in the airline space. This is because load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) has decreased at each of the above-mentioned carriers as traffic growth outweighed capacity expansion in the month.At Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report), load factor improved 40 basis points year over year to 81.5% in February, with traffic increasing 3.8% and capacity expanding 3.4%. Higher traffic growth in the same month also led to 200 basis points, 340 basis points, 140 basis points and 190 basis points increase in load factor at Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), GOL Linhas Aereas Inteligentes S.A. (GOL  -  Free Report), United Continental and Hawaiian Holdings, Inc.’s (HA  -  Free Report) subsidiary — Hawaiian Airlines, respectively.In fact, Southwest’s load factor expansion to 81% is a record figure for February.Price Performance in FebruaryIn view of the favorable load factor readings, it is of little wonder that the Zacks Airline industry outperformed the broader market in February. While the S&P 500 Index gained 3.7%, the industry rallied 4.8%.The impressive February traffic reports are likely to keep the long-standing capacity-related fears at bay, at least for now. Let’s take a look at some of the other factors which highlight the attractiveness of the sector.Impressive Unit Revenue Projections For the first quarter of 2018, unit revenue views are impressive, highlighting the solid demand for air travel. For example, American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) expects total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM: a key measure of unit revenue) growth between 2% and 4%. Meanwhile, United Continental envisions consolidated passenger unit revenue to be flat to up 2% year over year.Delta anticipates total unit revenues (excluding refinery sales) to increase in the band of 2.5-4.5% (on a year-over-year basis) for the current quarter. In fact, the company expects to perform well on this front throughout 2018, with passenger unit revenue growth estimated in each quarter.Dividends/Buybacks Bode WellThe likes of Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report) and SkyWest, Inc. have already announced hikes in their respective dividend payouts in 2018. We expect other carriers to do the same in view of the new tax law (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act).Notably, huge savings owing to the reduction in corporate tax rate implies that more cash will be available to fund their capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases, among others. This bodes well for shareholders who will gain in the form of dividend hikes and more buybacks.Don’t Even Think About Buying Bitcoin Until You Read This The most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year, giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more. Those gains, however, came with serious volatility and risk. Bitcoin sank 25% or more 3 times in 2017.Zacks has just released a new Special Report to help readers capitalize on the explosive profit potential of Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies with significantly less volatility than buying them directly. See 4 crypto-related stocks now >>

2450,DAL,"The airline industry is looking up, thanks to the increased demand for air travel. The bullish forecast by Airlines for America (‘A4A’) — a premier trade organization — for U.S. carriers in the current spring season further highlights this trend. According to the forecast, these companies are expected to profit considerably this spring (Mar 1-Apr 30) as travel demand is projected to increase 4% year over year to 151 million.With the U.S. economy improving and consumer confidence remaining strong, more Americans are taking vacations, resulting in the increased demand referred above. Moreover, ticket prices are still low and this has been an added incentive for passengers who are benefiting from a much-improved job market and rising disposable income.Buoyed the improving travel demand, many carriers including the likes of Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report), Hawaiian Airlines — the wholly owned subsidiary of Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. (HA  -  Free Report), JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) and United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report) – have recently issued improved views for current-quarter unit revenues. All the above-mentioned stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other key carriers like American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) and Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) are also expected to perform well with respect to unit revenues in the first quarter of 2018.Given this backdrop, it is not a bad idea to indulge in a comparative analysis of airline heavyweights — Delta and United Continental —  based on certain parameters.Price PerformanceWhen considering price performance in a year’s time, Delta clearly scores over United Continental. Delta has gained 22.9%, higher than its industry’s 20.8% rally. Meanwhile, the Chicago-based United Continental gained only 7.4% in the same time frame.ValuationDelta as well as United Continental are attractively valued. Going by the EV-to-EBITDA (enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) ratio, which is often used to value airline stocks, given their significant debt levels and high depreciation and amortization expenses, the stock doesn’t look expensive at this point.Delta currently has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 5.6, which is favorable compared to the figure of 8.1 carried by its industry. United Continental is even more favorably placed in this respect as its reading is 5.5.Current RatioThis metric measures the ability of a company to service both short-term and long-term debt. In other words, it is the ratio of the current level of total assets and expresses to that of the current level of liabilities. Here, United Continental is the winner with a current ratio of 0.56, which is a tad lower than the industry average of 0.57 but much higher than Delta’s 0.42.Debt-to-Equity RatioThe debt-to-equity ratio is a good indicator of the financial well-being of a company and is a good proxy for its debt-servicing capacity. Delta scores over United Continental in this respect. The reading for this Atlanta GA- based carrier is 47.39 compared with 144.21 for United Continental and 161.03 for the industry.Earnings Surprise HistoryUnited Continental has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 4.6%. Meanwhile, Delta has delivered a positive earnings surprise in three of the trailing four quarters while missing once, generating an average positive earnings surprise of 3.8%.ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that Delta holds and edge over United Continental when considering price performance over an extended period and Debt-to-Equity Ratio. Another favorable factor for Delta is that it is a regular payor of dividends. Its dividend yield is an impressive 2.2%. However, United Continental does not pay dividends. Moreover, Delta’s larger business size (market capitalization of $39.39 B) compared to United Continental ($18.7 B) gives it the gargantuan scale to cope with industry headwinds in a better way.Despite being outperformed, with respect to the above parameters, United Continental holds the edge over Delta in terms of valuation, current ratio and earnings surprise history.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2451,DAL,"Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report) reported impressive traffic numbers for February. Traffic for the total system — including scheduled service and fixed fee contract — measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs), increased 14.6% on a year-over-year basis to 937.28 million. System capacity, calculated in available seat miles (ASMs), improved 11.1% to 1.14 billion in the same month.With traffic growth outpacing capacity expansion, load factor (percentage of seats filled with passengers) improved 250 basis points year over year to 82.2%. Strong demand for air travel contributed to the increase in load factor. In fact, this Las Vegas-based carrier transported 999.16 million passengers in the month, reflecting an increase of 15.7% on a year-over-year basis.Impressive Price PerformanceIn the past three months, shares of Allegiant have outperformed the industry  it belongs to. The stock has rallied 18.9% compared with the industry’s gain of 2.1%. Notably, the impressive traffic report for February should boost the stock further.High Costs Remain a BaneDespite the impressive traffic numbers driven by the strong demand for air travel, escalating costs (labor as well as fuel) are expected to continue hurting the company’s bottom line going ahead. In the fourth quarter of 2017, cost per available seat miles (CASM), excluding fuel, increased 20.2% backed by the new pilot agreement, among other factors.Labor costs are likely to be high in the first quarter of 2018 too, thereby limiting bottom-line growth. The rise in fuel costs, which was $2.19 per gallon in February, also does not bode well for the stock.Zacks Rank & Key PicksAllegiant carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the airline space are Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) and Copa Holdings, S.A. (CPA  -  Free Report), carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Those gains, however, came with serious volatility and risk. Bitcoin sank 25% or more 3 times in 2017.Zacks has just released a new Special Report to help readers capitalize on the explosive profit potential of Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies with significantly less volatility than buying them directly.See 4 crypto-related stocks now >>

2452,DAL,"On Feb 26, billionaire investor, Warren Buffett, continued to display his affinity for airline stocks. In an interview to CNBC, the ""Oracle of Omaha"" did not reject the possibility of eventually owning an airline company, thereby displaying his recent interest in the space once again.Last year, the U.S. airline suffered significant losses due to a plethora of headwinds like back-to-back hurricanes and higher fuel costs. However, the industry recovered in the last quarter of 2017 after struggling for most of the year. The resurgence of airline stocks is evident from the fact that the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has increased 11.1% over the last 60 days.Persistent demand for air travel outpacing the overall economic growth and the latest trend of airline operators adding capacity are likely to keep the momentum high in 2018.Growth-Induced PolicesPresident Donald Trump’s proposed policy changes have made the overall economic outlook fairly bullish. The two pro-growth agendas of Trump, namely, significant cut in corporate tax and deregulation are major catalysts to the U.S. economy.  The proposal to reduce corporate taxes from the current 35% to 21% is likely to bring corporate tax rate at its historic low in 78 years. A large part of airline operators book much of their revenues within the United States. Consequently, a significant reduction in corporate tax rate faced by airliners would be immediately accretive to cash flow.Bullish IATA Forecast for 2018In December 2017, the International Air Transport Association (""IATA"") provided an encouraging outlook for the global airline industry. IATA predicts global net profit of $38.4 billion for the industry in 2018. This is much higher than the profitability forecast of $34.5 billion for 2017. This bright projection can be attributed to strong demand for air travel.Global net profit margin is expected to improve marginally to 4.7% in 2018 from 4.6% estimated in 2017. The top line is projected at $824 billion in 2018 compared with $754 billion expected for 2017.Optimism surrounding the air cargo business also improved. Cargo revenues are forecasted to increase to $59.2 billion in 2018 (estimated revenues for 2017 are $54.5 billion). Per the forecast, air travel growth of 6% is expected for 2018. The estimated figure for 2018 is above the average growth of 5.5% in the last 10-20 years.Moody’s Maintain Stable 2018 OutlookIn December 2017, Moody’s Investors Services maintains 2018 outlook for the global airline industry as stable. This stable outlook is driven by projections for 8.5% to 10% operating margins for Moody’s-rated airlines through 2019, with U.S. carriers remaining the most profitable. Moody’s projects industry revenues to grow about 4%, offsetting higher labor and fuel costs. Steady global economic growth will support rising demand for air travel over the next 12 to 18 months.Our Top PicksThe Transportation Services industry is currently in a strong position from the Zacks Industry Rank perspective. The industry is currently in the top 40% (102 out of 256) of the Zacks Categorized industries, suggesting it is well-positioned. Historically, the top 50% of the Zacks Ranked Industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.A thriving and improving economy also supports the overall bullishness of the airline industry, as it implies that more passengers and cargos are being transported across the United States. Improved global growth prospects and sustained business and consumer confidence have in turn helped this industry recover from the sluggishness in 2017 to quite an extent. Easily available credit also strengthens the situation.Given this scenario, we suggest investors add these five airline stocks to their portfolios, each of which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2458,DAL,"The latest fiasco at United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report), which resulted in the tragic death of a black French bulldog puppy on one of its flights on Mar 12, 2018, has not gone unnoticed by lawmakers in the United States.According to a Reuters report, U.S. senators — John Kennedy and Catherine Cortez Masto —  have introduced a legislation aimed at preventing airlines from putting live animals in overhead bins. The senators have also proposed the imposition of fines on violations of the animal-friendly measure.Following the dog fiasco, shares of United Continental have lost 2.6% of its value this week versus the 0.7% decline of its industry.   Reasons Behind the Proposed Bill The senators filed the bill (christened Welfare of Our Furry Friends Act) following the public outcry prompted by the puppy’s death on an United Airlines flight (1284) from Houston to New York. The carrier, however, apologised the next day (Mar 13) for the tragic incident, which is currently under investigation. Also, it has promised to issue bag tags for carriers of animals to avoid a repetition of the same incident. We note that United Airlines is the wholly-owned subsidiary of United Continental.The owner of the bulldog puppy was reportedly  insisted by a flight attendant to put the bag containing the animal in an overhead locker. As a result of this inhuman instruction, the dog died by the time the flight landed in New York's LaGuardia Airport.The Chicago-based carrier, however, said that the flight attendant was unaware of the dog in the bag.Whatever, be the real story, it cannot be denied that United Airlines’ track record with respect to customer service over the past year is not one to be proud of. It all started with the infamous David Dao incident on Apr 9, 2017.Animal Deaths: Highest on United Flights in 2017The death of the puppy further highlights the troubles faced by animals on flights of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) carrier. This is because the highest number of animal deaths among U.S. carriers in 2017 occurred in United Airlines’ flights.According to data released by the Department of Transportation, 18 of the 24 animal deaths on U.S. carriers were related to United Airlines flights. On the flip side, other legacy carriers — American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) and Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) — reported only two animal deaths each in 2017. The data also revealed that 138,178 animals were transported on United Airlines flights in the same year.Notably, the highest number of animal deaths on United Airlines flights prompted Kennedy to shoot off a letter to the carrier’s President Scott Kirby demanding an explanation regarding the issue.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Animal-friendly Measures on Flights in FocusEven before the death of the French puppy, the issue of carrying animals on flights was very much in focus. In fact, Delta had announced a change in its policy pertaining to onboard service animals from March. Risks related to untrained animals in planes due to lack of regulations led to the change in policy.At Delta, the concerned passenger onboard would need to furnish documents underlining the need for carrying the animal on the flight. Also, the person has to provide proof related to its training and vaccinations within 48 hours before the flight. Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) is also reviewing its policy pertaining to onboard service animals.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

2459,DAL,"Shares of C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (CHRW  -  Free Report) have outperformed the industry in the last six months. The stock has rallied 27.8% versus the industry’s decline of 0.7%. Reasons Behind the Price SurgeIn January 2017, the company reported fourth-quarter 2017 results with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. Moreover, both the bottom and top line increased substantially year over year. Price rise and volume growth across most transportation sectors drove the sales. Notably, the company has an impressive earnings history, having outshined the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters with an average beat of 3.6%. The company’s efforts to reward shareholders through dividends and share buybacks are also encouraging. In December 2017, the company’s board of directors approved a 2.2% hike in quarterly cash dividend to 46 cents per share (or $1.84 annually).Additionally, C.H. Robinson’s endeavors to expand globally via mergers and acquisitions are a further positive. Last August, it acquired Milgram & Company for around $62 million CAD (approximately $50 million USD). The buyout will likely boost the acquirer’s international presence and be accretive to its portfolio this year. This strategy is expected to drive growth for the company.The company’s Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) substantiates the bullish sentiment surrounding the stock as well.

2460,DAL,"Investors who are skeptical about whether to keep their money in bonds or stocks, may bank on a key financial parameter — earnings yield. It is the inverse of the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and can be used for finding undervalued stocks. Also, this ratio can be used for the comparative analysis of stocks with the market or fixed income securities.Earnings Yield can be calculated as (Annual Earnings per Share/Market Price) x 100. It is very useful in comparing a stock with other stocks as well as with fixed income securities. While comparing similar stocks, the one which gives high earnings yield should provide better returns.This ratio may also be utilized for comparing the performance of a market with the 10-year Treasury yield. When the yield of the market index is higher than the 10-year Treasury yield, stocks can be regarded as undervalued in comparison to bonds. This implies that investing in the stock market is a better option for a value investor.However, while T-bills are risk-free, investing in stocks always comes with a caveat. Hence, it would be wise to add a risk premium to the Treasury yield while making comparison with the earnings yield of a stock or the broader market.The Winning StrategyWe have set Earnings Yield greater than 10% as our primary screening criterion, but it alone cannot be used for picking stocks that have the potential to generate solid returns. So, we have added the following parameters to the screen:Estimated EPS growth for the next 12 months greater than or equal to the S&P 500: This metric compares the 12-month forward EPS estimate with the 12-month actual EPS.Average Daily Volume (20 Day) greater than or equal to 100,000: High trading volume implies that a stock has adequate liquidity.Current Price greater than or equal to $5.Buy-Rated Stocks: Stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have been known to outperform peers in any type of market environment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Here are four of the 31 stocks that made it through the screen:Volkswagen AG (VLKAY  -  Free Report) is an automobile manufacturer in Europe. This Zacks Rank #2 stock has an expected EPS growth rate of 18.7% for the next 3-5 years. Based in Riverwoods, IL, Discover Financial Services (DFS  -  Free Report) is a direct banking and payment services company in the United States.

2461,DAL,"Stocks in the airline space are flying high lately backed by improved unit revenue projections for the first quarter of 2018 provided by key sector players like United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report), Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) and Hawaiian Airlines — the wholly owned subsidiary of Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. (HA  -  Free Report).Additionally, after much struggles associated with capacity overexpansion, the carriers are experiencing better days now. In fact, February load factors (% of seats filled by passengers) increased for most carriers, thus hinting at a decline in capacity-related woes in the airline space.Price PerformanceThe positivity surrounding the industry is evident from its impressive price performance in the past three months. While the Zacks Airline Industry rallied 5.7%, the S&P 500 index gained 3.3%. Bullish Q1 Unit Revenue Views Bode WellUnit revenue guidance for first-quarter 2018 is impressive, highlighting the solid demand for air travel. Notably, United Continental expects current-quarter passenger revenue per available seat miles (PRASM) to grow between 1% and 3% (prior guidance: 0% to 2%). Unit revenue views have also risen at Delta Air Lines. The carrier projects total unit revenues, excluding refinery sales, to increase in the band of 4-5% compared with 2.5-4.5% projected earlier.Hawaiian Airlines too raised its guidance for first-quarter operating revenue per available seat mile (RASM) owing to better-than-expected passenger revenue performance in each of its geographies and higher cargo demand across the network. The company now expects RASM to increase 3-5%, up from its previous prediction of a decline of 0.5% to a rise of 2.5%. Also, JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU  -  Free Report) issued a revised RASM guidance, following its impressive traffic results last month. This low-cost carrier anticipates first-quarter 2018 RASM to improve 3.5-5.5% compared with 2.5-5.5% guided earlier.Load Factors Rise in FebruaryFebruary traffic reports offer a glimmer of hope to key sector participants after continued struggles in this space. At most carriers, load factors improved as traffic growth was outpaced by capacity expansion, thus leading to packed planes.Notably, At Delta Air Lines, load factor was up 40 basis points year over year to 81.5% in February, with traffic increasing 3.8% and capacity expanding 3.4%. Higher traffic growth in the same month led to 200 basis points, 340 basis points, 140 basis points and 190 basis points increase in load factor at Southwest Airlines Co., GOL Linhas Aereas Inteligentes S.A., United Continental and Hawaiian Airlines, respectively.With load factors rising, air fares are expected to rise as well, thus aiding the top line of carriers. Evidently, per reports released by the Bureau of Transportation Services, airfares increased 0.6% in February compared with that in January. The trend is likely to continue in 2018 as airlines face higher fuel costs.Dividends/Buybacks Bode WellCurrently, carriers are left with huge savings from the reduced corporate tax rate, courtesy of the new tax law. Thus, implying that more cash will be available to fund their capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases, among others. This bodes well for shareholders who are anticipated to gain in the form of dividend hikes and more buybacks.Meanwhile, the likes of Alaska Air Group, Inc. and SkyWest, Inc. have already announced hikes in their respective dividend payouts for 2018. We expect other carriers to do the same in view of the new tax law (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act).Zacks Industry Rank Highlights the Bright PictureThe Zacks Industry Rank of 95 (of 250 plus groups) carried by the Zacks Airline Industry also emphasizes the optimistic sentiment revolving around airline stocks. This favorable rank places the companies within the top 37% slot of the Zacks industries.We classify our entire 250-plus industries into two groups: the top half (i.e. industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Using a week’s rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1 over the last decade.

2462,DAL,"Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report), a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), is a research-based, global pharmaceutical company that discovers, develops, manufactures, and markets medicines for humans. The Company's diversified global healthcare portfolio includes human and animal biologic and small molecule medicines and vaccines, as well as nutritional products and consumer healthcare products. It sells its products to wholesalers, distributors, retailers, hospitals, clinics, government agencies, pharmacies, individual provider offices, and grocery and convenience stores.In its most recent reported quarter, Q4 18, the company easily beat both the Zacks consensus earnings and revenue estimates.  Pfizer posted year over year gains in revenues +1%, adjusted income +30%, and adjusted diluted EPS +32%.  The report also showed that the company’s tax rate would fall from 23% to about 17%, and that management approved a $5 billion share repurchase program.  Further, during the conference call management alluded to future consolidation within the segment along with several partnerships. The company’s innovative business segment, branded drugs, vaccines, and consumer health, grew by +8% YoY with direct sales revenues improving by +47% YoY.  The big drivers behind the success of the innovative segment was Eliquis, oral anticoagulant prescribed by cardiologists, Xeljanz, used for moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, and Prevnar, a pneumonia vaccine. Looking ahead, besides its legacy branded drugs, the company has a strong pipeline of new products focused on oncology, and biosimilars (generic drugs).  One of the most exciting new drugs is Ibrance, a new treatment for breast cancer that is expected to generate almost $6 billion in annual sales by 2020. Towards the end of 2017, management approved a +6.3% increase to its quarterly dividend, making the new annual dividend $1.36, or a +3.7% annual yield.  Pfizer has paid an annual dividend since 1901, and has increased it for the past nine consecutive years.  Moreover, the company is expected to use its tax savings to further increase its share repurchase program, and boost its dividend payments for the next several years. This strong earnings report, and positive future outlook has caused analysts to increase their earnings estimates for the next two quarters and next two fiscal years as you can see in the table below.Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report), a Zacks Rank #2 (Strong Buy) is a major American airline with its headquarters on the northern boundary of Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, within the city limits of Atlanta. Delta started operation by crop dusting and flying mail and then introduced passenger service. Delta's business is focused on making global connections, flying people and cargo throughout the United States and around the world. Delta Air Lines offers customers service to more destinations than any global airline with Delta and Delta Connection carrier service. Delta Air Lines and the Delta Connection carriers offer service to nearly 370 destinations on six continents. Delta has added more international capacity than all other U.S. airlines combined and is the leader across the Atlantic.In the company’s most recent quarter, they beat the Zacks consensus earnings and revenue estimates for the second consecutive quarter.  The report showed that revenues were up +8.3% overall with domestic up +7%, total passenger improving by +6.6%, cargo rising by +14.4%, and other revenues gaining +17.9% YoY.  Earnings Per Share improved by +17.1% YoY.  The big jump in other revenues was due to several key areas; club and on-board sales, administrative fees, loyalty programs, ancillary businesses, baggage fees, and refinery. Another tailwind for the company is their co-brand partnership with American Express as Delta gets the interchange fee.  In 2017, the Delta AmEx card portfolio realized $80.9 billion in charges where $1.975 billion in EBIT went to Delta.  This is expected to increase to $2.7 billion by 2020 due to the contractual increase in the price per mile Delta gets from AmEx.  Further, the whole partnership deal with AmEx generated $3 billion in revenues in 2017, and this is expected to increase to $4 billion by 2021 (the contract goes through 2022). Looking forward, management guided 2018 EPS in a range between $6.35-6.70, well above its previous guidance of $5.35-5.70.  This boost is mostly due to the tax reform plan which by itself is expected to benefit EPS by $1.00-1.25.  For Q1 18, management guided EPS at $0.65-0.75, and increased Revenue Per Available Seat (RASM) expectations from 2.5-4.5% YoY to 4-5%.  The rise in RASM is due to improvements in both leisure, and business travel. The increase in 2018 EPS guidance and upgraded Q1 18 RASM expectations caused analysts to positively revise estimates for FY 18, and FY 19.  Further, the stock price has continued to move upwards since the beginning of 2016.  You can see both of these improvements in the Price and Earnings consensus graph below.Price and Consensus  Price and Consensus |  QuoteDuring the December quarter the company repurchased $325 million worth of stock as part of its $5 billion share repurchase program announced in March of 2017.  The company also pays a solid annual dividend yield of +2.16%.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

2463,DAL,"In the past year, Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) has outperformed the S&P 500 index, of which Delta is a member. Shares of the company have gained 18.5% compared with the S&P 500 index’s rally of 16.4%.Lets delve deep to unearth the reasons behind the company’s impressive price performance.Delta has a solid earnings surprise history, having reported better-than-expected earnings per share in three of the trailing four quarters. Also, in the fourth quarter of 2017, this Atlanta, GA- based carrier’s earnings and revenues exceeded estimates and improved year over year. Results were aided by strong demand for air travel during the holiday season. Additionally, the company performed well on the unit revenue front. Total revenues per available seat miles (TRASM: excluding refinery sales) increased 4.4% (on a year-over-year basis) in the quarter. The metric is projected to lie within 4-5% in the first quarter of 2018. Apart from Delta, other airline players like United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report), Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. (HA  -  Free Report) and JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) are expected to perform well on the unit revenue front in the same time period.In fact, a solid earnings track record generally works as a catalyst in boosting the stock price. This is because it indicates the company’s ability to surpass earnings estimates. More often than not, investors take into account a company’s buoyant earnings history while betting on the stock, with the expectation that it will continue surpassing earnings estimates in its next releases.Furthermore, the company’s efforts to reward shareholders through dividends and share buybacks raise optimism on the stock’s performance. To this end, Delta returned $2.4 billion to shareholders through the above-mentioned shareholder friendly initiatives in 2017. Notably, this was the third consecutive year in which the carrier returned at least 70% of free cash flow to its investors. Going ahead, Delta intends to maintain the same level.Moreover, the company’s employee-friendly approach along with efforts to reduce its debt levels to modernize its fleet is impressive. Also, the new tax law, which reduces corporate tax rate significantly, is an added positive for Delta. Changes to the tax code is expected to boost 2018 earnings per share significantly.A Broker FavoriteDelta’s earnings estimates reflect a healthy uptrend. Evidently, the company has witnessed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter and current-year earnings being revised 1.3% and 0.4% upward, respectively, in the last 30 days.Given the wealth of information at the disposal of brokers, it is in the best interests of investors to be guided by broker advice and the direction of their estimate revisions. This is because the direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock.Zacks Rank & Style ScoreTaking into account the above-mentioned tailwinds, we believe that the current price performance represents an attractive entry point for investors. Delta’s Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) also supports our view. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Additionally, the company’s VGM Score of B highlights its attractiveness.

(UAL  -  Free Report) and Hawaiian Airlines — the wholly owned subsidiary of Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. (HA  -  Free Report) — unveiled bullish unit revenue views for the first quarter of 2018.While Delta and United Continental revealed their projections at the J.P. Morgan Aviation, Transportation and Industrials Conference, Hawaiian Airlines did the same in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The improved unit revenue projections reflect the increased demand for air travel.Moreover, the likes of Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report), United Continental and JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU  -  Free Report) reported traffic growth for February. Load factor (% of seats filled with passengers) increased at Southwest, Allegiant Travel and United Continental as traffic growth outpaced capacity expansion. However, the metric was flat at JetBlue.Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return(Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Mar 08, 2018).Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories1. Hawaiian Airlines raised its guidance for first-quarter operating revenue per available seat mile (RASM). This improvement was owing to better-than-expected passenger revenue performance in each of its geographies as well as higher cargo demand across the network.

2465,DAL,"Airline operations have been disrupted severely over the last couple of days due to the deadly nor’easter in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast of United States. Notably, this winter storm has impeded travel plans and caused harassments to passengers. It caused heavy snowfall accompanied by hurricane-force winds in excess of 120 kilometers per hour in the affected areas.Flight Cancellations at Large Due to the StormWith the storm disrupting normal life, it is of little wonder that travel plans were thrown haywire as major airline operators had to cancel multiple flights. In fact, the severity of the storm can be realized from the fact that approximately 4000 flights were cancelled in the United States by various carriers like American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report), Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report) since Mar 2, 2018.While Delta and United Continental carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), American Airlines has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The worst scenario was on Friday with carriers in the United States cancelling 3,423 flights while more than 4,000 were delayed. In fact, operations were disrupted severely at hubs like Boston, New York and Philadelphia.More Worries Loom Ahead?Although the winds have weakened, storm-related harassments still linger, thousands of homes in eastern United States are still without power. According to a Reuters report, coastal areas of Maine, MA, among others might still be affected by floods and extreme high tides.To compensate for the harassment of passengers, who had planned to travel in the affected period, most carriers including American Airlines, Delta and JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) are offering various facilities. For example, they can opt for change of flights without incurring any extra cost.Some Similar Incidents Weather-related issues have hurt airlines previously as well. In January 2018, operations at carriers were disrupted by winter storm Grayson. Last year, back-to-back hurricanes (Harvey, Irma and Maria) dented airline operations significantly.Also, winter storm Stella had crippled airline operations considerably by impeding travel. In 2016, Hurricane Matthew had spelt doom for airlines, causing extensive damage. In fact, such acts of nature hinder the schedules of carriers, thus causing multiple flight cancellations. Other Factors Hurting Airlines Apart from the storm-related disruption in operations, airlines have been confronted with a few other challenges.Of late, the disagreement between legacy carriers — American Airlines and United Continental — pertaining to gate allocation at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport has been grabbing headlines. Both carriers, having major hubs at Chicago’s largest airport, are levelling charges against each other. Unless resolved quickly, this issue might snowball into a major crisis.Moreover, fears related to capacity overexpansion were re-ignited with January traffic reports of most carriers like Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report), exhibiting a fall in load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers). The downturn can be attributed to capacity expansion outweighing traffic growth.We remind investors that shares of United Continental declined significantly in January, even after reporting better-than-expected results in the fourth quarter on issues related to capacity.On the fourth-quarter conference call, the company stated that it will continue expanding capacity in a bid to maintain market share at major airport hubs to deal with competition from discount carriers like Spirit Airlines, Inc. (SAVE  -  Free Report). For 2018, United Continental’s capacity growth is projected between 4% and 6% year over year. The metric is anticipated to increase in 2019 as well as 2020.Furthermore, airfares have declined for three successive months in the United States. Generally, carriers are forced to reduce fares as unit revenues decline in the face of capacity outpacing demand growth. While low air fares seem to be favorable for fliers, it becomes a drag on the company’s top line with their profits being hurt.In addition to the above challenges, the rise in fuel costs also does not bode well for carriers. Evidently, fourth-quarter earnings declined at the likes of Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. (HA  -  Free Report) on high fuel costs.Price PerformanceIn view of the above headwinds, it is of little wonder that the Zacks Airline industry underperformed the broader market in a year’s time. The S&P 500 Index has gained 13.7% compared with the industry’s rally of 10%. The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All  Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early. See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

2469,DAL,"The robust U.S. job data for February bodes well for the domestic economy. In fact, American businesses have recorded the strongest jobs growth in a year and a half in February. Factors like warmer-than-normal weather conditions and Trump’s business-friendly tax reform contributed to the impressive numbers.While the economy is currently basking in the glory of the February job data, it is worth noting that market participants were gripped by fears of inflation only a month back. Notably, both the Dow as well as the S&P 500 had entered into the correction territory on Feb 9. In fact, the significant increase in the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) highlighted the heightened volatility in the market at that time.Given the fluctuating nature of the U.S. equity market, investing in companies that pay consistent dividends seem to be a prudent strategy right now. This is because such companies are financially stable and mature and can even generate steady cash flow irrespective of market conditions.Airlines: A Sector to ConsiderA sector that boasts well-paying stocks in terms of dividends, is the one having airline stocks. Infact, airlines have rebounded nicely after having laid low by hurricanes last year. Markedly, the financial prosperity of airline stocks has contributed to their shareholder-friendly attitude. This is well-reflected by its healthy price performance over the last six months. The Zacks Airline industry has gained 13.7% in the period, outperforming the S&P 500’s 11.9% rally.Factors like healthy demand for air travel and improving unit scenario have contributed to the bullish sentiment surrounding airlines. The Zacks Industry Rank of 97 (out of 250 plus groups) carried by the Zacks Airline industry further highlights the attractiveness of airlines. The favorable rank places the companies in the top 38% of the Zacks industries.We put our entire 250-plus industries into two groups: the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Over the last 10 years, using a one week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Click here to know more: About Zacks Industry RankMoreover, the fact that Warren Buffett — one of the most revered investors of all time — continues to show his affinity for airline stocks bodes well for the sector. Last month, the ""Oracle of Omaha,"" in an interview to CNBC, did not reject the possibility of eventually owning an airline company, thus showcasing his interest in the space.More Dividend Hikes Likely Under the New Tax LawThe new tax law (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act), which reduces corporate tax rate significantly, is a huge positive for airline stocks. This is because it is likely to boost cash flow and in turn improve the bottom line of carriers. Moreover, the fact that the likes of Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) and JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU  -  Free Report) declared bonuses ($1,000 per member), following the tax overhaul, highlights the optimism on stocks pertaining to this measure.Meanwhile, the likes of Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report) and SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report) have already announced hikes in their respective dividend payouts in 2018. We expect other carriers to do the same in view of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.Notably, huge savings owing to the reduction in corporate tax rate implies that more cash will be available to fund their capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases, among others. This bodes well for shareholders who will gain in the form of dividend hikes and more buybacks.Valuation Signals More UpsideGoing by the EV-to-EBITDA (enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) ratio — which is often used to value airline stocks — given their significant debt levels, and high depreciation and amortization expenses, the industry does not look expensive at this point.The industry currently has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 6.9, which compares favorably with the market at large, as the current EV/EBITDA for the S&P 500 is at 12.2. The industry’s favorable positioning compared with the overall market certainly signals more upside.Dividend Paying Airlines Should Grace Your PortfolioIn view of the tailwinds mentioned above, we believe that stocks from the airline space should be present in one’s portfolio. Moreover, dealing with dividend stocks is a prudent strategy during uncertain times like the current scenario. Markedly, the best dividend stocks that pay out a healthy yield and have strong prospects are less susceptible to market downturns.Given the significant reduction in taxes, we expect the already cheap airline stocks to fly higher, going ahead. Consequently, we have zeroed in on three stocks in this high flying space, which have a strong dividend paying history. Moreover, each of the selected stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) is a leading provider of scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo in the United States as well as internationally. The company, based in Atlanta, GA, has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Value Score of A.The company has a dividend yield of 2.18%. Also, Delta has been consistently rewarding its shareholders through dividends since 2013. Notably, it has hiked dividend pay-outs significantly for four consecutive years since then. The latest hike was announced in May 2017, when the company’s board of directors approved a 50.6% dividend hike in its quarterly cash dividend to 30.5 cents per share. We expect the company to raise its dividend this year too.American Airlines Group, Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report), headquartered in Fort Worth, TX, is another established name in the airline space paying regular dividends. This Zacks Rank #2 legacy carrier has a Value Score of A. The company has a dividend yield of 0.71%.International Consolidated Airlines Group, S.A. (ICAGY  -  Free Report) based in Madrid, Spain, was founded in 2010. The carrier has a Zacks Rank #1.

2470,DAL,"Shares of United (UAL  -  Free Report) climbed on Tuesday after the company announced that it upped its unit revenue guidance for the first quarter and provided strong full-year earnings guidance. Meanwhile, fellow U.S. airline powers Delta (DAL  -  Free Report) and American (AAL  -  Free Report) also saw their stock prices climb, which makes this a great time to see if any of these stocks are worth buying at the moment.United In a SEC filing that was made public today, United announced that it expects to post adjusted earnings between $6.50 per share and $8.50 per share in fiscal 2018. Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for the company to post earnings of $7.50 per share, which falls directly in the middle of United’s latest guidance and would mark a 10.95% year-over-year surge.Investors might be happy to the note that the airline’s new high-side EPS guidance comes in $0.46 above our current highest earnings estimate. This might signal that some optimistic analysts will soon up their estimates based on United’s new EPS projections.The company also provided initial 2020 earnings guidance and noted that its CAGR target for EPS is 25%. United projects it will post an EPS figure between $11 and $13 in 2020, based on this three-year growth target.Along with these more long-term projections, United upped its Q1 fiscal 2018 passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) guidance from between 0% and 2% to 1% and 3%. This important metric is one that airline industry investors pay close attention to as it is a solid way to measure efficiency and profitability. United is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and sports an “A” grade for Value and a “B” for Momentum in our Style Scores system.Delta Delta announced earlier this month that the company carried 13 million passengers in February, which marked a record high for the normally slow travel period. As one might expect, the company’s domestic revenue passenger miles (RPM) climbed 5.4%.Looking ahead to fiscal 2018, Delta is expected to see its earnings jump by 29% to reach $6.36 per share, while its sales are projected to climb 5.8% to $43.63 billion. The airline power is also expected to expand its EPS figure at an annualized rate of 11.60% over the next three to five years.Delta is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and rocks an overall “B” VGM score, which is supported by its “A” grades for Value and Momentum. Investors should also note that Delta is currently trading at 8.8x earnings—a discount compared to the “Transportation – Airline” industry average as well as its biggest competitors United and American.American Aside from the recent cancelation of flights in the Northeast due to severe storms, American Airlines also looks to be a strong stock at the moment. AAL is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and boasts an “A” grade for Value, along with some strong growth prospects.The company is projected to see its fiscal 2018 earnings surge 20.7% to hit $5.89 per share. On top of that, our current estimates call for American’s 2019 EPS figure to climb another 19% above our current 2018 projections. American’s revenues are also expected to jump nearly 7% this year to reach $45.16 billion.Furthermore, American’s bottom line is projected to expand at an annualized rate of nearly 17% over the next three to five years, which is strong for a company of its size and age. These estimates could climb even higher if recent American initiatives, such as its new “Basic Economy” options on some trans-Atlantic flights, prove to be solid revenue drivers. The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

2471,DAL,"It was a week where billionaire investor, Warren Buffett, continued to show his affinity for airline stocks. In an interview to CNBC, the ""Oracle of Omaha"" did not reject the possibility of eventually owning an airline company, thereby displaying his recent interest in the space once again.Warren Buffett, the world’s third richest man, has stakes in airline heavyweights — Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report), American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report), United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report) and Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) — since 2016, after having shunned the sector for years.On the earnings front, Copa Holdings, S.A. (CPA  -  Free Report) performed well in the fourth quarter outperforming revenues and earnings estimates. Moreover, Southwest Airlines featured in the news when a dog reportedly bit a child on one of its flights. In fact, the incident gained prominence as many airlines are considering changes in their respective policies pertaining to carrying animals on flights.(Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Feb 21, 2018).Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % ReturnRecap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1.

Quarterly revenues also improved 12.4% on a year-over-year basis to $675.6 million and topped the consensus mark of $663.4 million.The year-over-year improvement in the top line was primarily owing to 12.6% growth in passenger revenues.

However, the company has not yet found a suitable company to buy mainly due to valuation concerns. An airline company could foot the bill (airline stocks are inexpensive) and might be acquired by the iconic investor. This commentary of one of the most revered investors of all times positively impacted airline stocks.3. According to data released by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), airlines fared better in 2017, as far as safety related performance was concerned, compared with 2016. In fact, the all accident rate (accidents per 1 million flights) improved to 1.08 in 2017 from 1.68 a year ago. The comparable figure was 2.01 for the 2012-2016 period.Moreover, the rate for major jet accidents (jet hull losses per 1 million flights) came in at 0.11 in 2017, compared with the 2016 figure of 0.39. The figure also compared favorably with the 2012-2016 rate of 0.33. Additionally, in 2017, there were six fatal accidents (none involving a passenger jet) with 19 fatalities among passengers and crew.This reading, too, is favorable with the 2016 figures of nine fatal accidents and 202 fatalities. In the 2012-2016 period, there was an average of 10.8 fatal accidents and approximately 315 fatalities per year.4. The long-standing pay-related dispute between European low-cost carrier, Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY  -  Free Report), and its pilots shows no signs of ending. According to a Reuters report, the European Employee Representative Council — formed in 2016 by pilots of the Irish carrier — demanded the resignation of Ryanair ‘s CEO Michael O‘Leary.The unofficial pan-European body was of the opinion that O‘Leary had failed to tackle the issue effectively, resulting in many pilots quitting the company. Ryanair has, however, dismissed the demand.5. An unfortunate child-related occurred on a Southwest Airlines flight (Phoenix-to-Portland) when a dog bit the girl on the plane. Southwest started reviewing its policy pertaining to onboard service animals, even before the occurrence of incident. In fact, not only Southwest but other carriers like Delta have been in the news recently regarding the issue.Markedly, from Mar 1, 2018 the concerned passengers on Delta flights would need to furnish documents underlining the passenger's need for carrying the animal on the flight. Also, the person has to provide proof related to its training and vaccinations within 48 hours before the flight.Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months. The table above shows that most airline stocks traded in the green over the past week, buoyed by comments of Warren Buffett.

2472,DAL,"It seems that airline stocks are back in favor after facing multiple challenges for the greater part of 2017. Sector participants have been hampered by a number of headwinds like disruptions from back-to-back hurricanes, the devastating earthquake in Mexico, issues related to customer dissatisfaction and high costs (labor as well as fuel).The lackluster performance of the sector in the first nine months of the year can be seen from the graph below. The chart clearly indicates that the Zacks Airline Industry had underperformed the S&P 500 Index in the above-mentioned period. While the S&P 500 index gained 11.9%, the industry rallied 8.8%.Airlines Laid Low in Q3It is a well-documented fact that airline stocks struggled in the third quarter of 2017 due to the negative impacts of the recent natural calamities. Even though most sector heavyweights like Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report), American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) topped earnings estimates, the outperformance was primarily owing to the conservative nature of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.In this context, let’s consider the case of American Airlines. In the third quarter, the consensus estimate for the carrier’s earnings was pegged at $1.39, much lower than the year-ago figure of $1.68. The conservative nature of the Zacks Consensus Estimate has made it easier for transportation companies to surpass them in the quarter.In fact, higher costs led to a decline in quarterly earnings on a year-over-year basis for most carriers, thus revealing the sorry state of affairs for the sector. While the bottom line fell 7.6% and 5.4% at Delta and Southwest Airlines, respectively, at United Continental the metric was down 28.6%. American Airlines also reported a significant reduction in earnings in the same time frame.Moreover, multiple flight cancellations and continued soft demand for air travel to and from the affected areas due to the recent natural calamities hurt third-quarter results. For example, United Continental’s pre-tax income was hurt to the tune of approximately $185 million.Improved Unit Projections Hint at Brighter Q4Post-hurricanes, things are looking up for stocks in the airline space. This is evident from the fact that major players in the sector like Southwest Airlines and United Continental issued improved unit revenue views for the fourth quarter on the back of buoyant demand for air travel and improving yields.United Continental now expects fourth-quarter consolidated passenger unit revenue (PRASM: a key measure of unit revenue) in the band of down 2% to flat on a year-over-year basis. The projection compares favorably with the earlier view that the metric might drop in the band of 1% to 3%.Southwest Airlines expects operating revenue per available seat miles (RASM: a key measure of unit revenue) to increase between 1% and 2% (earlier view had called for the metric to be up slightly to 1.5 %) in the final quarter of 2017. Hawaiian Holdings anticipates fourth-quarter RASM to improve between 1.5% and 3.5%, up from the previous view of down 1% to up 2%.Dividends/Buybacks Attest Solid Financial HealthFinancial prosperity of the sector participants is reflected in the fact that the likes of Southwest Airlines, Delta Air Lines and SkyWest Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report) have hiked their respective dividend payouts this year.Carriers have also indulged in share buybacks that substantiates their solid financial health yet again. For example, United Continental recently announced a new $3 billion share repurchase program. The company’s previous $2 billion share repurchase program announced in July 2016 is expected to be completed by 2017-end.In addition to the existing $100 million authorization, Hawaiian Holdings unveiled a new share repurchase program worth $100 million through Dec 31, 2019.Notably, the robust financial health of most carriers has prompted them to invest substantially in improving flying experience for travellers, in a bid to stay afloat in the competitive airline space.Bullish ProjectionsOf late, the bullish projections revealed by the International Air Transport Association (“IATA”) and Airlines for America (A4A) for 2017 profitability and the upcoming winter holiday season (Dec 15-Jan 4), respectively, further highlights the optimism surrounding the space.According to A4A, the winter holiday season is expected to be a busy one for U.S. carriers. The organization expects 51 million passengers to opt for air travel during the period, reflecting a 3.5% increase from the 2016 figure.An improving domestic economy and affordable air fares have resulted in the bullish forecast for this year. The rosy projection for the winter holiday period comes close on the heels of the robust performance of U.S. carriers in the Thanksgiving holiday period.Even on the global front, the picture seems to be a bright one for airlines. This is signified by the bullish projection issued by the IATA with respect to the profitability level for 2018. The research firm predicts global net profit of $38.4 billion for the industry. This is much higher than the 2017 profitability forecast of $34.5 billion (increased from the $31.4 billion predicted in June). The research firm has also predicted that the average net profit per departing passenger would be $8.90 per passenger in 2018 compared with $8.45 in 2017. Additionally, the improved projection for full-year 2017 by Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes (GOL  -  Free Report) is indicative of the improving Latin American economy.Zacks Industry Rank Supports Favorable ScenarioThe Zacks Industry Rank of 47 (out of 250 plus groups) carried by the Zacks Airline industry further highlights the attractiveness of railroads. The favorable rank places the companies in the top 18% of the Zacks industries.We put our entire 250-plus industries into two groups: the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Over the last 10 years, using a one week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Click here to know more: About Zacks Industry RankAirline Stocks Should Grace Your Portfolio- Our ChoicesThe above write-up clearly suggests that the overall outlook for the sector has improved significantly.

2473,DAL,"Last week the pilot fiasco at American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) was the most eye-catching event in the airline space. A scheduling error allowed its pilots to take leave during the upcoming winter holiday period. The prospect of an acute pilot shortage during the busy travel period caused panic among passengers. Some of them also contacted the company to be sure that their travel plans will not be hampered.Alarmed by the situation, the company finally signed an agreement in principle with its pilots’ union — Allied Pilots Association (APA) — to ensure that it operates the flights during December smoothly.On the traffic front, Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) and Hawaiian Holdings’ (HA  -  Free Report) wholly owned subsidiary — Hawaiian Airlines — revealed their respective November traffic numbers in the week. Additionally, Hawaiian Airlines provided an improved outlook on operating revenue per available seat miles (a key measure for unit revenue) for the fourth-quarter as well as 2017. The carrier also revised its fourth-quarter forecast for economic fuel cost per gallon, in line with the scenario of increasing fuel prices.Furthermore, the International Air Transport Association (“IATA”) and Airlines for America (A4A) provided forecasts for 2017 profitability and the upcoming winter holiday season (Dec 15-Jan 4), respectively.Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return (Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Nov 29, 2017).Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories1. In a bid to avoid flight cancellations during the busy winter travel period, American Airlines had offered pilots 150% of their normal hourly pay to operate unassigned flights. However, this measure did not find favor with the APA and it reportedly filed a grievance. According to APA, the company had violated its labor contract. The crisis was resolved over talks between the two parties, prompting APA to withdraw its protest.Though details of the talks were not disclosed, labor costs are likely to spike further and hurt the bottom line of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) carrier in the fourth quarter of 2017. (Read more: Will American Airlines' Pilot Fiasco Hurt Holiday Travel?You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.2. At Delta, November consolidated traffic — measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs) — came in at 16.15 billion, up 3.5% year over year. This upside was driven by a 3.9% increase in international RPMs. Consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) also rose 2.9% year over year to 18.91 billion, primarily owing to 4% rise in domestic ASMs. Moreover, load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) improved 40 basis points to 85.4% in the month on the back of traffic growth exceeding capacity expansion. (Read more: Delta Air Lines Reports Strong November Traffic, Stock Up).3. At Hawaiian Airlines RPMs increased 6.3% to 1.33 billion in November on a year-over-year basis. Load factor improved 10 basis points to 85.9% as traffic growth outpaced capacity expansion (6.2%) for the month. The carrier now anticipates fourth-quarter economic fuel cost per gallon between $1.80 and $1.90 (previous guidance had estimated the metric between $1.75 and $1.85). Operating unit revenue for the fourth-quarter is also anticipated to grow between 1.5% and 3.5% (previous guidance had estimated the metric to vary between down 1% to up 2%).For 2017, the metric is estimated to grow between 5.5% and 6.5% (previous guidance had called for growth between 5% and 6%). The company also painted a bright picture for long-term growth at its investor day presentation.4. The IATA unveiled a rosy view for carriers with respect to the profitability level for 2018. The research firm predicts global net profit of $38.4 billion for the industry. This is much higher than the 2017 profitability forecast of $34.5 billion (increased from the $31.4 billion predicted in June). The bright projection despite increased costs can be attributed to the strong demand for air travel. The bulk of the global profits in 2018 is expected from the North American region ($16.4 billion). The estimated figure is higher than $15.6 billion expected in 2017.Global net profit margin is expected to improve marginally to 4.7% in 2018 from 4.6% estimated in 2017. The top line is projected to come in at $824 billion next year compared with $754 billion projected in the current year. Cargo revenues are forecasted to increase to $59.2 billion for 2018 (estimated revenues for 2017 are $54.5 billion).According to the forecast, air travel growth of 6% is expected in 2018 compared with 7.5% growth in 2017. The estimated figure for 2018 is, however, above the average growth of 5.5% in the last 10-20 years. Capacity is projected to rise by 5.7% in 2018. According to the forecast, load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) for the next year is expected to touch record levels of 81.4% as capacity expansion is likely to outweigh traffic growth. According to the report, yields are expected to improve 3% in 2018.The research firm has also predicted that the average net profit per departing passenger would be $8.90 per passenger in 2018 compared with $8.45 in 2017. The firm projects that jet fuel prices are likely to escalate around 12.5% to $73.8 per barrel next year. Fuel bill is likely to account for 20.5% of total costs in 2018 (18.8% in 2017).However, labor costs are likely to be higher. They are expected to account for 30.9% of total expenses in 2018. Total unit costs in 2018 are expected to grow 4.3% (much higher than the 1.7% increase in 2017). Unit revenue growth for 2018 is projected at 3.5%.5. According to A4A, the winter holiday season is expected to be a busy one for U.S. carriers. Moreover, the organization expects 51 million passengers to opt for air travel during the period, reflecting a 3.5% increase from the 2016 figure. The forecast reflects an increase of 80,000 passengers per day from the comparable figure last year. Passenger volumes (on a daily basis) is projected to be in the range of 2 million to 2.7 million.Notably, the busiest days for the holiday period are expected to be Dec 21, Dec 22 and Dec 26 while the lightest travel days are projected to be Dec 16, Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and New Year’s Eve. To meet the surge in travel demand, U.S. carriers are increasing the number of available seats by 91,000 per day. The bullish forecast was backed by an improving domestic economy and affordable air fares.6. Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report) has announced the addition of 11 new routes, starting next spring. The carrier’s move is a prudent one as it is likely to boost traffic on the new routes, thereby driving the top line.

The company’s earnings (excluding 10 cents from non-recurring items) came in at $2.22 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.8%. Earnings were, however, 28.6% lower than the year-ago figure due to higher costs.Operating revenues of $9,878 million in the third quarter were also marginally ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9,857.3 million.

2476,DAL,"Last week saw Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) kick-starting the third-quarter earnings season for the airline space on an impressive note. The company’s earnings as well as revenues surpassed expectations, despite recent natural calamities. While this Atlanta, GA-based company’s top line expanded on a year-over-year basis, the bottom line contracted owing to higher costs.On the news front, JetBlue Airways Corp.

JetBlue expects its top line to be hurt to the tune of $44 million in the third quarter of 2017.

The board of directors of Hawaiian Holdings approved an initial quarterly dividend of 12 cents per share. The dividend will be paid on Nov 30 to its shareholders as of Nov 17, 2017. We believe that the dividend initiation not only highlights Hawaiian Holdings’ commitment to create value for shareholders but also underlines the carrier’s healthy financial condition and confidence in its business going forward. Meanwhile, the company has already been rewarding its shareholders through buybacks. Hawaiian Holdings has returned more than $218 million to investors since 2015.4. In a bid to expand further, Southwest Airlines announced that it will operate flights to the favorite tourist destination of Hawaii from next year. In order to fulfil its objective, this low-cost carrier intends to shortly commence the process of gaining the necessary approval from the Federal Aviation Administration for operating flights between the mainland and the Hawaiian Islands. In fact, the carrier will release its third-quarter results on Oct 26 and intends to utilize Boeing 737 MAX 8 planes, equipped with all modern facilities, for the new service.5. Alaska Air Group reported a decline in load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) for the month of September. The metric fell to 82.9% from 84.2%, recorded in September 2016 as capacity expansion (10.1%) outpaced traffic growth (8.4%).At the end of the first nine months of 2017, traffic — measured in revenue passenger miles — improved 6.6% year over year to of 39.07 billion while capacity — measured in available seat miles — expanded 6% to 46.17 billion. Load factor stood at 84.6% compared with 84.2% in the first nine months of 2016.6. The Bureau of Transportation Services revealed that average airfares in the United States declined 3.1% from the comparable figure a year ago. Also, the price of air tickets decreased 0.1% (unadjusted) in the same month on a month-on-month basis. The decline was owing to higher capacity in air fares.According to research firm Hopper, air fares (roundtrip) in the United States are likely to decline 1.1% on a month-on-month basis to $208, in October. Domestic capacity is projected to expand 3.4% on a year-over-year basis in the same month.7. Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report) reported a decline in load factor for the month of September.

Load factor stood at 83.7% compared with 85.8% in the first nine months of 2016.The carrier had to cancel 1,650 flights owing to hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria in the third quarter of 2017. Spirit Airlines anticipates total revenue per available seat miles (TRASM: a key measure of unit revenue) in the third quarter to decline approximately 6.5% (the previous guidance had called for a decline in the band of 7% and 8.5%). The brighter view is due improving yields (ticket and non-ticket) and better-than-expected load factor. The low-cost carrier expects its top line to shrink to the tune of approximately $40 million due to the natural calamities and the pilot dispute. Operating margin is expected to be hurt to the tune of approximately 450 basis points. Spirit Airlines now expects third-quarter adjusted cost per available seat miles to be flat to down 1% (the previous guidance had projected the metric to decline between 2% and 3% on a year-over-year basis).Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months.  CompanyPast WeekLast 6 monthsHA-2.9%-19.4%UAL2.6%-3.1%GOL-6.1%47.9%DAL3.6%21.8%JBLU3.1%-2.4%AAL-0.5%25.9%SAVE-5.1%-37.4%LUV0.8%8.4%CPA2%12.9%ALK-0.1%-6.8%                  The table shows that airline stocks exhibited a mixed price performance over the past week leading to the NYSE ARCA Airline Index gaining marginally to $112.12 in the period.

As is the norm, the early earnings reports included those of major banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) and Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report).Again, this current week is going to an extremely busy one with 178 companies, including 53 S&P 500 participants, revealing their Q3 numbers.In fact, the Transportation sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) has seen third-quarter reports from a handful of players. Evidently, airline behemoth Delta Air Lines’ (DAL  -  Free Report) earnings per share and revenues surpassed expectations, despite recent natural calamities. On the flip side, J.B. Hunt Transport Services’ (JBHT  -  Free Report) posted mixed results,  wherein the company reported lower-than-expected earnings per share but better-than-expected revenues.Though too early to reach a definite conclusion about the performance of this sector, it is widely expected that the recent natural calamities (Harvey, Irma, Maria and the earthquake in Mexico) will dent results of the sector participants in Q3.  The latest Earnings Preview too predicts that this widely diversified sector will cut a sorry figure in the quarter under review, with its bottom line contracting 15.5% owing to high costs.Markedly, one of the key components of the transportation sector are railroads. Though things are looking up for the same following improvement in the coal-related scenario and U.S. Presidential election last year, the natural disasters are likely to hurt earnings. These, in turn, have hurt operations at railroads by damaging important rail lines. Also, freight costs have skyrocketed following the natural disasters. With fuel costs on the rise, the bottom line of the same are likely to be hurt in Q3 due to the escalating costs induced by the hurricanes.Given this gloomy backdrop, investors interested in the transportation space will keenly await earnings reports of key railroads companies like CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) and Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (CP  -  Free Report) on Oct 17.According to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase its odds of an earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.CSX Corporation is not expected to report better-than-expected earnings per share in this quarter despite the improvement in coal revenues.The bullish sentiment pertaining to the commodity is reflected by the fact that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter coal revenues is $530 million, much higher than the $501 million expected in the second quarter of 2017.  In fact, this Jacksonville, FL-based company’s intermodal segment is also expected to perform well in the third quarter of 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter intermodal revenues stands at $451 million, again higher than the $446 million expected in the second quarter of 2017. Despite the bullish top-line scenario, the bottom line is expected to be hurt by increased costs induced by the hurricanes. Also, the recent service issues encountered by the company may hurt results.In fact, our proven model too does not conclusively show that CSX is likely to beat earnings estimates in Q3, despite its Zacks Rank #3. This is because the company has an Earnings ESP of -0.88%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Our model did not predict an earnings beat earlier too.

Freight revenues from the grain and potash units should also be impressive in Q3. However, high costs are likely to hurt the bottom line of the Calgary, Canada-based company. Consequently, our proven model too does not show that Canadian Pacific is likely to outperform with respect to the bottom line in Q3, despite its Zacks Rank #3. This is because the company has an Earnings ESP of - 0.66%. This is because the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.31 per share is currently pegged at 2 cents above the Most Accurate estimate.In fact, our model did not predict an earnings beat earlier too.

Several operators also indicated a rise in costs. Plus, fuel price is no longer as low as it was two years back. As per analysts, “a combination of low fuel prices, control of costs, and restrained growth” led leading airlines to score solid earnings in recent times. Now, the gradual retreat of those very factors may bring about pain in the space (read: ETFs in Focus as Oil Breaches $70 Mark).Nevertheless, investors having a strong stomach for oil-related risks and faith in the compelling valuation of airline stocks, may still play the space.

2479,DAL,"Shares of Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report) have lost 33.6% in a year, significantly underperforming the industry’s gain of 9.6%.  Reasons Behind the Price PlungeHigh labor and fuel costs have been hurting the company’s bottom line for quite some time. Notably, the company’s earnings declined 46.8% in the fourth quarter due to steep costs. Moreover, the carrier expects first-quarter 2018 cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel and special items to rise approximately 6% year over year. While the metric for 2018 is predicted to increase around 2.5%. Economic fuel cost per gallon is anticipated to grow 21% in the first quarter of 2018.Passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM: a key measure of unit revenues) also decreased 5.1% year over year. Consequently, such below-par performance of the key metric does not bode well for the company.The company has also been struggling with capacity overexpansion woes. In January, the company reported disappointing traffic results with load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) contracting 230 basis points in the month. This was because of capacity expansion (6.6%) exceeding traffic growth (3.5%).The pessimism surrounding the company is further evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 5.4% downward in the last 30 days. Moreover, the company’s Momentum Score of D also highlights its short-term unattractiveness.Additionally, the company’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) supports our negative stance regarding the stock.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the airline space are Deutsche Lufthansa AG , Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) and Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report). While Deutsche Lufthansa sports a Zacks Rank of 1, Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Shares of Deutsche Lufthansa, Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines have rallied more than 35%, 13% and 12%, respectively, in the last six months.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

2480,DAL," We are at the tail end of 2017 and it can be safely said that low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report) has not had the best of times due to multiple headwinds. The stock has shed 22.4% of its value so far this year, where as its industry has gained 13.2%.Why the Underperformance in 2017In May, Spirit Airlines had to cancel multiple flights owing to a dispute with its pilots, which resulted in customer dissatisfaction. Consequently, the company had to incur significant costs pertaining to passenger re-accommodation and other factors. The increased costs hurt its bottom line appreciably.Apart from Spirit Airlines, the likes of United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report), Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) and American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) have also faced customer-related issues this year.Additionally, Spirit Airlines continues to suffer owing to capacity overexpansion. Evidently, load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) has declined 170 basis points to 83.4% in the first 11 months of the year, due to traffic growth (13.9%) being outpaced by capacity expansion (16.2%). Pricing pressures have also hurt its performance.Moreover, the carrier’s operations were negatively impacted by the back-to-back hurricanes. As a result, Spirit Airlines had to cancel more than 1,650 flights in the third quarter of 2017. In fact, the dispute with its pilots coupled with the affects of hurricanes caused this low-cost carrier’ top line to shrink to the tune of approximately $40 million in the same period. The rising fuel costs have hurt its bottom line as well.  In the final quarter of 2017, high costs are expected to hurt the bottom line. The company's guidance for fourth-quarter total revenue per available seat miles (TRASM: a key measure of unit revenues) is also disappointing. The company expects TRASM for the fourth quarter to decline in the range of 4-6%.Will the Stock Recover in 2018?Spirit Airlines has been making efforts to make a turnaround  going forward.  In 2018, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company expects adjusted unit costs (non-fuel) to decline in the band of 3-5% owing to its prudent cost management initiatives. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Furthermore, the carrier's efforts to modernize its fleet raise optimism. The fleet strength is expected to be 112 by Dec 31 and increase to 122 by 2018-end. The company’s efforts to reward stockholders through share buybacks are impressive as well.In October 2017, the company’s board also authorized a share repurchase program worth up to $100 million in aggregate value. The date of expiration of the authorization is Oct 25, 2018.In addition, Spirit Airlines announced a change at its helm in a bid to improve efficiencies. To this end, it appointed Ted Christie — the company’s current executive vice president and chief financial officer — as the new chief executive officer (CEO). He will succeed Bob Fornaro with effect from Jan 1, 2019. However, before assuming that role, Christie will serve as the president and join the company's board of directors from Jan 1, 2018 onward. He will look into the finance, revenues, operations, IT and human resource functions of the organization.Therefore, it can be safely said that Spirit Airlines is leaving no stone unturned to revive its fortunes.However, only time will tell the extent to which the company is successful in its efforts.

This upside was driven by a 3.9% increase in international RPMs.Consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) also rose 2.9% year over year to 18.91 billion, primarily owing to 4% rise in domestic ASMs. Moreover, load factor improved 40 basis points to 85.4% in the month on the back of traffic growth exceeding capacity expansion.

2482,DAL,"The Sage of Omaha published his annual letter on Feb 24. He remained bullish on U.S. stocks over the long term. After all, stocks have performed better than bonds in the long run. Inflationary pressure is also brewing looming concern. This will affect bonds more than stocks because of their lower returns.Corporate America, in the meantime, has received a massive permanent tax break, which will further boost profits. Changes to the tax law has already provided the much-needed windfall to Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK-B, whose market value rose 21.9% in 2017, edging past the S&P 500’s return of 21.8%.Given the positives, investing in Berkshire’s largest stock holdings seems judicious. These companies have reliable business models that have stood the test of time.Buffett’s Annual Letter to Shareholders: Stay Invested in StocksWorld’s third richest man, Warren Buffett, urged investors to ignore gyrations in the equity market, guidance from market pundits with fancy credentials and resist the temptation to scoop up bonds. He added that investors with long-term goals like pension funds and savings-minded individuals will make a “terrible mistake” if they measure their investment “risk” by their portfolio’s ratio of bonds to stocks.As the investor’s investment horizon increases a diversified portfolio of equities do better than bonds. Lest we forget, the S&P 500 that mirrors a huge cross-section of American businesses has returned an average of 10% per year, while long-term government bonds have returned 5% to 6%.Treasury Yields RiseTreasury yields are scaling record highs after a significant rise in wage growth sparked fears of inflation and led investors to believe that the Federal Reserve will hike rates more times than anticipated.The labor market has come a long way since the Great Recession, with wages growing at the fastest pace in January in more than eight-and-a-half years. Average hourly wages increased 9 cents, or 0.3%, to $26.74. This helped the average year-on-year hourly earnings to rise to 2.9%, the highest since June 2009. Several states have also raised wages. Minimum wage has been raised in 18 states in January, which had a positive impact on 4.5 million workers, per the Economic Policy Institute (read more: Wages See Fastest Growth Since 2009: Top 5 Gainers).Rise in bond yields, in the meantime, might tempt investors to take money away from equities and invest in bonds. But, Buffett cautioned that long-term bonds tend to generate less return than stocks and with rising inflation, bonds can really become a dumb investment. Needless to say, rising inflation erodes the value of the principal on fixed income securities.Buffet Thanks New Tax Code for Big GainsBuffett told investors that Berkshire got a lift from the new tax code. He wrote that Berkshire made a $65.3 billion net gain in 2017, which increased the per-share book value of both Class A and Class B stock by 23%. However, only $36 billion came from the company’s operations. The rest came from the new U.S. tax code, which slashed corporate taxes and in turn boosted profit margins.The House of Representatives passed the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code in 30 years. The headline-grabbing move lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, while any income brought back from overseas is taxed 8% to 15.5%, instead of the current 35% (read more: GOP Passes Landmark Tax Bill: Best & Worst for Stocks).5 of Berkshire’s Largest Stock Holdings to Buy NowAs mentioned above, business magnate Warren Buffet prefers investing in stocks rather than bonds. And why not? Berkshire has registered big gains last year with its stock holdings totaling a solid $170.5 billion in value.

2483,DAL,"The past week, which included a holiday in the form of Presidents' Day, saw the release of data on airfare for January by the Bureau of Transportation Services. Airfares declined in the month, marking the third consecutive month of a drop in ticket prices.Even though, the low air fares are encouraging for fliers, it is likely to hurt the top line of airline companies. Capacity overexpansion by some carriers in key markets leading to intense competition may have resulted in the decline of airfares.On the traffic front, Copa Holdings, S.A. (CPA  -  Free Report) and Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report) unveiled their respective traffic numbers for January. Load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) increased at Copa Holdings for the month. However, the metric declined at Alaska Air Group as capacity expansion exceeded traffic growth.

2485,DAL,"The Thanksgiving holiday period hasn’t been very eventful for the airline space. However, a few developments concerning big names like American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) are worth a mention.In line with the efforts to expand its presence, American Airlines announced its intentions to start operating additional flights to Canada. Also, United Continental’s subsidiary — United Airlines — stated that it performed exceeding well in the Thanksgiving travel week, with respect to many key metrics like on-time performance.Meanwhile, the long-standing dispute between U.S. carriers and their Gulf counterparts got uglier with Etihad reportedly voicing concerns over a provision in the Senate’s tax-reform bill. According to the provision, certain foreign carriers including the likes of Etihad would have to pay U.S. corporate tax under certain conditions.We note that major U.S. carriers like Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report), American Airlines and United Continental had complained to the U.S. administration that the massive subsidies and other benefits enjoyed by the three state-owned carriers — Qatar Airways, Etihad and Emirates — are unfair as they deny a level playing field to the carriers in the United States.Also, according to the Air Travel Consumer Report released by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), service-related complaints from customers in April 2017 were comparatively more than that in April 2016 and March 2017.(Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Nov 22, 2017).Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % ReturnRecap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1. On Nov 16, the $1.5-trillion tax-reform bill was passed by the House Republicans by a vote of 227 to 205. This further threatens to ignite the dispute between U.S. carriers and their Gulf counterparts. A provision, introduced by Johnny Isakson — a senator from Delta’s home state Georgia — might hit the pockets of some foreign carriers hard. According to the proposal, some foreign carriers will have to pay U.S. corporate taxes on their income earned in the United States. However, two conditions need to be fulfilled.  These include the absence of a reciprocal tax agreement between the United States and the country where the foreign carrier is based and second, less frequent flights from the United States to the concerned nation (less than two weekly departures/arrivals by U.S. carriers). In the next few days, the tax cut bill will be debated and voted upon by the full Senate.2. In a bid to expand its operations, American Airlines announced that it intends to add flights to Canada from its hub at Chicago O'Hare International Airport, next year. Toward this end, the carrier aims to start operating daily flights to Vancouver from May 4, 2018.Moreover, flights on a seasonal basis to Calgary are expected to be operational from June 7, 2018. American Airlines also intends to increase frequencies from the U.S. East Coast to Eastern Canada apart from extending seasonal service to popular destinations in Canada. American Airlines carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.3. It hasn’t been a successful 2017 for United Airlines so far due to various issues like the infamous David Dao incident. But, recently the company has something to cheer for. The carrier performed exceedingly well in the Thanksgiving travel week (Nov 19 to Nov 26) smashing various records. For example, with respect to on-time departures the company established a company record of 89.1% on Thanksgiving Day. The next day United Airlines improved the record with the measure rising to 89.8%.4. According to the June Air Travel Consumer Report released by the DOT, the rate of cancelled scheduled domestic flights increased to 1.6% in April 2017 from 0.9% recorded a year ago. The figure, however, compared favorably to the reading of 1.8% in March 2017.According to the report, 78.5% flights operated by U.S. carriers (mentioned in the report) arrived on time in April 2017. This represents a deterioration from the comparable figures of 84.5% a year ago and 79.9% in March. Hawaiian Holdings (HA  -  Free Report) secured the top spot with 88.8% of its flights arriving on time in April. The carrier was followed by United Continental and Alaska Air Group (ALK  -  Free Report).Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last 6 months.  CompanyPast WeekLast 6 monthsHA4.4%-21.1%UAL3.4%-25.9%GOL10.9%92.2%DAL1.5%0.4%JBLU0.7%-12.3%AAL3.9%1%SAVE7.5%-27.9%LUV2.7%-7.4%CPA2.6%21.1%ALK1.4%-22.3%              The table above shows that all airline stocks traded in the green over the past week leading to a 1.7% gain in the NYSE ARCA Airline index to $111.72.

2486,DAL,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Delta Air Lines has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12.2, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 22. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Delta Air Lines’ current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Airlines industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 13.5. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Delta Air Lines has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 9.9, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Delta Air Lines stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Delta Air Lines has a P/S ratio of about 1. This is a bit lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.5x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Delta Air Lines currently has a Value Score of A putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Delta Air Lines a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Delta Air Lines might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of D. This gives DAL a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been pretty discouraging. The current quarter has seen no estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to nine lower, while the full year estimate has seen no upward and 10 downward movements in the same time period.This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 14.6% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has gone down by 3%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Delta Air Lines, Inc. Price and Consensus Delta Air Lines, Inc. Price and Consensus | Delta Air Lines, Inc. QuoteThe bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineDelta Air Lines is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a strong industry rank (Top 30% out of more than 250 industries) further strengthens its growth potential.So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

The top line increased 8.3% from the year-ago figure. Strong demand for air travel during the holiday season aided revenues.During the quarter under review, passenger revenues, cargo revenues and others increased 6.6%, 14.4% and 17.9%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.

In addition, passenger mile yield grew 4.1%.

In the quarter, the company invested $850 million toward aircraft purchases, and upliftment of planes and facilities, among the other factors.

The bottom line, however, decreased 7.3% from 2016 levels due to high costs.

The new tax law, which will reduce its corporate tax rate significantly, is expected to aid the company’s performance.Consequently, Delta lifted its earnings per share guidance for 2018. The company now expects earnings per share in the range of $6.35 to $6.70 (previous outlook: $5.35 to $5.70). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings is pegged at $5.62 per share.The upbeat views and the fourth-quarter outperformance pleased investors.

2488,DAL,"Markets notched up record highs following release of the Federal Open Market Committee minutes on Wednesday. The minutes clearly indicated a rate hike in December. Moreover, the minutes stated that a majority of the Fed officials voted in favor of the rate hike. Meanwhile, the Dow posted an all-time record close, supported by a rally in shares of Johnson and Johnson and McDonald’s.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 22,872.89, gaining 0.2%. The S&P 500 Index (INX) increased 0.2% to close at 2,555.24. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,603.55, increasing 0.3%. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,439 to 1,213. On the Nasdaq, advancers outnumbered decliners by 1,414 to 1,228. The CBOE VIX decreased 0.9% to close at 9.99.Benchmarks Finished at Record HighsThe Dow gathered 42.21 points on Wednesday to notch up an all-time record close. Such gains were buoyed by a rally in shares of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and McDonald’s Corp. (MCD  -  Free Report), which gained 2.8% and 2.6%, respectively. The blue-chip index has advanced 16% so far this year. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The S&P 500 amassed almost 5 points to hit a record close.

The Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE) and the Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLU) advanced 0.6% and 0.4%, respectively.Fed Minutes Confirm Rate Hike in DecemberMinutes of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), released Wednesday confirmed a rate hike in December, the third instance in 2017. Though, the Federal Reserve officials remained largely divided over raising interest rates, majority of the bankers vouched in favor of raising rates. The ones debating against increasing rates reasoned that hiking rates at a time when inflation is lower than the target of 2% — an indication of a healthy economy — might cause major setbacks to the U.S. economy.Such persistent disagreements among the Fed officials make it difficult for the investors to understand how the future of rate hikes would unfold. Meanwhile, a majority of the policymakers opined that the impact which hurricanes Harvey and Irma had on the U.S. economy would likely fade in a short time. Further, they also commented that inflation would soon hit the target rate of 2%.After the meeting ended, the Fed chose to leave the interest rates unchanged in the range of 1% - 1.25% and decided to start unwinding its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. The much anticipated unwinding of the humungous balance sheet of the Fed was announced at the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee last month. The Fed is slated to begin the gradual unwinding process this month and plans to trim assets by $10 billion each month.However, the Fed panel announced one rate hike before 2017 ends and three further hikes in 2018. Experts therefore speculate that this would come in December when Fed meets for the final time before the year ends. Moreover, in a recent speech at Cleveland, Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen cautioned against raising interest rates gradually. She reasoned that this might lead to overheating of the economy and also financial instability. Such claims by Yellen were seconded by Kansas City Fed President Esther George who said that waiting for the inflation rates to hit the 2% level could rather turn out to be a ‘mistake.’Stocks That Made HeadlinesAllegiant Raises Q3 Guidance Despite September Traffic FallAllegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report) has reported traffic numbers for September.

2492,DAL,"Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) announced on Valentine’s Day that the company is set to pay out more than $1 billion in profit sharing to its employees as part of its continued program to spread the wealth. Other U.S. airline firms also joined the party, and at the moment, this trend seems to be a sign of strength and stability in the industry.The Atlanta-based airline company noted that this is the fourth straight year it will share over $1 billion with its employees. Delta boasted that its profit sharing program goes far beyond the recent wave of one-time payments that companies such as Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report) and AT&T (T  -  Free Report) made after the new Republican tax reforms were enacted. The airline also noted that its total annual compensation has increased by 80% since 2008.“Our industry-leading profit sharing and compensation philosophy reflects a decision we made a long time ago to share in the company’s success each year with our people who make it possible,” Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in a statement. “Rather than make a one-off payment like other companies, Delta is invested in highly competitive base pay, an industry-leading annual profit sharing plan, and monthly bonuses each year when the airline performs well.”Delta might be leading the charge to distribute profits across the company, but it is certainly not alone. With that said, let’s take a look at three U.S. airline powers, including Delta, that have been able to share the wealth while maintaining a strong outlook. 1.       Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report)Prior to yesterday’s announcement, Delta employees received $1.1 billion in 2015; $1.5 billion in 2016, which the company cited as the largest corporate profit sharing payout in U.S. history; and another $1.1 billion in 2017. Amid this current tight labor market, Delta’s employee compensation plan could go a long way to securing a strong workforce. The company is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and rocks an overall “B” VGM score, which is supported by its “A” grade for Value in our Style Scores system.Investors should note that we have witnessed 10 upward earnings estimate revisions with 100% agreement to the upside for the company’s fiscal 2018. Based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates, Delta is projected to see its earnings soar by nearly 29% in its current fiscal year. Amid this effort to share the wealth, Delta is also projected to expand its bottom-line at a healthy annualized rate of 11.60% over the next three to five years.2.       Southwest Airlines Company (LUV  -  Free Report)In January, Southwest joined the list of companies that awarded employees bonuses of $1,000. On top of that, the Dallas-based airline announced last week that it would share $543 million through its profit sharing plan, which the company noted is equivalent to more than five weeks of pay. Southwest is currently Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports an overall “A” VGM grade.The low-cost airline giant also looks poised to continue to expand its bottom line, despite its commitments to spend more money on its employees. Our consensus estimate is moving higher on the back of strong analyst revision agreement for the current fiscal year. Southwest is expected to see its earnings surge 32.79% in the current quarter and 42.86% in 2018. Looking further down the road, Southwest is projected to expand its EPS figure at an annualized rate of 11.22% over the next three to five years.3.       American Airlines Group, Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report)This U.S. airline giant is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and boasts an “A” grade for Value and a “B” for Momentum. Like Southwest, American announced that it would pay out $1,000 bonuses to employees, which the company said would cost $130 million. American will also reportedly shell out another $241 million to its employees as part of a profit sharing program.It does not appear that the company’s recent wave of profit sharing will hurt American’s bottom line. The airline firm is expected to see its earnings per share hit $5.80 in 2018, which would mark a nearly 19% increase. Investors should also be aware that American has earned 10 upward earnings estimate revisions with 100% agreement to the upside for 2018, as well as five for the following year.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

2493,DAL,"The U.S. equity market has been on a roller-coaster of late. In fact, Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 1,033 points or 4.2%  on Feb 8. Other major bourses – the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq — also finished in the red on the same day.In fact, this was the second time in a week that the Dow shed over 1,000 points in a day after the 1,175 points decline on Feb 5. Following the latest U.S. sell-off, both the Dow as well as the S&P 500 are officially into the correction territory, down more than 10% from the recent all-time high reached in January.The steep sell-off was due to the stronger-than-expected job addition along with fastest wage growth in more than eight years. These factors, in turn, triggered fears of inflation and bolstered expectations that the Fed could take a more aggressive stance in hiking rates than previously expected.Furthermore, heightened volatility on the back of a significant increase in the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) — Wall Street’s so-called fear gauge — which currently is more than 30 (near the highest level since August 2015) indicates bearish market prospects. Notably, any reading above the 20 mark indicates bearish outlook in the equity market.Given this backdrop, investing in companies that not only pay consistent dividends but also raise the same seem to prudent. This is because such companies are financially stable and mature, and can even generate steady cash flow irrespective of market conditions.Transportation Stocks Riding HighA sector that boasts well-paying stocks in terms of dividends, is the one having transportation stocks. Transports have been having a good time lately after being laid low for most of 2017, due to various headwinds like back-to-back hurricanes, increased costs to name a few.Also, the string of outperformances (in terms of earnings as well as revenues) by the key sector participants like Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report), American Airlines Group and Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC  -  Free Report) in fourth-quarter 2017 bears testimony to the improved scenario surrounding the highly-diversified Zacks Transportation sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors).Factors Behind the ResurgenceRailroads are one of the most important sub-groups in the transportation sector. After facing multiple challenges over the past few years due to coal-related winds, stocks in the space seem to have bounced back on improvements in the coal scenario.Particularly with Donald Trump’s presidency, the coal industry is witnessing better days. In fact, Trump is aiming to revive the industry by relaxing regulations, which were hurting its prospects. Apart from coal, the scenario pertaining to another key source of revenues for railroads — intermodal — has improved by leaps and bounds lately.Airlines — another important sub-group in the broader sector – are also seeing good times now, courtesy of the improved demand for air travel. For 2018, the International Air Transport Association (“IATA”) predicts global net profit of $38.4 billion for the industry. This is much higher than the profitability forecast of $34.5 billion for the current year.Moreover, package delivery companies like FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) and United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) performed well on the back of e-commerce growth in the most recent holiday season. This further highlights the optimism surrounding transports.Trump’s Tax Overhaul — A BoonOn Dec 22, 2017, Trump signed the much-anticipated tax bill into law (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act). Under the $1.5 trillion tax overhaul package, corporate tax rates have been slashed to 21% from 35%. The significant reduction in corporate tax rate is likely to boost cash flow, which in turn will aid earnings of transportation stocks.Apart from the significant drop in corporate tax rate, the new law allows these companies to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income in the year of their occurrence, which was not allowed earlier. This aspect hugely favors transportation stocks as they invest substantially toward capital expenditures. As a result, their annual tax bills would be lowered significantly due to higher deductions.For example, Delta, which expects revenues in 2018 to increase between 4% and 6% on a year-over-year basis lifted its earnings per share guidance anticipating the new tax law to boost its results. The company now expects earnings per share in the range of $6.35 to $6.70 (previous outlook: $5.35 to $5.70).Shareholder-Friendly Activities Likely to Pick Up PaceAs noted above, many stocks in the transportation space reward shareholders through dividend payments and buybacks. For example, United Continental Holdings — a key transportation player — announced a new buyback program late last year. Moreover, the likes of Delta and Kansas City Southern hiked their quarterly dividend payouts in 2017.Following the new tax law, we expect an increase in these shareholder-friendly activities from various transportation companies. Due to the significant reduction in their tax bills, more cash is expected to remain in the hands of these companies to fund their capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases among others.Dividend Paying Transports — A Prudent ChoiceIn view of the above-mentioned tailwinds, we believe that stocks from the transportation space should be in one’s portfolio. Moreover, picking dividend stocks seems prudent during uncertain times like the current scenario.Consequently, we have zeroed in on five stocks in this high flying space, which have a strong dividend paying history. Also, these companies have raised their dividend payouts recently. All the chosen stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Our first choice is, UPS, the world's largest express carrier. Markedly, UPS provides specialized transportation and logistics services in the United States and internationally. UPS’ board of directors cleared an approximately 10% hike in its quarterly dividend to 91 cents per share ($3.64 annually) on Feb 8. The first installment of the new dividend will be paid on Mar 7, 2018 to the stockholders of record on Feb 20.The raised dividend highlights UPS’ commitment to create value for shareholders and underscores the company’s strong financial condition as well as bright prospects, going forward.Also, it has an impressive record with respect to dividends. The company has been rewarding shareholders with cash dividends regularly since 1969 and has more than quadrupled its dividend payout since it went public in 1999.Furthermore, the company’s Momentum Score of A highlights its short-term attractiveness. Notably, the Zacks Momentum Style Score indicates when the timing is right to grab a stock and make the most of its momentum.Our next choice is Union Pacific Corp. (UNP  -  Free Report), which provides rail transportation services across 23 states in the United States through its principal operating company, Union Pacific Railroad Company.On Feb 8, this railroad operator’s board of directors a 10% hike in its quarterly dividend payout to 73 cents per share (annualized $2.92 per share). The first installment of the raised dividend will be paid on Mar 30, 2018 to shareholders as of Feb 28.In fact, this is the company’s second dividend hike in three months.  In November 2017, the company had announced a 10% hike in its quarterly dividend payout to 66.5 cents per share. We believe that two dividend hikes in such a short span reflect the increased financial prosperity following the introduction of the new tax law.Additionally, the company has an impressive dividend history having rewarded shareholders through dividends for 119 consecutive years.The next member in our list is also a railroad operator — Norfolk Southern.  Last month, the company's board of directors increased its quarterly dividend to 72 cents per share (annualized $2.88 per share) from 61 cents per share (annualized $2.44 per share). The first instalment of the new dividend is payable Mar 10, 2018 to shareholders of record on Feb 2.Moreover, it has an impressive record with respect to dividends. The company has paid dividends for 142 consecutive quarters, since inception in 1982.GATX Corporation (GATX  -  Free Report) is our next choice. This leading global railcar lessor specializes in railcar and locomotive operating leasing, aircraft operating leasing, information technology leasing, and venture finance for customers in diverse industrial sectors worldwide.On Jan 26, 2018, the company’s board of directors cleared a 5% hike in its quarterly dividend to 44 cents per share ($1.76 annually). The first instalment of the new dividend is payable Mar 31, 2018 to shareholders of record on Mar 5.Also, it has an impressive record with respect to dividends. It has been paying dividends regularly since 1919. Furthermore, the company’s Momentum Score of B highlights its short-term attractiveness.The final member in our list is trucking company J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT  -  Free Report). On Jan 24, 2018, the company’s board of directors cleared an approximately 4.3% hike in its quarterly dividend to 24 cents per share (96 cents annually). The first installment of the new dividend is payable  Feb 23, 2018 to shareholders of record on Feb 9.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

2494,DAL,"Stocks in the airline space faced multiple challenges in the first three quarters of 2017. The space was hit by disruptions from back-to-back hurricanes, the devastating earthquake in Mexico and high costs.Evidently, the Zacks Airline Industry had underperformed the S&P 500 Index in the first nine months of the current year. While the S&P 500 index gained 11.9%, the industry rallied 8.8%.Turbulent Q3 for AirlinesThe third quarter of 2017 was a huge victim of the difficulties facing airlines. However, major companies like Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report), Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report) and United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected earnings per share in the quarter. The outperformance with respect to the bottom line can be mainly attributed to reduced expectations.All the above-mentioned companies carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Earnings per share, however, decreased on a year-over-year basis due to higher costs. While the bottom line fell 7.6% and 5.4% at Delta and Southwest Airlines, respectively, at United Continental the metric was down 28.6%. American Airlines too reported a significant reduction in earnings in the quarter.Also, multiple flight cancellations as well as continued soft demand for air travel to and from the affected areas due to the recent natural calamities hurt third-quarter results. For example, United Continental’s pre-tax income was hurt to the tune of approximately $185 million.Brighter Q4 Awaits Airlines?The worst seems to be over for airline stocks as its operations are back to normal. This is evident from Delta’s bullish view for the final quarter of 2017 particularly on passenger revenues per available seat miles (PRASM: a key measure for unit revenues). In fact, this airline behemoth expects the metric to increase in the band of 2% to 4% (on a year-over-year basis) in the same period. The projection compares favorably with the 1.9% increase in PRASM recorded in the third quarter.At American Airlines, total revenue per available seat miles (TRASM) improved only 1.1% in the third quarter of 2017. However, the fourth-quarter TRASM view is much brighter. The metric is expected to increase between 2.5% and 4.5% in the final quarter of 2017.Based on the bullish views, we expect airlines to perform better in the final quarter compared with the turbulent third quarter. Notably, strong demand for air travel backed by cheap ticket prices are expected to support the sector participants.Will Airlines Stocks Fly High on Thanksgiving Holiday Period?The resurgence of the key players in the airline space is evident from the bullish outlook provided by the Airlines for America (“A4A”) in the ongoing Thanksgiving holiday period (Nov 17–Nov 28).Per the guidance, approximately 28.5 million passengers are expected to avail the U.S. airlines’ services in the current holiday period this year, up 3% year over year. The forecast translates into 2.38 million fliers per day during the period, which is an increase of 69,000 from the comparable figure last year.Passenger volumes (on a daily basis) is projected to be in the range of 1.61 million to 2.88 million. The bullish forecast was primarily owing to cheap ticket prices. Consequently, the carriers had to add more seats to meet the surge in demand.Factors Supporting Turnaround in the Airlines SpaceAn improving economy, a much-improved job market and rising disposable income have been a blessing for the sector participants. Also, consumer confidence remains strong resulting in more Americans going on vacations.Despite the recent rally, oil prices are still hovering around the $58 a barrel, a long way off the highs of mid-2014 when the commodity had traded in excess of $100 a barrel. As fuel costs represent one of the largest input costs for airline companies, the lower the oil prices, the better it is for sector participants. In fact, lower oil prices imply greater financial well-being for airlines by virtue of massive savings.Moreover, a hike in dividend payouts this year by Southwest Airlines and Delta Air reflects financial prosperity in the airline space. In addition, Hawaiian Holdings’ (HA  -  Free Report) recent decision to reward shareholders with dividend payments is indicative of strong financial health.Impressive Stock Price performance so far in Q4Shares of JetBlue Airways (JBLU  -  Free Report), Delta and American Airlines are up 7.1%, 3.9% and 2.2%, respectively, on a quarter-to-date basis. This reflects that things are looking up for airlines.Also, the Zacks Airline industry has outperformed the S&P 500 Index on a quarter-to-date basis. While the industry rallied 4.5%, the S&P 500 Index has gained 3.6% in the same period.Improving Zacks Industry RankThe Zacks Industry rank of 87 carried by the 26-member Zacks Airline Industry also highlights the fact that airline stocks are back in favor. The favorable rank places the industry in the top 34% of the 250+ groups enlisted. The bullish stance on the industry is further augmented by the fact there have been 12 positive estimate revisions in the fourth quarter of 2017.The improving scenario for the airline space can be well gauged from the fact that the Zacks Industry Rank has improved immensely, given the industry’s 200+ rank only a few months ago. Valuation Signals More UpsideGoing by the EV-to-EBITDA (enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) ratio, which is often used to value airline stocks, given their significant debt levels and high depreciation and amortization expenses, the industry doesn’t look expensive at this point. The industry currently has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 8.1, which is favorable compared to what the industry saw in the last year. The ratio is below the high end of 8.5 during the period.Additionally, the reading compares favorably with the market at large, as the current EV/EBITDA for the S&P 500 is at 11.3. The industry’s favorable positioning compared with the overall market certainly signals more upside.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

2497,DAL,"Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 11, before the market opens.The carrier’s earnings as well as revenues surpassed expectations in the third quarter despite the natural calamities. However, the bottom line declined 7.6% on a year-over-year basis due to higher costs. While the top line increased 5.5% from the year-ago figure.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this earnings.Factors Likely at PlayLike the previous quarter, high costs are anticipated to hurt Delta’s bottom line in the fourth quarter too. Additionally, the recent power outage at the Atlanta airport has led to approximately 1,400 flight cancellations and is estimated to have affected the carrier’s pre-tax income to the tune of $25-50 million in the to-be-reported quarter. Moreover, the company has increased guidance for fourth-quarter costs due to the power crisis as well as some other factors.The Atlanta, GA-based company now anticipates fourth-quarter non-fuel unit costs including profit sharing to be up approximately 5.5% (previous view was in the range of 5-5.5%). The carrier expects fuel price per gallon for the concluding quarter of 2017 between $1.92 and $1.97 including taxes and refinery impact.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter Average fuel price per gallon, net of hedging (mainline) stands at $1.89, substantially higher than the year-ago reported value of $1.60. Moreover, due to high fuel costs, the company expects operating margin for the fourth quarter to be approximately 11%, the lowest point in its initially guided range of 11-13%. Additionally, system capacity for the period is projected to expand 2.3%.However, the airline has been seeing rising revenue trends in the final quarter. The carrier forecasts the metric to rise approximately 4% in the final quarter of 2017, higher than the 1.9% growth witnessed in the third quarter. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) stands at 14.04 cents, higher than the year-ago reported value of 13.58 cents.The carrier is anticipated to take a one-time charge of $150-$200 million in the to-be-reported quarter on account of the newly initiated tax law.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show conclusively that Delta is likely to beat estimates in fourth-quarter 2017. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as highlighted below.Zacks ESP: Delta has an Earnings ESP of -0.71% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 89 cents per share, marginally lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 90 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Delta carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about a possible earnings surprise. Hence, a negative ESP leaves our surprise prediction inconclusive.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the stock is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Delta Air Lines, Inc.

Make sure to keep an eye on these companies as they prepare to report during the week of January 8.1.       Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report)Domestic carrier giant Delta Air Lines is set to report its latest quarterly results before the market opens on January 11. Shares of the company have surged about 5% over the last four weeks, and the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) into its report date. Nevertheless, Delta warned investors about a decrease in December traffic earlier this week.Based on our consensus estimates, Delta is expected to report earnings of 90 cents per share and revenues of $10.17 billion. These results would represent year-over-year growth of 9.8% and 7.5%, respectively. The company has also recently raised its guidance for Q4 costs, thanks in part to a recent severe power outage in the Atlanta airport. 2.       JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report)Banking behemoth JPMorgan Chase is scheduled to release its new quarterly earnings report before the bell on January 12. JPM has move just about 4% higher over the last four weeks, and the stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). However, due to the new tax laws effect on deferred tax assets and foreign earnings, big banks like JPMorgan have cautioned investors about large one-time fees in the quarter.According to our latest consensus estimates, JPM is expected to post earnings of $1.69 per share, which represent a slump of about 1.2% year-over-year. Revenues are projected to be $24.99 billion, up about 6.9%. Still, JPMorgan expects to take a roughly $2 billion hit thanks to the aforementioned tax changes (also read: Q4 Bank Earnings Will be Messy & Noisy). 3.       Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report)Consumer banking giant Wells Fargo is also slated to report its latest quarterly results before the market opens on January 12. Having bounced back from its massive fraudulent account scandal, shares of WFC have gained about 13% over the past 12 weeks and 5% within the past month. The stock is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Based on the latest consensus estimates, Wells Fargo is expected to report earnings of $1.04 per share and revenues of $22.43 billion, which would represent year-over-year growth of 1.0% and 3.9%, respectively. It is also worth noting that Wells Fargo’s focus on domestic consumer banking should protect it from the new one-time tax fees in comparison to its industry peers. Want more stock market analysis from this author?

2500,DAL,"Gogo Inc. (GOGO  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has installed 110 2Ku’s – its in-flight connectivity service – in third-quarter 2017.  Reportedly, as of Sep 30, 2017, the company installed 2Ku service in 340 aircrafts.In its last conference call, Gogo had targeted 2Ku installations in 450–550 aircraft, including approximately 150 in Commercial Aviation – Rest of World (CA-ROW) in fiscal 2017. The company also stated that it launched 2Ku service on five new airlines in the quarter.As previously anticipated the company has been successful in accelerating 2Ku installation post Labor Day (Sep 4). John Wade, Gogo’s Executive Vice President and COO, believes that the company is well poised to “nearly double the number of 2Ku installations in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter.""Buoyed by the encouraging numbers (including the current installations), Gogo is now projected to install 2Ku service in about 600 aircrafts of 10 airlines by the year end.Notably, shares have gained 27% year to date, substantially outperforming the industry’s 8.9% decline.2Ku Installations – Key CatalystGogo’s Business Aviation (BA  -  Free Report) business has been instrumental in driving the company’s top line. In the last reported quarter, BA service revenues grew 30% year over year to $42.2 million. The results encouraged the company to reaffirm its outlook for 2017 wherein revenues are projected to be in the range of $670–$695 million.We note that Gogo’s 2Ku service has been its chief growth driver. Lower bandwidth cost structure coupled with faster installation rate is helping the company to gain traction in the market.The company has regulatory approval to install the service onboard majority of the important aircrafts. Last month, the company announced receiving an approval to install 2Ku on Boeing Inc’s (BA  -  Free Report) 777 aircraft and expects Boeing 767 aircraft to be included in the list by this year end.In August, the company’s 2Ku solution was selected by Alaska Airlines for its entire Boeing and Airbus Fleet. In the same month, Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) became the first customer to install the service on Airbus A350.The company is also expanding overseas with the addition of K5-Aviation as its first 2Ku business aviation customer in Europe.

Spirit Airlines’ fourth-quarter earnings (excluding $2.90 from non-recurring items) came in at 73 cents per share, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 71 cents per share. However, quarterly earnings were down 5.2% year over year. Increased labor and fuel costs contributed to the year-over-year decline.The carrier generated operating revenues of $667 million in the quarter. A 10.4% increase in flight volume contributed to the top line expanding 15.3% on a year-over-year basis.In the reported quarter, total revenue per available seat mile improved 17.9% year over year. Load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) increased to 81.6% from 81.4% in the year-ago quarter. The upside was owing to traffic growth outpacing capacity expansion (17.6%) in the quarter. On the contrary, total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM: a key measure of unit revenue) declined 1.8% year over year due to the 2.2% reduction in operating yields. Adjusted cost per available seat mile (CASM), excluding special items and fuel, also decreased 4.4%.Spirit Airlines expects TRASM to decline between 1% and 2.5% for the first quarter of 2018.

Consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) inched up 1.8% to 19.62 billion on a year-over-year basis. On the flip side, consolidated load factor fell 150 basis points to 79.7%. This is because capacity expanded while traffic remained flat, leading to vacant seats on planes (Read more: Delta Dips on Disappointing January Traffic Statistics).5. Hawaiian Airlines posted impressive traffic numbers in January. RPMs came in at 1.37 billion, up 2.6% on a year-over-year basis. Additionally, consolidated capacity inched up 2.3% to 1.63 billion.

2503,DAL,"It is a well-known fact that companies in the airline space have been facing challenges due to multiple headwinds. Stocks in this space have been hurt by high costs (labor and fuel), disruptions caused by the recent hurricanes, capacity overexpansion, among others.Evidently, United Continental Holdings’ (UAL  -  Free Report) third-quarter pre-tax income was affected to the tune of approximately $185 million due to the storms. As a result, the company cancelled 8,300 flights in the same period.Additionally, the massacre (described as the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history) in Las Vegas on Oct 1, 2017, pushed back airline stocks, particularly those with exposure to Las Vegas’ McCarran International Airport. For instance, bookings at Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report) for the fourth quarter have been hurt. The company now expects total revenue per available seat miles (TRASM) to decline between 0.5% and 3% mainly due to Irma and the Las Vegas mass shooting incident.In view of the above struggles, it is of little surprise that the Zacks Airline industry has underperformed the broader market year to date. While the S&P 500 Index gained 15.6%, the industry rallied 11.4%.Warren Buffett Still Rooting for Airlines – A Positive SignDespite the sector’s recent struggles, Warren Buffett — one of the most revered investors of all time — still continues to support the airline stocks. According to a third-quarter filing by Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett still has stakes in American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report), Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) and United Continental. Initially Buffett had shown interest in the sector last year, after staying away from it for a long time. In fact, his last investment in airlines was in the 1980s.Buffett’s investing style has always remained simple: buy shares in great companies and hold them for a significant period of time. These companies have reliable business models that have stood the test of time.As one of the greatest investors ever is still showing faith in airlines despite the recent turbulence, it is obvious that airline companies fit into his scheme of long-term sustainability. Therefore, it can be safely concluded that all is not lost for the sector and one should remain focused on them.Dividend-Paying Stocks to the RescueCompanies with strong fundamentals are generally payers of dividends. Such companies are financially stable and mature and can even generate steady cash flow irrespective of market and sector conditions.In fact, dividend stocks are a safe bet to create wealth as the payouts generally act as a hedge against uncertainty and simultaneously provide downside protection by offering sizable yields on a regular basis.Three Airline Stocks in FocusIn view of the virtues associated with dividend paying companies, we have zeroed in on three airline stocks, which have a strong dividend paying history. Also, they have raised their dividend payouts in the last 12 months.Delta Air Lines is a leading provider of scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo in the United States and around the world. The company, based in Atlanta, GA, currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and has a Value Score of A. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The company has a dividend yield of 2.45%. Also, Delta has been consistently rewarding its shareholders through dividends since 2013. Notably, it has hiked dividend pay-outs significantly for four consecutive years since then. The latest hike was announced in May 2017, when the company’s board of directors approved a 50.6% dividend hike in its quarterly cash dividend to 30.5 cents per share.Southwest Airlines with a Zacks Rank #3, is based in Dallas, TX. In May 2017, this low-cost carrier raised its cash quarterly dividend to 12.5 cents per share, reflecting an increase of 25% over the previous quarterly payout of 10 cents per share. The company has a dividend yield of 0.91%. Moreover, its past records substantiate the fact that Southwest Airlines has a stable dividend payment history. The company with a Value Score of B, has made dividend payments for more than 160 consecutive quarters.SkyWest Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report) operates a regional airline in the United States through its subsidiaries. The company has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a Value Score of B. The carrier, with a dividend yield of 0.64%, has paid dividends for more than 80 quarters in succession. In February 2017, the company’s board of directors approved a 60% dividend hike in its quarterly cash dividend to 8 cents per share.Zacks' Hidden TradesWhile we share many recommendations and ideas with the public, certain moves are hidden from everyone but selected members of our portfolio services.

2504,DAL,"In quarters past, we in the world of finance reporting would be sounding the trumpets for the ushering in of a new Earnings Season, which was to commence with aluminum giant Alcoa’s (AA  -  Free Report) report after the closing bell with Monday or Tuesday of a week just like this. But really, this was always just a convenient formality that didn’t have much integral meaning to earnings season as a whole nor the general domestic and global economies they help illustrate. If you want to get an early foothold on the global marketplace, for instance, you’d do better to focus on FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) numbers (which happened to miss consensus estimates by 20% in its fiscal Q1 2018 report a few weeks ago).That said, if you are interested in the lion’s share of data related to quarterly gains from the finance sector, then you have indeed found the right week. By this time Thursday morning, we will have seen Q3 earnings results from JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report). By the opening bell this Friday, we’ll also see Q3 reports from Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) and PNC (PNC  -  Free Report). Major banks represent nearly half the total earnings for the finance sector, which is why we can make informed projections about whether or not we’re looking at a strong quarter or not just by tracking these large U.S. banks.Bank stocks did not impress the market in Q2. Yet in the past month — the direct run-up to Q3 earnings season — banks are up 8%, according to Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian. Anticipation of a generous tax reform (tax cut) policy, plus a strong likelihood of a December interest rate hike from the Fed, helped bolster stock prices. But would disappointing earnings and revenue results start a pullback from record highs, not just among companies in the finance sector but across the board? After all, what industries can claim they have no involvement with the biggest Wall Street banks?Consider also that Q3 reports for the banks will not have any actualized data related to tax policy or a higher interest rate, thus they will not appear on the books this quarter. The good news is yearly comps should be beatable, so expectations of a lousy quarter are not warranted at this stage. For a comprehensive report on this week’s coming earnings reports, please read Sheraz’s latest Earnings Preview: Are Bank Stock Gains Sustainable?Aside from the big banks, we also look for earnings data Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) on Wednesday morning and Domino’s Pizza (DPZ  -  Free Report) on Thursday. So while the frequency of new reports will be milder than we will see in the coming next few weeks, we will hear from several heavy hitters representing different sectors.In the meantime, will stock indexes keep their brave chin pointed forward to new record highs? If this week’s reporting companies all beat estimates and raise guidance, how much higher can we expect markets to rise?It should be fun. Futures this Monday morning are all up a half-hour before regular-day trading begins.

2505,DAL,"The Q4 earnings season is picking up pace with multiple companies reporting earnings each passing day. According to the latest Earnings Preview, 81 S&P 500 companies will release quarterly numbers during the course of this week .Per the report, the entire S&P 500 fraternity is projected to end the Q4 reporting cycle with bottom-line growth of 10.3% on a year-over-year basis. The same set of companies is projected to witness top-line growth to the tune of 7.1%. These projections compare favorably with the readings in Q3, when revenues increased 5.9% and earnings improved 6.7%.In fact, of the 16 Zacks sectors, 14 are anticipated to end the reporting cycle with earnings growth, one being the widely-diversified Zacks Transportation sector. The bottom line for this sector is projected to increase 1.6% compared with the year-over-year decline of 13.9% in preceding quarter.Will Airlines Fly High in Q4?Given that the airline stocks form an integral part of the transportation sector, it is needless to say that companies in this space share the buoyant picture of the broader sector. Notably, the better-than-expected results reported by the likes of Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) in Q4 highlight the air of optimism surrounding airlines.The improved unit revenue scenario bodes well for airline stocks as they seem to be back in favor post hurricanes. Evidently, the likes of American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) and JetBlue Airways (JBLU  -  Free Report) have issued improved Q4 projections with respect to the metric, which measures sales relative to capacity for a carrier.The favorable scenario supports the bullish Zacks Industry Rank of 87 (out of 250 plus groups) carried by the Zacks Airline industry. This rank places the companies within the top 34% of the Zacks industries.Buoyed by the bullish sentiment surrounding the airline stocks, interested investors keenly await Q4 reports from key sector participants like Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report), American Airlines and Alaska Air Group (ALK  -  Free Report) on Jan 25.According to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase its odds of an earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.In the quarter to be reported, we expect high costs to hurt the bottom line of Dallas-based Southwest Airlines, similar to the previous quarter. Unit costs (excluding fuel and oil expenses, special items and profit-sharing expenses) are expected to be flat to up 1.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average fuel cost per gallon is pegged at $2.12, higher than $2 in the third quarter.In fact, our proven model too does not conclusively show that Southwest Airlines is likely to beat earnings estimates in Q4. This is because the company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% (as the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 76 cents per share is in line with the Most Accurate estimate) and a Zacks Rank #3 (Read more: Can Southwest Airlines Pull a Surprise in Q4 Earnings?).Southwest Airlines Company Price and EPS Surprise  Southwest Airlines Company Price and EPS Surprise | Southwest Airlines Company Quote You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The next company, American Airlines, is headquartered in Fort Worth, TX. It operates more than 6,700 daily flights to over 330 destinations in more than 50 nations across the globe. The carrier’s Q4 results are likely to be aided by higher passenger revenues. However, higher costs are expected to limit bottom-line growth.In fact, our proven model too does not conclusively show that American Airlines is likely to beat earnings estimates in the soon-to-be reported quarter. This is because the company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% ( as the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 92 cents per share is in line with the Most Accurate estimate) and a Zacks Rank #3 (Read more: American Airlines Q4 Earnings: What's in the Cards?).American Airlines Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  American Airlines Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | American Airlines Group, Inc. Quote Also, the Seattle, WA-based Alaska Air Group is anticipated to be hurt by high costs in Q4 like the previous one. As a result, the company expects non-fuel unit costs to be in the range of 8.65 cents to 8.67 cents much higher than 8.45 cents in the year-ago quarter. The increased projection can be attributed to the costs associated with the pay-related deal inked with its pilots.Increased in fuel costs are likely to pressurize the bottom line as well. Our proven model too does not conclusively show that Alaska Air Group is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because the company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% (as the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 83 cents per share is in line with the Most Accurate estimate) and a Zacks Rank #3 (Read more: Alaska Air Group Q4 Earnings: What's in the Offing?).Alaska Air Group, Inc.

2506,DAL,"United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected earnings and revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017. The company’s earnings (excluding 59 cents from non-recurring items) came in at $1.40 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.34. The bottom line was however, 21.4% lower than the year-ago figure due to higher costs.Operating revenues of $9,438 million in the fourth quarter were also ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9,427.9 million.

Cargo revenues increased 21.6% and other revenues grew 1.2% in the said time frame. Higher international freight volumes and yields boosted cargo revenues in the quarter.During the reported quarter, airline traffic measured in revenue passenger miles, improved 3.1% year over year on a consolidated basis. Capacity (or available seat miles) rose 4%. Load factor (percentage of seat occupancy) declined 70 basis points to 81.7% as capacity expansion outpaced traffic growth.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Expansion and Fleet Upgrade Efforts in 2017The company, constantly looking to grow and upgrade its fleet, made a substantial progress in expansion and fleet upgrade during 2017. The company announced 44 new domestic routes from seven of its mainland hubs and increased frequency on 11 routes to the Hawaiian Islands. Additionally, the carrier announced 13 new global routes last year.During the same period, the airline took delivery of 19 Boeing aircrafts, including 12 777-300ER, three 787-9 and four 737-800. Also, eight used Airbus aircrafts including two A320 and six A319 were purchased by the company.The carrier has also announced an agreement with Airbus for changes in its A350 order. The contract calls for conversion of the model type from A350-1000 to A350-900, an increase in the order size from 35 to 45 aircrafts and a postponement of the first delivery to 2022. On another agreement announced with Boeing, the company wishes to convert 100 of its existing 737 MAX orders into 737 MAX 10 aircrafts, beginning late 2020.Q118 GuidanceFor the first quarter of 2018, the carrier anticipates capacity to expand between 3.5% and 4.5%. Pre-tax margin (adjusted) is expected to be flat year over year. First-quarter consolidated passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) is predicted to be flat to up 2% year over year. Consolidated cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding third-party business expenses, fuel & profit sharing is estimated in the range of flat to up 1% in the first quarter. While first-quarter consolidated average aircraft fuel price per gallon is predicted at approximately $2.11. Additionally, Effective Income Tax Rate in the first quarter is expected between 22% and 24%.2018 OutlookFor 2018, the company expects capacity to augment between 4% and 6% year over year. Moreover, a similar growth in the metric is forecast in 2019 and 2020. The carrier’s move to inflate capacity in 2018 has not gone down too well with investors. Consequently, shares of the company were down 6.4% in after-hours trading on Jan 23.Notably, the airline’s move seems prudent as it aims to compete with low-cost carriers. However, it remains to be seen how the low fares affect the company’s bottom line going forward. The move also led to share price decline of other airline heavyweights like Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) and American Airlines (AAL  -  Free Report) in after market.Additionally, the company expects 2018 earnings per share between $6.50 and $8.50, while capex is anticipated in the range of $3.6 billion-$3.8 billion.Benefits of the Tax ReformThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, put into effect on Dec 22, 2017, is expected to reduce the company’s federal income tax liability this year onward. Notably, the new tax law lowers corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%. For 2018, the company projects a tax rate of around 22-24%. Net operating loss carry forwards are anticipated to offset the company’s taxable income and no cash taxes are likely to be paid in 2018.Upcoming ReleaseInvestors interested in the airline space now keenly await fourth-quarter earnings report of Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report), scheduled to be out on Jan 25.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

2507,DAL,"Airline operations were severely disrupted on Jan 4 as Winter Storm Grayson wreaked havoc. The storm has battered the East Coast, causing heavy snowfall accompanied by wind gusts in excess of 50 mph in the affected areas.Flight Cancellations MountWith the storm disrupting normal life, it is of little wonder that travel plans were thrown haywire as major airline operators had to cancel multiple flights. The severity of the storm can be realized from the fact that the U.S. carriers cancelled more than 4,000 flights, yesterday. Cancellations on Thursday hit operations severely at major airports in Boston, Newark and the New York City.We note that operations at United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) — the parent company of United Airlines — were hit the hardest among legacy carriers as Newark is a major hub for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. This Chicago-based carrier had to call off more than 560 flights on Jan 4 due to the Grayson-induced disruptions. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other airline players like American Airlines (AAL  -  Free Report), Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report), JetBlue Airways (JBLU  -  Free Report), Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report) and Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) were not spared of the miseries either and had to call of multiple flights resulting in significant loss of revenues.Apart from the cancellations, many flights were delayed causing harassments to passengers. In fact, operations were temporarily suspended at New York's Kennedy International airport due to the recent natural calamity. With high costs (labor plus fuel) impeding bottom-line growth of carriers, multiple flight cancellations caused by Grayson has hurt their top lines. Woes to ContinueWhat is worse is that the woes are likely to continue for the next few days as well, resulting in more flight cancellations and revenue losses for airline operators. In fact, more than 1,000 flights into/out of the United States are expected to be cancelled today.In fact, icy cold wind is expected to blow over the weekend in the affected areas confining people to their homes and disrupting travel plans. Apart from the damaging winds, severe power outages are anticipated in some areas along the East Coast.To compensate for the harassment of passengers, who had planned to travel in the affected period, most carriers including United Continental, American Airlines and Alaska Air Group (ALK  -  Free Report) are offering travel waivers for the concerned passengers. Natural Calamities Hurt Airlines SignificantlyThis is not the first time that the sector participants have been laid low by a winter storm. Earlier, such acts of nature have thrown the schedules of carriers out of gear, causing multiple flight cancellations.The back-to-back hurricanes (Harvey, Irma and Maria) dented airline operations significantly, hurting results in the third quarter of 2017. Prior to that, winter storm Stella had crippled airline operations considerably by impeding travel. In 2016, Hurricane Matthew had spelt doom for airlines, causing extensive damage. Will Grayson Dampen Airlines Recovery?The emergence of Grayson comes at a time when things are looking up for airline stocks after being laid low for most part of 2017. Moreover, the new tax law is expected to be a godsend for airlines.The bullish scenario is reflected in the fact that the Zacks Airline industry has outperformed the S&P 500 Index over the last three months. The industry has rallied 8.7% compared with the S&P 500’s 6.8% gain in the same period.Given this backdrop, it remains to be seen whether winter storm Grayson hurts revenues significantly and spoils the results of the affected carriers in the first quarter of 2018. Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This Stock Full disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

2508,DAL,"Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) has struggled so far this year in the face of multiple headwinds including the back-to-back natural calamities (Harvey, Irma and Maria). So far this year, the stock has gained 4.2%, underperforming the 8.8% rally of the industry it belongs to.However, the trading session on Oct 3, 2017 reinstated investors’ optimism on the airline behemoth as the stock gained 6.6% to close the trading session at $51.25.Reasons Behind the Surge Delta stated that it expects passenger unit revenue to increase approximately 2% in the third quarter of 2017 on a year-over-year basis. The guidance includes a negative impact of Irma to the tune of 1 point. Operating margin for the third quarter is projected between 15.5% and 16.5%. Hurricane Irma is likely to impact pre-tax income to the tune of approximately 120 million.In September 2017, Delta had projected passenger unit revenue to grow between 2% and 3% and operating margin was forecasted in the 16.5%-17.5% range. Notably, these projections were made before Irma disrupted its operations leading to 2,200 flights cancellations at Delta.Consequently, the fresh projections, though numerically weaker than the previous ones, pleased investors as the impact of Irma on the company’s financials was softer than expected. This, in turn, led to the surge in the stock price.Fuel price per gallon in the third quarter of 2017 is expected between $1.68 and $1.73. Non- fuel nit cost (including profit sharing) is projected to grow at approximately 2.5% on a year-over-year basis. System capacity is projected to improve 1.6%.The stock price appreciation was not limited to Delta only. Other carriers like American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) and JetBlue Airways (JBLU  -  Free Report) were also boosted by Delta’s projections and saw significant increase in their respective stock prices. Investors interested in these carriers must be hoping that the impact of Irma would be less severe than expected on them similar to Delta.Traffic ResultsDelta unveiled the improved projections while releasing its traffic data for the month of September. While traffic (total system) increased 0.3% year over year, capacity expanded 0.6% for the same month. Nevertheless, load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) declined 20 basis points to 84.4% as traffic growth was outpaced by capacity expansion in the same period.On a year-to-date basis, traffic improved 2.1% while capacity expanded 0.6%. Load factor improved 130 basis points to 85.7%.Zacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderDelta carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

2510,DAL,"Embraer SA (ERJ  -  Free Report) recently won a firm order from SkyWest Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report), the holding company of SkyWest Airlines and ExpressJet Airlines, for delivering 20 E175 jets.Order DetailsAt current list prices, the order is estimated to be valued at $914 million, which will be added to Embraer’s third-quarter 2017 backlog.The order includes 15 E175 SC (Special Configuration) aircraft in a 70-seat configuration. The E175 SC aircraft has an E175 airframe that can be retrofitted to 76 seats going forward. Additionally, it comprises order for five E175s, in a 76-seat configuration similar to the aircraft that SkyWest had ordered earlier.The transaction will take the total number of E175 jets booked by SkyWest in 2017 to 45. Notably the airliner had ordered 25 new jets from Embraer in September. The payment for all 45 aircraft will be made using $161 million in cash and the balance in debt. While delivery of the E175s is expected in between September and early 2018, the E175 SCs are expected to be delivered in the next year.Markedly, SkyWest Airlines will operate the E175s for Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report) and the E175-SCs for Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report).A Brief Note on E175 JetsThe E175 jets have a 76-seat dual class pattern, including 12 First Class seats, 16 Economy Plus seats and 48 Economy seats.The E175 jet also features a wingtip for enhanced aerodynamic performance. Moreover, this new fleet of the model is 6.4% more fuel efficient than the first-generation E175s. Over the last few years, Embraer has been able to grab the lion’s share of 80% of orders for airplanes in its class from airline companies in the United States.Our ViewWe note that Embraer is the only company that manufactures a family of four airplanes for the 70-to-130 seat segment. While the program was launched in 1999, the first E-Jet entered into revenue service in 2004.Commercial Aviation revenues represented 61.5% of the company’s total revenue in the second quarter, reflecting substantial improvement from 27% last year. Notably, the company delivered 35 commercial aircraft in the same quarter, up from 26 jets on the year-ago quarter.Furthermore, the company has a series of healthy contracts and tie-ups with other companies for its jets. As a result, Embraer continued to witness strong demand for its E-jets, thereby booking several orders in the second quarter.Moreover, armed with 3,500 flights and a fleet of 678 jets, SkyWest offers commercial air service in various cities across the United States, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean as well. SkyWest Airlines also has partnerships with United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, US Airways, American Airlines and Alaska Airlines. Therefore, such strong tie ups with this airlines will surely benefit Embraer’s profit margin in days ahead.Price MovementShares of Embraer have declined 30.2% in the last year, as against the industry's gain of 49.3%. This underperformance may have been caused by the weakening Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar. Additionally, the softness observed in the company’s Defense and Security business remains a concern.Zacks RankEmbraer carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2511,DAL,"All three key U.S. indexes closed at all-time highs on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 moving past 2,700 for the first time. Optimism over strong market performance in 2018 contributed to these gains. Additionally, gains in chipmakers and energy stocks had a positive impact on investor sentiment. Also, favorable economic data, including an upbeat manufacturing report and record construction spending boosted markets.How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) increased 0.4%, or 98.53 points to close at 24,922.68. The blue-chip index was just 80 points short of crossing the significant level of 25,000. The S&P 500 rose 0.6% to close at 2,713.06, reaching its best level ever. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,065.53, gaining 0.8%.

Further, gains in chipmakers pushed the indexes northward. Intel Corporation’s (INTC) shares fell 3.4% after the company admitted that reports indicating that its chips are subjected to data theft due to design flaws are true. However, the chipmaker assured that this problem will be taken care of in the coming weeks.Following this development, shares of Intel’s competitors like NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report) increased 6.6% and 3%, respectively. Key semiconductor index, PHLX Semiconductor (SOX) rose 1.7%.Additionally, out of the 11 key S&P 500 sectors, nine of them managed to close in the green. Anti-government rallies in major oil exporter Iran and recent crude supply cuts by Russia and OPEC countries, accompanied by steady economic growth had a positive impact on oil prices.  Both WTI and Brent crude prices increased to 2% and 1.9% to settle at $61.63 per barrel and $67.84 a barrel, respectively, their best gains since December 2014.Increase in oil prices had a positive impact on the Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE), which advanced 1.5%, becoming one of the best performing sectors of the S&P 500.

2512,DAL,"Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) reported disappointing traffic results for December. The company posted a decrease in air traffic for the month. Consolidated traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs), came in at 16.73 billion, down 0.4% year over year. The downside was mainly due to 1.1% dip in traffic on the international front.Consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) inched up 0.9% to 19.87 billion on a year-over-year basis. Consolidated load factor or percentage of seats filled by passengers fell 110 basis points to 84.2%. This is because capacity expanded while traffic contracted, leading to vacant seats on planes. Additionally, the Atlanta, GA-based airline recorded an 83.5% on-time performance and 97.3% completion factor (mainline) for the period under review.At the end of 2017, Delta generated consolidated RPMs of 217.71 billion (up 2.2% year over year) and ASMs of 254.33 billion (up 1% year over year). Load factor for the time frame was 85.6% as compared to 84.6% recorded at the end of 2016.Delta Air Lines, Inc. Price  Delta Air Lines, Inc. Price | Delta Air Lines, Inc. QuoteBearish Q4 Unit Cost PredictionThe company has increased guidance for fourth-quarter 2017 costs, thanks to the power outage at Atlanta airport among other factors. The power crisis at the said airport led to approximately 1,400 flight cancellations and is estimated to have affected the carrier’s pre-tax income to the tune of $25-50 million.The company now anticipates fourth-quarter non-fuel unit costs including profit sharing to be up approximately 5.5% (previous view was in the range of 5-5.5%). The reasons for the upsurge have been cited as “continued investment in our people and product combined with accelerated depreciation of aircraft retirements and the Atlanta power outage.”However, the carrier continues to expect fuel price per gallon between $1.92 and $1.97 including taxes and refinery impact. The carrier’s outlook pertaining to unit revenues for the fourth quarter also remains unaltered at approximately 4%. On another positive note, the airline has been seeing rising revenue trends in the final quarter and passenger unit revenues are expected in the high end of the guided range. Also, operating margin is still estimated at 11%.Additionally, system capacity is projected to expand 2.3%. Previously, the metric was forecast to grow in the band of 2.5-3% for the concluding quarter of 2017.The carrier further reiterated that it will take a one-time charge of $150-200 million in the to-be-reported quarter on account of the newly initiated tax law.The bearish unit costs outlook and discouraging traffic results seem to disappoint investors. Consequently, the stock was down 1.8% to $55.69 at the close of trading session on Jan 3.Zacks Rank & Key PicksDelta carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the airline space are Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes S.A. (GOL  -  Free Report), LATAM Airlines Group S.A. (LTM  -  Free Report) and SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report).

2513,DAL,"Last week was relatively quiet for the airline industry. The week, which had a day less of trading owing to Christmas, saw low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report) continue with its efforts toward expanding internationally as it announced its intentions of adding a couple of routes from South Florida. European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY  -  Free Report) was also in news as it faced a pilots’ strike due to issues related to pay and work conditions.Additionally, Moody's Investors Service, the rating services arm of Moody's Corporation, has upgraded the ratings of Latin American carrier Gol Linhas’ (GOL  -  Free Report) debt, which includes the corporate family rating to B2 from Caa3. The firm upgraded GOL’s ratings as a result of its strong operating performance on the back of an improving Brazilian economy. According to a Reuters report, passengers in a plane operated by JetBlue Airways (JBLU  -  Free Report) escaped unhurt after the plane skidded off a taxiway in Boston after landing.Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % ReturnOn the price front, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index gained almost 1% to $118.04 over the past week.(Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Dec 20, 2017).Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories1. Spirit Airlines announced the addition of two new international destinations from Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. The Miramar, Florida-based carrier will begin a daily non-stop service to the José Joaquín de Olmedo International Airport in Guayaquil, Ecuador from Mar 22, 2018 onward. Besides, it will initiate a nonstop service to the Cap-Haïtien International Airport, starting Apr 12, 2018. This will complement the carrier’s existing service to Port-au-Prince (Read more: Spirit Airlines to Add Two Global Routes From South Florida).Spirit Airlines carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.2. Ryanair, which has been witnessing labor strife for quite some time now, saw its pilots resort to a four-hour strike. This was reportedly the first time its pilots went on strike.  Operations were not disrupted significantly as a result of the pilots’ action. Flights got delayed but not a single one was cancelled. Disruptions were limited to the token strike, after the Irish carrier averted the possibility of a series of strikes across Europe, after agreeing to recognize unions.  3. GOL Linhas, which has had an impressive 2017, received a further shot in the arm when Moody's issued an upgraded rating. The outlook was changed to stable. Capacity discipline, cost-cutting initiatives apart from a strong demand for air travel to Latin America have aided the company this year. Moody's believes that GOL will perform impressively next year too, driven by the tailwinds.4. Inclement weather has been disrupting operations of U.S. carriers of late. Extensive snowfall in Boston resulted in delays as the departure/arrival of flights at Boston’s Logan Airport were halted on Christmas Day for about an hour due to snow-induced reduced visibility. Amid this scenario, a JetBlue Airways plane (AirBus A320) skidded off a snow-filled taxiway at the airport. Thankfully the mishap, which occurred on Dec 25 night, did not result in any injuries.5. In a customer-friendly move, Delta Vacations, the official vacation provider at Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report), added six new destinations across the United States to its portfolio. The destinations are Asheville, N.C.; Aspen, Colo.; Panama City, Fla.; Oakland, Calif.; Lexington, Ky.; and Fairbanks, Alaska. Passengers can avail of a wide range of accommodations such as boutique hotels, country inns and beach resorts at each destination.PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months.   The table above shows that all airline stocks traded in the green over the past week primarily due to the optimism surrounding the tax overhaul, which is expected to aid airlines significantly. However, the gains were muted in nature. Shares of JetBlue Airways gained the most (6.1%).Over the course of six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index appreciated 2.3% on the back of impressive gains at Latin American carriers GOL Linhas and Copa Holdings (CPA  -  Free Report). Share prices of the likes of Spirit Airlines and Alaska Air Group (ALK  -  Free Report) have declined appreciably in the period due to multiple headwinds.What's Next in the Airline Space?We expect December traffic reports from the likes of Delta in the coming days. Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2515,DAL,"The third-quarter earnings have drawn to a close for the airline companies. Notably, most carriers have managed to surpass estimates in the reported period, despite back-to-back natural calamities, primarily owing to reduced expectations.However, the broader scenario does not seem so bright for the companies with earnings having declined massively on a year-over-year basis. Q3 ResultsThe third quarter of 2017 saw major airline companies like Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), American Airlines Group, Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report) topping earnings estimates. However, earnings decreased on a year-over-year basis due to higher costs. At Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines, the bottom line declined 7.6% and 5.4%, respectively, while at United Continental, the metric decreased 28.6%. American Airlines too reported a significant reduction in earnings in the quarter. The hurricanes have significantly disrupted operations of the airlines. The multiple flight cancellations as well as continued soft demand for air travel to and from the affected areas due to Hurricane Harvey have hampered the companies’ top line. Southwest Airlines’ Passenger revenues per available seat mile (PRASM: a key measure of unit revenues) slid 1.4%, while RASM (revenues per available seat mile) was down 0.5% year over year.United Continental’s top line also slipped 0.4% on a year-over-year basis in the quarter. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company, which had to cancel 8,300 flights in the quarter under review due to weather-related disturbances, reported a 3.7% fall in PRASM. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.High Costs Hitting AirlinesPersistent high costs pertaining to fuel and labor have been hurting the bottom-line growth of airline stocks for quite some time now. Further, adding to the woes, Harvey contributed to an increase in oil prices. Higher fuel prices are expected to limit the earnings growth of the carriers in the fourth quarter as well. Also, with most carriers inking multiple labor deals, such costs have been on a rise of late. In fact this downside has been denting the earnings picture for the airlines over the past few quarters and the fourth quarter is likely to be no exception.Bearish Q4 and Full-Year View Several airline companies have provided a grim outlook for the final quarter of 2017 as well as the full year. United Continental expects consolidated PRASM to decline between 1% and 3% (year over year) in the fourth quarter of 2017. In addition, the company anticipates unit costs (excluding Fuel, Profit Sharing & Third Party business costs) to increase in the band of 2.5-3.5% due to higher labor and fuel costs. Average fuel price per gallon (consolidated) is projected between $1.80 and $1.85. For the fourth quarter of 2017, JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU  -  Free Report) expects consolidated operating cost per available seat mile (excluding fuel) to grow in the band of 5-7%. For 2017, the metric is projected to grow in the 4-5% range. RASM is anticipated to grow in the range of (3%) to 0% on a year-over-year basis.Spirit Airlines, Inc. (SAVE  -  Free Report) anticipates total revenues per available seat mile (TRASM) to decline 4-6% in the fourth quarter.Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. (HA  -  Free Report) predicts CASM (cost per available seat mile), excluding fuel, to rise significantly for the ongoing quarter, primarily due to higher labor costs. Fuel cost per gallon (economic) is anticipated in the range of $1.75-$1.85 for the fourth quarter, whereas the metric is expected in the $1.65-$1.75 band for 2017.Price PerformanceThe dull outlook for the airlines is evident from the fact that the Zacks Airline Industry has underperformed the broader market in the last three months. While the S&P 500 Index has gained 4.1%, the industry has declined 2.1%. Zacks Industry Rank Denotes the Drab ScenarioThe Zacks Industry Rank of 201 (of 250 plus groups) carried by the Zacks Airline industry further highlights the woes of the airlines. This unfavorable rank places the companies in the bottom 21% of the Zacks industries.We classify our entire 250-plus industries into two groups: the top half (i.e. industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Using a week’s rebalance for over 10 years now, the top half has been beating the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Click here to know more: About Zacks Industry RankZacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

In fact, this was the second successive quarter in which the carrier recorded quarterly unit revenue growth since the fourth quarter of 2014. In addition, passenger mile yield grew 0.2%.Operating ExpensesTotal operating expenses, including special items, increased 8% year over year to $9,221 million. Non-fuel consolidated unit cost or cost per available seat mile (CASM: normalized), including profit sharing, rose 2.6%, mainly owing to wage increases, product investments and accelerated depreciation pertaining to the carrier’s narrowbody fleet initiatives.LiquidityAt the end of the third quarter, Delta had $1.48 billion in cash and cash equivalents and adjusted net debt of $8.8 billion. Operating cash flow and free cash flow in the quarter generated by the company were $1.6 billion and $471 million, respectively.OutlookFor the fourth quarter of 2017, the carrier expects operating margin in the range of 11% to 13%. Fuel price, including taxes and refinery impact, is expected between $1.82 and $1.87 per gallon in the final quarter of the year. System capacity is expected to be up approximately 2% on a year-over-year basis.The company expects passenger unit revenues to increase in the band of 2% to 4% (on a year-over-year basis) in the fourth quarter.

2517,DAL,"Investors in Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the August 25th, 2017, $60 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Delta Air shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Delta Air is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Transportation - Airline industry that ranks in the Top 27% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, five analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while two have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.75 per shareto $1.80 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Delta Air right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

2518,DAL,"The past week saw key airline players like Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report), American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) and JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) revealing updates on their intention to add additional flights in a bid to expand their presence.On a more sombre note, the week also saw two terror attacks on two Spanish cities that claimed multiple lives apart from injuring many. Naturally, travel-focused stocks, which include airline players, lost value in the aftermath.According to many market watchers, the impact of the terror attacks in Spain is likely to be short term. This is in keeping with the trend that market weakness resulting from such anti-social incidents is usually short lived, especially when the frequency of occurrence is rapid as has been the case of late.In another major development, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway reduced its stake in three major U.S. carriers — Delta, American Airlines and United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) — in the second quarter of 2017. On the traffic front, Latin American carrier Copa Holdings (CPA  -  Free Report) unveiled its traffic data for the month of July.On the price front, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index declined 4.2% to $106.1 over the past week due to the terror attacks in Spain apart from the market pullback following concerns pertaining to recent actions of the Trump administration. Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return (Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Aug 16, 2017).Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1.

Both the incidents have claimed the lives of at least 14 and have left 130 others severely injured. Such acts of terrorism affected airline stocks as there is a possibility of waning travel demand due to security concerns.In fact, the timing of the attacks could not have been worse as the three-month period between June and August has been predicted to be the busiest one for U.S. carriers in terms of air travel.5. Copa Holdings revealed impressive traffic numbers for the month of July. Traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMS), improved 17.2% year over year 1,913 million.

2519,DAL,"The twin attacks of terror in Spain late last week hit airline stocks hard. Though the European airline stocks bore the brunt, their U.S. counterparts too felt the pinch.In fact, heavyweights like American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) and Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) fell sharply on Aug 17, following the Barcelona attacks. Both stocks currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Twin AttacksOn Aug 17, a van went through a crowd of tourists in Barcelona, killing at least 13 and injuring many. Such an inhuman act was followed by a second attack in the coastal town of Cambrils, located approximately 120 kilometers south of Barcelona.Reportedly the five terrorists involved in the Cambrils attacks were shot dead by the police. Both the incidents have claimed the lives of at least 14 along with 130 others severely injured. Such acts of terrorism affected airline stocks as there is a possibility of waning travel demand due to security fears.In fact, the timing of the attacks could not have been worse as the three-month period between June and August has been predicted to be the busiest one for U.S. carriers in terms of air travel.According to the forecast by the Airlines for America (A4A) in May 2017, approximately 234.1 million passengers will be transported worldwide by U.S. airlines in the above-mentioned period, up 4% from the 2016 levels. Notably, air travel projection for summer is of 2.54 million fliers per day during the said period.Given this backdrop, it is of little wonder that airline stocks shed value on the news of the attacks.Buffett’s Airline Exposure TrimmedAccording to the 13-F filing by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway in the second quarter, the company reduced its stakes in three major U.S. carriers.Reportedly, the Omaha, NE-based company reduced its stakes in Delta, American Airlines and United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report) by 4.6%, 3.5% and 2.6%, respectively, on a sequential basis.Moreover, the Oracle of Omaha’s investment in low-cost carrier Southwest Airlines Co. reportedly remained unchanged.In fact, Buffett is one of the most revered investors of all times and his decision to trim investments in three airline heavyweights also points at the fact that all is not well with this key sector.High Labor Costs: Major HeadwindWith airline companies constantly inking deals with various labor groups, it is of little surprise that costs on this front are increasing, which is limiting bottom-line growth.At American Airlines, total operating expenses increased 11.1% year over year in the second quarter to $9.6 billion. Expenses pertaining to salaries and benefits were up 12.5%. Consolidated operating costs per available seat miles (CASM), excluding special items. also rose 6.8%.The scenario is expected to be similar in the third quarter as well. Delta expects non-fuel unit cost (including profit sharing) to increase approximately 4%. Additionally, consolidated cost per available seat miles (excluding special items and fuel) is anticipated to increase 5% at American Airlines.Capacity Overexpansion: Major ChallengeCapacity-related woes had been plaguing stocks in the airline space for quite some time. In fact, the July traffic reports of most carriers have highlighted that such issues might resurface. Major carriers like American Airlines, United Continental and JetBlue Airways Corp. have posted declines in their respective load factors (percentage of seats filled by passengers) for the same month. The downturn was due to capacity expansion outweighing traffic growth.Generally, carriers are forced to reduce fares as unit revenues decline in the face of capacity outpacing demand growth. While low air fares are favorable for fliers, it is a drag on the top lines of carriers with their profits being hurt.Other HeadwindsCarriers like United Continental, American Airlines and Spirit Airlines have been laid low by passenger-related issues this year.In fact, Spirit Airlines has issued a lackluster guidance with respect to total revenue per available seat miles (TRASM: a key measure of unit revenue) for the third quarter. This was mainly due to the dispute with its pilots in May leading to multiple flights cancellations, thereby causing passenger harassment. The metric is expected to decline in the band of 2%-4% on a year-over-year basis, as well.Moreover, technical glitches have been a great nuisance for carriers. Evidently, the likes of Delta and Southwest Airlines have seen their operations being affected by technological problems this year. Given that technological infrastructure is a key expense for airlines, the profitability of carriers might be affected in the event of such malfunctions, going forward.Price Performance In view of the above headwinds, it is of little wonder that the Zacks Airline industry underperformed the broader market in the last three months. The S&P 500 Index gained 1.7%, as against the industry’s decline of 0.6%.Some Positives RemainAccording to many market watchers, the impact of the terror attacks in Spain is likely to be short-term in nature. This is in keeping with the trend that market weakness resulting from such anti-social incidents is usually short lived, especially when the frequency of occurrence is rapid as has been the case of late.Notably, the recent forecast by A4A on the upcoming Labor Day travel period (Aug 30-Sep 5) has highlighted the fact that U.S. carriers will make hay during the period with approximately 16.1 million passengers expected to avail services of the U.S. airlines. Travel demand is projected to increase 5% on the back of low air fares and improving disposable income. The improving unit revenue scenario is another positive for airlines.Furthermore, the bullish Zacks Industry Rank of 50 (out of 265 groups) carried by the 22-member Airline industry highlights the fact that there are still reasons to be positive on the sector despite some hiccups. In fact, the airline industry falls under the broader Transportation sector (one of 16 Zacks Sectors). The favorable rank places the companies in the top 20% of the Zacks industries.We put our X industries (all 265 of them) into two groups: the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Over the last 10 years, using a one-week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Click here to know more: About Zacks Industry RankHow to Pick Winners?The above commentary clearly reflects that despite headwinds all is not lost for airline stocks and there exists few hidden gems in the space which investors can unearth.

It further aims to launch a service from San Diego to Mexico City ahead in November.Another airline heavyweight Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) too has been following suit.

2521,DAL,"For some investors, the search for undervalued stocks can be paramount. But on top of this, investors want stocks that have the potential to outperform the market in the near term.To accomplish this, investors look at several key valuation metrics. For example, a low P/E ratio is one of the more common value-based metrics that investors tend to keep their eyes on. On top of that, other value-focused stats, such as the P/S ratio, must be taken into consideration.Still, along with value, investors often want to buy companies that are set to grow at an impressive rate. And this is where pairing basic value and growth metrics with strong Zacks Rank stocks can come in handy.Today, we’ll look at three foreign companies, which are household names in many parts of the world, that are currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), as well as value and growth metrics that might prove enticing for investors.Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BAMXF  -  Free Report)This German automotive powerhouse is the parent company of three of the most recognizable and iconic auto brands: BMW, MINI, and Rolls-Royce. The firm boasts a “B” grade for Value and an “A” for Momentum in our Style Scores system, helping it earn an overall VGM grade of “A.”With a current P/E ratio of 7.44, which beats the “Automotive – Foreign” industry average of 8.15, BAMXF is trading far below the S&P 500 average. The company’s P/S ratio of 0.57 and 1.15 P/B ratio are both strong. BAMXF’s Cash Flow per share of 21.81 crushes the industry average of 6.13, while its Price/Cash Flow ratio of 4.61 also presents value compared to the industry’s 5.43 ratio.After seeing its stock price pop 21.89% over the last year, which outpaced the industry average of 13.37%, the company is set to keep growing. Based on our current consensus estimates, the company’s sales are set to jump 12.41% for the year to hit $117.16 billion. Also, the auto giant’s earnings are projected to pop 17.46% this year.Deutsche Lufthansa Deutsche Lufthansa is another German giant that helps people get from point A to B. The company operates within the Lufthansa Group and is the largest German airline. Its shares have soared 111.14% since the start of the year, which is far above “Transportation – Airline” industry average of 12%.Lufthansa currently rocks “A” grades for Value, Growth, and Momentum. The company is currently trading at 6.17x earnings, which marks a discount to the S&P 500 average as well as the industry’s 10.41 average P/E Ratio.Lufthansa’s P/S Ratio of 0.35 is also far “better” than the airline industry average of 0.81 and below U.S. giants Delta (DAL  -  Free Report) and American Airlines (AAL  -  Free Report). On top of that, the German airline company’s 6.27% EPS growth projection crushes the industry’s 2.29% average, meaning that Lufthansa could be a better-than-average growth pick in the airline industry.Air France-KLM SA Closing out this roundup of value-driven foreign stocks with solid growth potential is French-Dutch airline power Air France-KLM. Since the beginning of the year, the company’s shares have skyrocketed 187.13%. And growth seems poised to continue as Air France-KLM has received one positive earnings estimate revision for its current full-year and one for the following year, all within the last 60 days.According to our current consensus estimates, the company’s earnings are projected to climb 76.39% this year. Based on these same estimates, the airline giant’s revenues are set to rise by 9.35% and top $29.90 billion.Air France-KLM earned an “A” for Value, along with a “B” for Growth and an “A” for Momentum. With a P/S Ratio of 0.17, investors pay just $0.17 for every dollar of Air France-KLM sales, making it one of the best ratios in the industry. The airline conglomerate’s 6.06 P/E Ratio also marks a discount to the industry.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

2522,DAL,"The transportation sector is struggling this earnings season with total earnings from 97.9% of the sector’s total market capitalization that has reported so far down 14.2% despite revenue growth of 5.1%. This is much below earnings growth of 9.6% and revenue growth of 10% for the same period, in the last reporting cycle (read: 5 Sector ETFs for Revenue Growth Play).Earnings and revenue beat ratio of 69.2% and 61.5%, respectively, are also disappointing despite the fact that most of the industry players dominating the sector managed to beat our estimates on earnings or revenues or both.For a better understanding, let’s dig into the earnings results of some well-known industry players:Transportation Earnings in FocusThe world's largest package delivery company United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both fronts. Earnings of $1.45 surpassed our earnings estimate by a penny while revenues of $15.98 billion edged past the estimated $15.61 billion. For fiscal 2017, the company narrowed its earnings per share guidance range from $5.80-$6.10 to $5.85-$6.10. The Zacks Consensus Estimate at the time of earnings release was pegged at $6.00.The major railroads Union Pacific (UNP  -  Free Report), Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern Corp (NSC  -  Free Report) also beat on both the top and bottom lines. NSC outpaced the earnings estimate by a wide margin of 11 cents while earnings at UNP and KSU came ahead by a penny and three cents, respectively. Revenues for the three railroads trumped their Zacks Consensus Estimate by $102 million, $9 million and $40 million, respectively.Ryder Systems (R  -  Free Report), the leader in supply chain management and fleet management services, beat the earnings estimate by four cents and revenue estimate by $42 million.The two largest U.S. airlines Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental (UAL  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected results but the latter lagged on revenues. Earnings of $1.57 and revenues of $11.1 billion at Delta edged past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.54 and $11.03 billion, respectively. At United Continental, earnings per share of $2.22 came above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.18 but revenues of $9.878 billion slightly fell shy of the estimated $9.88 billion (read: Will Airline ETF Crash on Subdued Q3 or Take Off on Value?).Last but not the least, earnings for the leading trucking carrier J.B. Hunt (JBHT  -  Free Report) came in below the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a nickel but revenues were $28 million above the estimate.ETFs in FocusGiven this, the sector saw a 2.3% average decline (average price difference between a day before and after the earnings announcement of a stock) in response to earnings announcements. As such, both transport ETFs, iShares Dow Jones Transportation Average Fund (IYT  -  Free Report) and SPDR S&P Transportation ETF (XTN  -  Free Report), saw rough trading in the past one month. IYT shed 1.6% while XTN was down 0.4%. Both funds have an unfavorable Zacks ETF Rank #4 (Sell) rating with a High risk outlook (see: all the Industrials ETFs here).IYTThe fund tracks the Dow Jones Transportation Average Index, giving investors exposure to a small basket of 20 securities. The fund has a certain tilt toward large-cap stocks at 55% while mid and small caps account for 26% and 19% share, respectively, in the basket. Though the product is heavily concentrated on the top firm FedEx (FDX) at 14.3%, the in-focus eight firms collectively make up for 47.2% of the portfolio. From a sector perspective, air freight & logistics takes the top spot with 30.8% of the portfolio while railroads, trucking and airlines round off to the next three spots with double-digit exposure each. The fund has accumulated nearly $799.2 million in AUM while sees solid trading volume of around 258,000 shares a day. It charges 44 bps in annual fees.XTNThis fund tracks the S&P Transportation Select Industry Index, holding 43 stocks in its basket. It is skewed toward small caps at 47% while the rest is split between mid and large caps. As a result, the in-focus firms account for over 2% share each. Further, about 32.3% of the portfolio is dominated by trucking, while airlines takes one-fourth share. Airfreight & logistics, and railroads also make up for a double-digit allocation each. With AUM of $194.6 million, the fund charges 35 bps in fees per year from investors and trades in a lower volume of around 22,000 shares a day (read: ETFs to Buy After Weak Jobs Report).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

2523,DAL,"Fuel costs account for a major chunk of an airline's operating costs. Hence, decline in fuel costs are a boon for any airline company. In such a scenario, operating expenses of carriers are significantly reduced, thereby boosting their bottom line through huge savings.However, fuel costs are on the rise lately, with oil prices crossing the $50 a barrel threshold mark. This upsurge can be attributed to the improving demand outlook for the commodity and OPEC deal extension talks. This upsurge, however, does not spell good news for carriers.Fuel Cost Outlook Raised by CarriersIt is a well-documented fact that Hurricanes Harvey and Irma had disrupted airline operations significantly. Harvey contributed to an increase in oil prices due to gasoline shortages caused by the storm. Higher fuel prices are expected to limit earnings growth of carriers in the third quarter. United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) projects fuel price per gallon between $1.72 and $1.77 (earlier view: $1.56 to $1.61).Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) also lifted its forecast for fuel prices. The low-cost carrier expects fuel price (economic) per gallon between $2.00 and $2.05 (earlier projection was in the band of $1.95 and $2.00). Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) also raised its outlook for the same to $1.68-$1.73 from the earlier $1.55-$1.60 bracket, backed by rise in market price that began in late July.Labor Costs As noted above, decline in fuel costs over the last few years had been a boon for airlines. Evidently, the financial health of carriers had improved significantly by means of huge savings induced by low fuel costs.The financial prosperity of carriers had not gone unnoticed by their employees, who too were eager to get a share of the pie. This, in turn, propelled frequent new labor deals across the labor-intensive airline industry, thus increasing labor costs.This had dented the earnings picture for airlines over the past few quarters and the third quarter is likely to be no different. With upsurge in fuel costs, the bottom line of airline stocks are expected to dent further this time. Top Lines Likely to Be HurtMajor airline players like United Continental and American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) had to call off multiple flights due to Harvey and Irma. This is likely to hurt their top line in the third quarter. Markedly, the airline companies like United Continental, American Airlines, JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU  -  Free Report) and Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report) also trimmed their unit-revenue outlook for the quarter, stung by these headwinds.As a result, Spirit Airlines expects its top line to shrink to the tune of approximately $8.5 million. This view takes into account the multiple flights cancelled by the company as well as the continued soft demand for air travel to and from the affected areas due to Harvey. Weak airfares are likely to pressurize revenues.ConclusionThe above commentary clearly suggests that turbulence is likely to affect airlines in the third quarter. Furthermore, the rise in fuel costs has proved to be a bane for carriers. In fact, according to the International Air Transport Association (“IATA”), oil price in 2017 is projected at $54 per barrel for Brent Crude that is above $44.6 per barrel in 2016. This significant increase in the input costs for airlines highlights the gloomy days ahead for the sector participants.4 Stocks to Watch After Massive Equifax HackCybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

2524,DAL,"Stocks in the airline space have been going through tough times of late. Major airline companies are severely hurt from the consecutive impacts of Harvey and Irma. Consequently airline stocks have lowered their guidance for the upcoming quarter.The airline companies are expected to reveal third-quarter 2017 earnings numbers next month. With the tropical storms bearing heavily on the airline companies, the scenario for future looks very grim.Bleak Third-Quarter ForecastsSeveral airline companies have trimmed their third-quarter outlook, primarily due to natural disasters.United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report), the parent company of United Airlines, the worst hit from Harvey has reduced views with respect to pre-tax margin and passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM: a key measure of unit revenue) for the current quarter. The carrier now expects PRASM to decline between 3% and 5% year over year (the earlier guidance provided in July had called for the metric to be in the range of +1% to -1%).The carrier currently expects pre-tax margin between 8% and 10% (previous outlook had called for the metric to be in the range of 12.5-14.5%). Higher fuel prices are also estimated to hamper the bottom line in the third quarter. Fuel price per gallon is now projected in the band of $1.72-$1.77 (earlier view: $1.56-$1.61). Cost per available seat miles, excluding fuel, profit-sharing, third-party business expenses and other special items are now projected to increase between 2.5% and 3.5% (earlier outlook had called for a rise in the 2-3% range).The Chicago-based company now expects capacity to grow between 3% and 3.5% compared with the approximate 4% expansion projected earlier.Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report) with significant exposure to Houston expects the top line to shrink to the tune of approximately $8.5 million in the third quarter due to natural calamity. Currently, Spirit Airlines anticipates total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM: a key measure of unit revenue) in the current quarter to fall between 7% and 8.5% (the earlier guidance had called for a drop in the band of 2-4%). Aggressive competitive pricing in key markets also contributed to this bleak forecast.Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) also trimmed outlook for the third quarter due to stiffer competition and higher fuel costs. The carrier now estimates passenger unit revenue for the said quarter to improve in the range of 2-3%. Past view had called for growth in the 2.5-4.5% band. The airline also raised outlook for fuel prices to $1.68-$1.73 from the earlier $1.55-$1.60 bracket on the back of upsurge in market price, which began in late July.Apart from the above carriers, the likes of JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU  -  Free Report) and Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) also cut their respective unit revenue views for the third quarter. American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) expects TRASM to grow at a slower pace in the third quarter due to difficult year-over-year comparisons.High Labor CostsSteep labor costs have been hitting the airline stocks for quite some time now. In fact, the future scenario also seems dull and the metric is expected to affect the third-quarter results as well.Zacks Industry Rank Highlights the Drab ScenarioThe Zacks Industry Rank of 202 (out of 250 plus groups) carried by the Zacks Airline industry further highlights the plight of the airlines. This unfavorable rank places the companies in the bottom 21% of the Zacks industries.We classify our entire 250-plus industries into two groups: the top half (i.e. industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Over the past decade, using a week’s rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Click here to know more: About Zacks Industry RankPrice PerformanceThe dim outlook of the airlines is evident from the fact that the Zacks Airline Industry has underperformed the broader market in the last three months. While the S&P 500 index has gained 2.4%, the industry has declined 4.2%. 4 Airline Stocks to Dump NowKeeping the above-mentioned headwinds in view, we have zeroed in on four stocks for investors to offload from their respective portfolios.Spirit Airlines, Inc. operates an airline based in Fort Lauderdale, providing travel opportunity principally to and from South Florida, the Caribbean as well as Latin America.

2528,DAL,"It is a well-documented fact that the widely-diversified transportation sector, which includes airline companies, railroads, truckers and shippers to name a few, has had a turbulent time in 2017 due to multiple headwinds. Issues ranging from customer dissatisfaction, high fuel costs, driver shortages, technological glitches and service disruptions due to hurricanes have let sector participants down at various times of the year.Lets have a deeper look into the major headwinds that have hampered this sector.Probably, the most infamous incident to have plagued the sector in 2017 was the David Dao incident at United Airlines, the wholly owned subsidiary of United Continental (UAL  -  Free Report), on Apr 9. The passenger dragging episode drew flak from across the globe, resulting in multiple apologies from the company. Apart from United Airlines, customer dissatisfaction issues have also hurt other airline operators like Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report).The rise in fuel prices also do not bode well for transportation stocks as expenses related to the commodity are one of the largest input costs for any sector participant. In fact, oil prices have increased more than 37% in the last three months, hitting a more than two-year high of around $59 recently.Additionally, the recent hurricanes disrupted operations of major sector participants. Consequently, airline operators like United Continental had to cancel multiple flights causing significant loss of revenues.Hurricanes also hurt operations of major railroads like Union Pacific Corp. (UNP  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC  -  Free Report) by damaging important rail lines. Freight costs skyrocketed following the natural disasters. Railroads have also been negatively impacted this year by weakness in the automotive sector due to sluggish vehicle production in the United States.In 2017, technological glitches have hurt sector participants as well. Operations at FedEx Corp.’s (FDX  -  Free Report) subsidiary, TNT Express, were crippled by a cyberattack in June. The attack caused large-scale service delays.Due the above-mentioned headwinds, the Zacks transportation sector is currently placed at the bottom among the 16 Zacks Classified sectors.S&P 500 Going from Strength to StrengthWith the domestic economy on a solid footing, it is of little surprise that U.S. stock markets are hitting all-time highs on a fairly regular basis. The S&P 500 also maintained its upward journey for 13 straight months through November. The benchmark index, in fact, hasn’t seen a drop of at least 3% since Nov 7, 2016, the longest stretch on record. The index had rallied more than 19% so far this year and is on track to record its best year since 2013.In fact, strong economic growth has been responsible for this upsurge in the S&P 500 Index. Bullish domestic data released recently are indicative of the healthy position of the U.S. economy.Per the Commerce Department’s second estimate, the U.S. economy expanded at a 3.3% pace in the third quarter. This represents an improvement from the annualized growth rate of 3.1% in the April to June period and the strongest performance since the third quarter of 2014. Meanwhile, President Trump’s proposals to overhaul the tax law and make it business friendly, have added to the already buoyant scenario.Transports Lag the S&P 500 IndexWhile the S&P 500 equity index has been on an uptrend, it has been a turbulent 2017 for the transportation stocks as enumerated above. Given this contrasting scenario, it is of little wonder that the sector has lagged the coveted S&P 500 Index.The recent optimism surrounding the tax bill, which on becoming a law is expected to aid transports significantly, is primarily responsible for the sector giving positive returns to investors this year.  Despite this, it has not been a great year for the sector participants due to the headwinds mentioned above.The Zacks transportation sector rallied 10.9% year to date compared with the broader S&P 500's gain of 20.3%.5 Sector Outperformers in 2017Despite the headwinds to have plagued sector participants, there are a few stocks in the sector which have given higher returns than the sector.However, given the widely diversified transportation sector, it is by no means an easy task for investors to arrive at such outperformers. To aid their search procedure, we have zeroed in on five such stocks.The stocks, apart from having solid fundamentals, have large market capitalizations.  This is because, focusing on such stocks is considered to be safe. Their large market capitalizations provide the requisite cushion to combat economic downturns and stringent credit conditions.Our first choice is FedEx Corporation. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company offers customers a one-stop source for global shipping, logistics and supply chain solutions. The company has an impressive expected earnings growth rate (next 3 to 5 years) of 12.8%. which is higher than the industry’s 11%.The company has a market capitalization of $63.95 billion and a VGM Score of A. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners.However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score. Additionally, the stock has returned 34.9% year to date. Impressive performance during the current holiday season will boost the stock further. (Looking for the Best Stocks for 2018? Be among the first to see our Top Ten Stocks for 2018 portfolio here.)You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Our next choice is Union Pacific Corporation. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) railroad operator is based in Omaha, NE. As the largest railroad in North America, Union Pacific connects the Pacific and Gulf Coast ports with the Midwest and eastern United States gateways.The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter and current-year earnings being revised 2% and 0.7% upward, respectively, over the last 60 days. Additionally, the stock has returned 29.9% year to date. The company has a market capitalization of $101.68 billion.Moreover, railroads including Union Pacific are seeing good times under President Trump due to his pro-coal stance. Trump is aiming to revive the coal industry by relaxing regulations which were hurting its prospects. As fortunes of railroads are tied to coal, any positive development pertaining to the commodity is a boost for railroad operators.Additionally, railroads invest significantly for capital expenditure as the industry is capital-intensive in nature. For example, Union Pacific has announced a $3.1 billion capital plan this year, which is in line with its efforts to promote safety and enhance productivity.In the current scenario, capital expenditures cannot be tax-deducted in the year they are incurred. However, companies will be able to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income immediately as per the provisions of the tax reform bill. Naturally, this aspect hugely favors railroads and if it materializes companies in the space would be huge gainers. Our next choice is also a railroad operator — Norfolk Southern Corporation. This Zacks Rank #3 company is based in Norfolk, VA.

2530,DAL,"The past week in the airline space was mostly about numbers, with several airline companies like American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report), Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report) and Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report) reporting their respective third-quarter 2017 earnings results.Markedly, the common trend in the quarterly reports of the above-mentioned companies was the year-over-year decline in earnings due to higher costs. Apart from high labor costs, rise in oil prices also hurt the bottom line as fuel-related expenses increased. In addition to high costs, back-to-back hurricanes (Harvey, Irma and Maria) and the earthquake in Mexico also distorted the earnings picture.Despite the headwinds, most sector participants reported better-than-expected earnings per share in Q3. In view of these headwinds, the earnings per share estimates have been trimmed over the past few months.With the bar (pertaining to earnings estimates) being lowered significantly, courtesy the drastic downward revisions, it is of little surprise that most carriers have managed to beat the (highly conservative) Zacks Consensus Estimate in the third quarter.Moreover, the fact that the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has declined 4.5% to $106.42 over the past five trading days. This further substantiates the fact that the series of earnings beat in the airline space have failed to cheer investors.The only notable update on the non-earnings front came from the Airlines for America (“A4A“). The leading trade group, predicted that 28.5 million passengers will opt for air travel in the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday period (Nov 17 – Nov 28), implying a 3% increase from the 2016 figure. Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return(Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Oct 25, 2017).Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1.

2531,DAL,"According to a report appearing in the Associated Press, Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) will no longer operate flights connecting Guam and Japan from January, 2018. Lackluster demand for air travel on the route has made it financially unviable for Delta. Consequently, the Atlanta, GA-based carrier decided to terminate service. Following Delta’s decision, United Airlines, which is owned by United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report), is the sole U.S.- based company to operate flights on the route. Apart from United Airlines, Japan Airlines operates flights connecting the U.S. island territory to Japan’s Narita airport.Is North Korea's Missile Threat Responsible?The above route had become all the more unfriendly for air travel, thereby denting Delta’s profits following North Korea's threat to attack Guam. The threat and the resultant tensions had caused low-cost carrier Hong Kong Express Airways postpone flights on the Japan-Guam route until next summer. North Korea has, in fact, fired couple of missiles over Japan.In fact, Delta’s decision to withdraw service deals a further blow to the already struggling tourism industry in Guam. Travellers from the Land of the Rising Sun have mostly avoided Guam, following the missile threats. This is further substantiated by the fact that Japanese cancellations accounted for most of the 7000 + tours to Guam that had been called off in August. The tours were of varying nature ranging from educational trips to those for business purposes. The cancellations caused Guam’s tourism sector substantial losses in August.Delta Air Lines, Inc. Price  Delta Air Lines, Inc. Price | Delta Air Lines, Inc. Quote Narita-Saipan Route Still in OperationDelta will reportedly continue operating daily flights connecting Narita airport and Saipan. The route is financially viable to Delta due to less competition. Saipan is located to Guam’s northeast. With the Guam-Narita service scheduled to end early next year, it remains to be seen whether the Narita-Saipan route attracts more traffic. Additionally, the company decided to continue operating on the Palau-Narita route. Palau is located to the southwest of Guam. Flights will operate twice a week on the route.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderDelta carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Better-ranked stocks in the airline space include GOL Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes S.A. (GOL  -  Free Report) and Ryanair Holdings RYAAY), holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2534,DAL,"Its earnings time again! This is the time when the investor community is busy comparing estimates with actual outcomes. Prior to the releases, investors would look to add stocks that have the potential to surpass earnings expectations in the quarter. This is because an earnings beat positively impacts the stock price. Given this backdrop, the obvious question is how to find potential winners?Through this write-up, we aim to help investors find airline stocks that are likely to report better-than-expected earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2017. Notably, airline stocks are an integral part of the Zacks Transportation sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors).The fourth-quarter earnings season will be kicked off by Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) on Jan 11. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The overall sentiment pertaining to airlines is quite positive ahead of the earnings season. This is because airline stocks seem to be back in favor after struggling for most of 2017 due to multiple headwinds like the back-to-back hurricanes and unit revenue issues, among others.Contrasting Price Performances Signal ImprovementPost hurricanes, things are looking up for airline stocks. This is evident when comparing the price performance of the Zacks Airline industry with the S&P 500 Index in the first nine months and the last three months of 2017.While the industry gained only 1.8%, the S&P 500 index rallied 12.6% in the first nine months.  However, the industry handily outperformed the S&P 500 index in the final quarter of 2017, rallying 12.9% compared with the S&P’s gain of 6%.Why the Bullish ScenarioThe improving scenario can be made out from the bullish fourth-quarter unit revenue forecasts from key sector players like Delta and Hawaiian Holdings (HA). Moreover, the likes of United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) and JetBlue Airways (JBLU  -  Free Report) announced new share buyback programs during the same quarter. These shareholder-friendly initiatives bear testimony to the solid financial health of carriers.Furthermore, the robust financial health of most carriers has prompted them to invest substantially in improving the flying experience for passengers, in a bid to stay afloat in the competitive airline space. Also, high fuel costs, which might limit bottom-line growth, are likely to boost the top line by raising ticket prices.Impressive performances of carriers in the Thanksgiving travel period and the winter holiday season are likely to boost their top-line performances as well. In fact, strong demand for air travel on the back of an improving economy, a much-improved job market and rising disposable income is likely to aid results in the to-be-reported quarter.Zacks Industry Rank Highlights the Favorable ScenarioThe improving scenario for the airline space is well reflected by the bullish Zacks Industry Rank of 83 carried by the 24-member Zacks Airline industry. Notably, the favorable rank places the industry in the top 32% of the 250+ groups. The positioning indicates a positive outlook. We put our entire 250-plus industries into two groups: the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Over the last 10 years, using a one week rebalance, the top half outpaced the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The Zacks Industry Rank for this sector has improved immensely, given the industry’s 200+ rank only a few months ago.Click here to know more: About Zacks Industry RankGiven the favorable backdrop, it is very much likely that airline stocks will perform well in Q4. Naturally, it is a prudent idea to add such stocks to one’s portfolio for handsome returns.Selection of OutperformersWith the airline space being densely populated, the task of selecting the right stocks is by no means an easy one. Given the numerous stocks in the sector that almost always muddle one’s stock-picking prowess, the Zacks methodology could offer some relief.Our research shows that for stocks with the combination of a Zacks Rank #1, 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%.

2535,DAL,"American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) is one of the most well-known names in the airline industry. However, the company has been in the news for wrong reasons of late. Pilots at the carrier will be on vacation during the busy Christmas week, thanks to a scheduling glitch.As a result of the computer failure, the pilots’ union — Allied Pilots Association (APA) — estimated that approximately 15,000 flights are likely to be affected during the Dec 17- Dec 31 period. This is because they do not have assigned pilots. It is feared that flights from some of the carriers’ biggest hubs like Chicago's O'Hare and New York's LaGuardia airports are likely to be pilot less, thanks to this bizarre problem.According to a Yahoo Finance report, the Trip Trade app, which is used for assigning flights to pilots, malfunctioned due to a computer glitch. As a result of the scheduling error, the system apparently showed that the requisite staffing was available at the carrier to operate the scheduled flights during the period, even though it was not actually the case.Naturally, the news of pilot shortage at the largest U.S. carrier caused panic as the travel plans during the Christmas holiday period will be thrown hay aware in the event of the forecast coming true. Consequently, some customers had to apparently contact the carrier in a bid to get assurance that their travel plans will not be hampered.American Airlines Swings into ActionAmerican Airlines is leaving no stone unturned to deal with this issue of pilot shortage to avoid the inconvenience likely to be caused during the holiday period. According to media reports, the carrier had taken measures like using standby pilots and offering them 150% of their normal hourly pay in order to avoid flight cancellations during the busy travel period. In December, American Airlines plans to operate 200,000 flights.The carrier said that apart from about “a few hundred” there are pilots to operate the rest. This was probably directed to mitigate fears of travel-related disruptions among its passengers. However, the above view of American Airlines differs from that of the APA which stated that “Thousands of Flights Still Unassigned.” Consequently, a conflict between the carrier and the APA on the issue in the coming days cannot be ruled out.Also, customer-related issues had hurt the industry quite significantly this year. The infamous David Dao incident at United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report), which earned it worldwide criticism, was one such issue. Meanwhile, measures taken by American Airlines, substantiates the fact that this carrier is certainly planning to avoid a similar fate in the coming days. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Other carriers like Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report) and Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) had also been affected by customer-related issues this year. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Whatever the final outcome, the measures taken by American Airlines to combat this unwarranted crisis are likely to push up labor costs even further. With fuel costs also on the rise, the bottom line is likely to be significantly hurt in the fourth quarter due to escalating operating expenses.Computer Glitches not UncommonAmerican Airlines is not the only carrier to suffer from a scheduling glitch.  A similar issue in September had hurt European low-cost carrier, Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY  -  Free Report). According to a CNBC report, the carrier had to cancel 2,000 flights resulting in significant customer harassments.Technical glitches, in fact, have been a great nuisance for carriers. Earlier in 2017, British Airways, the largest carrier in the UK (in terms of on fleet size), encountered a major IT system failure resulting in cancellation of flights and untold miseries to the concerned travellers. Additionally, a computer glitch recently disrupted operations at Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report). Since expenditure on technological infrastructure is a major one for airlines, their profitability might be hurt in the event of such malfunctions.Will the American Airlines Issue Hurt the Industry's Recovery?Airline stocks seem to be back in favor again, after being laid low for most part of the year due to multiple headwinds ranging from the back-to-back hurricanes, the devastating earthquake in Mexico and high costs.Evidently, the Zacks Airline Industry had underperformed the S&P 500 Index in the first nine months of the current year. While the S&P 500 index gained 11.9%, the industry rallied 8.8%.However, the industry seems to be limping back to normalcy as indicated by the upward share price movements at major carriers like JetBlue Airways (JBLU  -  Free Report) (up 15.6%) and Delta (up 9.1%) since the beginning of the current quarter.Also, the Zacks Airline industry has outperformed the S&P 500 Index on a quarter-to-date basis. While the industry rallied 7.8%, the S&P 500 Index has gained 5.3% in the same period.The Zacks Industry rank of 63 carried by the 26-member Zacks Airline Industry also highlights the fact that airline stocks are back in favor. The favorable rank places the industry in the top 25% of the 250+ groups enlisted. The bullish stance on the industry is further augmented by the fact there have been 12 positive estimate revisions in the fourth quarter of 2017.The improving scenario for the airline space can be well gauged from the fact that the Zacks Industry Rank has improved immensely, given the industry’s 200+ rank only a few months ago.However, the latest customer-related issue at American Airlines might prove to be a dampener, as far as the recovery of airlines is concerned. The fears are likely to turn into reality in the event of the Christmas holiday travel plans of passengers being hampered due to pilot shortage. Naturally, investors interested in the airline space are anticipated to keenly await for updates on this burning issue.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

2536,DAL,"The pure-play aviation ETF U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS  -  Free Report) lost about 4.7% in the last five days (as of Oct 27, 2017) on mixed earnings. Some recently released earnings couldn’t live up to investors’ expectations. Results were also hurt by the recent hurricanes. Below we highlight earnings in detail (see all Industrials ETFs here).Q3 Results in DetailDelta Air Lines Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) reported more than two weeks ago with a beat on both lines. Operating revenues of $11.06 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.037 billion. Revenues increased 5.5% from the year-ago figure. The carrier’s third-quarter earnings (excluding 7 cents from non-recurring items) of $1.57 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.54.

The company has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and a VGM Score of C.United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected results. Earnings (excluding 10 cents from non-recurring items) came in at $2.22 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.8%. Earnings were, however, 28.6% lower than the year-ago figure due to higher costs. Operating revenues of $9.878 billion were also marginally ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.857.3 billion. However, the top line shrunk 0.4% on a year-over-year basis. United Continental has a Zacks Rank #5 and a VGM Score of D.Low cost carrier Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected earnings but lower-than-expected revenues. The carrier’s earnings per share (excluding 4 cents from non-recurring items) of 88 cents beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 87 cents. The bottom line however, declined 5.4% on a year-over-year basis.Operating revenues of $5.271 billion lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.297 billion. The top line, however, improved 2.6% year over year. Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) LUV has a VGM Score of B.American Airlines Group Inc.’s (AAL  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 earnings (excluding 14 cents from non-recurring items) of $1.42 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents. Quarterly earnings declined significantly on a year-over-year basis due to high costs.

The Zacks Ranked #5 American Airlines Group has a VGM Score of C.Low-cost carrier JetBlue Airways Corporation’s (JBLU  -  Free Report) third-quarter earnings of 55 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents. Quarterly earnings, however, declined 5.2% from the year-ago figure due to higher costs.

This Zacks Ranked #5 company has a VGM Score of B.Alaska Air Group (ALK  -  Free Report) reported earnings (excluding 10 cents from non-recurring items) of $2.24 per share, which fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.25.

The company has a Zacks Rank #5 and a VGM Score of A.Is There Any Strong Positive?By now, one must have understood from the beat ratios that corporate strength in the airlines industry is moderate. But investors should note that most of the stocks have a good Value Score of A or B. This makes the space a value play.  However, oil prices play a crucial role in the airlines’ cost structure. If oil prices manage to see an uptrend in the coming days on an extension of the OPEC output curb deal, airlines may suffer on profit margins (read: Q3 Earnings to Drive Energy ETFs Higher).Nevertheless, investors having a strong stomach for oil-related risks and faith in the compelling valuation of airline stocks, may play the recent dip in the space.

2538,DAL,"Declining air fares have hurt airline stocks for quite some time now. In fact, the ticket prices decreased in almost every month of 2016, with the sharpest decline recorded in July. The same has been weak in 2017 as well.Markedly, the August reading on air fares in the United States further highlights the scenario. Even though, the low air fares spell good news for fliers, it is likely to hurt the top line of airline companies.What the Data SaysAccording to data released by the Bureau of Transportation Services, in the United States average air fares (adjusted) in August fell 3.2% from the comparable figure a year ago. Notably, the August reading marked the second successive month of price weakness. Also, air fares decreased 6.1% (unadjusted) in the same month on a month-on-month basis.According to research firm Hopper, air fares (roundtrip) in the United States are likely hit a low of $216 in October. The reading in the current month is projected to be $217, down 2.1%, from the August figure.Price War Between Legacy and Low-Cost CarriersThe emergence and subsequent success of low-cost carriers like Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report), JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) and Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) have rung alarm bells as far as the likes of Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report), American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) are concerned. In fact, the price war has contributed to the softness in ticket prices.Furthermore, in a bid to attract budget conscious passengers, American Airlines and United Continental had introduced Basic Economy Fares (low-priced tickets) earlier in 2017. Recently, American Airlines expanded the offering in order to compete more effectively with low-cost carriers.In fact, United Continental acknowledged the price war with discount carriers like Spirit as one of the reasons behind trimming its passenger unit revenue guidance for the third quarter.Capacity OverexpansionCapacity overexpansion may lead to oversupply in the market and is one of the contributing factors behind suppressed air fares.The August traffic reports of the likes of JetBlue, Spirit and Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report) revealed that capacity expanded at a higher pace than traffic. Consequently, load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) declined in the month at the above- mentioned carriers. Currently, Allegiant Travel carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. The July traffic reports also unveiled declining load factors for most carriers.International Air Transport Association’s (“IATA”) forecast for 2017 further highlights the declining air fares in the United States. The association predicts capacity expansion of 4.4% in North America to be higher than 4% projected growth in passenger demand.Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % ReturnOil Prices Still WeakDespite the recent surge in oil prices, which might be due to affects of Harvey, the commodity is still trading at around $50 a barrel. We note that the level is way below the over $100 a barrel mark witnessed in 2014.According to Hopper, even though Jet fuel prices increased 8.5% in August to $1.54, the reading was approximately half the high witnessed in February 2014. Soft oil prices are being cited as one of the main reasons for declining air fares.Falling Airfares Contributes to Busy Labor DayThe sharp fall in air fares is an encouraging piece of news for fliers. In sync with this, soft ticket prices made air travel more affordable on Labour Day, thus attracting many fliers. This was, in fact, evident from the bullish Labor Day forecast by Airlines for America. According to the organization, approximately 16.1 million passengers were expected to be transported through U.S. airlines during the Labor Day holiday period this year, up 5% year over year.Per the IATA, inflation-adjusted airfare had fallen 1% on a year-over-year basis in the first half of 2017, which further substantiates softness in ticket prices in the United States.ConclusionGiven the present backdrop, we don’t expect an upsurge in ticket prices in the next few months. This, in turn, is likely to hurt the top line of airline stocks, thereby adding to the woes of carriers, which are already reeling under multiple tailwinds like high costs and weather-related disruptions. Whatever be the outcome, we anticipate investor focus to remain on this burning issue of air ticket prices, going forward.New Report: An Investor’s Guide to CybersecurityCyberattacks have become more frequent and destructive than ever.

2539,DAL,"In a move to further enhance shareholders' wealth, JetBlue Airways Corporation’s (JBLU  -  Free Report) board of directors approved a new share repurchase program. This latest move reflects the company’s sound financial position and favorable prospects.The new authorization permits JetBlue to buy back its common stock worth up to $750 million. The duration of the program, which commences from Jan 1, 2018, is of two years. As of Sep 30, 2017, the company had approximately 327.8 million shares outstanding. This low-cost carrier ended the third quarter of 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of nearly $394 million.Notably, management’s new authorization comes after JetBlue completed its previous $500 million share repurchase program in September, 2017. We note that the program had commenced on Jan 1, 2016.The latest buyback program, announced by this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is in sync with its impressive record of rewarding shareholders. On the third-quarter conference call, JetBlue stated that the company has returned in excess of 7% of its average market capitalization to its shareholders in a year. The figure is the second best among airline stocks, according to JetBlue. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.JetBlue Airways Corporation Price JetBlue Airways Corporation Price | JetBlue Airways Corporation QuoteApart from JetBlue, United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) also recently announced a new $3 billion share repurchase program. The company’s previous $2 billion share repurchase program announced in July 2016 is expected to be completed by this year-end. Additionally, the likes of Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) and Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) have hiked their respective dividend payouts this year.In fact, the financial prosperity of companies in the airline space has allowed them to undertake shareholder-friendly measures like dividends and buybacks. We believe such initiatives not only enhance shareholders’ return but also raise the market value of a stock.Through share repurchases and dividend payouts companies bolster investors’ confidence, persuading them to either buy or hold the scrip. Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

2540,DAL,"Earlier this month, Airlines for America (A4A), the industry trade organization for the leading U.S. airlines, issued a report saying that 51 million passengers are expected to fly globally on U.S. airlines during the upcoming 21-day winter holiday travel period.An additional 1.7 million people are expected to travel during this period (Dec 15 through Jan 4) compared to last year’s 49.3 million people, representing an increase of about 3.5%. The higher demand reflects an improving economy as well as affordable airfares.According to A4A, 91,000 additional seats will be made available by airlines every day across their networks so that the additional 80,000 daily passengers can be accommodated during this period. Airlines expect to use larger planes and add more flights during the upcoming holiday season. December 21, December 22 and December 26 are expected to be the busiest travel days of the winter holiday season while December 16, Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and New Year’s Eve are expected to be the lightest travel days.With the third quarter of 2017 being challenging for the airline industry due to competitive pricing actions, higher fuel costs, Hurricanes Irma and Harvey and the earthquake in Mexico City, focus will remain on how the industry fares during the holiday season. Here is a look at five U.S. airline stocks that will remain in focus during the 21-day winter holiday season.American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report): American Airlines, together with its wholly-owned regional airline subsidiaries and third-party regional carriers operating as American Eagle, operates an average of almost 6,700 flights daily spanning 350 destinations across more than 50 countries. The Fort Worth, TX-based company has hubs in Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix and Washington, DC.The company is investing in new aircraft and also working on driving efficiencies. American Airlines expects cost savings of $1 billion by 2021 on the back of increased use of technology, changes to process and procedures and further elimination of post-merger redundancies.Shares of American Airlines are up 7.3% year to date, compared to the 11.1% rally of the industry it belongs to.Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report): Dallas, TX-based Southwest Airlines is a major passenger airline providing scheduled air transportation in the United States and near-international markets. At the end of the third quarter, the company had 687 aircraft in its fleet, reflecting the third quarter delivery of six new 737-800 aircraft from Boeing, nine new 737 MAX 8 aircraft from Boeing, and six pre-owned Boeing 737-700 aircraft from third parties. The company, which is replacing its old aircraft, expects to take delivery of 11 new 737-800 aircraft, five new 737 MAX 8 aircraft, and four pre-owned 737-700 aircraft during the fourth quarter. Southwest Airlines expects to exit the year with a fleet of 707 aircraft with the number expected to increase to 750 by the end of 2018.Southwest Airlines reported a 3.4% increase in revenue passenger miles in November 2017 from the year-ago period and said that it now expects fourth quarter 2017 operating revenue per available seat mile (“RASM”) to increase in the 1-2% range from the year-ago period. The company had previously said (on the third quarter conference call) that fourth quarter RASM would be up slightly to up 1.5% year-over-year.Shares of Southwest Airlines are up 26.7% year to date, compared to the 11.1% rally of the industry it belongs to.United Airlines (UAL  -  Free Report): Chicago, IL-based United Airlines operates about 4,500 flights a day to 337 airports spanning five continents through United and its regional carriers. The company’s hubs in the United States include Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, Newark/New York, San Francisco and Washington, DC. While 751 mainline aircraft are run by United, the airline's United Express carriers operate 489 regional aircraft.The company recently reported that consolidated traffic (revenue passenger miles) increased 5.1% in November 2017. Moreover, the company witnessed the fewest cancelations of any month in its history and also set a new record with its best ever on-time arrival rate.Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report): Atlanta, GA-based Delta serves more than 180 customers every year. Delta and the Delta Connection carriers offer service to 306 destinations across 52 countries on six continents. Over the last five years, Delta has invested about $2 billion to build a franchise with some of the best airline brands around the world including Virgin Atlantic, AeroMexico, GOL, China Eastern with the latest being an investment in the Air France-KLM group. Key hubs and markets include Atlanta, Boston, Detroit, Los Angeles, Minneapolis-St. Paul, New York-JFK, New York-LaGuardia, Salt Lake City, Seattle, Amsterdam, London-Heathrow, Paris-Charles de Gaulle, and Tokyo-Narita.Shares of Delta are up 9% year to date, compared to the 11.1% rally of the industry it belongs to.JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report): JetBlue provides air transportation services across the United States, the Caribbean and Latin America with an average of 1,000 flights per day. Known as New York's Hometown Airline, JetBlue is the leading carrier in Boston, Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood, Los Angeles (Long Beach), Orlando, and San Juan. The company said that traffic in November increased 2.8% from the year-ago period.JetBlue also updated its outlook for the fourth quarter with RASM year-over-year growth expected to range between minus 0.5% and 1.5%. This compares favorably to the previously issued guidance of a decline between minus 3% and 0%. The company also expects the negative impact from the recent hurricanes to be less than what had been previously forecasted.While the stocks discussed above are all Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stocks, you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

2541,DAL,"Shares of SkyWest (SKYW  -  Free Report) scaled a 52-week high of $53.90 on Dec 11, before retracing a bit to close the session at $53.85. In fact, the stock has performed very well in the last six months. While SkyWest has rallied 43.6%, the Zacks Airline industry’s gained 1% in the same time frame. Catalysts Behind the UpsurgeSkyWest’s efforts to modernize its fleet and streamline operations are impressive. In sync with this, the company aims to reduce the 50-seat jets in its fleet and add new E175 aircraft.Additionally, this St. George, Utah-based carrier inked aircraft purchase and capacity purchase  deals with Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) and Alaska Air Group’s (ALK  -  Free Report) wholly-owned subsidiary, Alaska Airlines, in October 2017. Per the agreements, SkyWest’s wholly-owned subsidiary — SkyWest Airlines — will operate15 Embraer E175 SC aircraft (70 seats) and five Embraer E175 aircraft (76 seats) under Delta and Alaska Airlines, respectively.So far this year, the company has also witnessed a decline in block hours (a measure of aircraft utilization) due to its fleet transition efforts. The presence of E175 planes in its fleet resulted in approximately 139,200 additional block hours. However, the presence of other types of planes in its fleet resulted in a decline of approximately 232,500 block hours, causing the metric to fall 5.2% year to date.We note that it has been proven historically that an earnings surprise is reflective of the true health of a company. An impressive track record in this respect generally acts as a catalyst behind stock price appreciation. Also, earnings surprise history indicates a company’s consistency in beating market estimates. Generally, investors take into account a company’s upbeat earnings history while deciding to buy a stock. While arriving at this investment decision, they expect that it will continue reporting better-than-expected earnings per share in its next releases.In this context, the carrier’s impressive track record with respect to earnings per share seems to be encouraging.  SkyWest outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last 13 quarters. In the third quarter of 2017, this regional carrier performed very impressively reporting better-than-expected earnings and revenues. We expect the carrier to continue performing impressively on the bottom-line front in the near term as well.Moreover, the company’s efforts to reward shareholders through dividends and share buybacks raise optimism in the stock.  In February 2017, the company hiked its quarterly dividend by 60%. Also, SkyWest’s expansion-related efforts are impressive.The above bullish factors are reflected in the company’s Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), implying that it is expected to outperform the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Estimate Revisions & Style ScoreUpward estimate revisions reflect optimism in a stock’s prospects. SkyWest scores impressively on this front as well. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings being revised 4.5% upward over the last 90 days. Similarly, the consensus mark for current-year earnings has been revised 2.5% upward in the same time span.Additionally, the stock has an attractive VGM Score of A. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.Such a score allows investors to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score.Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy) offer the best upside potential.Taking into account the above-mentioned tailwinds and the favorable readings, we believe that the current price represents an attractive entry point for investors. The carrier’s bullish Zacks Rank also supports our view.Stock to ConsiderApart from SkyWest, investors interested in the airline space may also consider Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes S.A. (GOL  -  Free Report) sporting a Zacks Rank #1.Shares of Gol Linhas have soared more than 200% in a year. More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2542,DAL,"The Q3 earnings season is in full flow with earnings reports available from more than 135 S&P 500 companies. In fact the current week is an extremely busy one with 722 companies (including 180 S&P 500 players) slated to unveil their numbers during its course.Per the latest Earnings Preview, stocks in the highly sought-after fraternity are projected to end Q3 with their top and bottom lines expanding 5% and 2.6%, respectively. In fact, seven of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to witness their bottom line expand on a year-over-year basis.Rough Ride for Transports in Q3?The Zacks Transportation sector, does not share this rosy picture with the sectoral earnings projected to contract 14.9% due to higher costs and the recent hurricanes. In fact, the bottom line for key sectoral participants like Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) have contracted 7.6% and 28.6%, respectively, in Q3 on a year-over-year basis.Notably, the unfavorable projection for this widely-diversified sector highlights the fact it has been one of the worst victims of the natural disasters (Harvey, Irma, Maria and the earthquake in Mexico). For example, airline operators had to cancel multiple flights leading to significant loss in revenues.In fact, the negative impact of the hurricanes is also well reflected in the key transportation earnings reports available thus far. Evidently, United Continental Holdings had to cancel 8,300 flights in the quarter and consequently its third-quarter pretax income reduced to the tune of approximately $185 million.Additionally, these catastrophes have hurt operations of railroads by damaging important rail lines, leading to rapid increase in freight costs. Also, the sluggishness of the automotive unit is a cause of concern for railroads. For trucking companies, shortage of drivers remains a major headwind. Meanwhile, the rise in labor costs has hurt J.B. Hunt Transport Services’ (JBHT  -  Free Report) third-quarter results and the trend is likely to continue in the rest of Q3.Stocks to Watch for Earnings on Oct 26Given this backdrop, investors interested in the transportation space will keenly await Q3 reports from key sector participants like American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report), United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) and Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) that are scheduled for Oct 26.According to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise.American Airlines Group, headquartered in Fort Worth, TX, operates more than 6,700 daily flights to over 330 destinations in more than 50 nations across the globe. Of late, this carrier also underwent a turbulent phase like the other airlines, mainly due to the hurricanes.Consequently, the company called off approximately 8,000 flights in the third quarter. Also, increased costs (fuel and labor) are expected to hit the bottom line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter fuel price per gallon (including taxes) is pegged at $1.59, much higher than the $1.48 reported a year ago.Despite the disruptions, the scenario with respect to total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) is an improved one from the year-ago quarter, courtesy better-than-expected yields. For the third quarter, American Airlines expects total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) to grow between 0.5% and 1.5%.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter TRASM is pegged at 14.98 cents, higher than 14.73 cents reported in the third quarter of 2016. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter yields is pegged at 15.56 cents, higher than 15.27 cents reported in the third quarter of 2016.However, the chances of this legacy carrier beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in Q3 are less, even though it has an Earnings ESP of +0.53%. This is because American Airlines’ Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) acts as a spoiler.In fact, our model did not predict an earnings beat earlier as well. Previously, when we issued its Q3 earnings preview article, the company had an Earnings ESP of +1.41%, while the Zacks Rank remained the same.

The same for International Package revenues is pegged at $3,076 million, below the figure of $3,163 million reported in the second quarter of 2017. Also, high costs are likely to hurt the company’s bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter.According to our proven model, the chances of the company beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in this quarter are less, despite its Zacks Rank #3.

Additionally, growth in e-commerce is likely to benefit UPS.Meanwhile, Southwest Airlines’ third-quarter results are expected to be hurt due to the recent hurricanes and the earthquake in Mexico. These natural disasters have forced the airline to cancel approximately 5,000 flights. Owing to the multiple flight cancellations, the company expects the quarters’ operating revenues to be hurt to the tune of $100 million.Increased costs are expected to hurt the bottom line as well. Cost per available seat miles, excluding special items, is estimated to increase between 3% and 4%. Fuel price per gallon is anticipated between $2.00 and $2.05 in the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter fuel price is pegged at $2.00 per gallon, higher than $1.93 reported in the second quarter of 2017.According to our proven model, the chances of the company beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in this quarter are less.

2543,DAL,"The Q3 earnings season is picking up pace with multiple companies reporting earnings everyday. According to the latest Earnings Preview, by the end of this week 267 S&P 500 companies will release their quarterly numbers. Out of them, 180 will be reporting during the course of this week.Per the report, the entire S&P 500 fraternity is projected to end the Q3 reporting cycle with bottom-line growth of 2.6% on a year-over-year basis. The same set of companies is projected to witness top-line growth to the tune of 5%.  These projections compare unfavorably with the readings in Q2, when revenues increased 5.5% and earnings expanded 11.2%. In fact, the timid Q3 projections are reflective of the headwinds including back-to-back hurricanes (Harvey, Irma and Maria) and the devastating Mexico earthquake.The highly diversified Zacks Transportation sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) has been hit severely by the above mentioned natural disasters as well. This is because the sector includes travel focussed stocks such as airlines. Markedly, the gloomy picture for this sector is reflected by declining earnings projection for Q3 to the tune of 14.9% year over year. The estimated growth in revenues is pegged at a modest 4.5% compared with an impressive growth of 10.1% in Q2.Turbulence Awaits Airlines in Q3?Given that the airline stocks form an integral part of the transportation sector, it is needless to say that this particular space is undergoing a rough phase mainly due to the natural calamities. Even though the likes of Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) have outperformed in Q3, results of these carriers have been hit hard by the hurricanes.Evidently, Delta's pre-tax income was reduced to the tune of $120 million in the third-quarter due to Irma as it had to call of multiple flights. Meanwhile, United Continental cancelled 8,300 flights owing to Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Consequently, its third-quarter pre-tax income was hurt to the tune of approximately $185 million.Moreover, surging costs (fuel as well as labor) have resulted in year-over-year bottom-line contractions for both these legacy carriers. Of late, fuel costs are on the rise with oil prices crossing the $50 a barrel threshold mark. This upsurge can be attributed to the improving demand outlook for the commodity and OPEC deal extension talks. The trend is expected to continue in the remainder of Q3 with high costs hurting the bottom line of carriers.In fact, unfavorable scenario substantiates the bearish Zacks Industry Rank of 245 (out of 250 plus groups) carried by the Zacks Airline industry. This unfavorable rank places the companies in the bottom 4% of the Zacks industries.In this adverse situation, investors interested in the airline space will keenly await Q3 reports from key sector participants like Alaska Air Group (ALK  -  Free Report),Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report) and SkyWest Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report) on Oct 25.According to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase its odds of an earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Alaska Air Group together with its partner regional carriers serves more than 100 cities across North America. Based in Seattle, WA, this airline company is not expected to report better-than-expected earnings per share in this quarter.The carrier's bottom line is expected to be hurt by high costs.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter fuel price per gallon is 1.77, higher than the 1.71 reported in the second quarter of 2017.In fact, our proven model too does not conclusively show that Alaska Air Group is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because the company has an Earnings ESP of -4.02% (the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.32 per share is currently pegged at nine cents above the Most Accurate estimate) and a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Our model did not predict an earnings beat earlier too.

As is the case with Alaska Air, Allegiant Travel Company’s bottom line is also expected to be hurt by escalated costs.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel (CASM-ex fuel), is 7.01 cents, 9.2% higher than the figure reported in the second quarter of 2017. The company expects the metric to grow between 16.7% and 17.1% in the to-be-reported quarter.In fact, our proven model too does not conclusively show earnings beat for this Las Vegas-based company in Q3. This is because Allegiant Travel has an Earnings ESP of -4.76% (the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.37 per share is currently pegged at six cents above the Most Accurate estimate) and a Zacks Rank #5 (read more: Will Rising Costs Affect Allegiant's Q3 Earnings?).Allegiant Travel Company Price and EPS Surprise  Allegiant Travel Company Price and EPS Surprise | Allegiant Travel Company Quote SkyWest, through its subsidiaries, operates a regional airline in the United States. This St. George, UT-based carrier is focused on streamlining its operations. Going forward, the carrier aims to reduce the 50-seat jets in its fleet and add new E175 aircraft.  Notably, a reduction in block hours (a measure of aircraft utilization) is in sync with its fleet transition plans.Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter block hours is 468,860, 5% lower than the figure reported a year ago. In fact, the same for third-quarter consolidated capacity (measured in available seat miles) is 8,516 million, approximately 2% lower than the figure reported in the previous year.However, according to our proven model this SkyWest has less chances of beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter, despite its Zacks Rank #3.

2544,DAL,"Airline hubs are specific airports that an airline company uses as a transfer sport to get travelers to their intended destination. This system is part of the spoke-hub transportation model, which has been favored by many airlines since the industry was deregulated in 1978. The model consists of a system of connections in which all airline traffic moves across spokes linked to the hub at the center.For example, Denver and Los Angeles represent hubs, with many spokes reaching outward to other cities. The purpose of this model is simple: to save airlines money and to provide passengers better routes to their selected destinations. Today, most airlines have at least one main airport that their flights must travel through, and from there, the flights go outwards on different network spokes.So which airlines dominate which airports? Let’s take a look at seven major U.S. airlines, and see where their hubs are located.American Airlines (AAL  -  Free Report)The world’s largest airline by fleet size and revenue, American Airlines has been an industry staple since its formation in 1930. The company is headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, and since its merger with US Airways in 2013, American Airlines operates nine domestic hubs:Dallas-Fort Worth International AirportCharlotte-Douglas International AirportChicago O’Hare International AirportPhiladelphia International AirportPhoenix Sky Harbor International AirportMiami International AirportRonald Reagan Washington International AirportLos Angeles AirportNew York City’s John F. Kennedy International Airport Alaska Airlines (ALK  -  Free Report)Alaska Airlines is American airline founded back in 1932. Originally offering flights from Anchorage, Alaska, the airlines today has flights to more than 100 destinations including Alaska, Hawaii, Canada, Costa Rica, and Mexico. Alaska Airlines’ fleet consists of mostly Boeing (BA) 737 aircraft, as well as Bombardier and Embraer planes. The company has three main hubs:Seattle-Tacoma International AirportPortland International AirportTed Stevens Anchorage International AirportAnd two focus cities:San Diego International AirportSan Jose International Airport Delta Airlines (DAL  -  Free Report)Like American, Delta has been present in the U.S. airline industry for decades. It began carrying passengers in 1929, and has grown rapidly since then due to many airline mergers. Headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, Delta operates 10 domestic hubs:Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International AirportDetroit Metropolitan Wayne County AirportCincinnati/Northern Kentucky International AirportJFK International AirportNew York City’s La Guardia AirportBoston Logan International AirportLos Angeles International AirportMinneapolis-St. Paul International AirportSalt Lake City International AirportSeattle-Tacoma International AirportAnd three international hubs:Amsterdam Airport SchipholTokyo Narita International AirportParis-Charles de Gaulle Airport Frontier AirlinesFounded in 1994, Frontier Airlines is a popular, privately-held, ultra-low-cost carrier headquartered in Denver Colorado. It recently announced a huge route expansion, and Frontier is adding 21 new destinations and 85 new routes to its network. Additionally, Frontier is adding dozens of non-stop flights between other cities that it already serves. With this network increase, Frontier’s route map will grow to 82 cities by next summer. The airline operates out of one main hub:Denver International AirportAnd seven focus cities:Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International AirportCleveland Hopkins International AirportHartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International AirportLas Vegas’ McCarran International AirportOrlando International AirportPhiladelphia International AirportTrenton-Mercer Airport JetBlue Airways (JBLU  -  Free Report)JetBlue is a popular low-cost airline option headquartered in Long Island in New York City. It serves 97 destinations in the U.S., Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America, and South America. JetBlue was founded in 1998, and primarily uses Airbus and Embraer aircraft. JetBlue utilizes the old0fashioned point-to-point system, which carries passengers short distances with few connecting flights, the airline operates out of six domestic focus cities:JFK International AirportFort Lauderdale-Hollywood International AirportBoston Logan International AirportLong Beach AirportSan Juan’s Luis Munoz Marin International AirportOrlando International Airport Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report)Touted as the world’s largest low-cost carrier, Southwest Airlines was launched in 1967 and is known for its Rapid Rewards frequent-flyer program. Its headquarters is in Dallas, Texas. While Southwest does not use the hub and spoke transportation model (it prefers the point-to-point system like JetBlue) the airline still operates out of 10 major domestic cities:Chicago Midway International AirportBaltimore-Washington International AirportMcCarran International AirportDallas Love Field AirportDenver International AirportPhoenix Sky Harbor International AirportHouston’s William P. Hobby AirportHartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International AirportOrlando International AirportLos Angeles International Airport United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report)Headquartered in Chicago, United Continental Holdings is an airline holding company for United Airlines and Continental Airlines, which formed in a merger back in 2010. Operating more than 700 mainline aircraft, United Continental needs a lot of hubs. The airline company has nine hubs in total, eight domestic:Chicago O’Hare International AirportHouston’s George Bush Intercontinental AirportDenver International AirportLos Angeles International AirportNewark Liberty International AirportSan Francisco International AirportWashington Dulles International AirportGuam A.B. Wan Pat International AirportAnd one international:Tokyo Narita International Airport As you can see, these seven major airlines overlap in their hub or major operating city locations nationwide, which can be looked at as a positive thing for frequent travelers. The hub and spoke model offers each airline (even Southwest and JetBlue) a way to replace a high number of half-empty routes with fewer, fuller ones, leading to less delays and a wide variety of connections.<!--{cke_protected}{C}%3C!%2D%2Dtd%20%7Bborder%3A%201px%20solid%20%23ccc%3B%7Dbr%20%7Bmso-data-placement%3Asame-cell%3B%7D%2D%2D%3E-->Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2545,DAL,"Shares of United (UAL  -  Free Report) sunk over 11% on Thursday after the airline announced it will continue to expand its flying capacity amid a rise in overall operating expenses.United, one of the largest U.S. airline companies, reported third-quarter earnings and revenues that beat expectations on Wednesday—in the face of the recent series of tropical storms and hurricanes that forced the company to cancel thousands of flights (also read: United Continental (UAL  -  Free Report) Q3 Earnings & Revenues Top Estimates).United canceled 8,300 flights due to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, which cost the company an estimated $185 million and helped lead to a 0.4% decline in revenues. On top of that, the company’s earnings plummeted 29.6%, while net income sunk 34%.Tropical storms clearly damaged the Chicago-based airline giant’s bottom line. But what has investors worried isn’t the wave of hurricanes, it’s the increased competition that has forced the airline company’s costs to rise.United’s operating expenses climbed 6% to $8.8 billion in the third quarter, while consolidated unit cost per available seat mile rose 3%. The company cited higher labor expenses and fuel costs as a reason for the big jump in these costs.The company’s passenger revenues per available seat mile also fell well over 3%. And United now projects its unit revenues will sink between 1% and 3% in its fourth quarter.Consequently, United will reportedly bump up capacity by 3.5% in the fourth quarter, in order to maintain its market share at major airport hubs.The move comes amid shrinking profits as low-cost airlines, such as Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report), drive down ticket costs and lure passengers away from larger, more expensive carriers.Investors now fear that United will have a harder time boosting its bottom line as it spends more to fight off the new wave of competition. Shares of United fell on Wednesday and now rest about 28% below their 52-week high. United is currently a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Other Airlines United’s struggle to increase profits amid greater competition caused turbulence throughout the U.S. airline industry—where even its new, low-cost opponents sunk on Thursday as the fight for passengers heats up.Shares of Spirit tanked over 3.70%, while fellow budget-minded carriers JetBlue (JBLU  -  Free Report) and Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) saw their stock prices dip marginally. Big U.S. airline companies Delta (DAL  -  Free Report) and American Airlines (AAL  -  Free Report) sank 1% and 2%, respectively. The US Global Jets ETF (JETS  -  Free Report) suffered a 1.30% decline.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2547,DAL,"Shares of American Airlines (AAL  -  Free Report) climbed on Tuesday morning after the company received a significant analyst upgrade. Now, will the rest of the industry follow suit?J.P. Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report) analyst Jamie Baker upgraded American Airlines to “neutral” from “overweight” in a note to clients on Tuesday. Baker also increased his price target for the airline company to $61 per share from $52 per share—which represents a jump of over 20% from Monday’s close.American Airlines shares gained 2.3% premarket, but the stock is now only up marginally through morning trading. The airline has had an up and down year and sits roughly $3 below its 52-week high of $54.48 per share, which it reached in mid-July.American Airlines beat both earnings and revenue estimates when it reported its second-quarter earnings on July 28. But the positive report didn’t send the stock soaring.The U.S. airline industry suffered as a whole from less than stellar second-quarter earnings reports—United Continental (UAL  -  Free Report) and Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report) were both down more than 10% in July. Yet, today, American Airlines is up because J.P. Morgan’s Baker notes that the industry could be prepared to turn things around overall.""Cost convergence, fare unbundling, widespread consolidation, diminished new entrant activity, and return-oriented management teams have combined to form an industry that is actually managing itself for the first time we can recall,"" Baker wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. ""We believe the US airline industry will continue to take steps to ensure profitability and continued balance sheet repair.""The analyst also raised American Airlines 2018 earnings per share estimate to $6.20 per share from $5.47 per share.""American is in the midst of several revenue accretive initiatives including an expansion of Basic Economy and higher paid load factors in the domestic premium cabin, and we believe these initiatives will drive higher returns and stronger unit revenue,"" he continued.American Airlines is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and scored an “A” grade for both Value and Growth, as well as a “B” for Momentum in our Zacks Style Score system.Airline Industry Today’s American Airlines upgrade has helped some of the rest of the sector as well. Spirit (SAVE  -  Free Report) jumped 4.48% in early Tuesday morning trading. United (UAL  -  Free Report), Southwest (LUV  -  Free Report), Delta (DAL  -  Free Report), and JetBlue (JBLU  -  Free Report) all saw marginal gains.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

2548,DAL,"The stock market is marching higher, hitting multiple fresh highs amid Washington turmoil, geopolitical risks and lofty valuation. In such a scenario, dividend investing seems a perfect choice. These cash payouts are major sources of consistent income for investors when returns from the equity market are at risk.In particular, stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth as opposed to those that pay high yields form a healthy portfolio with more scope for capital appreciation.Why Dividend Growth Investing Is Better?Dividend growth stocks offer the best of both worlds –– potential for capital appreciation and rising income even in a volatile market. This is because these stocks belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, while simultaneously offer outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis irrespective of the market direction.Dividend growth reflects a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. All these superior fundamentals make dividend growth stocks quality and promising investments for the long term. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that hike is likely in the future.Though these stocks have a long history of outperformance compared with the broader stock market or any other dividend paying stock, it does not necessarily mean that they have the highest yields.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3–5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past one year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment.VGM Style Score of B or better: This is simply a weighted combination of Value, Growth and Momentum. This when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 offers the best upside potential.Here are six of the 24 stocks that fit the bill:Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report): This Georgia-based company is America's fastest growing international carrier that provides scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo in the United States and internationally.

2549,DAL,"The airline industry has been struggling of late, especially from the back-to-back impact of Harvey and Irma. The airline stocks are lying low as investors begin to worry over their ability to recoup losses incurred from the onslaughts of successive calamities.Another source of pessimism surrounding the stocks comes in the form of persistent high labor costs. The rise in fuel costs is also worrisome for airlines.Harvey & Irma ImpactsHurricanes Harvey and Irma have had devastating effect on the airline industry. Thousands of flights were canceled and fuel costs inflated. As was widely expected, United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report), the parent company of United Airlines, was the worst hit from Harvey as Houston is the carrier’s second-largest hub. More than 7,400 flights were called off at George Bush Intercontinental Airport, with operations suspended at the airport due to the inclement storm for more than four days.With the onset of Irma on the other hand, JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU  -  Free Report) is expected to be the worst hit. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has two hubs at Orlando and Fort Lauderdale, apart from Puerto Rico. Following Irma, the carrier cancelled more than 860 flights. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Bleak Third-Quarter ForecastsSeveral airlines companies have trimmed their third-quarter outlook, primarily due to the impact of the natural disasters.Most recently, American Airlines (AAL  -  Free Report) lowered guidance for the third quarter due to Irma’s devastating strike. The company now anticipates third-quarter 2017 total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) in the range of flat to up 1% year over year. Previous projection had called for a 0.5-2.5% rise in the metric. Due to higher fuel costs for the quarter, the company currently estimates third-quarter 2017 pre-tax margin, excluding special items, to vary between 8.5-10.5%. The prior view was in the range of 10-12%.Other major airline companies like United Continental Holdings, Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report), JetBlue Airways Corporation and Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) have also reduced projections for the third quarter.Persistent High Labor CostsSteep labor costs have been hurting the airline stocks for quite some time now. In fact, the future scenario also seems grim and might hurt the third-quarter results as well.Zacks Industry Rank Highlights the Drab ScenarioThe Zacks Industry Rank of 160 (out of 250 plus groups) carried by the Zacks Airline industry further highlights the woes of airlines. This unfavorable rank places the companies in the bottom 38% of the Zacks industries.We classify our entire 250-plus industries into two groups: the top half (i.e. industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Over the last 10 years, using a week’s rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Click here to know more: About Zacks Industry RankPrice PerformanceThe dull outlook of the airlines is evident from the fact that the Zacks Airline Industry has underperformed the broader market in the last three months. While the S&P 500 Index has gained 2.4%, the industry declined 1.4%.4 Airline Stocks to DumpKeeping the above-mentioned headwinds in view, we have zeroed in on four stocks that investors would do better to eliminate from their portfolio.Spirit Airlines, Inc. operates an airline based in Fort Lauderdale, providing travel opportunity principally to and from South Florida, the Caribbean as well as Latin America. The company based in Miramar, FL currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and has a VGM Score of C. The earnings per share growth rate for the next five years is 8% for the company. The reading compares unfavorably with the industry’s 9.1%.The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings being reduced 35.9% in the last 60 days. For full-year 2017, the same has been lowered 22.6% during the same period.Also, the company has been lately grappling with pilot related dispute. Consequently, the carrier had to withdraw multiple flights resulting in customer dissatisfaction.Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report) is a holding company of primarily Alaska Airlines, Virgin America and Horizon Air Industries. The company based in SeaTac, WA carries a Zacks Rank #5 and a Momentum Score of F. The earnings per share growth rate of the company for the next five years is 6.3%. The reading compares unfavorably with the reading of 9.1% for the industry.The  Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings has been cut 9.6% in the last 90 days. For full-year 2017, the same has been slashed 4% over the same period.LATAM Airlines Group S.A. offers domestic and international passenger plus cargo air services. The Santiago, Chile-based company carries a Zacks Rank #5 and a VGM score of D.The company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year 2017 earnings has been decreased 34.1% in the last 90 days.International Consolidated Airlines Group SA is the holding company for British Airways and Iberia, catering to scheduled passenger and cargo airline services. The company based in Harmondsworth, United Kingdom, carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). The carrier’s earnings per share growth rate for the coming five years is 5.2%, which too compares unfavorably with the industry’s 9.1% increase.5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.See these buy recommendations now >>

2550,DAL,"Last week witnessed that quite a few key airline players including the likes of United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) and American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) trim their respective projections on current-quarter unit revenues. This was mainly due to weather-related disruptions and the rising fuel prices.Notably, Irma gradually has been losing intensity and the damage caused by it has been less severe on Florida than projected. The likes of Alaska Air Group ALK and American Airlines also unveiled their respective traffic data for August during the week. Also, Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) grabbed headlines by virtue of its expansion related update.On the price front, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index climbed 4.7% to $108.59 over the past week as airline stocks regained strength following Irma’s loss of steam. Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return(Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Sep 06, 2017).Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1. United Continental Holdings, the parent company of United Airlines, has been the worst hit as Houston is the carrier’s second-largest hub. In fact, more than 7,400 flights were cancelled at George Bush Intercontinental Airport, with operations suspended at the airport, for more than four days.The company trimmed its views with respect to pre-tax margin and passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM: a key measure of unit revenue) for the current quarter mainly due to Harvey at the Cowen and Company Global Transportation Conference.The Chicago-based carrier now expects PRASM to decline between 3% and 5% year over year (the earlier guidance provided in July had called for the metric to be in the range of +1% to -1%). In fact, Harvey has impacted the current-quarter PRASM to the tune of approximately 150 basis points. Also, the carrier anticipates pre-tax margin between 8% and 10% (previous guidance had called for the metric to be in the range of 12.5% to 14.5%). Higher fuel prices are further expected to hurt the bottom line in the third quarter (read more: Harvey Impact on Airlines: United Continental Hit the Most).On a separate note, United Continental announced its intention to start nonstop flights operating daily between its Houston hub and Sydney from Jan 18, 2018. The service once operational, should be warmly welcomed by passengers as it broadens their options of reaching Sydney from Houston. The flight, first connecting Houston to Australia, will be the second-longest for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) carrier spanning 8,596 miles. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.2. Delta Air Lines will collaborate with partner Air France to introduce a nonstop trans-Atlantic service from Indianapolis to its European hub at Paris Charles de Gaulle. The service is expected to be operational from May 24, 2018. Additionally, the company will operate flights connecting Indianapolis and Paris on a Boeing 767-300ER aircraft (read more: Delta Air Lines to Initiate Indianapolis-Paris Service).3. At Southwest Airlines, traffic (measured in revenue passenger miles) rose 5.3% in August. Load factor (the percentage of seats filled by passengers) improved 30 basis points to 84.9% in the same month as traffic growth outpaced capacity expansion (4.9%). The Dallas-based carrier, which had to call off approximately 2,800 flights due to Harvey, now expects operating revenue per available seat mile (RASM) in the range of down 1% to slightly up, on a year-over-year basis. The metric was earlier projected to increase approximately 1% from the year-ago quarter. (read more: Southwest Airlines August Traffic Up, Q3 RASM View Bearish).4. While traffic at American Airlines improved 3.7% in August, capacity expanded 3.2%.  Load factor increased 40 basis points to 86.3% as capacity expansion was outpaced by traffic growth. In fact, the company that has significant exposure to Florida including its hub at Miami International Airport had to cancel multiple flights due to Irma. The natural calamity also caused it to trim its current-quarter total revenue per available seat miles (TRASM) view.Consequently, the key unit revenue metric is now expected to be approximately flat to up 1% year over year (the earlier guidance had called for an increase between 0.5% and 2.5%). With fuel costs on the rise, the carrier anticipates pre-tax margin (excluding special items) in the band of 8.5% to 10.5% for the third quarter compared with the previous guidance of 10% to 12%. American Airlines expects to perform better with respect to TRASM in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with the current quarter.5. Traffic at Alaska Air Group increased 5.8% to 4.78 billion in August. On a year-over-year basis, consolidated capacity rose 5.5% to 5.55 billion. Also, the load factor improved to 86.2% from 85.8% recorded in August 2016, as traffic growth exceeded capacity expansion (read more: Alaska Air Group Delivers Impressive August Traffic Data).6. August traffic at Hawaiian Airlines — the wholly owned subsidiary of Hawaiian Holdings (HA  -  Free Report) — inched up 1% while capacity shrunk 1.1%. Load factor increased 180 basis points to 86.2% in the same month as traffic expanded and capacity contracted (read more: Hawaiian Holdings Arm Posts Impressive August Traffic Data).Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months. CompanyPast WeekLast 6 monthsHA-3.8%-18.9%UAL4%-12.3%GOL-0.1%46.9%DAL8%3.6%JBLU4.3%-1.3%AAL4.2%9.3%SAVE7.5%-31.9%LUV6.3%-1%CPA3.4%24.3%ALK6.2%-21%                  The table above shows that most airline stocks traded in the green in the past week leading to the NYSE ARCA Airline Index’s significant gain.

2551,DAL,"Stocks in the airline space have been struggling lately due to multiple headwinds like higher fuel costs and the havoc created by Harvey. However, major sector participants breathed a sigh of relief as the impact of Irma was not as severe as forecasted in Florida. In fact, Irma has been downgraded to a tropical depression.Carriers Fly High Led by American AirlinesBuoyed by the weaker-than-expected impact, most airline stocks flew high on Sept. 11 after being grounded lately. Major gainers included the likes of American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report), Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report), United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU  -  Free Report) and Alaska Air Group (ALK  -  Free Report).With a high proportion of sector participants trading in the green, it was of little surprise that the NYSE ARCA Airline Index had a field day. The sector tracker ended the trading session at $107.69, up 2% from the closing price on Sep 8. In fact, the rally was not limited to airline stocks as major indices gained handsomely. The S&P 500 gained 1.1% to close the trading session at a record 2,488.11 with American Airlines leading the show. The Dow Jones Industrial average treaded past the 22,000 mark for the first time since mid-August. The Nasdaq Composite Index also closed at 6,432, gaining 1.1%.The surge was mainly owing to the change in course of Irma. Consequently, Miami and Orlando escaped the projected extreme devastation as the storm moved westward. Markedly, American Airlines, which has significant exposure to Florida and operates multiple flights from Charlotte and Miami on a daily basis, was naturally a big benefactor. The stock gained 5.2%, ending the trading session at $45.86.Delta and American Airlines Bullish on Q4In September 2017, many airline stocks including the likes of United Continental and Southwest Airlines had trimmed their respective unit revenue projections for the current quarter with the Harvey-induced revenue loss being the main culprit. The rise in fuel costs, which again may be Harvey-induced, also has not helped matters.However, airline heavyweights — Delta and American Airlines — sounded bullish regarding their prospects in the final quarter of the year.Last week, at the Cowen Global Transportation Conference, American Airlines had declared that it expects to perform better with respect to total revenue per available seat miles (TRASM: a key measure of unit revenue) in the fourth quarter compared with the current quarter.Moreover, the carrier forecasted lower year-over-year growth with respect to another key metric — cost per available seat miles — excluding fuel and other special items. The metric is expected to grow at approximately only 3% in the final quarter compared with the 5% growth projected in the current quarter.Delta also appeared to be optimistic about a rebound in the fourth quarter at the same investor conference, on the back of healthy demand for leisure travel. The bullish commentary of two of the biggest airline players in the United States bodes well for the sector, indicating that all is not lost with a rebound possible from the recent struggles.Both Delta and American Airlines carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks Industry Rank Holds Out HopeThe Zacks Industry Rank of 87 (out of 250 plus groups) carried by the Zacks Airline industry further highlights the fact that despite the recent struggles, the sector remains an attractive investment option. Notably, the favorable rank places the companies in the top 34% of the Zacks industries.We put our entire 250-plus industries into two groups: the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Over the last 10 years, using a one-week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Click here to know more: About Zacks Industry RankValuation Signals More UpsideThe impressive Zacks Industry Rank is well supported by the segment’s attractive valuation. Going by the EV-to-EBITDA (enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) ratio, which is often used to value airline stocks, given their significant debt levels and high depreciation and amortization expenses, the industry doesn’t look expensive at this point.The industry currently has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 7.6, which is better than what the industry saw in the last five years. The ratio is almost near the low end of 5.1 during the period.Additionally, the reading compares favorably with the market at large, as the current EV/EBITDA for the S&P 500 is at 10.9 and the median level is 9.4. The industry’s favorable positioning compared to the overall market certainly signals more upside as well. More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2552,DAL,"Stocks in the airline space are no doubt going through tough times. After being hurt by Harvey, the companies are likely to be negatively impacted by another natural calamity – Hurricane Irma – which is currently approaching the state of Florida.Notably, Irma, which has already caused untold devastation in the Caribbean, is expected to hit the shores of Florida this weekend.Airline Stocks GroundedOn Sep 7, key airline stocks lost value with multiple flights being cancelled due to Irma.JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) was the worst hit with the stock declining 3.2% to close the trading session at $18.25.In fact, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has significant exposure to Florida, with two hubs in the state — Orlando and Fort Lauderdale. JetBlue also has a hub in Puerto Rico.  Moreover, this low-cost carrier has cancelled more than 860 flights on Sep 11. Hence, Irma is expected hit the stock severely. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Again, United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report), which has already cancelled many flights and likely to call off many more to and from southern Florida airports in the next few days, saw its stock price tumble 2.9% to $58.58. Markedly, the stock has taken a pounding lately, with it being hit the hardest by Harvey.  Consequently, the company unveiled a bearish forecast with respect to passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) mainly due to Harvey.Other major losers in the space included the likes of American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report), Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. (HA  -  Free Report), Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report) and Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report). With major sector participants declining, it was of little wonder that the NYSE ARCA Airline Index declined 0.3% on Sep 7 over the previous day’s closing price.In fact, the likes of American Airlines and Delta have also cancelled many flights due to the approaching Irma. The spate of flight cancellations follows the multiple cancellations due to Harvey.Issue Regarding Ticket PricesWithresidents of the state trying their best to flee to safety in a bid to escape the havoc, which is likely to unleash on Florida, airline companies are apparently charging high prices for tickets on flights to and from therein. This has landed them in a controversy on ticket prices, even though the likes of JetBlue have capped flights out of Florida at $99.Weather-related issues have hurt airlines previously too. In March 2017, operations at carriers were disrupted big time by winter storm Stella. Moreover, this January, an icy winter storm ravaged the Southeast U.S. cities. It also disrupted the flight schedules of airlines, thereby causing undue harassment. Last year, Hurricane Matthew had also caused extensive damage in the affected areas. Such acts of nature throw the schedules of carriers out of gear, causing multiple flight cancellations.The stocks in the airline space have also been hit hard by other headwinds like high labor and fuel costs. The disastrous impact of Harvey has further complicated matters. Now, with Irma approaching there seems to be little respite for the sector in the near term.Price PerformanceIn view of the above headwinds, it is of little wonder that the Zacks Airline industry underperformed the broader market in the last three months. The S&P 500 Index gained 1.2%, as against the industry’s decline of 5.3%.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2553,DAL,"Hurricane Irma has already hammered some of the Caribbean and is currently on a collision course for Florida, with landfall expected this weekend. Many people have already fled the area, and airline stocks are moving lower as investors begin to worry that they won’t be able to recoup the losses caused by Harvey and Irma.Irma UpdateHurricane Irma has already killed at least 10 people in the Caribbean and caused massive power outages in Puerto Rico. The Category 5 hurricane continues to make its way through the tropical island area towards the continental U.S.The National Hurricane Center recently updated its assessment of Irma and outlined details of the tropical storm’s likely path, stating that in all likelihood the storm will hit Florida soon.“The threat of direct hurricane impacts in Florida over the weekend and early next week continues to increase.

Thousands of flights were canceled due to Harvey, and now it seems that trend will likely continue as Irma makes its way towards Florida.On Wednesday, United (UAL  -  Free Report) projected that its unit revenues will decline more than previously expected in the third quarter, citing bothHurricane Harvey and a price war with low-cost airliners as major reasons (also read: Here's Why United Stock Fell Today).Harvey-related inflated fuel prices, thousands of canceled flights, and goodwill-related price caps on flights out of Florida have caused shares of major U.S. airlines, including the biggest carriers, to fall on Thursday.Shares of United sank by 1.86%, while American Airlines (AAL  -  Free Report) dropped by 1.02%. Delta (DAL  -  Free Report) saw its stock price fall by 0.50%. These major airlines sent shares of the US Global Jets ETF (JETS  -  Free Report) down marginally.Hawaiian Holdings (HA  -  Free Report) shares fell by over 1.14%, and JetBlue (JBLU  -  Free Report), which capped flights out of Florida at $99.00, saw its stock price tank by nearly 3%.However, shares of smaller airlines and discount carriers such as Southwest (LUV  -  Free Report), Spirit (SAVE  -  Free Report), and Alaskan (ALK  -  Free Report) have already fought their way back from morning dips to see marginal gains on Thursday.Also, shares of major cruise line stocks, Carnival (CCL  -  Free Report), Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH  -  Free Report), and Royal Caribbean (RCL  -  Free Report) all fell marginally.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

"
2555,DAL,"Shares of Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) have lately been on an uptrend. The stock has registered gains of 14.5%, comfortably outpacing the Zacks Airline industry’s 9.5% growth over the last three months.Continuing the trend, this Atlanta, GA-based airline behemoth presented a rosy picture at its Investor Day, particularly with respect to passenger unit revenues. The stock gained 2.9% on Dec 14, to close the trading session at $5516, after the update.The carrier issued an encouraging outlook for passenger revenue per available seat miles (PRASM: a key measure of unit revenue) for the current quarter and expects the metric to improve by approximately 4% (the earlier outlook on the metric had called for an improvement in the band of 2% to 4%). Delta expects to perform well on this front in 2018 as well, with PRASM growth estimated in each quarter. We note that Delta is not the only carrier to unveil a bullish unit revenue view for the fourth quarter. Fellow airline players like United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) and JetBlue Airways (JBLU  -  Free Report) have done the same recently.Delta, however, said at the event that due to high fuel costs, the company expects operating margin for the fourth quarter to be approximately 11%, the lowest point of its previously guided range of 11% to 13%. Fuel price per gallon, inclusive of taxes and refinery impact, are now projected between $1.92 and $1.97 (the previous view had projected the metric in the band of $1.82 and $1.87).The carrier expects normalized non-fuel unit costs, including profit sharing expenses, in the band of 5% to 5.5% in the current quarter mainly due to “continued investment in our people and product combined with accelerated depreciation of aircraft retirements.” The metric was earlier projected to grow in the range of 4% to 5%. Capacity is expected to grow in the band of 2.5% to 3% in the final quarter of 2017.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) carrier also sounded confident about performing well in 2018. It expects to end 2018 with earnings per share in the band of $5.35 to 5.70. The projection is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.41 per share. The tax reforms, on materialization, are likely to boost Delta’s 2018 bottom line in the range of $1-1.25. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The carrier expects to bring down the non-fuel unit cost growth to the range of 0% and 2% (excluding profit sharing) in 2018, thereby aiding its bottom line. Through its prudent cost management, the carrier intends to reduce the growth of the metric below 2% over the long term.Delta also stated that it remains focused on rewarding its shareholders with dividends and buybacks. The carrier expects to return approximately $2.4 billion to its shareholders this year. Moreover, it intends to return at least 70% of free cash flow to its investors in 2018. Over the long term, the carrier aims to return 20% to 25% of free cash flow to its investors through dividends.Moreover, the carrier is constantly looking to modernize its fleet. To this end, it announced the decision to buy 100 Airbus A321neo narrow-body planes. Delta has the option to buy 100 more similar jets under the deal. Delivery of the new entrants to Delta’s fleet is expected to start in the first quarter of 2020, continuing till 2023. In fact, Delta expects capital spending levels of approximately $ 4 billion in 2018, up from the estimated $3.7 billion in 2017, with the lion’s share being spent on aircraft.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

2556,DAL,"In the past week, airline behemoth Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) issued a bleak outlook with respect to passenger unit revenue and operating margin for the third quarter of 2017. Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report) also unveiled a bearish current-quarter view with respect to total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM: a key measure of unit revenue) mainly due to the disruptions induced by Harvey.Additionally, Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY  -  Free Report) unveiled its London schedule for the summer of 2018 in the same period. The Irish carrier, however, reiterated its Brexit-related fears.The week also saw a customer-friendly announcement from Alaska Air Group’s (ALK  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Alaska Airlines, because the company aims to form a codeshare agreement with Singapore Airlines.As if the disruptions caused by Harvey were not enough, Hurricane Irma has offered a fresh challenge to the airline companies. In fact, this latest natural calamity already resulted in cancellation of multiple flights to Caribbean cities.On the price front, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index declined almost 1% at $105.06 over the past week, which was a day short on trading owing to the Labor Day holiday on Sep 4.Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return (Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Aug 30, 2017).Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1. Ryanair Holdings unveiled a busy London schedule for the summer of 2018, even as it reiterated Brexit-related fears. The schedule announced by the low-cost carrier features a record 68 routes. The carrier aims to transport 24.8 million customers from the three London airports — Stansted, Gatwick and Luton (read more: Ryanair Issues 2018 London Summer Roster Amid Brexit Fears).Meanwhile, the carrier also unveiled impressive traffic numbers for August. Traffic climbed 10% and load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) improved 1% to 97% on the back of lower air ticket prices.Currently, Ryanair holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.2. Spirit Airlines expects its top line to decline to the tune of approximately $8.5 million in the third quarter due to Harvey. This view takes into account the multiple flights cancelled by the company as well as the continued soft demand for air travel to and from the affected areas due to the natural calamity.In the current quarter, the company anticipates TRASM to decline between 7% and 8.5% (the previous guidance had called for a decline in the band of 2% and 4%). In fact, per the company, 100 basis points of the trimmed guidance can be attributed to the negative impact of Harvey. Also, aggressive competitive pricing in its key markets contributed to the bleak forecast.On a brighter note, the company revised its unit cost (non-fuel) guidance for the current-quarter favorably owing to better operational performance. Spirit Airlines now expects adjusted cost per available seat miles (CASM ex-fuel) to decline between 2% and 3% on a year-over-year basis (the previous guidance had projected the metric in the band of -1% and +1%).3. Delta reported a 6.9% rise in air traffic for August, while capacity expanded 2.7% for the month. Meanwhile, load factor increased 350 basis points to 87.9%.However, the carrier has lowered guidance for the third quarter of 2017 citing reasons like higher fuel costs and soft yields. Delta now anticipates passenger unit revenue for the said quarter to increase in the band of 2-3%. Previous guidance had called for an increase in the 2.5-4.5% range. Operating margin is expected to improve in the range of 16.5-17.5% from the former 18-20% band. The airline, however, raised its outlook for fuel prices per gallon from $1.68 to $1.73 from the earlier $1.55 to $1.60 band. The uptick was driven by an increase in market price that began in late July.4.  Alaska Airlines stated that from Sep 27, members of Alaska Mileage Plan and Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer loyalty programs will begin earning miles on the flights. Additionally, the carriers will form a codeshare partnership, subject to government approval. Notably, a codeshare deal allows sharing of flights. This implies that a passenger can avail any flight operated by either of the companies covered under the agreement, irrespective of the flight number (read more: Alaska Air Group Arm-Singapore Airlines Deal to Aid Flyers).Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months. CompanyPast WeekLast 6 monthsHA-0.5%-16.2%UAL-6.7%-16.2%GOL17%37%DAL-3.3%-6.2%JBLU-1.3%-5.6%AAL-3.5%-3.1%SAVE-13.1%-39.4%LUV-0.2%-10%CPA6.5%22.5%ALK-2.2%-22.4%                  The table above shows that all airline stocks barring GOL Linhas (GOL  -  Free Report) and Copa Holdings traded in the red in the past week mainly due to the bearish events mentioned above.

2557,DAL,"Airline companies have been undergoing turmoil of late due to the recent extensive devastation caused by hurricane Harvey. It’s small wonder that the natural calamity has impeded travel globally, disrupting the airline operations. In fact, Harvey led to multiple flight cancellations. Further adding to the woes, airline stocks have been struck by an additional headwind.Reasons Behind The Stocks’ PlungeShares of major airline companies declined following Delta Air Lines, Inc.’s (DAL  -  Free Report) traffic report for August. Also, theNYSE ARCA Airline Index declined 1.4% at the close of business on Sep 5. Delta’s shares have dipped 3.5%, while shares of its peers namely, American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report), JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report), United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines Company (LUV  -  Free Report) and Alaska Air Group Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report) have sunk substantially.Delta reported a 6.9% rise in air traffic for August, while capacity expanded 2.7% for the ongoing month. On the other hand, load factor or percentage of seats filled by passengers, increased 350 basis points to 87.9%.However, the carrier has lowered guidance for the third quarter of 2017 citing reasons like tougher competition and higher fuel costs. Surprisingly, it made no claims on either Hurricane Irma or Harvey having a bearing on the current scenario.The carrier now anticipates passenger unit revenue for the said quarter to increase in the band of 2-3%. Previous guidance had called for an increase in the 2.5-4.5% range. Operating margin is expected to improve in the range of 16.5-17.5% from the former 18-20% band. The airline however, raised its outlook for fuel prices to $1.68-$1.73 from the earlier $1.55-$1.60 bracket on the back of upsurge in market price which began in late July.Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report) too trimmed its view for revenue per available seat mile. The carrier estimates the metric to reduce to 7-8.5% in the third quarter of 2017. Prior guidance had anticipated a drop of 2-4%. The below-par guidance was mainly due to disruptions induced by Harvey.Other Headwinds On another warning note, airline companies feel skeptical about Hurricane Irma, that has already resulted in multiple flights to Caribbean cities being cancelled. The impact of the latest natural calamity on airline stocks is likely to increase further in the coming days .The decision of Warren Buffett, one of the most revered investors of all times, to cut his stakes from three airline heavyweights — Delta, United Continental and American Airlines — also points at the cloud of uncertainty looming over this key sector.Apart from recent challenges, high labor costs have hurt airlines for the last few quarters. With airline companies constantly inking deals with various labor groups, it is of little surprise that expenses on this front are escalating, limiting bottom-line growth.Price PerformanceThe Zacks Airline Industry fared poorly due to the headwinds, thereby significantly underperforming the broader market in the last three months. The S&P 500 Index nudged up 1.5% as against the industry’s decline of 6.5%.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye OnTech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

2558,DAL,"Copa Holdings, S.A. (CPA  -  Free Report) posted a substantial rise in traffic for September. Measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs), traffic came in at 1.59 billion, up 10.7% from 1.45 billion reported a year ago.On a year-over-year basis, consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) climbed 8.9% to 1.9 billion. As the increase in traffic outpaced capacity growth, load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) expanded 130 basis points (bps) to 84.1% in the month.For the first nine months of 2017, Copa Holdings generated RPMs of 14.83 billion (up 13% year over year) and ASMs of 17.82 billion (up 8.6%). Load factor registered a rise of 320 bps year over year to 83.2% during the period.With the earnings season on, several major airline companies are scheduled to report third-quarter earnings numbers next week. American Airlines (AAL  -  Free Report) and Alaska Airlines (ALK  -  Free Report) will reveal third-quarter financial numbers on Oct 26 and Oct 25, respectively.Copa Holdings is slated to release third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 8. Last quarter, the carrier’s earnings per share (on an adjusted basis) of $1.48 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.42. The bottom line also comfortably surpassed the year-ago count of 51 cents. Quarterly revenues improved 16.8% year over year to $578.1 million, exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $548 million. It remains to be seen how the carrier performs in the third quarter.Last week, Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter earnings numbers.The company’s earnings as well as revenues outpaced expectations, despite recent natural calamities.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2559,DAL,"It is a well-documented fact that woes related to capacity overexpansion had plagued stocks in the airline space in the not so distant past (particularly 2015). In fact, the July 2017 traffic reports of most carriers have highlighted that such issues might resurface.In such a scenario, investors fear that capacity expansion may lead to oversupply in the market even as fuel costs remain weak. Low fuel costs and capacity over-expansion are believed to be the primary reasons for the decline in airfares. While low air fares are favorable for fliers, it is a drag on the top lines of carriers due to their lesser profits.Will Capacity Woes Return?Most carriers have seen their respective load factors (percentage of seats filled by passengers) decline in July. The reason for the downturn was capacity expansion outweighing traffic growth in the month. For example, load factor declined to 84.3% from 85.2% at American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) as capacity inched up 1.9% on a year-over-year basis while traffic growth was a mere 0.8%. American Airlines currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Shares of the Long Island City, NY-based JetBlue Airways Corp. ((JBLU  -  Free Report)) also depreciated following the release of its July traffic report on Aug 10 as load factor declined. The metric came in at 87.1%, down 70 basis points as capacity expanded 5.9% with traffic increasing 5.1%.Apart from the above mentioned companies, the likes of Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report), United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report), Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report) also have seen their respective load factors decrease due to capacity overexpansion.Apart from fears on capacity over expansion, the views on unit revenues for the third quarter of 2017 have lagged expectations. For example, American Airlines expects total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM: a key measure of unit revenue) growth in the band 0.5-2.5% year over year. The figure is pegged much below the 5.7% improvement registered by the carrier in the second quarter.The third quarter TRASM guidance for Hawaiian Holdings (HA  -  Free Report), the parent company of Hawaiian Airlines, is also concerning. The carrier expects the metric to grow in the band of 4.5–7.5%, whereas TRASM had climbed 9.2% in the second quarter.Generally, carriers are forced to reduce fares as unit revenues decline in the face of capacity outpacing demand growth. The Airlines for America (A4A) Labour Day projection, also highlights the fact that carriers are adding capacity to meet the anticipated demand surge. According to the forecast, carriers are anticipated to add 133,000 seats per day during the Travel period (Aug 30-Sep 5).Price Performance in JulyIn view of the disappointing July traffic reports, it is of little wonder that the Zacks Airline industry underperformed the broader market in the month. The S& P 500 Index gained 2.1%, while the industry contracted 3.6%.  High Costs – Another HeadwindApart from woes related to capacity, the bottom line of airlines is being hurt in the second quarter due to high labor costs. However, with labor deals in vogue in the aviation space, labor costs have been on the rise.The earnings picture was distorted in the second quarter due to high costs as was the case in the first quarter. For example, at American Airlines total operating expenses climbed 11.1% year over year. Expenses pertaining to salaries and benefits were up 12.5%.Second-quarter results at Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) were also hurt by higher costs. Total operating expenses, including special items, increased 9% year over year to $8,763 million. Non-fuel consolidated unit cost or cost per available seat mile (CASM: normalized), including profit sharing, climbed 5.5%, mainly owing to wage increases, product investments and the operational disruption in April.The scenario is expected to be similar in the third quarter as well. Delta expects non-fuel unit cost (including profit sharing) to increase approximately 4% in the quarter. Additionally, consolidated cost per available seat miles (excluding special items and fuel) is anticipated to increase 5% at American Airlines in the third quarter.ConclusionWith high costs expected to limit bottom-line growth in the near term, fears about the return of capacity woes highlighted by the declining July load factors pose further challenges for airline stocks. Consequently, we believe investors need to be mindful of such headwinds before investing in the space.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

2560,DAL,"American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) has announced new flights to Europe, catering to high customer demands for Europe travel during summer. The carrier will offer special summer services to Budapest and Prague from Philadelphia, plus an additional one to Venice from Chicago, beginning May 4, 2018.Budapest and Prague will be extra destinations on the airlines’ travel route. The carrier currently offers flights connecting Venice from Philadelphia. Earlier in summer this year, the carrier started services to Amsterdam and Rome from Dallas/Fort Worth and to Barcelona from Chicago, thus expanding its European presence. At present, American Airlines along with its joint business partners conducts nonstop flights to 23 European destinations from the United States. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has been making constant efforts to extend its global reach. To this end, the airline announced plans to purchase a minority stake in China Southern Airlines (ZNH  -  Free Report) in March this year. The carrier has invested approximately $200 million in the Hong Kong-listed shares of China Southern. With this move, the airline seems to follow the likes of Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report), which had similarly purchased a 3.55% stake in China Eastern Airlines (CEA  -  Free Report) in 2015. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Notably, focus of the U.S. carriers like American Airlines on the Chinese market is pretty logical, given the projection that China will be the largest aviation market by 2024, thereby overtaking the United States.Price PerformanceAmerican Airlines stock has been performing well of late, on the back of strong second-quarter results. The stock has outperformed its industry in the last three months. Shares of the company have gained 8.42% compared with the industry’s increase of 4.08%.This announcement is likely to boost the stock further.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

2561,DAL,"Major airline companies like United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) and JetBlue Airways (JBLU  -  Free Report) unveiled improved unit revenue views for fourth-quarter 2017 over the course of the last five trading days. This indicates that things are looking up for the airline space post-hurricanes.The bullish forecasts were revealed by the companies while disclosing their respective November traffic numbers. While load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) increased at Southwest Airlines, the metric declined at JetBlue Airways as capacity expansion was surpassed by traffic growth at the Long Island City, New York-based carrier. United Continental also announced an additional buyback program.Hawaiian Airlines — the wholly owned subsidiary of Hawaiian Holdings (HA  -  Free Report) — also grabbed headlines as it emerged as the most punctual airline in the United States for October. Moreover, the long-standing dispute between leading U.S. carriers and their Gulf counterparts witnessed a major development in the week. According to a Reuters report, representatives of the United States and Gulf carriers discussed about the issue with officials of the U.S. administration.We remind investors that major U.S. carriers like Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report), American Airlines and United Continental had complained to the U.S. administration in 2015 that the massive subsidies and other benefits enjoyed by the three state-owned carriers — Qatar Airways, Etihad and Emirates — were unfair as they deny a level playing field to the carriers in the United States.On the price front, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index gained more than 1% to $114.71 over the last five trading days, buoyed by the improved unit revenue views of major sector participants.(Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Dec 6, 2017).Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return  Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1. At United Continental, traffic — measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs) — was 17.02 billion, up 5.1% from the year-ago figure. On a year-over-year basis, consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) also climbed 5.1% to 20.80 billion (Read more: United Continental's November Traffic Up, PRASM View Bullish).United Continental carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Meanwhile, ASMs climbed 2.5% to 12.58 billion. The company now anticipates fourth-quarter 2017 operating revenues per ASM (RASM) to increase 1-2%, higher than the previous guidance (Read more: Southwest Airlines November Traffic Up, RASM View Raised).3. JetBlue also provided an improved guidance for fourth-quarter RASM. The carrier now expects RASM in the range of down 0.5% to up 1.5% (on a year-over-year basis). The revised guidance reflects an improvement from the prior outlook of a decline of 3% to flat year over year. The low-cost carrier now expects hurricanes Irma and Maria to hurt its fourth-quarter results to the tune of approximately 50 basis points. This projection is also an improvement over the previous forecast of one to two percentage points.Meanwhile, load factor declined 120 basis points in the month to 84.2% as traffic growth (2.8%) was outpaced by capacity expansion (4.3%). In the same month, the carrier registered a completion factor (system wide) of 99.7% with 86.5% flights on schedule.4. Gol Linhas (GOL  -  Free Report) issued a bullish outlook for 2018 driven by an improved Latin American economy. The company expects revenues in 2018 to come in at approximately R$11 billion compared with the R$10.4 billion estimated in the current year.Load factor rose to 81% from 77.8% a year ago, owing to traffic expansion (7.1%) exceeding capacity growth (2.8%) (Read more: GOL Linhas Reports Robust November Traffic Figures).5. The latest Air Travel Consumer Report unveiled by the U.S. Department of Transportation revealed that Hawaiian Airlines secured the top position among U.S. carriers in October 2017 with respect to punctuality as 89.5% of its flights arrived on time.  Delta was the second-most punctual U.S. carrier with 89.4% of its flights arriving on time. According to the report, 84.8% of flights operated by U.S. carriers (considered in the report) were on schedule in October, reflecting an improvement from 83.6% recorded in September.The rate of cancelled scheduled domestic flights decreased to 0.7% in October from 3.3% recorded in the previous month. Flight cancellations were high in September primarily due to the hurricanes.6. At Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report), RPMs increased 17.3% to 2.08 billion in November. ASMs increased 17.1% to 2.55 billion in the month. Load factor improved 10 basis points to 81.4% as traffic growth outpaced capacity expansion. Meanwhile, the carrier registered a completion factor of 89.7% with 99.6% flights on schedule.Price Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last 6 months. The table above shows that most airline stocks traded in the green in the past week resulting in the NYSE ARCA Airline Index gaining. Shares of Southwest Airlines appreciated the most (5.9%) over the past week, driven by its impressive traffic results and bullish guidance.

2562,DAL,"It seems that airline stocks are back in favor after being laid low by multiple headwinds like the recent hurricanes, the devastating earthquake in Mexico and issues related to customer dissatisfaction for the greater part of 2017.Contrasting Price Performances Signal ImprovementPost hurricanes things are looking up for airline stocks. This is evident from the charts below which compare the price performance of the Zacks Airline industry with the S&P 500 Index in the first nine months and the last three months of 2017.While the industry gained only 1.8%, the S&P 500 index rallied 12.6% in the first nine months of the current year. The industry, however, handily outperformed the S&P 500 index in the last three months, rallying 12.9% compared with the S&P’s gain of 6.4%. Improving Unit Revenue ScenarioBullish unit revenue views from sector heavyweights for the final quarter of 2017 bear testimony to the improved scenario for airline stocks.At its recently held Investor Day, Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) said that it expects passenger revenue per available seat miles (PRASM: a key measure of unit revenue) for the current quarter to improve by approximately 4% — the highest point of its previously guided range of 2% to 4%. Southwest Airlines anticipates operating revenues per ASM (RASM) to increase between 1% and 2%, which compares favorably with the previous outlook of up slightly to 1.5 %.Furthermore, the rising fuel costs scenario might lead to rise in ticket prices and boost revenues.  In fact, in the last three months oil prices have increased more than 43% and are currently hovering around the $60 a barrel mark. The International Air Transport Association (“IATA”) projects that jet fuel prices will escalate to around 12.5% to $73.8 per barrel in 2018.We note that Delta expects to perform well backed by increased unit revenues in 2018, with PRASM growth estimated in each quarter. Higher fuel prices are likely to drive unit revenue growth in 2018. Dividends/Buybacks Represent Solid Financial HealthFinancial prosperity of the sector participants is reflected in the fact that the likes of Southwest, Delta and SkyWest (SKYW  -  Free Report) have hiked their respective dividend payouts in 2017.Additionally, these carriers have indulged in share buybacks that substantiates their solid financial health yet again. For example, United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) recently announced a new $3 billion share repurchase program.  Also, JetBlue Airways’ (JBLU  -  Free Report) board of directors approved a new share repurchase program, earlier this month.On the back of such solid financial prospects, the trend of dividend hikes and buybacks is expected to continue in 2018 as well.Notably, the robust financial health of most carriers has prompted them to invest substantially in improving flying experience for travellers, in a bid to stay afloat in the competitive airline space. IATA: Airline Industry to See Higher Profits in 2018IATA predicts global net profit of $38.4 billion for the industry in 2018. This is much higher than the profitability forecast of $34.5 billion for the current year. The bright projection can be attributed to the strong demand for air travel. The bulk of the global profits in 2018 is expected from the North American region ($16.4 billion). The estimated figure is higher than $15.6 billion expected in 2017.Global net profit margin is expected to improve marginally to 4.7% in 2018 from 4.6% estimated in 2017. The top line is projected to come in at $824 billion next year compared with $754 billion projected in the current year.Optimism surrounding the air cargo business has also improved. Cargo revenues are forecasted to increase to $59.2 billion for 2018 (estimated revenues for 2017 are $54.5 billion).According to the forecast, air travel growth of 6% is expected in 2018. The estimated figure for 2018 is above the average growth of 5.5% in the last 10-20 years. Capacity is projected to rise by 5.7% in 2018. According to the forecast, load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) for the next year is expected to touch record levels of 81.4% as capacity expansion is likely to outweigh traffic growth.New Tax Regime Likely to Aid AirlinesLast Friday, President Trump finally signed the much-anticipated tax bill into law. The $1.5 trillion tax overhaul package reduces corporate taxes from 35% to 21%. The significant reduction in corporate tax rate is likely to boost cash flow, which in turn will aid the bottom lines of carriers.Since most airline companies are almost entirely exposed to the statutory corporate tax rate, the massive tax cut is expected to help them save a considerable amount in tax payment in the United States.Moreover, airline companies seem to invest significantly for capital expenditures. In the new regime, these companies will be able to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income immediately, which was not allowed earlier. As a result, their annual tax bills would be lowered significantly due to higher deductions. This, in turn, will leave more cash in the hands of these companies to fund their capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases among others.Improving Zacks Industry Rank Supports Favorable ScenarioThe Zacks Industry rank of 76 carried by the 25-member Zacks Airline Industry also highlights the fact that airline stocks are back in favor. Notably, a favorable rank places the industry in the top 30% of the 250+ groups enlisted. The bullish stance on the industry is further augmented by the fact there have been 12 positive estimate revisions in the fourth quarter of 2017.Also, the Zacks Industry Rank has improved immensely, given the industry’s 200+ rank only a few months ago.We put our entire 250-plus industries into two groups: the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Over the last 10 years, using a one week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Click here to know more: About Zacks Industry RankValuation Signals More UpsideGoing by the EV-to-EBITDA (enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) ratio, which is often used to value airline stocks, given their significant debt levels and high depreciation and amortization expenses, the industry doesn’t look expensive at this point.The industry currently has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 6.6, which compares favorably with the market at large, as the current EV/EBITDA for the S&P 500 is at 11.9.  The industry’s favorable positioning compared with the overall market certainly signals more upside. Airlines Should Grace Your PortfolioApart from the above-mentioned factors, an improving economy, a much-improved job market and rising disposable income are also favorable for sector participants. Furthermore, consumer confidence remains strong resulting in more Americans going on vacations. Consequently, we expect airline stocks to fly high in 2018.Given this bullish backdrop, we believe it’s worth investing in the airline space this year. However, with a wide range of airline firms thronging the investment space, it is by no means an easy task for investors to arrive at winning stocks. This is where the Zacks Rank, which justifies a company's strong fundamentals, can come in really handy.Markedly, the Zacks Rank is a reliable tool that helps investors to trade with confidence regardless of their trading style and risk tolerance.

Each carrier has a market capitalization in excess of $1 billion. Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes S.A. (GOL  -  Free Report) is a low-cost and low-fare carrier, headquartered in Sao Paulo, Brazil.

2563,DAL,"Thanks to a strong economy, low unemployment and relatively low fares, last-minute trips during the Labor Day holiday are palpably more this time than any year. This is especially true given that air travel is poised to hit another record with 16.1 million passengers expected to fly over the seven-day Labor Day holiday (Aug 30 to Sep 5), up 5% from last year, per the report from U.S. airlines group, Airlines for America (read: ETFs & Stocks to Gain Height on Busy Air Summer Travel).In order to accommodate higher travel demand, U.S. airlines increased the number of seats available for their late summer getaway by about 133,000. The addition of capacity will fuel traffic numbers as industry capacity is at its highest since 2007.The busiest travel day of the weekend is projected to be Sep 1 followed by Aug 31 and Sep 4 while Hartsfield-Jackson International in Atlanta, LAX in Los Angeles and O’Hare International in Chicago will likely be the most active U.S. airports.However, this Labor Day holiday might not as cheap as it was last two years. Gasoline prices at pumps in some states have increased due to Hurricane Harvey. Analysts had expected about a 10% jump in prices, but the forecasts were revised up as worries over supply shortage increased. Nearly one-third of U.S. refining output was affected by Harvey and its extreme rainfall and flooding. Per CNBC, drivers could have to pay as much as $2.60 per gallon nationally during summer’s last big travel weekend (read: Gasoline ETF Jumps on Storm Harvey).That said, investors seeking to tap huge air travel demand during the Labor Day weekend should focus on the airline ETF — U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS  -  Free Report).JETS in FocusThis fund provides exposure to the global airline industry, including airline operators and manufacturers from all over the world, by tracking the U.S. Global Jets Index. In total, the product holds 34 securities and is heavily concentrated on the top four firms — American Airlines (AAL  -  Free Report), Delta Airlines (DAL  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) and United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report). These account for at least 11% share each while other firms hold less than 4% share.In terms of regional exposure, North America accounts for 78% of JETS, followed by Europe at 11%. Other regions like Asia-Pacific, Asia, Latin America and Middle East make up for a low single-digits in the portfolio (read: Hurricane Harvey Puts These ETF Areas in Focus).The fund has gathered $115.4 million in its asset base while sees moderate trading volume of nearly 61,000 shares a day. It charges investors 60 bps in annual fees and has gained 2.9% so far this year. JETS has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a High risk outlook.What Lies Ahead?Not only will strong Labor Day weekend travel fuel growth in JETS, the month of September is historically kind to the ETF given the outperformance of some of the big holdings in the portfolio. Per Schaeffer's Investment Research, Delta Airlines has finished higher 70% of the time with an average gain of 6% over the past 10 Septembers while United Continental has finished to the upside nearly two-thirds of the time over the last 11 Septembers with an average gain of 5.1%. Both stocks account for a combined 22.3% share.Additionally, the International Air Transport Association expects another solid year of performance for the airline industry, suggesting good tidings for the stocks and ETF. It expects global airlines to post $31.4 billion in profits this year buoyed by stronger demand in both cargo and passenger business. However, it is well below the 2016 profit of $34.8 billion. As such, airlines are expected to retain net profit of $7.69 per passenger, down from $9.13 in 2016 and $10.08 in 2015 (read: What Lies Ahead of Leisure & Travel ETFs in 2H?).Cargo demand is expected to grow 7.5%, more than double 3.6% growth seen in 2016 while passenger demand is expected to grow 7.4%, the same as that of 2016.Regionally, North American carriers continue to be the “powerhouse of industry profitability” with expected profits of $15.4 billion and accounts for more than half of the global industry profit. European and Asia-Pacific carriers would add $7.4 billion each to the industry profit. Latin America and Middle East carriers are expected to earn $800 million and $400 million respectively, but airlines in Africa are expected to post a $100 million loss.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

2564,DAL,"There were quite a few developments in the airline industry that grabbed headlines last week. However, the havoc wreaked by Tropical Storm Harvey in Houston, overshadowed everything as operations of key airline participants like United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) — as it relies extensively on its hub at Houston — were adversely impacted.The Harvey havoc apart, major U.S.-based carriers like Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) and American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) were laid low following the announcement of Iceland-based low-cost carrier WOW Air to expand into four U.S. destinations — all in the Midwest.On a cheerful note, low-cost carrier Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) announced plans to introduce additional routes with focus on CA. The Dallas- based carrier also intends to bolster its Mexican service. Updates on route expansion were also available from Alaska Airlines, the wholly-owned subsidiary of Alaska Air Group (ALK  -  Free Report) and Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report) over the last week.On the price front, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index was almost flat at $105.7.(Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Aug 23, 2017).Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1. Major U.S. carriers shed value on Aug 23, on fears of intensifying competition in the transatlantic market, following the decision of WOW Air to expand services to Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland, and Cincinnati. Following the expansion, the total number of U.S. cities served by the carrier will increase to 12 (read more: Airline Stocks Sink as WOW Air Expands into the Midwest).2. Tropical Storm Harvey, which causing heavy rainfall in Houston, TX, has caused airlines to cancel multiple flights. The misery is expected to continue this week with two Houston airports — George Bush Intercontinental Airport and William P. Hobby Airport — closed due to heavy rains.

United Continental is expected to be the worst hit, with losses exceeding $200 million (read more: Airline Operations Disrupted as Harvey Wreaks Havoc).3. Alaska Airlines has begun daily, nonstop services from San Jose, CA to Austin, TX and Tucson, AZ.

The carrier also intends to start nonstop seasonal flights from Apr 14, 2018. The flights will operate on Saturdays between Cancun, Columbus, Ohio, and New Orleans. Despite the expansion plan, the carrier continues to expect capacity (available seat miles) growth of less than 4% in the first half of 2018. The metric is expected to grow at less than its 2016 year-over-year growth of 5.7% for full-year 2018. 5. In a customer-friendly move, Spirit Airlines decided to launch four routes from Nov 9 to facilitate reaching New Orleans. Flights connecting New Orleansto Boston Newark and Tampa will operate daily.

2566,DAL,"Investors in Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jul 28th 2017 $60.50 Callhad some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Delta Air Lines shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Delta Air Lines is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) in the Transportation - Airline industry that ranks in the Top 2% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, four analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while two have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.68 per share to $1.78 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Delta Air Lines right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

2567,DAL,"Wall Street officially ranks among the world’s most expensive markets on a number of metrics. In fact, two-third of money managers finds the U.S. stock market’s recent record run unsettling. The dizzying ascent of U.S. stocks as a result of lofty valuations might sooner than later threaten to spark a major sell-off.In such an overvalued market, it will be enticing to find stocks that are perceived to be “bargains” or are undervalued. These stocks are fundamentally sound to withstand any market upheaval and at same time will help investors make money by buying before the impending rally.Wall Street Ranks Among the Globe’s Most ExpensiveInvestors continue to fret over lofty valuations on Wall Street. The U.S. stock market has turned out to be the least reasonably priced equity market across the globe, coming in last among the 40 counties and regions surveyed on a variety of metrics by StarCapital Research. But, an undervalued equity market has achieved better returns in the future compared to their overvalued foils.  The following table shows how much the U.S. stock market is overvalued compared to other markets around the world:OVERALL RANK (TOP 5 & BOTTOM 5 CONSIDERED)COUNTRYCAPEP/E1South Korea15.312.92Austria17.216.63Czech Republic8.812.94Hungary13.610.45Italy14.638.836Indonesia19.721.137India20.622.838Philippines2220.639Belgium22.927.640U.S.2822.4Source: StarCapital ResearchThe U.S. stock market’s cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio, which compares decade-long stock prices with corporate earnings, is 28. This is the third highest among the countries compared, cheaper only to Denmark (36.1) and Ireland (34.5). Historically, the CAPE ratio at current levels in the U.S. has preceded significant market declines.The price-to-earnings ratio in the U.S. comes in at 22.4, the tenth-highest in the world if we exclude the broader segment of developed Europe. Even though such a ratio is below the U.K.’s 31 and India’s 22.8, it is way above China’s 7.4 and Russia’s 7.1. Both these nations are considered to be the most inexpensive.The U.S., in the meanwhile, has a price-to-book ratio 3.1, the second highest among the 40 regions, while on a price-to-sales ratio basis, the nation is the seventh most expensive country in the world, with a reading of 2.0.Two-Third Investors Think U.S. Stocks Are OvervaluedOnly 36% of investment managers find the U.S. stock market to be fairly valued at current levels or undervalued as per a quarterly investment manager survey performed by Northern Trust Asset Management. Such a reading marks the lowest since the survey began in the third quarter of 2008. On the other hand, two-third of investors – 65% – believes that the U.S. market is overvalued. This is the highest percentage for overvaluation on record.The survey, further, figured out that only 6% of investors considered consumer staples to be undervalued, while 15% said the same for technology. Financial, energy and health care sectors have a little more room to grow, with 39%, 32% and 32% respondents, respectively, believing that stocks are undervalued.With the Dow Jones, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq hitting a series of record highs this year, experts are in fact contemplating investments overseas. A whopping 86% of investment managers believe that the European stocks are undervalued, while 88% feel that the emerging market equities are undervalued or fairly priced.But, what has driven the U.S. stock market to record levels and eventually resulting in pricey stocks? A big chunk of gains came from the so-called FAANG stocks that comprise tech companies like Facebook Inc (FB  -  Free Report), Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL  -  Free Report), as well as consumer discretionary stocks like Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report). Significant improvement in corporate earnings is also cited to be the reason for the market’s recent gains.“FAANGtastic five” – Gains TractionIf we consider the “FAANGtastic five” – each of them gained between 25% and 52% in the year-to-date period. Amazon, in particular, at one point topped the $1000-a-share level, highlighting the stellar show put up by tech stocks in the said period. Internet and tech companies scaled higher on hopes that potential tax reforms will get eventually implemented.Many tech companies have, in fact, boosted earnings without the help of government policies. Notably, Apple is riding high on growing demand for smartphones and web-based services.However, as chances of Trump getting his policies through Congress ebbed, gains have continued on the back of solid corporate earnings.Q2 Earnings UpbeatImproved second-quarter economic growth, strong manufacturing and service surveys, and a moderate uptick in wage growth helped Corporate America post relatively high profit margins in Q2. We now have results from 97 S&P 500 members. Total earnings for these companies are up 8.4% from the same period last year on 5.1% higher revenues, with 78.4% beating EPS estimates and 72.2% beating revenue estimates.According to estimates, total second-quarter earnings for the S&P 500 cohort are expected to be up 8.6% from same period last year on 4.7% higher revenues. This would follow earnings growth of 13.3% in Q1 on 7% revenue growth, the highest in at least two years (read more: Four Takeaways from the Q2 Earnings Season).5 Best Value Stocks to Counter An Overvalued MarketIt’s no secret that the U.S. stocks are mostly overvalued, which raises concerns of a possible downturn. Given this uncertainty, it will be wise to invest in value stocks. Value investors look for volatile times to pick up stocks at a discount, which are at the same time fundamentally strong to withstand any economic downturn.Thanks to our new style score system, we have been able to identify five value stocks. Our research shows that stocks with a Value Style Score of ‘A’ or ‘B’ when combined a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Delta Air Lines, Inc.

Moreover, its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the previous four quarters, with an average beat of 4.69%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors Likely at PlayWe expect Spirit Airlines’ second-quarter results to be hurt due to the dispute with its pilots in May, this year.  Consequently, the carrier had to cancel multiple flights resulting in customer dissatisfaction. Additionally, passenger related issues have hurt other the US carriers like Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report), of late.As a result of the disruption in its services caused by the dispute, the company had to incur costs pertaining to passenger re-accommodation and other factors. In fact, due to these costs Spirit Airlines expects cost per available seat miles, excluding fuel (CASM), to increase in the band of 9.5% to 10.5% on a year-over-year basis, which is much higher than the comparable figure recorded in the previous quarter.The rising fuel costs might also limit bottom-line growth at Spirit Airlines in the quarter. Fuel cost per gallon (economic) is projected at $1.64 per gallon in the second quarter. Spirit Airlines expects total revenue per available seat miles (TRASM) to increase approximately 5.5% in the quarter. Also, capacity is projected to increase 13.6% on a year-over-year basis.Spirit Airlines, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Spirit Airlines, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Spirit Airlines, Inc.

2569,DAL,"Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27, before the market opens.In the first quarter, this low-cost carrier saw a negative earnings surprise of 1.61% owing to high labor costs. Operating revenues of $4,883 million marginally missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,894.1 million. Revenues, however, increased 1.2% on a year-over-year basis. Let’s see what awaits the stock in the second quarter.Factors Likely at PlayWe note that labor costs have spiked due to the recent labor deals inked by the company. This, in turn, is expected to hurt the bottom line in the second quarter as well similar to the previous quarter. In fact, Southwest Airlines expects CASM – excluding fuel and oil expenses, special items and profit sharing expenses – to increase approximately 6% in the to-be-reported quarter on a year-over-year basis.Currently, labor deals are in vogue in the airline space. Not only Southwest Airlines, but other players in the space like United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) and Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) have signed deals with various labor groups over the last few months. Additionally, rising fuel costs might also limit bottom-line growth at Southwest Airlines in the quarter.The company expects operating revenue per available seat miles (RASM) to increase in the band of 1% to 2%. In fact, we are optimistic about the company's efforts to enhance its shareholders’ wealth through dividends and share buybacks. Evidently, Southwest Airlines announced that its board of directors approved a new share repurchase program worth $2 billion.Simultaneously, the company increased its quarterly dividend by 25%. We expect an update on this issue at the second-quarter conference call.Southwest Airlines Company Price and EPS Surprise  Southwest Airlines Company Price and EPS Surprise | Southwest Airlines Company QuoteEarnings WhispersOur quantitative model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Southwest Airlines in this quarter.

2570,DAL,"Normal life has been disrupted with the tropical storm Harvey wreaking havoc, and is expected to cause further damage. In fact, the storm caused severe devastation throughout the weekend with Houston – the fourth largest city in the country -- experiencing the worst hit.Meanwhile, the city has been witnessing unprecedented rainfall, resulting in multiple causalities. Also, the flooding is expected to continue as Texas is battered by heavy rains due to the storm.Notably, Harvey, which has been downgraded to a tropical storm from a category-four hurricane, is expected to remain over Texas until mid-week.Flight Cancellations at Large Due to HarveyIn view of the extensive damage, it is of little wonder the natural calamity impeded travel disrupting operations of airlines. In fact, Harvey resulted in significant travel disruptions over the weekend leading to multiple flight cancellations/delays at the George Bush Intercontinental and William P. Hobby airports, resulting in untold miseries and harassments to passengers.According to a Bloomberg report, operations at United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) were significantly crippled due to the natural calamity as it relies extensively on its hub at Houston, causing it to cancel a huge number of flights therein to ensure the security of its passengers. Currently, United Continental carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other carriers like Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) had to trim Houston operations. According to The Wall Street Journal, American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) had to cancel 110 flights on Aug 27 due to the calamity, majority of them to and from Houston.Moreover, in a bid to mitigate the harassments of passengers, most carriers including the likes of Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report), Alaska Air Group (ALK  -  Free Report), American Airlines, Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU  -  Free Report) have made offers to passengers who are rescheduling their travel dates. These passengers will be able to do so without paying any additional charges. Markedly, with the two Houston airports - George Bush Intercontinental Airport and William P. Hobby Airport - closed as heavy rainfall continues to hit Houston, air travel is expected to be hurt further this week.Evidently, weather-related issues have hurt airlines previously too. In March 2017,operations at carriers were disrupted big time by winter storm Stella. Moreover, this January, an icy winter storm ravaged the Southeast U.S. cities. It also disrupted the flight schedules of airlines, thereby causing undue harassment. Last year, Hurricane Matthew had also caused extensive damage in the affected areas.In fact, such acts of nature throw the schedules of carriers out of gear, causing multiple flight cancellations.Other Headwinds Hurting Airlines LatelyApart from the Harvey-related disruption in operations, airlines have been laid low lately by quite a few other happenings.The twin terror attacks in Spain, earlier in the month that claimed multiple lives apart from injuring many, caused travel-focused stocks include airline players to lose value. Such acts of terrorism might cause travel demand to dwindle due to security fears. Naturally, airline stocks are hurt by this anticipation.Moreover, fears related to capacity overexpansion were re-ignited with July traffic reports of most carriers exhibiting a fall in load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers). The downturn was due to capacity expansion outweighing traffic growth.Generally, carriers are forced to reduce fares as unit revenues decline in the face of capacity outpacing demand growth. While low air fares are favorable for fliers, it is a drag on the top lines of carriers with their profits being hurt.Also, the decision of Warren Buffett, one of the most revered investors of all time, to trim his stakes in three airline heavyweights – Delta, United Continental and American Airlines – also points at the fact that all is not well with this key sector.Price PerformanceIn view of the above recent headwinds, it is of little wonder that the Zacks industry fared worse than the broader market in the last one month. The S&P 500 Index contracted 0.9% compared with the industry’s decline of 3%.High Labor Costs Remain a DragIn addition to the recent challenges, high labor costs have hurt airlines for the last few quarters. With airline companies constantly inking deals with various labor groups, it is of little surprise that costs on this front are increasing, which is limiting bottom-line growth.The situation on this front is not expected to improve in the third quarter as well. Delta expects non-fuel unit cost (including profit sharing) to increase approximately 4%. Additionally, consolidated cost per available seat miles (excluding special items and fuel) is anticipated to increase 5% at American Airlines. Again, Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report) expects cost per available seat miles (CASM), excluding fuel, to increase in the band of 16-18%.Bottom LineWith airline companies already grappling with multiple headwinds, the emergence of Harvey has only added to the woes of stocks in the space. Consequently, investors are expected to remain glued to the updates, as stocks strive to return to their winning waysMore Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2571,DAL,"Shares of GOL Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes S.A. (GOL  -  Free Report) have skyrocketed 239.2%, comfortably outperforming the Zacks Airline industry’s rally of 13.7% on a year-to-date basis.In fact, stocks exhibiting such impressive price movements are generally considered as lucrative investment options. This is because the surge in stock price is generally attributed to some positive development(s) surrounding the company and is certainly not out of the blue or arbitrary. The same is true for GOL Linhas, which has witnessed a slew of positive factors leading to the significant stock price appreciation.Lets delve deep to unearth the factors.Catalysts Behind the SurgeCurrently, GOL Linhas stands to benefit from a strong demand for air travel. In the third quarter of 2017, the carrier’s top line expanded 13.2% on a year-over-year basis on the back of a 14.1% rise in passenger revenues.In fact, an improved Latin American economy has prompted the carrier to issue an upbeat view for 2017. Based in Sao Paulo, Brazil, the company expects earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margin — a measure of the company's earnings ability — around 9% (previous guidance had projected the metric between 7% and 9%). The guidance for EBITDA margin stands at around 14% (previous guidance had projected the metric between 12% and 14%).GOL Linhas anticipates capacity (available seat kilometers) to be around 0.5% (previous guidance had projected the metric to either remain flat or decline up to 2% on a year-over-year basis). Another important metric, load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) is now projected to be around 79% (previous guidance had forecasted the metric in the 77% to 79% range).Additionally, the company’s focus on maintaining capacity discipline is impressive. The measure is expected to result in improvement in yields, going forward. The carrier’s efforts to reduce its debt levels are an added positive. Efforts to modernize its fleet also raise optimism in the stock.Furthermore, GOL Linhas’ partnership with key airline players like Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) bodes well.A Broker FavoriteGOL Linhas’ earnings estimates reflect a healthy uptrend. The company has witnessed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings being revised 86.6% upward, in the last 30 days. Also, the current-year earnings estimates have climbed more than 100% in the same time frame.Given the wealth of information at the disposal of brokers, it is in the best interests of investors to be guided by broker advice and the direction of their estimate revisions. This is because the direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock. Zacks Rank & Style ScoreTaking into account the above-mentioned tailwinds, we believe that the current price represents an attractive entry point for investors. GOL Linhas’ Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) also supports our view, indicating that the stock is likely to outperform the broader market over the next one to three months. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Furthermore, the company’s Momentum Score of B highlights its short-term attractiveness. The Zacks Momentum Style Score indicates when the timing is right to grab a stock and make the most of its momentum. Back-tested results show that stocks with Style Scores of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy), handily outperform others. Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the airline space may also consider International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (ICAGY  -  Free Report) and SkyWest (SKYW  -  Free Report). While International Consolidated Airlines Group sports a Zacks Rank #1, SkyWest holds a Zacks Rank #2.While shares of International Consolidated Airlines have surged more than 50% on a year-to-date basis, SkyWest has been up more than 36%. Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

2573,DAL,"Airline hubs are specific airports that an airline company uses as a transfer sport to get travelers to their intended destination. This system is part of the spoke-hub transportation model, which has been favored by many airlines since the industry was deregulated in 1978. The model consists of a system of connections in which all airline traffic moves across spokes linked to the hub at the center.For example, Denver and Los Angeles represent hubs, with many spokes reaching outward to other cities. The purpose of this model is simple: to save airlines money and to provide passengers better routes to their selected destinations. Today, most airlines have at least one main airport that their flights must travel through, and from there, the flights go outwards on different network spokes.So which airlines dominate which airports? Let’s take a look at seven major U.S. airlines, and see where their hubs are located.American Airlines (AAL  -  Free Report)The world’s largest airline by fleet size and revenue, American Airlines has been an industry staple since its formation in 1930. The company is headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, and since its merger with US Airways in 2013, American Airlines operates nine domestic hubs:Dallas-Fort Worth International AirportCharlotte-Douglas International AirportChicago O’Hare International AirportPhiladelphia International AirportPhoenix Sky Harbor International AirportMiami International AirportRonald Reagan Washington International AirportLos Angeles AirportNew York City’s John F. Kennedy International Airport Alaska Airlines (ALK  -  Free Report)Alaska Airlines is American airline founded back in 1932. Originally offering flights from Anchorage, Alaska, the airlines today has flights to more than 100 destinations including Alaska, Hawaii, Canada, Costa Rica, and Mexico. Alaska Airlines’ fleet consists of mostly Boeing (BA) 737 aircraft, as well as Bombardier and Embraer planes. The company has three main hubs:Seattle-Tacoma International AirportPortland International AirportTed Stevens Anchorage International AirportAnd two focus cities:San Diego International AirportSan Jose International Airport Delta Airlines (DAL  -  Free Report)Like American, Delta has been present in the U.S. airline industry for decades. It began carrying passengers in 1929, and has grown rapidly since then due to many airline mergers. Headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, Delta operates 10 domestic hubs:Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International AirportDetroit Metropolitan Wayne County AirportCincinnati/Northern Kentucky International AirportJFK International AirportNew York City’s La Guardia AirportBoston Logan International AirportLos Angeles International AirportMinneapolis-St. Paul International AirportSalt Lake City International AirportSeattle-Tacoma International AirportAnd three international hubs:Amsterdam Airport SchipholTokyo Narita International AirportParis-Charles de Gaulle Airport Frontier AirlinesFounded in 1994, Frontier Airlines is a popular, privately-held, ultra-low-cost carrier headquartered in Denver Colorado. It recently announced a huge route expansion, and Frontier is adding 21 new destinations and 85 new routes to its network. Additionally, Frontier is adding dozens of non-stop flights between other cities that it already serves. With this network increase, Frontier’s route map will grow to 82 cities by next summer. The airline operates out of one main hub:Denver International AirportAnd seven focus cities:Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International AirportCleveland Hopkins International AirportHartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International AirportLas Vegas’ McCarran International AirportOrlando International AirportPhiladelphia International AirportTrenton-Mercer Airport JetBlue Airways (JBLU  -  Free Report)JetBlue is a popular low-cost airline option headquartered in Long Island in New York City. It serves 97 destinations in the U.S., Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America, and South America. JetBlue was founded in 1998, and primarily uses Airbus and Embraer aircraft. JetBlue utilizes the old0fashioned point-to-point system, which carries passengers short distances with few connecting flights, the airline operates out of six domestic focus cities:JFK International AirportFort Lauderdale-Hollywood International AirportBoston Logan International AirportLong Beach AirportSan Juan’s Luis Munoz Marin International AirportOrlando International Airport Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report)Touted as the world’s largest low-cost carrier, Southwest Airlines was launched in 1967 and is known for its Rapid Rewards frequent-flyer program. Its headquarters is in Dallas, Texas. While Southwest does not use the hub and spoke transportation model (it prefers the point-to-point system like JetBlue) the airline still operates out of 10 major domestic cities:Chicago Midway International AirportBaltimore-Washington International AirportMcCarran International AirportDallas Love Field AirportDenver International AirportPhoenix Sky Harbor International AirportHouston’s William P. Hobby AirportHartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International AirportOrlando International AirportLos Angeles International Airport United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report)Headquartered in Chicago, United Continental Holdings is an airline holding company for United Airlines and Continental Airlines, which formed in a merger back in 2010. Operating more than 700 mainline aircraft, United Continental needs a lot of hubs. The airline company has nine hubs in total, eight domestic:Chicago O’Hare International AirportHouston’s George Bush Intercontinental AirportDenver International AirportLos Angeles International AirportNewark Liberty International AirportSan Francisco International AirportWashington Dulles International AirportGuam A.B. Wan Pat International AirportAnd one international:Tokyo Narita International Airport As you can see, these seven major airlines overlap in their hub or major operating city locations nationwide, which can be looked at as a positive thing for frequent travelers. The hub and spoke model offers each airline (even Southwest and JetBlue) a way to replace a high number of half-empty routes with fewer, fuller ones, leading to less delays and a wide variety of connections.<!--{cke_protected}{C}%3C!%2D%2Dtd%20%7Bborder%3A%201px%20solid%20%23ccc%3B%7Dbr%20%7Bmso-data-placement%3Asame-cell%3B%7D%2D%2D%3E-->Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2574,DAL,"Monday, October 9, 2017In quarters past, we in the world of finance reporting would be sounding the trumpets for the ushering in of a new Earnings Season, which was to commence with aluminum giant Alcoa’s (AA  -  Free Report) report after the closing bell with Monday or Tuesday of a week just like this. But really, this was always just a convenient formality that didn’t have much integral meaning to earnings season as a whole nor the general domestic and global economies they help illustrate. If you want to get an early foothold on the global marketplace, for instance, you’d do better to focus on FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) numbers (which happened to miss consensus estimates by 20% in its fiscal Q1 2018 report a few weeks ago).That said, if you are interested in the lion’s share of data related to quarterly gains from the finance sector, then you have indeed found the right week. By this time Thursday morning, we will have seen Q3 earnings results from JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report). By the opening bell this Friday, we’ll also see Q3 reports from Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) and PNC (PNC  -  Free Report). Major banks represent nearly half the total earnings for the finance sector, which is why we can make informed projections about whether or not we’re looking at a strong quarter or not just by tracking these large U.S. banks.Bank stocks did not impress the market in Q2. Yet in the past month — the direct run-up to Q3 earnings season — banks are up 8%, according to Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian. Anticipation of a generous tax reform (tax cut) policy, plus a strong likelihood of a December interest rate hike from the Fed, helped bolster stock prices. But would disappointing earnings and revenue results start a pullback from record highs, not just among companies in the finance sector but across the board? After all, what industries can claim they have no involvement with the biggest Wall Street banks?Consider also that Q3 reports for the banks will not have any actualized data related to tax policy or a higher interest rate, thus they will not appear on the books this quarter. The good news is yearly comps should be beatable, so expectations of a lousy quarter are not warranted at this stage. For a comprehensive report on this week’s coming earnings reports, please read Sheraz’s latest Earnings Preview: Are Bank Stock Gains Sustainable?Aside from the big banks, we also look for earnings data Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) on Wednesday morning and Domino’s Pizza (DPZ  -  Free Report) on Thursday. So while the frequency of new reports will be milder than we will see in the coming next few weeks, we will hear from several heavy hitters representing different sectors. In the meantime, will stock indexes keep their brave chin pointed forward to new record highs? If this week’s reporting companies all beat estimates and raise guidance, how much higher can we expect markets to rise?It should be fun. Futures this Monday morning are all up a half-hour before regular-day trading begins.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

2575,DAL,"Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 11, before the market opens.This Atlanta, GA-based carrier’s second-quarter earnings of $1.64 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.66. However, earnings climbed 11.56% on a year-over-year basis on the back of a 3.3% operating revenue growth. Meanwhile, quarterly operating revenues of $10.79 billion fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.In fact, the carrier may be in for a disappointment in the third quarter too. The negative sentiment surrounding the stock can be gauged from the fact that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter has decreased in excess of 14% over the last three months.Owing to multiple headwinds, the stock has struggled so far this year, underperforming the Zacks Transportation-Airline industry on a year-to-date basis. The stock has gained 5.7%, whereas the industry has rallied 15.2%.  Our proven model too does not show conclusively that Delta Air Lines will beat earnings in third-quarter 2017. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case as highlighted below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Delta Air Lines is 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.54 per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Delta Air Lines carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).In fact, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when it is witnessing negative estimate revisions like Delta Air Lines is.Factors Likely at PlayWe expect Delta Air Lines’ third-quarter results to be hurt by the back-to-back hurricanes which resulted in the carrier cancelling multiple flights. Delta Air Lines expects passenger unit revenues to increase approximately 2% in third-quarter 2017 on a year-over-year basis. The guidance includes a negative impact of Irma to the tune of 1 point. Operating margin for the third quarter is projected between 15.5% and 16.5%; Hurricane Irma is likely to impact the metric to the tune of approximately 120 million.It is not only Delta Air Lines whose third-quarter results are likely to be impacted by the natural calamities. Results of other carriers like United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) and American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) are also likely to be hurt by the events.High fuel costs are also expected to limit earnings growth in the quarter. Fuel price per gallon in third-quarter 2017 is expected between $1.68 and $1.73. With the company inking multiple labor deals, labor costs have spiked. High labor costs have been hurting the company for quite some time and the third quarter is likely to be no different.We are, however, appreciative of the company's efforts to enhance shareholders’ wealth through dividends and share buybacks.Delta Air Lines, Inc.

The guidance includes a negative impact of Irma to the tune of 1 point. Operating margin for the third quarter is projected between 15.5% and 16.5% Hurricane Irma is likely to impact the metric to the tune of approximately 120 million.In September 2017, Delta had projected passenger unit revenue to increase between 2% and 3%, and operating margin was forecast in the 16.5%-17.5% range. Those projections were made before Irma disrupted its operations leading to cancellations of 2,200 flights at Delta.Consequently, the fresh projections, though numerically weaker than the previous ones, pleased investors as the impact of Irma on the company’s financials was softer than expected. Fuel price per gallon in the third quarter of 2017 is expected between $1.68 and $1.73. Delta unveiled the projections while releasing its traffic data for the month of September.While traffic (total system) increased 0.3% year over year, capacity expanded 0.6% for the month. Load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) declined 20 basis points to 84.4% in the month as traffic growth was outpaced by capacity expansion. 2. Southwest Airlines expects operating revenue per available seat mile (RASM) to be flat to down 1% year over year. The metric was earlier projected in the range of down 1% to slightly up. Operating revenues in the third quarter are likely to be hurt to the tune of $100 million owing to the natural disasters.This low-cost carrier expects capacity in the third quarter to expand approximately 3% on a year-over-year basis. The metric is now expected to increase between 3.5% and 4% from the earlier projected increase in the 4% to 5% range. Fuel price (economic) per gallon is still projected between $2.00 and $2.05. Unit cots (excluding fuel and oil expense, special items and profit sharing costs) are projected to increase between 3% and 4%.3. American Airlines stated at its Investor Day that it expects total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) in the third quarter to grow at 0.5% on a year-over-year basis. The company projects third-quarter pre-tax margin excluding special items, to vary between 8.5% and 10.5%. Prior view was in the range of 10%-12%.However, its long-term view was very encouraging. The carrier’s efforts to modernize its fleet are impressive as well. The company is on track to introduce 496 new planes in its fleet by the year-end.4.  The deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history took place in Las Vegas on Oct 1, 2017.

The Russell 2000 index also outperformed the large-cap benchmarks in the last 30 days average after increasing more than 7%.Upbeat Vehicle Sales ReportDomestic vehicle sales remained upbeat in September after major car-makers reported strong sales for the month. Experts attributed such gains to heavy demands for vehicles in the wake of the two devastating hurricanes. Moreover, attractive discounts and demands for the repair of hurricane-damaged vehicles also bolstered revenues for auto makers.General Motors (GM  -  Free Report) stated that its sales surged 12% over the last month from about 279,397 vehicles the auto-giant sold last month. Meanwhile, Ford Motor (F  -  Free Report) reported a surge of 9% in its sales in the last month and that of Toyota Motor gained 15% to hit 226,632 vehicles — it sold last month.

Economists believe that such a showing can also be attributed to an increase in the new orders.

2579,DAL,"Airline hubs are specific airports that an airline company uses as a transfer sport to get travelers to their intended destination. This system is part of the spoke-hub transportation model, which has been favored by many airlines since the industry was deregulated in 1978. The model consists of a system of connections in which all airline traffic moves across spokes linked to the hub at the center.For example, Denver and Los Angeles represent hubs, with many spokes reaching outward to other cities. The purpose of this model is simple: to save airlines money and to provide passengers better routes to their selected destinations. Today, most airlines have at least one main airport that their flights must travel through, and from there, the flights go outwards on different network spokes.So which airlines dominate which airports? Let’s take a look at seven major U.S. airlines, and see where their hubs are located.American Airlines (AAL  -  Free Report)The world’s largest airline by fleet size and revenue, American Airlines has been an industry staple since its formation in 1930. The company is headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, and since its merger with US Airways in 2013, American Airlines operates nine domestic hubs:Dallas-Fort Worth International AirportCharlotte-Douglas International AirportChicago O’Hare International AirportPhiladelphia International AirportPhoenix Sky Harbor International AirportMiami International AirportRonald Reagan Washington International AirportLos Angeles AirportNew York City’s John F. Kennedy International Airport Alaska Airlines (ALK  -  Free Report)Alaska Airlines is American airline founded back in 1932. Originally offering flights from Anchorage, Alaska, the airlines today has flights to more than 100 destinations including Alaska, Hawaii, Canada, Costa Rica, and Mexico. Alaska Airlines’ fleet consists of mostly Boeing (BA) 737 aircraft, as well as Bombardier and Embraer planes. The company has three main hubs:Seattle-Tacoma International AirportPortland International AirportTed Stevens Anchorage International AirportAnd two focus cities:San Diego International AirportSan Jose International Airport Delta Airlines (DAL  -  Free Report)Like American, Delta has been present in the U.S. airline industry for decades. It began carrying passengers in 1929, and has grown rapidly since then due to many airline mergers. Headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, Delta operates 10 domestic hubs:Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International AirportDetroit Metropolitan Wayne County AirportCincinnati/Northern Kentucky International AirportJFK International AirportNew York City’s La Guardia AirportBoston Logan International AirportLos Angeles International AirportMinneapolis-St. Paul International AirportSalt Lake City International AirportSeattle-Tacoma International AirportAnd three international hubs:Amsterdam Airport SchipholTokyo Narita International AirportParis-Charles de Gaulle Airport Frontier AirlinesFounded in 1994, Frontier Airlines is a popular, privately-held, ultra-low-cost carrier headquartered in Denver Colorado. It recently announced a huge route expansion, and Frontier is adding 21 new destinations and 85 new routes to its network. Additionally, Frontier is adding dozens of non-stop flights between other cities that it already serves. With this network increase, Frontier’s route map will grow to 82 cities by next summer. The airline operates out of one main hub:Denver International AirportAnd seven focus cities:Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International AirportCleveland Hopkins International AirportHartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International AirportLas Vegas’ McCarran International AirportOrlando International AirportPhiladelphia International AirportTrenton-Mercer Airport JetBlue Airways (JBLU  -  Free Report)JetBlue is a popular low-cost airline option headquartered in Long Island in New York City. It serves 97 destinations in the U.S., Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America, and South America. JetBlue was founded in 1998, and primarily uses Airbus and Embraer aircraft. JetBlue utilizes the old0fashioned point-to-point system, which carries passengers short distances with few connecting flights, the airline operates out of six domestic focus cities:JFK International AirportFort Lauderdale-Hollywood International AirportBoston Logan International AirportLong Beach AirportSan Juan’s Luis Munoz Marin International AirportOrlando International Airport Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report)Touted as the world’s largest low-cost carrier, Southwest Airlines was launched in 1967 and is known for its Rapid Rewards frequent-flyer program. Its headquarters is in Dallas, Texas. While Southwest does not use the hub and spoke transportation model (it prefers the point-to-point system like JetBlue) the airline still operates out of 10 major domestic cities:Chicago Midway International AirportBaltimore-Washington International AirportMcCarran International AirportDallas Love Field AirportDenver International AirportPhoenix Sky Harbor International AirportHouston’s William P. Hobby AirportHartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International AirportOrlando International AirportLos Angeles International Airport United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report)Headquartered in Chicago, United Continental Holdings is an airline holding company for United Airlines and Continental Airlines, which formed in a merger back in 2010. Operating more than 700 mainline aircraft, United Continental needs a lot of hubs. The airline company has nine hubs in total, eight domestic:Chicago O’Hare International AirportHouston’s George Bush Intercontinental AirportDenver International AirportLos Angeles International AirportNewark Liberty International AirportSan Francisco International AirportWashington Dulles International AirportGuam A.B. Wan Pat International AirportAnd one international:Tokyo Narita International Airport As you can see, these seven major airlines overlap in their hub or major operating city locations nationwide, which can be looked at as a positive thing for frequent travelers. The hub and spoke model offers each airline (even Southwest and JetBlue) a way to replace a high number of half-empty routes with fewer, fuller ones, leading to less delays and a wide variety of connections.<!--{cke_protected}{C}%3C!%2D%2Dtd%20%7Bborder%3A%201px%20solid%20%23ccc%3B%7Dbr%20%7Bmso-data-placement%3Asame-cell%3B%7D%2D%2D%3E-->Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

In fact, 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to see their bottom line expand on a year-over-year basis at the end of the quarter.One such sector is the highly diversified transportation sector. In fact, the participants from this space are likely to end Q2 with the top and the bottom line expanding 4.7% and 9.1%, respectively. Notably, both the figures compared favorably to the readings in Q1, when earnings contracted 17.8% and revenues grew 6.9%.Moreover, the sector has already seen contrasting Q2 reports from two key players, Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report).

We can then distribute to our main destinations in Europe, be it London, Paris, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Berlin, Copenhagen, etc.,” Mogensen said. “That’s really the key.

2586,DAL,"On Aug 21, we issued an updated research report on Delta Air Lines, Inc.(DAL  -  Free Report).Delta’s performance with respect to passenger unit revenues is impressive. In the second quarter, passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM: a key measure of unit revenue) increased 2.5% year over year p. In fact, this was the first quarter in which the carrier recorded quarterly passenger unit revenue growth since the fourth quarter of 2014. The metric’s third-quarter guidance is also encouraging which projects it to grow in the 2.5-4.5% band (on a year-over-year basis) during the period.The company’s efforts to enhance shareholders’ wealth through dividends and share buybacks are also appreciative. In May, Delta announced that its board of directors approved of a new share repurchase program worth $5 billion. Simultaneously, the company hiked its quarterly dividend by over 50% to 30.5 cents per share.The carrier’s employee-friendly approach also raises optimism. In February, it paid more than $1 billion to its employees as part of a profit-sharing plan for 2016.The carrier’s initiatives to maintain capacity discipline deserve some praise. Keeping with this objective, capacity inched up only 0.4% in the second quarter of 2017. The airline’s July traffic is also laudable. Consolidated traffic – measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs) – came in at 21.73 billion, up 2.7% year over year. This upside was driven by a 4.8% rise in domestic RPMs.Consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) improved 1.5% to 24.65 billion on a year-over-year basis. Consolidated load factor or percentage of seats filled by passengers expanded 100 basis points to 88.1% on the back of traffic growth outweighing capacity expansion in July, leading to packed planes.The carrier’s expansion plans also hold promise. Delta recently announced plans to introduce flights to Lagos, Nigeria from the airline’s New York-JFK hub. This service will be operational next year and complement the existing one to Lagos from Atlanta. Also, the carrier intends to launch non-stop flights connecting Atlanta and Shanghai which will begin next July.Delta Air Lines, Inc. Price and Consensus  Delta Air Lines, Inc.

2587,DAL,"Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report) saw a 17% rise in traffic (measured in Revenue Passenger Miles or RPMs) to approximately 2.2 billion in Jun 2017 on a year-over-year basis. Available Seat Miles (ASMs) increased 19.2% to 2.53 billion. Load factor (the percentage of seats filled by passengers) decreased 160 basis points (bps) to 86.8% as capacity expansion outpaced traffic growth.Additionally, the airline recorded a 67.8% on-time performance and 96.1% completion factor for the same month.The company also witnessed a 11.4% year-over-year rise in RPMs to 11.83 billion on a year-to-date basis. ASMs rose 14.3% to 14.17 billion. Load factor decreased 210 bps to 83.5%. The passenger flight segments in the first half of 2017 rose to 11.8 billion, up 11.1%.Apart from releasing its June traffic numbers, this low-cost carrier also revised its guidance for the second quarter of 2017. This was done primarily owing to the dispute with pilots encountered in May, which resulted in many flight cancellations. Detailed results should be out on Jul 27. Moreover, capacity is projected to increase 13.6% on a year-over-year basis (old guidance had hinted at an increase of 14.5%).Following the flight cancellations, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company had to re-accommodate quite a few of the affected passengers either on its flights or those operated by other carriers. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Consequently, Spirit Airlines retained some of the revenues pertaining to the cancelled ASMs. This, in turn, boosted TRASM resulting in the upward revision. The metric is now expected to increase approximately 5.5% in the second quarter (previous guidance had called for an increase in the range of 4% to 5%).Cost per available seat miles, excluding fuel (CASM), is now expected to increase year over year in the band of 9.5% to 10.5% (old guidance had called for an increase in the range of 9% to 10%). Also, fuel cost per gallon (economic) is now pegged at $1.64 per gallon compared with $1.66, expected earlier.Price PerformanceShares of Spirit Airlines have underperformed the Zacks categorized Transportation-Airline industry in the last three months, mainly due to the dispute with its pilots. The stock has declined 7.5% against the industry’s gain of 13.8% during the same period.Of late, we note that passenger related issues have hurt the other US carriers too. These companies include the likes of American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report), Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report).5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.

2588,DAL,"The second-quarter earnings season is expected to be strong, with the S&P 500 index anticipated to see earnings growth of 5.6% and revenue growth of 4.5%, per the latest Earnings Trends. The stock market is also at record levels. However, the ongoing turmoil in Washington, geopolitical risks, Fed-related uncertainty, and lofty valuation could bring some difficulties for stocks this season (read: Sector ETFs & Stocks to Tap Q2 Earnings Growth).  While five of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to post double-digit earnings growth, six sectors would lag. Plus, the current earnings estimate is down from 7.9% projected at the start of the second quarter. Amid such volatility, investors should focus on ETFs with large allocations to stocks that have a high chance of surprising in their upcoming release. This could result in a winning bet this earnings season.How to Find ETFs?Handpicking ETFs with a portfolio of stocks that are most likely to beat on earnings is no mean task.

2589,DAL,"The third-quarter earnings season is in its tail end with majority of the companies having already unveiled their quarterly financial numbers. The picture that has emanated so far is a healthy one and this earnings season remains on track to end on a strong note, displaying substantial growth.The already reassuring picture is expected to get rosier by the end of this week. During the course, 826 companies including the 49 S&P 500 players are expected to report their financial figures. Consequently, we will have reports from the 455 S&P 500 players as 406 companies in the highly-sought after space had already posted results as of Nov 3.Per the latest Earnings Preview, the top and bottom lines for the 406 S&P 500 companies expanded 6.3% and 7.5%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. Additionally, approximately 66.7% and 73.9% of the S&P 500 members have outperformed on the revenues and earnings front. This progress in the quarterly performance can be attributed to a turnaround in the economy and improved job market scenario, among other factors.In fact, stocks in the highly sought-after fraternity are projected to end the third quarter with their top and bottom lines expanding 5.6% and 6.5%, respectively. Also, nine of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to witness their bottom line expand on a year-over-year basis.Turbulent Q3 for TransportsThe widely-diversified Zacks Transportation sector does not share this rosy picture with the sectoral earnings projected to contract 14%, due to higher costs and the recent hurricanes.Evidently, the bottom line for key sectoral participants like Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) in the third quarter has contracted a respective 7.6% and 28.6%, on a year-over-year basis. Thus, substantiating the fact that the transportation sector has been one of the worst victims of the natural disasters (Harvey, Irma, Maria and the earthquake in Mexico). For example, airline operators had to cancel multiple flights leading to significant loss in revenues.Additionally, these catastrophes have hurt operations of railroads by damaging important rail lines leading to rapid increase in freight costs. Also, the sluggishness of the automotive unit is a cause of concern for railroads. For trucking companies, shortage of drivers remains a major headwind. Meanwhile, the rise in labor costs has hurt J.B. Hunt Transport Services’ (JBHT  -  Free Report) third-quarter results and the trend is likely to continue in the rest of the quarter.Given this backdrop, investors interested in the transportation space will keenly await third-quarter reports from sector participants like Expeditors International of Washington (EXPD  -  Free Report) and Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings (AAWW  -  Free Report) that are scheduled for Nov 7.According to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Expeditors International of Washington provides logistic services globally. The company is engaged in the business of global logistics management including international freight forwarding and consolidation for both air and ocean freight.Higher operating expenses are likely to hit this transportation company’s bottom line in the quarter. In fact, increased volumes might lead to higher operating expenses at all the three primary divisions — Airfreight services, Ocean freight and ocean services, and Customs brokerage and other services — of the company. Personnel expenses are also expected to be high, owing to higher headcount.However, the top line is anticipated to improve in the soon-to-be reported quarter. Despite the prevalent imbalance between demand and supply in the Airfreight market, volume growth is likely to drive revenues at this flagship division. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Airfreight services segment’s third-quarter revenues is pegged at $692 million, higher than the $672 million reported in the previous quarter.Total revenues from the Ocean freight and ocean services unit are also expected to increase, backed by volume growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s third-quarter revenues is pegged at $547 million, higher than the $529 million reported in the second quarter of 2017.Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Customs brokerage and other services segment’s third-quarter revenues is pegged at $476 million, higher than the $472 million reported in the last quarter.Yet, the chances of this transportation company beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate are less, even though it carries a Zacks Rank #3. This is because Expeditors has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 60 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.In fact, our model did not predict an earnings beat earlier as well. Previously, when we issued its Q3 earnings preview article, the company had an Earnings ESP of -0.28%, while the Zacks Rank remained the same.Expeditors International of Washington, Inc.

QuoteAtlas Air Worldwide is the parent company of Atlas Air and Polar Air Cargo, which together operate the world's largest fleet of Boeing freighter aircraft.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for expenses on aircraft fuel is pegged at $85 million, 30.8% higher than figure reported a year-ago. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for block hours (a measure of aircraft utilization) is pegged at 64,313, 4.9% higher than the figure reported in the second quarter of 2017.Moreover, according to our proven model Atlas Air Worldwide has less chances of beating the estimates this quarter, despite its Zacks Rank #3.

2590,DAL,"Shares of Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) have struggled despite reporting better-than-expected third-quarter revenues and earnings per share on Oct 11. Since the company announced the third quarter results, the company has lost 5.1%, as against the S&P 500’s gain of 1.1%.Markedly, multiple headwinds like high fuel costs, back-to-back hurricanes have hurt the entire airline space. Naturally, Delta is no exception.Amid this gloomy backdrop, this Atlanta, GA-based company received good news when it reported encouraging traffic data for the month of October. Consolidated traffic — measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs) — came in at 18.3 billion, up 4.1% year over year. The upside was driven by a 4.9% increase in domestic RPMs.Consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) expanded 3.1% to 21.29 billion on a year-over-year basis. The metric increased 4.7% and 0.6% on the domestic and international fronts, respectively.Consolidated load factor or percentage of seats filled by passengers, improved 90 basis points to 86%. This is because traffic growth outweighed capacity expansion in October leading to packed planes. Additionally, the airline recorded an 89.4% on-time performance and 100% completion factor (mainline) for the same month.At the end of the first ten months of 2017, Delta generated consolidated RPMs of 184.83 billion (up 2.3% year over year) and ASMs of 215.56 billion (up 0.8% year over year). Notably, load factor was 85.7% versus 84.5% recorded in the same period last year.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderDelta has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Investors interested in the broader Transportation sector may consider Deutsche Lufthansa , Avianca Holdings (AVH  -  Free Report) and Hertz Global Holdings (HTZ  -  Free Report).

2591,DAL,"While designing the portfolios, investors solely aim at raking in handsome returns. Hence, they prefer adding the well-performing stocks to their portfolios and get rid of the underperformers.One such stock that investors would do well to avoid for the time being is Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report). We’ll tell you why.Multiple Headwinds Hurting the StockDelta, like its peers such as United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report), had to cancel multiple flights due to the natural calamities Harvey and Irma. Consequently, third-quarter results are likely to be hurt by the hurricanes.Earlier in September 2017, Delta gave a bearish view for the third quarter due to  higher fuel costs and soft yields. The Atlanta, GA-based company now anticipates passenger unit revenue for the said quarter to increase in the band of 2-3% compared with the previous guidance of 2.5-4.5%. Operating margin is expected to improve in the range of 16.5-17.5% than 18-20%, projected earlier.Moreover, Delta expects fuel prices per gallon between $1.68 and $1.73 compared with $1.55 and $1.60 band, guided earlier. The uptick was driven by an increase in market price that began in late July.Apart from high fuel costs, expenses on the labor front are also likely to limit bottom-line growth in the third quarter. In fact, labor costs have spiked as the company inked multiple labor deals. Meanwhile, high labor costs have been hurting the company for quite some time and the third quarter is likely to be no different.Certainly Not a Broker FavoriteGiven the challenges faced by the company, it is natural that the stock is not a favorite of brokers right now. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings being revised 11.1% downward over the last 30 days.Furthermore, it is in the best interests of investors to be guided by broker advice and the direction of their estimate revisions, given the wealth of information at the disposal of brokers. Markedly, the direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock.Additionally, Delta’s Momentum Score of F highlights its short-term unattractiveness.Price PerformanceShares of Delta have struggled so far this year due to the above headwinds. Consequently, the stock has underperformed its industry on a year-to-date basis. The stock has been down 2.1%, as against the industry’s gain of 8.6%.In ConclusionTaking into account the above-mentioned headwinds and the unfavorable readings, we advise investors to avoid the stock at the moment. The Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) carried by the stock also suggests the same.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the same space that the investors can consider are Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY  -  Free Report) and GOL Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes S.A. (GOL  -  Free Report), each holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

2594,DAL,"Shares of Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report) tumbled to a 52-week low of $119.05 during the trading session on August 17. However, the figure recovered marginally to close the trading session at $119.45, down 3.2% from the closing price of August 16.Why the Decline?Last month, this Las Vegas, NV-based company reported disappointing second-quarter 2017 results on the bottom-line front. Its earnings of $2.94 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents, and declined 20.11% from the year-ago figure due to higher costs.Cost per available seat miles (CASM), excluding fuel, increased 13.2% in the quarter. The new pilot agreement contributed to the increase in the metric.  In fact, the company inked many labor deals in the recent past leading to a spike in labor costs. This, in turn, has been hurting the bottom line for quite some time.In fact, this dismal performance is likely to continue in the third quarter as well. The company expects CASM to grow in the band of 16% to18% in the quarter. The metric is anticipated to increase in the 10% to 12% range for full-year 2017.Moreover, the guidance for the quarter with respect to total revenue per available seat miles (TRASM: a key measure of unit revenue) is disappointing. Allegiant expects third-quarter 2017 TRASM in the band of - 0.5% and +1.5% compared with the figure in the year-ago quarter. The projection compares unfavorably with 3.1% improvement registered by the metric in the second quarter of 2017.Apart from the earnings miss, the company’s July traffic report was disappointing with load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) declining.Notably, the  key metric at this  Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company fell 80 basis points year over year to 88.8% as capacity expansion outweighed traffic growth for the month. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Lacklustre Price PerformanceShares of the company have performed disappointingly so far this year. The stock has declined 27.2% against the industry’s gain of 11.2% on a year-to-date basis.Certainly Not a Broker FavoriteGiven the challenges faced by the company, it is natural that the stock is not a favorite of brokers right now. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter has moved down 24% to $1.52 in the last month, due to multiple downward revisions. Also, for full-year 2017 the same descended 5.5% to $9.33.Given the wealth of information at the disposal of brokers, it is in the best interests of investors to be guided by broker advice and the direction of their estimate revisions. Notably, the direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock.Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the Airline industry may consider Delta Air Lines, Inc.

2595,DAL,"Spirit Airlines, Inc. (SAVE  -  Free Report) has lost 4.51% in a year, significantly underperforming its industry’s 32.85% gain in the period.This downside was primarily due to the airline’s dispute with its pilots. Consequently, the carrier had to cancel multiple flights resulting in customer dissatisfaction. As a result of the disruption in services, the company had to incur heavy costs to the tune of $45 million, pertaining to passenger re-accommodation and other factors.As a matter of concern, this pilot dispute even hurt Spirit Airlines’ second-quarter results. The carrier reported lower-than-expected revenues in the quarter. Also, cost per available seat miles, excluding fuel (CASM) climbed 10% in the second quarter. Adding further to its woes, the tiff is anticipated to be a drag on the company’s third-quarter results too. Plus, the decline in load factor (percentage of seats filled by customers) in July due to capacity overexpansion is a cause for worry.The company has issued a disappointing guidance with respect to total revenue per available seat miles (TRASM: a key measure of unit revenue) for the third quarter due to pricing and competitive pressures. The metric is expected to decline in the band of 2-4% in the third quarter of 2017 on a year-over-year basis.Considering such a gloomy scenario, we believe investors would do well to dump this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock from their portfolios at the moment.Zacks Rank & Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the airline space are Air France-KLM SA (AFLYY  -  Free Report), Delta Air Lines, Inc.

2596,DAL,"When video emerged online showing a passenger being dragged off a United Continental (UAL  -  Free Report) flight earlier this year, consumers, analysts, and investors alike reacted in horror. Shares of the Chicago-based carrier took a huge hit as a result of the incident, and the legacy airline’s market cap lost upwards of $950 million.In a statement, United said four crew members needed to get to a flight departing from Louisville otherwise it would be canceled, and passengers were asked to voluntarily give up their seats. However, no one volunteered, and four passengers were then selected at random, including David Dao, the man who was forcibly removed.What happened onboard in April was not United’s last PR mess that surfaced. Soon after, the airline barred two teenage girls from boarding a flight after a gate agent decided the leggings they were wearing were inappropriate. The incident was first reported by a fellow passenger on Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report), and subsequently went viral.But the girls were apparently “pass travelers,” a company benefit that allows United employees and their dependents to travel for free on a standby basis; leggings violated this specific dress code, since pass travelers are “representing” the airline.Incidents like these began popping up all over the Internet and traditional news sites, detailing the poor customer service experienced on flights across the industry. From an American Airlines’ (AAL  -  Free Report) crew member yanking away a mother’s stroller and almost hitting her child to the death of a giant rabbit named Simon on a United flight, viral stories about flying nightmares were nonstop.Industry OutlookDespite one public relations disaster after another, the airline industry kept chugging along, and right now, Transportation-Airline sits in the top 8% of all 265 industries ranked on the Zacks Industry Rank; the sector has also returned over 10.5% year-to-date, which is on par with the S&P 500, and 36% over the past 12 months.Historically, airline stocks were—and they still are—a turbulent investment, closely tied to fluctuating oil prices. But during periods of low oil prices and steady economic growth, like the type of environment we’re in now, airlines see their profits rise. Since 2014, U.S. airline stocks as a group have gained almost 90%.The International Air Transport Association (IATA) expects the global airline industry to bring in $30 billion in profits this year, with 4 billion projected travelers. The earnings represent a 4.1% net profit margin on top of total revenue of $736 billion.Even Berkshire Hathaway  CEO Warren Buffet, who publicly denounced airline investments in the past, sees promise in the industry. Last year, the famous investor bought stakes in all four major U.S. carriers: United, American, Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report), and Southwest (LUV  -  Free Report).Given this overall bullish sentiment, let’s take a look at three airline stocks investors should consider for their portfolio.SkyWest (SKYW  -  Free Report) operates one of the larger regional airlines in the U.S., and provides passenger and air freight services. The carrier sits at a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank, and boasts a VGM score of ‘A,’ with individual Style Scores of ‘A’ in Value and Growth.SkyWest expects year-over-year earnings growth of 18.59% for the current year, and three analysts have revised their estimates upwards in the last 30 days compared to none lower. The company has an average earnings surprise of nearly 13%, while SkyWest has also beaten expectations in the past four consecutive quarters. In the past one year, SKYW has given its investors a solid return of over 30%.Delta is one of the country’s fastest growing international carriers, and has added more international capacity than all other U.S. airlines combined. Sitting at a #1 (Strong Buy) on the Zacks Rank, Delta also has a Value Style Score of ‘A,’ with an overall VGM score of ‘B.’The Atlanta-based airline anticipates year-over-year earnings growth of about 3.6% for the current year, with three positive estimate revisions in the last 30 days compared to only one negative revision in the same time frame. Delta has beaten expectations in three of the past four consecutive quarters, and has an average earnings surprise of almost 2%. Shares of DAL have surged over the past year, gaining over 35%.Despite its many PR setbacks, United is actually looking to be a pretty promising pick. The airline is one of the largest in the world, and is the holding company for United Airlines and Continental Airlines. United is currently a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank, and has a VGM score of ‘A,’ with Value and Growth Style Scores of ‘A’ and ‘B,’ respectively.While United expects earnings loss of about 9% for the current year, the airline’s earnings do appear to bounce back next year, with United projecting year-over-year growth of over 12.5%. This, however, does not come as a surprise, as the airline was hit hard financially earlier this year. Historically, United has beaten earnings in the past four consecutive quarters, and has an average earnings surprise of 5.4%. Over the past 12 months, UAL has gained almost 39%.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year. With compounding, rebalancing, and exclusive of fees, it can turn thousands into millions of dollars.But here's something even more remarkable: You can master this proven system without going to a single class or seminar.

2597,DAL,"Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report) posted a significant rise in air traffic for the month of July. Traffic – measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs) – came in at 2.35 billion, up 17.8% on a year-over-year basis. Consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) also expanded 22.7% to 2.72 billion.However, load factor or percentage of seats filled by passengers decreased to 86.3% from 89.8% recorded last July. Load factor fell as traffic growth was outpaced by capacity expansion for the month.In fact, this Miramar, FL-based low-cost carrier registered a completion factor (system wide) of 97.2% for the month with 73.5% flights on schedule.Notably, for the first seven months of 2017, Spirit Airlines registered a 12.4% increase in RPMs to 14.18 billion and a 15.5% rise in ASMs to 16.9 billion, both on a year-over-year basis. But load factor fell 240 basis points to 83.9% in the period.Price PerformanceShares of Spirit Airlines have underperformed its industry in the last three months mainly due to the dispute with its pilots. The stock was down 31% compared with the industry’s decline of 2.4% during the same period. In fact, the dispute with pilots was largely responsible for Spirit Airlines issuing a below-par forecast with respect to total revenue per available seat miles (TRASM: a key measure of unit revenue) for the third quarter. The metric is expected to decline in the band of 2% to 4% on a year-over-year basis, as well. Currently, the company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2598,DAL,"Harvey, which wreaked havoc on Houston — America’s fourth-largest city — with heavy rainfall has negatively impacted airline operations causing multiple flight cancellations. In fact, air travel was hurt with two Houston airports, George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH) and William P. Hobby Airport (HOU), reportedly remaining closed for a few days (since the noon of Aug 27) due to Harvey-induced heavy rainfall. The airports are, however, currently operational.Bleak Third-Quarter ForecastsThe picture pertaining to the extent of impact on sector participants is becoming clearer with many of them unveiling fresh forecasts for the third quarter of 2017. As was widely expected, United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report), the parent company of United Airlines, has been the worst hit as Houston is the carrier’s second-largest hub. In fact, more than 7,400 flights were cancelled at IAH, with operations suspended at the airport due to the unprecedented storm, for more than four days.The company trimmed its views with respect to pre-tax margin and passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM: a key measure of unit revenue) for the current quarter mainly due to Harvey at the Cowen and Company Global Transportation Conference. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) carrier now expects PRASM to decline between 3% and 5% year over year (the earlier guidance provided in July had called for the metric to be in the range of+1% to - 1%).In fact, Harvey has impacted the current-quarter PRASM to the tune of approximately 150 basis points. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The carrier now expects pre-tax margin between 8% and 10% (previous guidance had called for the metric to be in the range of12.5% and 14.5%). Higher fuel prices are also expected to hurt the bottom line in the third quarter. Fuel price per gallon is now projected in the band of $1.72 and $1.77 (earlier view: $1.56 to $1.61). Cost per available seat miles, excluding fuel, profit sharing, third-party business expenses and other special items, is now projected to increase between 2.5% and 3.5% (earlier view had called for an increase in the band of 2% and 3%).The Chicago-based company now expects capacity to grow between 3% and 3.5% compared with the approximately 4% expansion projected earlier. These forecasts regarding key metrics hurt the United Continental stock badly on Sep 6. The stock closed the trading session at $60.33, down 1.3% from the Sep 5 closing price.Apart from United Continental, Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) also revised its outlook for the third quarter at the same investor conference. The Dallas-based carrier had to call off approximately 2,800 flights due to the storm. Operating revenue per available seat mile (RASM) is projected in the range of down 1% to slightly up year over year. The metric was earlier projected to increase approximately 1% from the year-ago quarter.Following the Harvey impact, the low-cost carrier trimmed its current-quarter capacity growth projection. The metric is now expected to increase between 3.5% and 4% from the earlier projected increase in the 4% to 5% range. Fuel price (economic) per gallon is now projected between $2 and $2.05 (earlier projection was in the band of $1.95 and $2).Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report), which has significant exposure to Houston, expects its top line to shrink to the tune of approximately $8.5 million in the third quarter due to the natural calamity. Currently, Spirit Airlines anticipates total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM: a key measure of unit revenue) in the current quarter to decline between 7% and 8.5% (the previous guidance had called for a decline in the band of 2% and 4%). In fact, per the company 100 basis points of the trimmed guidance can be attributed to the negative impact of Harvey. Also, aggressive competitive pricing in its key markets contributed to the bleak forecast.Another low-cost carrier, JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) has also revised its third quarter view on key metrics. JetBlue now expects RASM in the band of -1% to +1% (on a year-over-year basis). The earlier projection had called for the metric between -0.5% and +2.5%. The company attributed the reduction in the guidance to the prevalent competitive pricing environment. JetBlue also trimmed its capacity growth projection to the 6% to 7% range from 6.5% to 7.5% projected earlier.Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) also trimmed its passenger unit revenue outlook for the third quarter on Sep 5, while releasing its August traffic report. American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) expects TRASM to grow at a slower pace in the quarter due to difficult year-over-year comparisons. In fact, the metric is expected to perform better in the final quarter of 2017 compared with the current quarter.Hurricane Irma: What’s in Store?As if the disruptions caused by Harvey were not enough, Hurricane Irma has offered a fresh challenge to the airline companies. In fact, this latest natural calamity already resulted in cancellation of multiple flights to Caribbean cities.Meanwhile, a controversy has erupted regarding ticket prices for flights from Florida where Hurricane Irma is fast approaching. Naturally, investors would keenly await updates on the issue and the impact of Irma on airline stocks.In fact, stocks in the airline space have been hit hard by other headwinds like high labor costs too. The disastrous impact of Harvey has further complicated matters. Now, with Hurricane Irma emerging there seems to be little respite for the sector in the near-term going forward.Price PerformanceIn view of the above headwinds, it is of little wonder that the Zacks Airline industry underperformed the broader market in the last three months. The S&P 500 Index gained 1%, as against the industry’s decline of 5.8%. One Simple Trading Idea Since 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

2599,DAL,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 6.9% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Delta Air Lines Lags Q2 Earnings Despite PRASM GrowthDelta Air Lines kick-started the second-quarter earnings season in the airline space on a disappointing note. The company’s earnings as well as revenues lagged expectations. Also, the top- and bottom-line miss disappointed investors. Consequently, shares of the company were down in early trading.The Atlanta, GA-based carrier’s second-quarter earnings (excluding special items) of $1.64 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.66.However, earnings climbed 11.56% on a year-over-year basis on the back of a 3.3% operating revenue growth. Meanwhile, quarterly operating revenues of $10.79 billion fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.During the quarter, passenger revenues, cargo revenues and others increased 2.9%, 10.9% and 4.9%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. Average fuel price (adjusted) was down 15.7% to $1.66 per gallon.Operating StatisticsRevenue passenger miles (a measure of air traffic) increased 2.1% to approximately 57.6 billion.

In addition, passenger mile yield grew 0.8%.Operating ExpensesTotal operating expenses, including special items, increased 9% year over year to $8,763 million. Non-fuel consolidated unit cost or cost per available seat mile (CASM: normalized), including profit sharing, climbed 5.5%, mainly owing to wage increases, product investments and the operational disruption in April.LiquidityAt the end of the second quarter, Delta had $2.24 billion in cash and cash equivalents and adjusted net debt of $8.4 billion. The carrier generated $2.8 billion of adjusted operating cash flow and $1.9 billion in free cash flow in the quarter.Dividend and Share RepurchaseDelta returned $748 million to its shareholders through dividends ($148 million) and share buybacks ($600 million) in the quarter under review. In fact, we are impressed with the company’s efforts to return greater value to its investors.In May 2017, the company’s board of directors approved a new share repurchase program worth $5 billion. The new share buyback plan is expected to be completed by Jun 2020. Simultaneously, the airline major increased its quarterly dividend by over 50%.Third-Quarter GuidanceThe carrier expects operating margin in the range of 18% to 20%.

2600,DAL,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Delta Air Lines has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 9.95, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.09. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Delta Air Lines’ current PE ratio marginally above its midpoint (which is 9.85) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 10.18. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Delta Air Lines has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 9.01, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Delta Air Lines stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Delta Air Lines has a P/S ratio of about 0.90. This is significantly lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.24 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is slightly below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Delta Air Lines currently has a Value Style Score of ‘A’, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes DAL a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Delta Air Lines is just 0.79, a level that is considerably lower than the industry average of 1.43. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, DAL is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Delta Air Lines might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name.

2601,DAL,"The past week saw key airline players like Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report), United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) and Hawaiian Airlines — the wholly owned Hawaiian Holdings (HA  -  Free Report) — revealing traffic data for Jul 2017. Delta and Hawaiian reported an increase in their respective load factors (% of seats filled by passengers) while the metric decreased at United Continental as capacity expansion outpaced traffic growth at the Chicago-based carrier in the month.Moreover, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) revealed encouraging global traffic data for the month of June as well as the first half of 2017. On the non-traffic front, Alaska Airlines, a wholly owned subsidiary of Alaska Air Group (ALK  -  Free Report), started operating flights from San Francisco and Los Angeles to Mexico City.On the price front, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index declined 0.82% to $110.78 over the past week. Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return(Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Aug 02, 2017)Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1. At Delta, consolidated traffic – measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs) – came in at 21.73 billion, up 2.7% year over year. The upside was driven by a 4.8% increase in domestic RPMs. In fact, consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) expanded 1.5% to 24.65 billion on a year-over-year basis (read more: Delta Air Lines' July Traffic & Load Factor Increase).Delta sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.2. Hawaiian Holdings’ wholly owned subsidiary Hawaiian Airlines reported a 1.9% rise in traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs) for the month of July. The figure increased to 1.48 billion from 1.45 billion a year ago. On a year-over-year basis, consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) inched up 0.5% to 1.69 billion. Also, the load factor or percentage of seats filled by passengers rose to 87.3% from 86.2% recorded in Jul 2016, as traffic growth outpaced capacity expansion (read more: Hawaiian Holdings' Arm Sees Rise in Traffic Figures for July).3. Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report) too reported traffic numbers for the month of July. Traffic for the total system, which includes scheduled service and fixed fee contract and measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs), increased 2.7% on a year-over-year basis to 1.16 billion. System capacity, measured in available seat miles (ASMs), improved 3.6% in the month to 1.31 billion.With capacity growth outpacing the rise in traffic, load factor declined 80 basis points year over year to 88.8%. Allegiant’s passenger count rose 6.8% in Jul 2017. Allegiant maintained its third-quarter guidance for total revenue per available seat miles, which it gave last month while releasing second-quarter results.4. United Continental, the parent company of United Airlines posted impressive traffic numbers for the month of July. Traffic – measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs) – was 21.5 billion, up 3.9% from a year ago.On a year-over-year basis, consolidated capacity expanded 4.6% to 24.8 billion. Consequently, load factor decreased to 86.9% from 87.5%, a year ago. This was because capacity expansion outpaced traffic growth. The carrier still expects passenger unit revenue for the third quarter to be down 1% to up 1% on a year-over-year basis. 5. The monthly data released by the IATA revealed a 7.8% year-over-year increase in demand for air travel across the globe for the month of Jun 2017. The rise was attributable to an increase in both international and domestic traffic (measured in revenue passenger kilometers) in the month. The report also revealed a 6.5% rise in capacity (measured in available seat kilometers).The greater increase in traffic compared with capacity resulted in the load factor improving 100 basis points to 81.9% in June. Moreover, traffic grew at the highest pace (7.9%) in 12 years in the first half of the year on the back of an improving economy and subdued air fares. Load factor also touched a record 80.7% in the first half of 2017.6. In a bid to expand further, Alaska Airlines started operating non-stop flights connecting Mexico City to two key U.S. cities —San Francisco and Los Angeles. The start of the new services marks the most significant network expansion in the company’s history. In fact, 29 new routes are expected to be launched by the year-end.Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months. CompanyPast WeekLast 6 monthsHA0.95%-17.23%UAL-0.46%-6.65%GOL9%40.5%DAL-0.95%2.13%JBLU-1.41%10.2%AAL-2.12%7.64%SAVE-7.94%-29.32%LUV-0.9%0.2%CPA-0.33%27.75%ALK0.6%-12.53%                 The table above shows that the majority of airline stocks traded in the red over the past week.

2602,DAL,"The International Air Transport Association released airline passenger demand metrics for the first month of the summer travel season late last week, and the results proved to be strong.However, the airline industry has fluctuated so far this summer. So let’s take a look at some of the biggest airline stocks as the vital summer travel season nears its end.Traffic DataIATA reported global passenger traffic data and demand for June on August 3. The firm announced that global passenger demand soared by 7.8% year-over-year based on passenger traffic data. According to previous reports, demand rose 7.7% in May.On top of June gains, the industry reached a 12-year high in traffic growth at 7.9% for the first six months of the year. The industry’s first half 80.7% load factor, a full flight measurement, reached an all-time high.Overall June capacity, measured in available seat kilometers, rose by 6.5%, while load factor gained 1% to 81.9%.“A brighter economic picture and lower airfares are keeping demand for travel strong,” IATA’s CEO Alexandre de Juniac said in a statement. “But as costs rise, this stimulus of lower fares is likely to fade. And uncertainties such as Brexit need to be watched carefully. Nonetheless, we still expect 2017 to see above-trend growth.”June airline demand climbed 4.4% in North America and capacity rose 4.1%, while load factor grew marginally to 84.5%. Travel to North American was up, but travel to and in international destinations rose far more. European airlines traffic jumped 8.8% in June, and the region’s load factor rose 1.8% to 85.9%, which is the highest overall. Asia-Pacific, Latin American, and African airlines’ traffic all skyrocketed over 9% in June, with Africa posting the highest jump at 9.9%.With all of this increased traffic airline companies must be doing well, right?AirlinesDelta (DAL  -  Free Report), Air France-KLM (AFLYY  -  Free Report), Lufthansa , and Ryanair (RYAAY  -  Free Report) are all currently Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks, and the airline transportation industry currently ranks in the top 7% of the 256 different industries that Zacks tracks.U.K. based Ryanair rests only slightly below its 52-week and all-time high. Lufthansa currently sits just $1 below its 52-week high water mark. However, the airline industry as a whole has suffered since mid-July.Some of the biggest U.S. airlines, Southwest (LUV  -  Free Report), United (UAL  -  Free Report), and American Airlines (AAL  -  Free Report), all fell less than 1% on Tuesday as part of a growing downward trend. Smaller carriers Spirit (SAVE  -  Free Report), JetBlue (JBLU  -  Free Report), and Hawaiian (HA  -  Free Report) also dipped slightly.The US Global Jets ETF (JETS  -  Free Report), which tracks the airline industry as a whole, fell as well. Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) stock was also dragged down slightly along with the airline companies.July and August flight metrics won’t be reported for a while. But June flight demand, traffic, and load increases have not seemed to help airlines at the moment. So for now, investors might have to see if airline companies can turn heightened demand into soaring stock prices.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

2604,DAL,"Shares of Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) have been struggling ever since it reported lower-than-expected second-quarter revenues and earnings per share last month. In fact, the stock has declined 7.9% in the last one month compared with its industry’s fall of 4.9%. Amid this gloomy backdrop, this Atlanta, GA-based company received good news when it reported encouraging traffic data for the month of July.Consolidated traffic – measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs) – came in at 21.73 billion, up 2.7% year over year. The upside was driven by a 4.8% increase in domestic RPMs.In fact, consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) expanded 1.5% to 24.65 billion on a year-over-year basis. However, the metric declined 1% on the international front mainly due to a 6.9% reduction in the metric in the Pacific area.Consolidated load factor, or percentage of seats filled by passengers, improved 100 basis points to 88.1%. This is because traffic growth outweighed capacity expansion in July leading to packed planes. Additionally, the airline recorded an 83.1% on-time performance and 99.9% completion factor (mainline) for the same month.At the end of the first seven months of 2017, Delta generated consolidated RPMs of 127.6 billion (up 1.6% year over year) and ASMs of 148.75 billion (up 0.2% year over year). Notably, load factor was 85.6%versus 84.4% recorded in the same period last year.Apart from the traffic report, Delta was also in the news recently when it announced its decision to invest €375 million in Air France-KLM SA (AFLYY  -  Free Report), thereby strengthening its ties with the latter.In fact, Delta has been constantly looking to expand its operations. To this end, the carrier recently announced its intention to launch non-stop flights connecting Atlantaand Shanghai. The new service will be operational from July next year.Zacks Rank & Key PicksDelta currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

2605,DAL,"The transportation sector is riding high on second-quarter financial results, with total earnings from 97.8% of the sector’s total market capitalization that has reported so far are up 9.6% on revenue growth of 10%. Both revenue and earnings surprises of 76.9% also seem impressive.This is because most of the industry players dominating the sector managed to beat our estimates on earnings or revenues or both, while a few lagged (read: 3 ETFs Loaded with Positive ESP Stocks).For a better understanding, let’s dig into the earnings results of some well-known industry players:Transportation Earnings in FocusThe world's largest package delivery company – United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) – topped our estimates on both fronts. Earnings of $1.58 surpassed our earnings estimate by 12 cents while revenues of $15.75 billion edged past our estimated $15.48 billion. For the current fiscal 2017, the company continues to expect earnings per share in the range of $5.80–$6.10. The Zacks Consensus Estimate at the time of earnings release was pegged at $5.95.The major railroads – Union Pacific (UNP  -  Free Report)) and Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) – beat on both the top and the bottom lines while Norfolk Southern Corp (NSC  -  Free Report) lagged on revenues. UNP and KSU surpassed our earnings estimate by 8 cents and 7 cents, respectively, and revenue estimates by $87 million and $33 million. On the other hand, earnings of $1.71 at NSC trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7 cents while revenues of $2.637 billion were marginally below our estimated $2.642 billion.Ryder Systems (R  -  Free Report), the leader in supply chain management and fleet management services, beat our earnings estimate by 7 cents and revenue estimate by $24 million (see: all the Industrials ETFs here).The two largest U.S. airlines – Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental (UAL  -  Free Report) – reported varied results. Earnings of $1.62 and revenues of $10.79 billion at Delta missed our estimates of $1.66 and $10.85 billion, respectively. At United Continental, earnings per share of $2.75 came above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.72 and revenues of $10 billion were ahead of our estimated $9.96 billion.Last but not the least, earnings for the leading trucking carrier – J.B. Hunt (JBHT  -  Free Report) – came in below the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents and revenues were $6 million below our estimate.ETFs in FocusHowever, strong results failed to boost transport stocks as the sector saw 2.4% average decline (average price difference between a day before and after the earnings announcement of a stock) in response to earnings announcements. Given this, both transport ETFs, iShares Dow Jones Transportation Average Fund (IYT  -  Free Report) and SPDR S&P Transportation ETF (XTN  -  Free Report), saw rough trading over the past one month. IYT shed 3.7% while XTN was down 2.2%. Both funds have an unfavorable Zacks ETF Rank of 4 or ‘Sell’ rating with a High risk outlook.IYTThe fund tracks the Dow Jones Transportation Average Index, giving investors exposure to a small basket of 20 securities. The fund has a certain tilt toward large cap stocks at 55% while mid and small caps account for 28% and 18% share, respectively, in the basket. Though the product is heavily concentrated on the top firm – FedEx (FDX) – at 13.7%, the in-focus eight firms collectively make up for 46.7% of the portfolio. From a sector perspective, air freight & logistics takes the top spot with 29.8% of the portfolio while railroads, airlines and trucking round off to the next three spots with double-digit exposure each. The fund has accumulated nearly $842.7 million in AUM while sees solid trading volume of more than 342,000 shares a day. It charges 44 bps in annual fees (read: Transport ETF Hits New 52-Week High).XTNThis fund tracks the S&P Transportation Select Industry Index, holding 45 stocks in its basket. It is skewed toward small caps at 55% while the rest is split between mid and large caps. As a result, the in-focus firms account for over 2% share each. Further, about 36.4% of the portfolio is dominated by trucking, while airlines takes one-fourth share. Airfreight & logistics, and railroads also make up for a double-digit allocation each. With AUM of $176.5 million, the fund charges 35 bps in fees per year from investors and trades in a moderate volume of around 33,000 shares a day. Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

2606,DAL,"Qatar Airways has announced that it will no longer invest in American Airlines (AAL  -  Free Report), reversing its decision in June to buy as much as a 10% stake. In reaction to this news, American Airlines stock closed the day at $50.45 per share, down 1.19%.“Further review of the proposed financial investment, taking into account the latest public disclosure of American Airlines, has demonstrated that the investment no longer meets our objectives,” Qatar said in a statement.A spokeswoman for American said there would be no elaboration on what Qatar was referring to when they said, “the latest public disclosure of American Airlines.”Many were shocked in June when Qatar announced its interest in American Airlines. American, along with U.S. competitors Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) and United Airlines (UAL  -  Free Report), have lobbied the government to limit Qatar’s growth in the U.S. The U.S. carriers have argued that Qatar, along with Persian Gulf airlines Etihad and Emirates, receive unfair subsidies.American CEO Doug Park has also maintained his criticism of Qatar despite their investment interest. “We aren’t particularly excited about Qatar’s outreach, and we find it puzzling given our extremely public stance the illegal subsidies that Qatar… receives,” he said after news broke about Qatar’s interest. “We remain committed to that effort, and we will remain so even with this potential investment.”Qatar said it will “continue to investigate alternative investment opportunities in the United States of America and elsewhere that do meet our objectives” to develop “the best possible travel experience for its customers.”AAL remains a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with a VGM score of ‘A.’ Last week, it reported second quarter fiscal 2017 earnings of $1.92 per share, beating our estimate of $1.87.More Stock News: Tech Opportunity Worth $386 Billion in 2017From driverless cars to artificial intelligence, we've seen an unsurpassed growth of high-tech products in recent months.
