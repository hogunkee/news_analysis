0,ALXN,"Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ACHN  -  Free Report) reported a loss of 17 cents per share for the fourth quarter of 2017, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 15 cents and a loss of 3 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.The company generated no revenues in the reported quarter. However, it reported revenues of $15 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 earned from an agreement with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), which was terminated in 2017.Shares of Achillion have underperformed the industry year to date. The company’s shares lost 30.4%, compared to the industry’s decrease of 2.6%.Research and development (R&D) expenses increased nearly 4.4% from the year-ago period to $15.7 million. The increase was due to higher clinical trial expenses for lead pipeline candidate, ACH-4471, and manufacturing and formulation expenses for next generation factor D inhibitor candidate, ACH-5228. General and administrative (G&A) expenses increased 64.8% year over year to $8.7 million as Achillion paid underwriting fees related to sale of its common stock by J&J.2017 PerformanceThe company generated no revenues for full-year 2017. It had reported revenues of $15 million in the year-ago period. Loss per share widened 37.8% year over year to 62 cents. R&D expenses increased almost 10% year over to $65.1 million due to increase in clinical cost related ACH-4471 and preclinical and manufacturing costs for ACH-5228, partially offset by reduced preclinical and manufacturing costs for ACH-4471. G&A expenses rose 18.4% to $24.5 million primarily due to higher legal and consulting fees.2018 OutlookThe company provided its R&D and SG&A expense guidance for 2018 in the range of $58-$60 million and $19-$20 million, respectively. The company expects R&D expense to decrease due to its restructuring plans. Net loss is expected to be in the range of 55 cents - 58 cents per shareRestructuring DetailsConcurrent with the earnings results, the company announced an operational restructuring plan to focus on its existing factor D inhibitor candidates and reduce expenses. Achillion will also reduce its workforce by 20% under its restructuring plan. The company plans to save $10 million in 2018.Achillion is planning to complete a phase II study on its most advanced candidate, ACH-4471, in C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) or immune complex-mediated membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (IC-MPGN) in 2018, with interim data planned in the third quarter of 2018. Two more studies are planned for 2018, which will evaluate ACH-4471 in C3G.Meanwhile, interim data from the ongoing phase II study evaluating ACH-4471 monotherapy in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (“PNH”) is planned for the fourth quarter of 2018.

1,ALXN,"Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ACHN  -  Free Report) announced that it has initiated a phase I study on its next-generation, oral, alternative pathway factor D inhibitor, ACH-5548. Interim data from the same is expected during the second half of 2018.ACH-5548 is the third compound discovered and developed by Achillion from its complement factor D portfolio, which consists of another two such compounds, namely ACH-5228 and ACH-4471.Factor D, an essential protein of the complement pathway is integral to the human innate immune system. Though this area has commercial opportunity, the complement-mediated space is highly crowded with many biotech companies working on to introduce these treatments to the market.Achillion is focused on its factor D portfolio. The company is working on to develop oral inhibitors of complement Factor D. Targeted therapeutic areas include paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), C3 glomerulopathy (C3G), immune complex membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and dry age-related macular degeneration.The phase I placebo-controlled trial administered single-ascending dose of ACH-5548 to healthy volunteers. Approximately, 28 patients are estimated to be enrolled in this assessment. The program’s primary endpoint is to evaluate the safety and tolerability while the secondary includes evaluations of pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and examination of alternative pathway inhibition.The company also aims at completing the phase I studies on its two next generation factor D inhibitors – ACH-5228 and ACH-5548 – in the fourth quarter of 2018.Notably, the company’s lead candidate, ACH-4471, has shown clinically meaningful complement inhibition of factor D in PNH patients. The company plans to present results from a 14-day phase II study on ACH-4471 for the treatment of C3G during the third quarter of 2018 and post interim data from phase II clinical trials with longer-duration on ACH-4471 to address both C3G and PNH in the second half of 2018.Achillion also anticipates to initiate another phase II study on ACH-4471 for evaluating the candidate in combination with Alexion’s (ALXN  -  Free Report) Soliris for potentially long-term treatment of PNH patients, who are already being treated with Soliris.Shares of Achillion have lost 0.7% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 3.1%. Achillion currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2,ALXN,"Investors interested in Medical - Biomedical and Genetics stocks are likely familiar with Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN  -  Free Report) and Regenxbio (RGNX  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Alexion Pharmaceuticals and Regenxbio are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This means that ALXN's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.ALXN currently has a forward P/E ratio of 17.76, while RGNX has a forward P/E of 37.74. We also note that ALXN has a PEG ratio of 1. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. RGNX currently has a PEG ratio of 9.48.Another notable valuation metric for ALXN is its P/B ratio of 3.05. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, RGNX has a P/B of 7.58.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to ALXN's Value grade of B and RGNX's Value grade of D.ALXN sticks out from RGNX in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that ALXN is the better option right now.

3,ALXN,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report)) submitted a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the FDA for approval of ALXN1210, the company’s investigational long-acting C5 complement inhibitor, for the treatment of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH).The company uses a rare disease priority review voucher, which enables the FDA to expedite the review in eight months, instead of the standard 12 months. Priority Review designation from the FDA is generally granted to drugs that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the safety and effectiveness of the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a serious disease. The application is supported by data from two rigorous phase III studies in the largest population of patients with PNH ever studied The studies included patients who had never received a complement inhibitor, and patients who were stable on Alexion’s lead drugSoliris (eculizumab) and switched to ALXN1210. The objective of the studies was to demonstrate that patients with PNH can be effectively and safely switched from treatment with Soliris, every two weeks, to treatment with ALXN1210, every eight weeks. Weight-optimized treatment with ALXN1210, every eight weeks, demonstrated non-inferiority to treatment every two weeks with Soliris on all primary endpoints and key secondary endpoints, in both studies.Moreover, none of the patients, treated with ALXN1210, experienced breakthrough hemolysis (one of the key secondary endpoints) compared to five patients treated with Soliris.In addition to the BLA in the United States, Alexion is preparing submissions for the approval of ALXN1210 as a treatment for patients with PNH in the European Union (EU) by mid-year and in Japan in the second half of the year.Year to date, shares of Alexion have increased 2% against the industry’s decline of 5.8%. Further, Alexion is enrolling pediatric PNH patients in a phase III study of ALXN1210. The study includes patients who have never received treatment with a complement inhibitor and those who enter the study stabilized on Soliris. Patients are also being enrolled and dosed in a phase III trial, with ALXN1210 administered intravenously, every eight weeks, in complement inhibitor treatment-naive adolescent and adult patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). The company is expected to complete enrollment in the second quarter and announce the results in the fourth quarter of 2018. Enrollment and dosing are also ongoing in a phase III trial of ALXN1210 in pediatric patients with aHUS.Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

5,ALXN,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report) posted fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $1.48 per share which were higher than the year-ago earnings of $1.26 by 17.1%. Earnings also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.28. Strong product revenues drove the bottom line in the quarter.Revenues rose 9.5% year over year to $909.7 million and exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $878 million. Revenues were driven by increased sales of Soliris, Strensiq and Kanuma.  Following the earnings release, shares of the company rose 0.7%. Over a year, Alexion’s share price has declined 7.3%, underperforming the industry’s gain of 1.4%.   Revenues in DetailSoliris (paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (“PNH”) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS)) sales were up 6% to $791.9 million during the quarter driven by strong volume growth. While Strensiq (hypophosphatasia [“HPP”]) contributed $95.6 million to revenues, up 36% year over year, Kanuma (lysosomal acid lipase deficiency [LAL-D]) contributed $21.9 million (up 99%) to quarterly revenues.Cost SummaryAdjusted research and development (R&D) expenses were $188.6 million, up 1.3% year over year.Adjusted selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $245.2 million, up 4.8% year over year.2017 ResultsEarnings per share for 2017 were $5.86, up 27% year over year.Revenues in 2017 came in at $3.55 billion, up 15% year over year.2018 GuidanceAlexion expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $6.60-$6.80. It projects revenues in the range of $3.85-$3.95 billion. Revenue guidance for Soliris is expected to be in the range of $3.33-$3.40 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for 2018 was $7.07 per share which is line with the guidance  while for sales it was $4.06 billion which is higher than the guidance range.The outlook assumes unfavorable Soliris revenue impact of $90 million to $110 million from ALXN1210 and other clinical trial recruitment versus prior year.Alexion expects to incur additional restructuring and related expenses of approximately $30 million to $70 million related to the 2017 restructuring activities.Pipeline UpdateAlexion received FDA approval for label expansion of Soliris to treat patients with refractory generalized myasthenia in adults who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AchR) antibody-positive in United States, and Japan during the fourth quarter. Further, the European Commission also approved the drug for the same indication in August 2017. The label expansion should help the company in boosting the revenues.Currently, Alexion is evaluating Soliris in a couple of other phase III studies — PREVENT — for the treatment of relapsing neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder. The company completed enrollment in the trail and expects to report data in mid 2018.The company also advanced the ALXN1210 clinical development program which is being evaluated in phase III studies for the treatment of PNH and aHUS during the quarter. The company completed enrollment in the PNH trial and expects to report data from the study in the second quarter of 2018. Enrollment for aHUS is expected to be complete in the second quarter of 2018 and Alexion expects to report data from this study in the fourth quarter of 2018.Our TakeAlexion exceeded earnings estimates and sales estimates in the fourth quarter. We expect growth at Alexion to continue being driven by Soliris. In the meantime, other new products — Strensiq and Kanuma — are doing well and should boost revenues. Mention a qualitative line on 2018 guidanceWe are also impressed by Alexion’s efforts to develop its pipeline, especially the label expansion efforts for Soliris and the recent approval of Soliris to treat patients with refractory generalized myasthenia in the United States, Europe and Japan. Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

6,ALXN,"The fourth-quarter earnings season has crossed the halfway mark. So far, the results reflect a favorable trend, with an above average proportion of companies beating both top- and bottom-line expectations.Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for the 251 S&P members that have released results, are up 16% from the year-ago quarter on a 10.5% rise in revenues. The beat ratio for the bottom line is 80.5%, while that for the top line is 78.1%. The proportion of companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 64.9%.Biotech companies Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report) are expected to report their Q4 numbers on Feb 8. Let's take a look at which of these biotech companies has an edge over the other ahead of their release.However, before we look at the numbers, let us have a look at the biotech industry.A Glance at the IndustryThe biotech industry is seeing significant pickup in merger and acquisition (M&A) deals of late. The year started off with Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) announcing plans to acquire Impact Biomedicines. The company revealed plans of acquiring Juno Therapeutics  for approximately $9 billion.The French pharma giant Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) also announced of buying biopharma company Bioverativ for $11.6 billion in January 2018. The same month Sanofi also announced plans to acquire the Belgian biotech company, Ablynx for €3.9 billion ($4.8 billion).In the fourth quarter, the biotech sector is well poised. Of the major players in the biotech sector, Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) put a mixed show in the reported period with earnings lagging estimates while sales exceeding the same. However, Celgene and Vertex (VRTX  -  Free Report) outpaced both the metrics’ expectations.Alexion New Haven, CT-based Alexion’s blockbuster drug, Soliris, continues to perform well. Alexion continues to identify and treat high number of new patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (“PNH”) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) with Soliris, across its 50-country operating platform. Alexion is working on expanding Soliris’ label into additional indications. The FDA recently approved the drug for the treatment of refractory gMG in patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody-positive. The drug was approved in Europe for this indication. Label expansion into additional indications will give Soliris access to a higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug significantly.The company also announced some restructuring initiatives. In this context, Alexion plans to focus on rare diseases businesses in core areas of hematology, nephrology, neurology and metabolic disorders to enhance productivity.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $878 million, marking an increase of 5.5% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.28 per share, marking an increase of 1.59% year over year.Alexion’s track record is excellent as it has topped estimates in the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 11.91%.Alexion has an Earnings ESP of +8.92% as the Most Accurate estimate is $1.40 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.28.

Price and EPS Surprise | Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. QuoteRegeneron Regeneron’s key growth driver, Eylea, is likely to continue to contribute to the company’s top-line growth. Regeneron is working on expanding Eylea label into additional indications. While a phase III study (PANORAMA) is evaluating Eylea for the treatment of moderately severe to severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy in patients without DME, another phase III study (in Japan) is evaluating it for neovascular glaucoma. Label expansion into additional indications will give Eylea access to higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug. Apart from Eylea, investors will remain focused on the uptake of new drugs — Kevzara and Dupixent. The FDA also approved Dupixent (dupilumab) Injection for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis.  The initial uptake of the drug is encouraging. The drug was approved in Europe also. The company is also evaluating the drug for treating asthma in adults (LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST study). Hence, focus will be on the company’s performance, particularly Eylea and Dupixient uptake during the fourth-quarter earnings call. Investors are also expected to await updates on the company’s pipeline.The Earnings ESP, for Regeneron is -1.04%. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.50 billion, marking an increase of 22.1% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $4.68 per share, marking an increase of 53.95% year over year.The company’s performance has been mixed so far. In the last four quarters, it surpassed earnings estimates on two occasions and missed in two, with an average positive surprise of 5.96%. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

8,ALXN,"The fourth-quarter earnings season has crossed the half way mark, and the results so far reflect a positive trend, with an above average proportion of companies beating both top- and bottom-line expectations. Per the latest Earnings Trend, total earnings for the medical sector are up 16.9% from the same period last year on 8.5% higher revenues so far.The biotech stocks had a fairly good run in 2017 despite the prevalence of headwinds like rising competition, pipeline setbacks, slowdown in growth of mature products and generic competition for certain key drugs. While some of these issues still persist, most companies seem to have combatted the pressure courtesy of new drug approvals and upbeat performance of many blockbuster drugs.  We note that the slowdown in mature products compelled prominent biotechs to acquire smaller ones with promising pipelines. Gilead Sciences (GILD) acquired Kite Pharma and subsequently obtained FDA approval of Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel), the latter’s chimeric CAR-T therapy candidate. Celgene recently announced plans to acquire Juno Therapeutics for $87 per share in cash, or a total of approximately $9 billion, net of cash and marketable securities acquired.Picking the Prospective Winners for the SeasonThere are a number of biotech companies which are likely to trump fourth-quarter estimates. However, with a wide range of biotech firms thronging the investment space, it is by no means an easy task for investors to arrive at stocks that have the potential to deliver better-than-expected earnings.With the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have zeroed in on five biotech stocks that carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and have a positive Earnings ESP. Earnings ESP is a very valuable tool for investors looking for stocks that are most likely to beat earnings estimates. Moreover, adding a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 has delivered a positive surprise 70% of the time. While you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here, you can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Bet on These 5 Stocks for Higher ReturnsSan Francisco, CA-based Exelixis, Inc. (EXEL  -  Free Report) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing small-molecule therapies for the treatment of cancer. Exelixis' lead drug Cabometyx continues to gain traction. The recent FDA approval of Cabometyx for the treatment previously untreated advanced RCC should further boost demand. The drug performed impressively against widely used Sutent. We expect Cabometyx will pose a challenge to Sutent’s market share for first line RCC in 2018.  Exelixis’ track record is outstanding. The company has surpassed expectations in the trailing four quarters, with an average of 543.6%. The company which is scheduled to report results on Feb 26, currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +21.98%.Dublin, Ireland-based Alkermes plc (ALKS  -  Free Report) has a diversified product portfolio and a promising pipeline of candidates targeting major central nervous system disorders including schizophrenia, depression, addiction and multiple sclerosis. The company generates revenues from its proprietary products Vivitrol and Aristada, and the five partnered products — Risperdal Consta, Invega Sustenna/Xeplion, Invega Trinza/Trevicta, Ampyra/Fampyra and Bydureon. We expect these products to continue contributing to the company’s top-line growth in the coming quarters. Moreover, the pipeline progress has been encouraging too. The company recently submitted a NDA to the FDA for its pipeline candidate, ALKS 5461 for the adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder.  The company has a decent track record with an average positive surprise of 75.0%. Alkermes currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +34.12%.Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ANTH  -  Free Report), a biopharmaceutical company, is focused on developing drugs to treat serious and life-threatening diseases such as exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and B-cell associated renal diseases. The company currently has two compounds in development, Sollpura and blisibimod.  The company licensed Sollpura from Eli Lilly & Co in July 2014.  Sollpura is a novel non-porcine investigational Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement Therapy for the treatment of Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency (“EPI”), often seen in patients with cystic fibrosis and other conditions.  Blisibimod was licensed from Amgen and targets B-cell activating factor, or BAFF, which has been shown to be elevated in a variety of B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases, including Immunoglobulin A nephropathy. After having suffered a setback, the company recently reported encouraging data from a phase III study, RESULT, on Sollpura for the treatment of EPI. With a decent track record, the company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +20.47%.Based in New Haven, CT, Alexion Pharmaceuticals’ (ALXN  -  Free Report) key growth driver, Soliris, is approved for the treatment of two severe and ultra-rare disorders resulting from chronic uncontrolled activation of the complement component of the immune system — paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. The label expansion of the drug along with geographic expansion will further boost sales. Among new products, while Strensiq is gaining momentum, the company redefined its strategy for Kanuma which earlier lagged expectations. Alexion’s track record is excellent as it has consistently topped estimates in the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 11.91%. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +8.92%. Alexion is scheduled to report results on Feb 8.Wilmington, DE-based Incyte Corporation’s (INCY  -  Free Report) Jakafi is a first-in-class JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, approved in the United State for the treatment of patients with polycythemia vera (“PV”), who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant to hydroxyurea. It is also approved for the treatment of patients with intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis (“MF”), including primary MF, post-PV MF, and post-essential thrombocythemia MF.  Jakafi sales are being driven by patient demand. Inclusig also continues to perform well and exceeded expectations.  The label expansion of Jakafi for graft-versus-host disease will further boost sales. The company has an encouraging track record with an average positive surprise of 42.9%. Incyte currently carries a Zacks Rank 3 and an Earnings ESP of +5.57%. The company is scheduled to release results on Feb 15.Bottom Line  Challenges in the form of competitive and pricing pressure will remain. However, a number of companies in the healthcare space have fared well. Picking some outperformers from the space, backed by a solid Zacks Rank and a positive Earnings ESP, could lead investors to gain this earnings season.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

9,ALXN,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 8, before the opening bell.In the last quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, Alexion’s track record is excellent as it has consistently topped estimates in the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 11.91%.Moreover, Alexion’s shares have underperformed the industry in the past one year. The stock has gone down 9.4% compared with the industry’s gain of 2.9%.  What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model shows that Alexion is likely to beat on earnings in the to-be-reported quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — which have a significantly higher chance of beating estimates.Zacks ESP: Alexion has an Earnings ESP of +8.92% as the Most Accurate estimate is $1.40 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.28. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Alexion’s Zacks Rank #3, when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors Likely to Impact Q4 ResultsAlexion’s blockbuster drug, Soliris, continues to perform well. Alexion continues to identify and treat a consistently high number of new patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) with Soliris, across its 50-country operating platform.Alexion is working on expanding Soliris’ label into additional indications. The FDA recently approved the drug for the treatment of refractory gMG in patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody-positive. The drug was approved in Europe for this indication. Approximately 60,000-80,000 patients are expected to have  gMG in the United States. Additionally, a phase III study (PREVENT) on Soliris in patients with relapsing neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder is ongoing with enrollment was completed and data expected in mid-2018. Label expansion into additional indications would give Soliris access to a higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug significantly.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Soliris indicates the drug sales to increase about 1.6% from the year-ago quarter to $766 million.Meanwhile, Strensiq continues to perform well with revenues receiving an impetus from a growing number of patients (both children as well as adults with pediatric onset disease) owing to hypophosphatasia (HPP) disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives. The company expects Strensiq to be a strong additional growth driver. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Strensiq indicates the drug sales to increase about 31.9% from the year-ago quarter to $91 million.Furthermore, the company announced some restructuring initiatives. In this context, Alexion plans to focus on rare diseases businesses in core areas of hematology, nephrology, neurology and metabolic disorders to enhance productivity.Notably, the company is expected to reduce spending and headcount associated with the previously announced deprioritized pipeline programs as well as optimizing additional R&D expenses. Alexion also deprioritized ALXN1101 (cPMP replacement therapy) and ALXN6000 (samalizumab) as well as partnerships with Moderna Therapeutics, Blueprint Medicines and Arbutus Biopharma.Consequently, the company will reduce its global workforce by approximately 20% and expects that the increased financial flexibility will allow it to reinvest approximately $100 million annually into R&D.While, Alexion anticipates pretax savings of approximately $250 million by 2019, the total pretax restructuring and related expenses associated with the plan in the range of $340- $440 million. The company targets operating margin of 50% by the same year. Approximately 50% of the restructuring and related expenses will result in cash outlays while the same of approximately $240 million to $300 million are expected to be recorded in 2017.In the meantime, the company’s efforts to develop its pipeline are impressive, particularly in case of ALXN1210. Currently, it is evaluating ALXN1210 (a longer-acting anti-C5 antibody that inhibits terminal complement) in phase III studies for both PNH and aHUS.In fact, the company initiated a phase III PNH switch study of ALXN1210 administered intravenously every eight weeks compared to patients currently treated with Soliris. Therefore, we expect investors to focus on updates from ALXN1210 as the successful development and commercialization of the drug will boost growth prospects.  A tentative approval for PNH is expected in 2019.However, Soliris’ quarter-to-quarter revenue growth will be impacted by the enrollment ramp up of trials on ALXN1210 (by $80-90 million), particularly in the second half of 2017.   Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

10,ALXN,"Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA  -  Free Report) will report fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 earnings on Feb 8, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 4.76%.This generic drug maker’s shares have lost 40.1% in the past year, while the industry witnessed a decrease of 27.7%.Teva’s earnings have surpassed expectations in only one of the last four quarters, met the same in one and missed expectations in the remaining two, resulting in an average negative surprise of 2.66%.Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited Price and EPS Surprise  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited Price and EPS Surprise | Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderIncreased pricing erosion and volume declines in Teva’s U.S. Generics unit, ongoing political turmoil in Venezuela and loss of exclusivity in the Specialty segment are hurting the company’s top line. We do not expect any improving trend in the fourth quarter.The U.S. generics industry is witnessing significant competitive and pricing pressure, thereby affecting the company’s top-line performance. An increase in FDA generic drug approvals and ongoing customer consolidation are resulting in additional competitive pressure in the industry. Drug price erosion was 10% in the third quarter and management had warned on the call that the erosion will accelerate in the fourth quarter and beyond. Moreover, accelerated FDA approvals of additional generic versions of competing off-patent medicines, lower-than-expected contribution of new generic launches and increased competition for its largest product - Concerta authorized generic – will also continue to hurt sales in the Generics unit.Meanwhile, in the Specialty segment, loss of exclusivity of key drugs like Copaxone, Azilect and Nuvigil will hurt sales.Sales of Teva’s blockbuster multiple sclerosis (MS) treatment Copaxone should continue to erode due to generic competition. Glatopa, a generic version of Copaxone 20 mg, has been on the market since June 2015. In October, in a major blow to Teva, Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) launched (at-risk) its generic version of the 40 mg formulation, much earlier than expected. Mylan also launched its version of the 20 mg formulation in October. With the entry of the generic version of the 40 mg formulation and the entry of a second generic version of the 20 mg formulation, Copaxone sales are expected to erode rapidly. Teva had previously estimated a negative impact of at least 30 cents per share on fourth-quarter earnings.Meanwhile, a generic version of Azilect was launched in the United States in January 2017 and sales have started to decline sharply. ProAir also lost exclusivity in the United States in 2017 and its fourth-quarter sales are likely to be lower.To combat the rapid decline in sales, last month, Teva announced a restructuring plan that will see more than 25% of the company’s global workforce being laid off over the next two years with the majority expected in 2018. Though management then provided quite a few details on how the plan will be executed, we expect an update on the upcoming conference call. Also, in November, Teva had announced a new organizational and leadership structure to save costs and increase productivity that included the departure of heads of three divisions. The company had also said then that it will no longer have two separate global groups for its two businesses – generics and specialty medicines. Instead, Teva will now operate through three regions —North America, Europe and Growth Markets — which will include generics, specialty, and over-the-counter (OTC) medicines. An update on the progress made on the new strategy so far is expected on the call.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Teva is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Its Earnings ESP is -3.10% as the Most Accurate estimate stands at 78 cents per share while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at 81 cents per share.

11,ALXN,"We expect GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 7, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive surprise of 1.19%.Glaxo’s shares have underperformed the industry in a year’s time. The stock has lost 4.3% against the industry’s rally of 21.1%.Glaxo’s earnings performance has been pretty good so far. The company’s earnings surpassed estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters, meeting estimates in the remaining quarter. Overall, the company came up with an average beat of 6.69%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors to Consider                                            Glaxo should continue to see strong sales of in its Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines business segment.Glaxo’s Pharmaceuticals segment is expected to be driven by solid sales of new HIV products, Tivicay and Triumeq. Sales of newly launched respiratory drugs, the Ellipta products and Nucala are likely to offset the declines in sales of older respiratory products Seretide, Advair and Avodart.  On the third-quarter conference call, Glaxo had said that its inhaled respiratory products, particularly the older ones, are facing competitive and continued pricing pressure, which is expected to continue.Meanwhile, many of Glaxo’s key drugs like Lovaza and Avodart are facing a sales decline due to generic competition -  a trend we expect will continue in Q4. Importantly, pricing dynamics and rivalry pressure are hurting sales of the company’s top-selling drug, Advair in the United States while generic competition is hampering Advair sales in Europe.The Vaccines segment will consistently benefit from a sustained uptake of meningitis vaccines like Bexsero and Menveo {acquired from Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report)}.While Shingrix vaccine (prevention of shingles) was approved in the United States in October 2017, Trelegy Ellipta (only once-daily single inhaler triple therapy for COPD) was granted an EU approval in November 2017. Trelegy Ellipta is already approved in the United States for COPD. Meanwhile, Juluca (dolutegravir + rilpivirine) — the first dual treatment for HIV — received approval in the United States last November. We expect management to comment on the commercialization plans for these newly approved products on the Q4 conference call.Importantly, sales growth is on the wane in the Consumer Healthcare segment due to a slowdown in market conditions and the impact of divestitures. The Consumer Healthcare segment is anticipated to remain under stress in the fourth quarter and is not much predicted to push up the sales.Meanwhile, cost savings from restructuring and continued efficiencies should boost operating profits.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Glaxo is likely to beat estimates because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for an earnings beat and Glaxo precisely has the correct mix.Zacks ESP: Glaxo has an Earnings ESP of +10.35%, representing the difference between the Most Accurate estimate (72 cents per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate (65 cents). A positive ESP indicates a likely positive surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Glaxo has a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of Glaxo’s Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Conversely, the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.GlaxoSmithKline PLC Price and EPS Surprise GlaxoSmithKline PLC Price and EPS Surprise | GlaxoSmithKline PLC QuoteOther Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other health care stocks worth considering with the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around:Exelixis, Inc.

12,ALXN,"Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) will report fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 earnings on Feb 6, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.22%.Allergan’s share price has declined 21.4% in the past year while the industry witnessed a decline of 22.9%.Allergan’s earnings performance has been strong, with the company beating expectations in each of the past four quarters. The average positive earnings surprise over the last four quarters is 1.95%.Allergan PLC. Price and EPS Surprise  Allergan PLC. Price and EPS Surprise | Allergan PLC. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderAllergan’s established products like Botox, Linzess, Lo Loestrin and Restasis and new products like Vraylar and Namzaric should support sales in the fourth quarter. In fact, label expansions for Botox (FDA approval for forehead line treatment) and Vraylar (FDA approval for maintenance treatment of schizophrenia) are likely to boost sales of these drugs in the fourth quarter. However, we believe sales erosion from Namenda XR due to lower demand and loss of exclusivity, mainly from Asacol HD and Minastrin, will again hurt the top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Botox, Linzess and Namenda XR are pegged at $837 million, $206 million and $103 million, respectively.In third quarter, some new products like Viberzi and Kybella performed below expectations. It remains to be seen if sales of these products rise this time aroundThe addition of Alloderm from LifeCell (January 2017) and CoolSculpting body contouring system from ZELTIQ (April 2017) is expected to support the top line in the quarter.Higher promotional expenses for key products, increased costs to support an advancing pipeline and the acquisition of lower margin LifeCell and ZELTIQ can put pressure on Allergan’s margins.Investor focus will be on management’s comments on the impact of new competition for key growth drivers, Restasis and Linzess. We remind investors that on the third quarter call, Allergan said that it will refrain from any M&A activities for the next few months until its gets a better handle on the Restasis situation. Allergan is facing potential loss of exclusivity for Restasis, its second-best selling product. In October 2017, a Texas federal district court invalidated four of the six patents covering Restasis, potentially opening doors for early generic competition. Though Restasis patents are scheduled to expire in August 2024, a generic version may be launched in the second quarter of 2018.Also, the company said that a split of the company is not in the cards at the moment. An update on these strategies is expected on the fourth-quarter call.We expect management to also comment on the cost-saving and restructuring program it announced earlier this year. In the regulatory filing, Allergan said it is laying off over 1,000 employees to protect it from potential revenue declines. Allergan also said that it plans to eliminate an additional 400 open positions. While the company estimates to incur costs of approximately $125 million, the job cuts and other cost-savings measures are expected to save operating costs between $300 and $400 this year. Also, the majority of the costs, primarily due to severance, will be reflected in the fourth-quarter results.Also, investors expect management to comment on the weaker-than-expected sales outlook for 2018, which Allergan announced in early January.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Allergan is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Most Accurate estimate stands at $4.75, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at $4.74. This results in an Earnings ESP of +0.19%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Allergan has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

Gilead expects net product sales in the range of $24.5-$25.5 billion, up from $24.0-$25.5 billion provided earlier. Non-HCV product sales are projected between $16 billion and $16.5 billion (earlier projection: $15.5 billion and $16 billion).Strong HIV performance and other antiviral product sales are being driven by continued uptake of tenofovir alafenamide (“TAF”) based products — Genvoya, Descovy and Odefsey. We expect the trend to continue in the fourth quarter as well. Genvoya has already become the most prescribed regimen for both treatment-naïve and switch patients since its launch. This should drive the non-HCV product sales.  The TAF-based regimens now represent 56% of total Gilead HIV prescription volume following the launch of Genvoya and Odefsey and Descovy in 2016. Strong uptake for Truvada for use in the pre-exposure prophylaxis setting is also expected to boost sales. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of Genvoya is $1058 million. However, Gilead lost exclusivity for Viread in some countries outside the United States which might impact sales.HCV product sales are projected between $8.5 billion and $9.0 billion (earlier projection: $8.5 billion and $9.5 billion).  The HCV franchise continues to be under competitive and pricing pressure leading to a massive decline in Harvoni and Sovaldi sales. Harvoni and Sovaldi has been facing competition from AbbVie Inc.’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak and Viekira XR among others. While patient starts have exceeded expectations in 2017, competition has started to erode Gilead's market share and net pricing. The company saw some impact of this in the third quarter but most of it was due to be experienced in the fourth quarter.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of lead HCV drug Sovaldi and Harvoni are $141 million and $614 million, respectively. The HCV portfolio received a major boost when Epclusa gained approval in 2016. The FDA also approved Vosevi tablets as a single-tablet regimen (“STR”) for the re-treatment of chronic HCV infection in adults.Adjusted R&D expenses and adjusted SG&A expenses are now projected in the range of $3.3-$3.4 billion and $3.3-$3.4 billion, respectively. Adjusted product gross margin is expected in the range of 86-87%. Earnings per share are now projected around $1.02-$1.17 (earlier projection: 86-93 cents).Meanwhile, the Kite acquisition was a step in the right direction with the FDA approval of its chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel), for the treatment of refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which includes DLBCL, transformed follicular lymphoma and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma. However, management stated that Yescarta launch will be a controlled launch to ensure patient safety as CAR-T therapy is complicated and can sometimes be associated with severe side effects.We expect the management to throw more light on the same during the fourth-quarter’s call. Investors are also likely to keep an eye on other pipeline updates.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Gilead will beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. Unfortunately, that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Gilead is -1.01%.  This is because the Most Accurate estimate is $1.68 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.70. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter .Zacks Rank: Gilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). As it is, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some health care stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

14,ALXN,"We expect Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 5, before the market opens.Bristol-Myers’ shares have increased 30.1% in the past year while the industry recorded an increase of 26.6%.Bristol-Myers’ track record has been mixed so far. The company delivered positive earnings surprise in two of the last four quarters and missed expectations twice. The average positive earnings surprise in the last four quarters is 2.72%. In the last reported quarter, Bristol-Myers delivered a negative surprise of 2.6%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors at PlayBristol-Myers’ blockbuster immuno-oncology drug, Opdivo is expected to continue as the primary sales driver in the fourth quarter. The drug is already approved in multiple cancer indications. In the past two quarters, the drug received approval for five line extensions, which is expected to boost sales. Moreover, in December 2017, Opdivo’s label was expanded as adjuvant therapy for completely resected melanoma.The FDA’s approval of Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda in May for the first-line treatment of metastatic non-squamous NSCLC had a lower-than-expected impact on third-quarter sales. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter Keytruda sales is pegged at $1.3 billion, flat with the year-ago actual figure.In January 2018, the European Commission approved the label expansion of Yervoy injection in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The FDA had approved the drug for this indication in July 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the drug’s sales in the fourth quarter is $315 million.In November 2017, Bristol-Myers announced that the FDA has approved line extension of Orencia in pediatric patients with Ph+ chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase. The label expansions (including psoriatic arthritis in July 2017) and new administration option approved in June 2017 is expected to fuel growth of the drug, which registered growth of 10% in the previous quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Orencia sales is $686 million.On the other hand, the decline in Hepatitis C franchise is expected to continue due to intense competition from multiple drugs including Epclusa whose label was expanded to include HIV co-infection in August. Moreover, the HIV business continues to face competitive pressure. Recent launches by other companies in the same space are expected to further impact the Sustiva franchise. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Hepatitis C franchise sales is pegged at $55 million this quarter, down 75.7% from year-ago quarter actual figure.The company is developing its key drug, Opdivo as monotherapy as well as combination therapy for several tumor types in multiple studies, with two label expansion applications under review in the United States. We expect investor focus on updates related to Opdivo on the conference call.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model indicates that Bristol-Myers is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, stands at +0.35%. This is a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Bristol-Myers has a Zacks Rank #3.

15,ALXN,"GW Pharmaceuticals plc. (GWPH  -  Free Report) will report fiscal first-quarter 2018 results on Feb 5, before the market opens.GW Pharma’s share price has increased 20.8% over a year compared with the industry’s gain of 26.7%.  Factors at PlayGW Pharma’s growth is solely dependent on Sativex, which is marketed outside the United States for the treatment of spasticity due to multiple sclerosis. The company in December 2017, terminated its agreement with Japan-based Otsuka Pharmaceutical for Sativex in the United States. As a result, GW Pharma reacquired full ownership of the development and commercialization rights of the product in the United States. The drug’s sales is expected to remain on a growth trajectory in fiscal first-quarter like the past several quarters, though the impact of the reacquisition will not be felt much this quarter.GW Pharma made significant progress with its lead cannabinoid pipeline candidate, Epidiolex for the treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (“LGS”) and Dravet syndrome in Q4. In October 2017, the company submitted a new drug application for Epidiolex to the FDA seeking approval in both the indications. In December 2017, the FDA accepted the filing with Priority Review and set an action date of Jun 27, 2018. In December 2017, the company also submitted its marketing authorisation application (“MAA”) to the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) for Epidiolex . It is also gearing up for the launch of the candidate, which is expected to increase operational expenses in fiscal first-quarter.The company is also developing GWP42006 (CBDV) in a phase II clinical trial for epilepsy, with data expected to be announced soon. The candidate received orphan drug designation from the FDA for treating Rett syndrome.Investor focus at the call will be on management’s comments commercialization plan for Epidiolex, if approved,e. An update on progress of CBDV development is also expected.Surprise HistoryGW Pharma’s performance over the last four quarters has been rather poor, with the company surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate only once and missing the same on three other occasions. The average surprise over the last four quarters is -4.01%. The company missed estimates last quarter, resulting in a negative earnings surprise of 26.01%.What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model shows does not conclusively show an earnings beat for GW Pharma this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate (loss of $2.39) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate (loss of $2.03), is -17.26%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: GW Pharma currently has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. GW Pharmaceuticals PLC Price and EPS Surprise  GW Pharmaceuticals PLC Price and EPS Surprise | GW Pharmaceuticals PLC Quote Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some biotech stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

16,ALXN,"We expect Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 results on Feb 2, before market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 7.77%.Merck’s performance has been pretty impressive, with the company exceeding earnings expectations in all the trailing four quarters. The average positive earnings surprise over the last four quarters is 7.76%Merck & Company, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Merck & Company, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Merck & Company, Inc. Quote Merck’s shares have declined 0.6% in the past year against a 27.5% increase for the industry.Factors to ConsiderMerck’s new products like Keytruda (cancer) and Bridion (sugammadex) Injection are likely to drive the top line this quarter. However, loss of market exclusivity for several drugs and lower sales of key products like Januvia and Gardasil/Gardasil 9 may hurt sales.Keytruda sales are being driven by the launch of new indications globally. Keytruda sales are gaining particularly from strong momentum in the first-line lung cancer indication as the therapy is the only anti-PD-1 approved in first-line setting.The Keytruda development program also significantly advanced in 2017 with regulatory approvals for six new indications in the United States, four in Europe and three in Japan.The approvals expanded the patient population, driving up sales in the third quarter. This momentum is likely to drive fourth-quarter as well as 2018 results.Strong demand in most markets is driving sales of Bridion (sugammadex) Injection.Meanwhile, rising competitive pressure is hurting sales of relatively newer drugs like Zostavax and Zepatier. On the third-quarter earnings call, Merck management had warned that Zepatier uptake in the fourth quarter and in 2018 may be impacted by evolving marketplace and competitive landscape.While continued pricing pressure is hurting sales of older products like Januvia, lower demand due to competitive pressure is dampening sales of Isentress. Importantly, on the Q3 call, the company had said that though pricing pressure will continue to hurt sales of Januvia/Janumet, volumes may improve in the future quarters, especially outside the United States.The animal health franchise should also boost sales this quarter. On the Q4 call, investors will be keen to find out if the vaccine segment has recovered from product shutdown issues related to the last year’s cyber-attack.Finally, higher investments for ongoing launches, remediation expenses related to the cyber attack, as well as additional R&D costs associated with the new oncology collaboration with AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) will raise costs and hurt profits.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Merck is likely to beat estimates this quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for a likely positive surprise.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate (95 cents per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate (94 cents per share), is +1.06%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Merck has a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of Merck’s Zacks Rank #3 and positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5), on the other hand, should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other drug/biotech stocks that have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around:Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

17,ALXN,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (VRTX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 31, after the market closes.Vertex’s shares have soared 100.5% in the past year while the industry has recorded an increase of 11.8%.Vertex’s track record has been impressive so far. The company delivered positive earnings surprises in each of the last four quarters. The average positive earnings surprise for the last four quarters is 32.67%. In the last reported quarter, Vertex came up with a positive surprise of 43.24%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors at PlayVertex’s cystic fibrosis (""CF"") drugs — Kalydeco & Orkambi — performed consistently in the first three quarters of 2017. We expect this positive trend to be reflected in the results of the soon-to-be reported quarter.Approval of two line extensions for Kalydeco in the United States has increased the eligible patient population for the drug. In May 2017, Kalydeco was approved for use in patients 2 and older who have one of 23 residual function mutations in the CFTR gene. This was followed by approval in people who have mutations responsive to Kalydeco, including one of five ""splice"" mutations, in August 2017. The expansion of patient population will certainly boost sales of the drug. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Kalydeco for the fourth quarter is $224 million. For 2017, Vertex expects Kalydeco revenues to be in the range of $810-$830 million.In December 2017, Vertex announced that Kalydeco met endpoints in a phase III study in patients aged one to two years who have one of 10 mutations in the CFTR gene. Regulatory applications for label expansion are planned to be filed in the first quarter of 2018. We also note that regulatory applications for another label expansion of Kalydeco are under review. The applications seek approval of Kalydeco+tezacaftor in patients aged 12 and older who have two copies of the F508del mutation or one F508del mutation and one residual function mutation. We expect Vertex to provide updateson the earnings call.Although, the company has not been so successful with agreements in Europe related to Orkambi, the drug has done well so far this year. In June and July, Vertex struck re-imbursement agreements in Ireland and Italy, respectively. The consensus estimate for Orkambi for the fourth quarter is $361 million.In January 2018, Vertex announced that an extension of the marketing application for Orkambi was approved in Europe. With the approval, Orkambi’s marketing label in EU will now include use in children with CF aged between six and 11 years and have two copies of the F508del mutation, expanding patient population by about 3,400.Investor focus on the call will be on these triple combination CF regimens, which are crucial for long-term growth of Vertex.However, operating expenses are likely to be on the higher side with Vertex expanding its pipeline and conducting multiple studies to evaluate candidates.What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model does not conclusively show that Vertex is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate (earnings of 55 cents) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate (earnings of 58 cents), stands at -4%.

18,ALXN,"We expect biotech major Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 results on Feb 1, after the market closes. Amgen delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.83% in the last quarter.Amgen shares are up 26.9% in the past year. This compares favorably with the 11.8% increase registered by the industry during this period.Amgen’s performance has been pretty impressive, with the company delivering positive surprises consistently. The average earnings beat over the last four quarters is 5.25%.Amgen Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Amgen Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Amgen Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for the company this quarter.Factors at PlayAmgen’s newer products like Prolia, Xgeva, Kyprolis, Vectibix and Blincyto are expected to deliver the goods backed by higher demand. However, sales of mature brands like Aranesp, Enbrel, Epogen, Neulasta and Neupogen are expected to be lower due to competitive pressure.Neulasta demand is being hurt by competition from PD-1s and other new cancer therapies. Neupogen sales are also being hurt by biosimilar competition in the United States mainly from Zarxio, Sandoz’s biosimilar version of NeupogenWe expect Neulasta and Neupogen sales to continue to be hurt by competitive dynamics in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, Neulasta and Epogen are expected to start facing biosimilar competition in the United States this year.Enbrel sales are expected to continue to be hurt by increased pricing and competitive pressures. Enbrel is one of the main drivers of Amgen’s revenues. The company launched Enbrel Mini with AutoTouch, a new auto injector device for Enbrel in the United States in November, which is likely to provide some support to fourth-quarter sales.Meanwhile, operating expenses are expected to be higher in the fourth quarter than the prior quarter, reflecting the typical pattern of the business as well as costs related to recovery efforts following Hurricane Maria. Amgen expects to record $75 million to $100 million in expenses related to Hurricane Maria recovery efforts in the fourth quarter, which will reduce earnings per share by 8-11 cents.Investor focus on the call will be on management’s comments about the initial impact of inclusion of cardiovascular outcomes data on the label of its PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha. In December 2017, Amgen gained FDA approval to include a new indication - risk reduction of major cardiovascular events data – on Repatha’s label based on data from the phase III cardiovascular outcomes study (FOURIER). This makes Repatha the first PCSK9 inhibitor to prevent heart attacks, strokes and coronary revascularizations in adults with established cardiovascular disease. With the cardiovascular indication approved to be included in Repatha’s label, Amgen believes that patient access to Repatha should improve. Please note that uptake of Repatha, which gained FDA approval in August 2015, has not been very encouraging so far due to pricing and re-imbursement issues/payer restrictions.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Amgen is likely to beat on earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate ($3.06 per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate ($3.04 per share) is +0.55%. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Amgen has a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of Amgen’s Zacks Rank #3 and positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5), on the other hand, should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other stocks in the biotech sector that have both a positive ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank are:Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

19,ALXN,"Varian Medical Systems Inc. (VAR  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jan 24, after the market closes. In the previous quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.09, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.19. Further, adjusted earnings declined from $1.38 in the year-ago quarter.On an average, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 6.6% in the trailing four quarters. Also, a lackluster price performance is a woe. Over the last year, the stock has returned 22.6% compared with the industry’s rally of 33.2%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Varian Medical Systems, Inc. Price and Consensus  Varian Medical Systems, Inc. Price and Consensus | Varian Medical Systems, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayDeclining Financials:Varian Medical experienced declining revenues in fourth-quarter of 2017. The trend is expected to continue in the quarter-to-be-reported as well. Lackluster performance by the company’s Halcyon cancer-treatment device will hamper sales in Latin America. In fact, sales in the Halcyon platform declined 46% in Latin America in the fourth quarter, thanks to several tenders pushing out, mainly from public-sector deals. Revenues from Asia-Pacific and Japan are also expected to decline significantly due to plummeting orders of Halcyon.Further, softness in the market for freestanding clinics is a headwind for Varian Medical in the to-be-reported quarter.Performance in the proton-therapy unit has been dampened due to intense competition in the niche space. This is anticipated to be a major concern for Varian Medical.Narrowing Customer Base:The majority of Varian Medical's X-Ray tube and flat panel detector sales cater to a small number of (large imaging system) original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers. The equipment manufacturing majors incorporate these X-Ray products into their own medical diagnostic imaging systems and industrial imaging systems. Due to the pattern of client concentration, a loss of any one of these clients may have an adverse effect on Varian Medical’s operating results.Earnings WhispersBuoyed by the above factors, our proven model does not conclusively indicate earnings beat for Varian Medical in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Varian Medical currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.76%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 99 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is at 98 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Varian Medical currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

(SRPT  -  Free Report) was a star performer in Tuesday’s trading session, as the stock skyrocketed as much as 57.7% to a new high of $176.50 but closed a little lower, rising 36.8% (read: 4 Sector ETFs That Crushed S&P 500 in 9-Year Bull Run).The surge propelled the company’s market cap from $6.9 billion to more than $9 billion, making it the fifth most valuable drugmaker headquartered in Massachusetts, behind Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX  -  Free Report), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN  -  Free Report) and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY  -  Free Report).The massive gain for the mid-cap biotech firm came from encouraging early trial results for a gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The study was conducted on three patients and revealed an average reduction of more than 87% in their creatine kinase, an enzyme found within muscle cells that can leak into the bloodstream when damage has occurred in the muscle, on day 60.This indicates that Sarepta’s muscular dystrophy drug could successfully treat and produce robust levels of dystrophin, a protein that protects muscle cells.DMD is a rare genetic disease marked by progressive muscle degeneration, which can cause physical disability along with life-threatening problems in the heart and respiratory system. The disease mostly affects boys between the ages of 3 and 5, and typically kills patients before the age of 30.The positive clinical trial also sent shares of fellow DMD gene therapy developer Solid Biosciences (SLDB  -  Free Report) up by more than 46% yesterday (see: all the Healthcare ETFs here).ETF ImpactThe news led to a surge in biotech ETFs, especially Virtus LifeSci Biotech Products ETF (BBP  -  Free Report), iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB  -  Free Report) andSPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI  -  Free Report). The trio has risen 2.3%, 1.5% and 1.4%, respectively. In fact, BBP and XBI touched a new 52-week high each.BBP in FoucsThe ETF follows the LifeSci Biotechnology Products Index, which measures the performance of biotechnology companies with a primary product offering or product candidate that has received the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s approval. Holding 40 stocks, Sarepta Therapeutics takes the fourth position in the basket with a 4.1% share. The product has accumulated AUM of about $33.2 million and charges 79 bps in fees per year. It has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a High risk outlook.IBB in FocusThis fund provides exposure to 192 firms by tracking the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index, with Sarepta accounting for 0.9% of assets. IBB is the most popular fund is the biotech space with AUM of $8.9 billion. Expense ratio comes in at 0.47%.

21,ALXN,"The biotech sector was in focus with regular pipeline updates. While Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (SRPT  -  Free Report) and Solid Biosciences (SLDB  -  Free Report) gained on positive data, Anika Therapeutics, Inc. (ANIK  -  Free Report) and Ziopharm Oncology, Inc. (ZIOP  -  Free Report) declined on dismal results.Recap of Important StoriesSarepta, Solid Biosciences Surge:  The going has been good for the Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) market. Shares of Sarepta surged significantly after the company reported impressive preliminary results from its phase I/IIa gene therapy trial assessing AAVrh74.MHCK7.micro-Dystrophin in individuals with DMD. The biopsies performed at the end of day 90 showed robust micro-dystrophin expression in muscle measured by all methods and observed in all three patients. The patients enrolled also showed a significant decrease in serum creatine kinase (CK) levels, with a mean reduction of CK of over 87% at Day 60. (Read more:Sarepta's Stock Soars on Encouraging Gene Therapy Results).Earlier, Solid Biosciences’ shares surged too after the company announced that the FDA has lifted the clinical hold on its phase I/II trial, IGNITE DMD, for its experimental candidate, SGT-001. Notably, SGT-001, Solid Biosciences’ lead candidate, is a microdystrophin gene transfer, which is being evaluated for the treatment of DMD.  The clinical hold was lifted as the FDA acknowledged that Solid Biosciences has satisfactorily addressed all the issues raised. (Read more: Solid Surges as FDA Lifts Clinical Hold on DMD Drug).Alexion Submits BLA for ALXN1210: Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report) announced that the company has submitted the Biologics License Application (BLA) to the FDA for approval of its experimental long-acting C5 complement inhibitor, ALXN1210, for the treatment of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Since the submission is for a rare disease using a priority review voucher, the BLA is entitled to an eight-month review by the FDA instead of the standard 12-month review. Alexion’s lead drug, Soliris, is already approved for PNH and a tentative approval of ALXN1210 will give a significant boost to the company. ALXN1210 had earlier achieved non-inferiority to Soliris in complement inhibitor treatment-naive patients with PNH based on the co-primary endpoints of transfusion avoidance and normalization of LDH levels in a phase III study wherein ALXN1210 was administered intravenously every eight weeks.Alexion carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Anika Plunges on Disappointing Data: Shares of Anika Therapeutics have dropped in after-market trading after the company reported disappointing results from a phase III trial on Cingal, which is being conducted to support registration in the United States. The 16-02 trial compared Cingal, a combination of cross-linked HA and triamcinolone hexacetonide (TH), with TH alone and cross-linked HA in treating patients with osteoarthritis in the knee. The primary endpoint was a comparison of the pain reduction when treated with Cingal compared with only TH at 26 weeks. However, the results did not show any statistical significance even though Cingal achieved greater pain reduction numerically at every time point in the study. Cingal is Anika’s third-generation visco supplement, along with Orthovisc and Monovisc products, to treat pain associated with osteoarthritis of the knee.Ziopharm Oncology Plunges As FDA Places Clinical Hold on CAR T Therapy:  Shares of Ziopharm Oncology declined after the FDA placed a clinical hold on its phase I trial evaluating CD19-specific CAR-T therapies manufactured under point-of-care. The FDA has requested additional information relative to Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls in support of the investigational new drug (IND) application for the trial.  The therapy is being evaluated as an investigational treatment for patients with relapsed or refractory, CD19+ leukemias and lymphomas.Amgen Got European Nod For Addition of Data to Blincyto: Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) announced that the European Commission (EC) has granted a full marketing authorization for Blincyto (blinatumomab) based on encouraging overall survival (OS) data from the phase III study, TOWER, in adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Results showed that Blincyto demonstrated a superior improvement in median OS over standard-of-care (SOC) chemotherapy. Median OS was 7.7 months for Blincyto versus four months for SOC.PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return  Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NASDAQ Biotechnology Index gained 1.02% over the last five trading sessions.

22,ALXN,"The biotech sector was in focus last week with regular pipeline updates and collaboration/licensing deals. While biotech bigwig Amgen’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) drugs won both FDA and EC approvals, Axovant (AXON  -  Free Report) soared on a licensing deal Oxford BioMedica. Meanwhile, Regeneron (REGN  -  Free Report)  collaborated with Zoetis to discover new veterinary treatments.Recap of Important Stories:Amgen Gets FDA Nod to Addition of Data to Kyprolis: Amgen announced that the FDA has approved its supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to add the positive overall survival (OS) data from the phase III trial, ASPIRE, to myeloma drug, Kyprolis.  The data added to the label showed that Kyprolis, Revlimid and dexamethasone (KRd) significantly reduced the risk of death by 21% and extended overall survival by 7.9 months versus Revlimid and dexamethasone alone (Rd) in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. In addition, the European Commission (EC) approved a label expansion for Prolia (denosumab) for the treatment of bone loss associated with long-term systemic glucocorticoid therapy in adult patients at increased risk of fracture.  This is the third indication for which Prolia has received EC approval.(Read more: Amgen Gets FDA Nod to Add ASPIRE Data on Kyprolis Label, Amgen's Prolia Gets Label Expansion Approval in Europe )Regeneron Collaborates With Zoetis: Regeneron announced a five-year collaboration agreement with Zoetis whereby the latter will use its monoclonal antibody therapeutics in animals and discover new veterinary treatments. Per the terms, Regeneron has granted Zoetis a license for its proprietary VelocImmune antibody technology, which the latter will use to develop monoclonal antibodies modified for species-specific use in companion and livestock animals. In exchange, Regeneron will receive a license fee, approval and sales milestone payments and royalties on any potential veterinary treatments. Axovant Sciences Soar on Gene Therapy Deal: Shares of Axovant Sciences gained after the company announced that it has licensed the exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize AXO-LentiPD from Oxford BioMedicafor Parkinsons’ disease. AXO-LentiPD, formerly OXB-102, is an experimental gene therapy being developed for Parkinson’s disease, which delivers three genes encoding a critical set of enzymes required for dopamine synthesis in the brain. Axovant plans to initiate a phase I/II dose escalation study on AXO-LentiPD in patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease, by the end of 2018. Per the terms of the agreement, Axovant will make an initial payment of $30 million in cash to obtain rights to AXO-Lenti-PD, as well as its predecessor product, ProSavin. Out of this $30 million, $5 million is applied as a credit against the process development work and clinical supply that Oxford BioMedica will provide to Axovant. In addition, Oxford BioMedica will also be entitled to receive additional development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments, potentially in excess of $812 million and tiered royalties on net sales of AXO-Lenti-PD, if approved. Meanwhile, Axovant will receive $25 million equity financing from Roivant Sciences to support clinical development of AXO-Lenti-PD and additional business development. The company also got a new chief technology officer, Fraser Wright. (Read more:  Axovant Gains on Licensing Deal with Oxford BioMedica)Axovant currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

The agreement also includes an additional $18 million payment if Biogen exercises its option, with up to $335 million in potential development and commercialization milestones as well as tiered royalties. TMS-007, a plasminogen activator, enables to restore blood flow following acute stroke, with an extended treatment window versus the current standard of care. The candidate is currently being evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II study in Japan for the safety and efficacy of a single IV administration of TMS-007 in approximately 60-90 patients with AIS up to 12 hours after stroke onset. The first patient was dosed in February 2018. The acquisition is in line with Biogen’s efforts to broaden its neurology portfolio.Alexion Teams With Complement Pharma: Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report) announced a partnership with Complement Pharma to co-develop the preclinical C6 complement inhibitor, CP010, for neurodegenerative disorders. CP010 is a humanized monoclonal antibody in preclinical stages that binds to C6 in circulation to inhibit its function throughout the body by preventing MAC formation in both the periphery and the central nervous system. Alexion and Complement Pharma will collaborate on the development program for CP010. Complement Pharma will be responsible for conducting preclinical and phase I studies as well as manufacturing CP010. In exchange, Alexion will provide Complement Pharma with up to €14 million in milestone-dependent payments through phase Ib development.  Alexion is looking to develop its pipeline and reduce dependence on key drug Soliris for pipeline development.

23,ALXN,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report) announced a partnership with Complement Pharma to co-develop the preclinical C6 complement inhibitor, CP010, for neurodegenerative disorders.CP010 is a humanized monoclonal antibody in preclinical stages that binds to C6 in circulation to inhibit its function throughout the body by preventing MAC formation in both the periphery and the central nervous system.Terms of the PartnershipPer the terms, Alexion and Complement Pharma will collaborate on the development program for CP010. Complement Pharma will be responsible for conducting preclinical and phase I studies as well as manufacturing CP010. In exchange, Alexion will provide Complement Pharma with up to €14 million in milestone-dependent payments through phase Ib development.   The phased agreement extends through the completion of phase Ib development. Moreover, Alexion has the option to acquire Complement Pharma during the term of the agreement.Rationale of the PartnershipAlexion is looking to diversify its portfolio beyond its key growth driver, Soliris. Soliris is approved for the treatment of two severe and ultra-rare disorders resulting from chronic uncontrolled activation of the complement component of the immune system – paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS).Since Soliris, a C5 inhibitor, has demonstrated the significant impact that C5 inhibition can have on various diseases caused by uncontrolled complement activation, the company plans to use its expertise to potentially treat additional diseases by targeting C6, a different component of the complement system.The company’s other pipeline candidate, ALXN1210 is an innovative, long-acting C5 inhibitor that works by inhibiting the C5 protein in the terminal complement cascade.Our TakeWhile the underlying growth of Soliris has been robust, Alexion is looking to develop its pipeline and reduce dependence on the former. The partnership with Complement Pharma is a step in the same direction and will also augment Alexion’s C5 franchise.Earlier, Alexion announced that it will acquire Sweden-based Wilson Therapeutics for $855 million. The acquisition will add a late-stage candidate, WTX101, to Alexion’s pipeline. The candidate is currently in phase III for the treatment of Wilson disease, a rare genetic disorder. The candidate is a first-in-class oral copper-binding agent with a unique mechanism of action and ability to access and bind copper from serum and promote its removal from the liver.The company also plans to use Halozyme's (HALO  -  Free Report) ENHANZE drug-delivery technology to develop a next-generation subcutaneous formulation of ALXN1210 to potentially further extend the dosing interval to once every two weeks or once per month. Alexion’s shares have gained 2.7% in the last six months compared with the industry’s decline of 6.7%.Of late, quite a few companies in the pharma/biotech sector are looking to diversify/bolster their portfolio/pipeline with acquisitions and collaborations. Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) recently acquired Juno Therapeutics to gain traction in the promising CAR-T space.  Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) acquired Bioverativ Inc., which focuses on therapies for hemophilia and other rare blood disorders.Zacks RankAlexion currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Per the terms of the deal, Cara is entitled to receive an upfront payment of $50 million in cash and an equity investment of $20 million to acquire Cara common stock at a price of approximately $17/share. Cara is also entitled to receive additional payments of up to $470 million, which includes $30 million in regulatory and up to $440 million in tiered commercial milestones. The company will also receive tiered royalties based on net sales of Korsuvainjection in the licensed territories.Celgene to Repurchase Shares: Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) announced that the company will repurchase $3 billion of its common stock.

25,ALXN,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 3.5% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is ALXN due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Alexion's Earnings Beat Estimates in Q1, Guidance UpAlexion posted first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of $1.68 per share which were higher than the year-ago earnings of $1.38 by 22%. Earnings also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.48. Strong product revenues drove the bottom line in the quarter.Revenues rose 7% year over year to $930.9 million and exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $918 million. Revenues were driven by increased sales of Soliris, Strensiq and Kanuma.  Revenues in DetailSoliris (paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (“PNH”) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS)) sales were up 2.1% to $800.1 million in the quarter driven by strong volume growth. While Strensiq (hypophosphatasia [“HPP”]) contributed $110.7 million to revenues, up 50.4% year over year, Kanuma (lysosomal acid lipase deficiency [LAL-D]) contributed $19.6 million (up 63.3%) to quarterly revenues.Cost SummaryAdjusted research and development (R&D) expenses were $161.6 million, down 16.9% year over year.Adjusted selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $220.4 million, down 2.5% year over year.2018 GuidanceThe company raised its earnings per share and revenue guidance for 2018. It expects earnings per share to be in the range of $6.75-$6.90 up from the previous range of $6.60-$6.80. It projects revenues in the range of $3.93-$3.99 billion up from its previous expectation of $3.85-$3.95 billion. Revenues for Soliris are expected in the range of $3.38-$3.42 billion compared with $3.33-$3.40 billion expected earlier. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for 2018 was $6.90 per share while for sales it was $3.99 billion and both of them reflect the higher end of the guidance range.The outlook assumes unfavorable Soliris revenue impact of $90 million to $110 million from ALXN1210 and other clinical trial recruitment versus prior year.Alexion expects to incur additional restructuring and related expenses of approximately $15 million to $80 million related to the 2017 restructuring activities.Pipeline UpdateThe company announced positive top-line results from the phase III study of its long-acting C5 complement inhibitor — ALXN1210 which showed that patients with PNH can be effectively and safely switched from treatment with Soliris every two weeks to treatment with ALXN1210 every eight weeks. The study showed non-inferiority of ALXN1210 to Soliris in patients with PNH who had been stable on Soliris based on the primary endpoint of change in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, a direct marker of complement-mediated hemolysis in PNH. The study also demonstrated non-inferiority on all four key secondary endpoints.In addition, ALXN1210 achieved non-inferiority on the primary and all four key secondary endpoints in the phase III PNH Switch study of ALXN1210 administered intravenously every eight weeks compared to patients currently treated with Soliris.Alexion plans to file for regulatory approval for ALXN1210 in patients with PNH in the United States and EU in mid-2018, followed by Japan later in 2018.Enrollment of ALXN1210 in phase III study for aHUS is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2018 and Alexion expects to report data from this study in the fourth quarter of 2018.AcquisitionIn April 2018, Alexion announced that it will acquire Sweden-based Wilson Therapeutics. Alexion has offered SEK 232 in cash for each outstanding share of Wilson Therapeutics which translates into a total transaction value of $855 million. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018.The acquisition will add a late-stage candidate, WTX101 to Alexion’s pipeline. The candidate is currently in phase III for the treatment of Wilson disease, a rare genetic disorder.Alexion is looking to diversify its portfolio and reduce its dependence on Soliris. The deal will strengthen Alexion’s rare disease pipeline with a late-stage candidate.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.

26,ALXN,"Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ACHN  -  Free Report) reported a loss of 15 cents per share for the first quarter of 2018, same as the year-ago loss but wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 14 cents.The company generated no revenues in the reported quarter.Shares of Achillion were down 2.4% on May 2. However, the company's stock have outperformed the industry year to date. The company’s shares have gained 28.1% against the industry’s decrease of 10.9%.Research and development (R&D) expenses decreased nearly 4.8% from the year-ago period to $14.6 million. The decrease was due to decreased stock-based compensation, lower personnel costs as the February restructuring resulted in reduced number of employees and lower manufacturing and formulation expenses for next generation factor D inhibitor candidate, ACH-5228. This was partially offset by increased costs related to clinical studies of ACH-4471 and ACH-5228 and preclinical costs of ACH-5548.General and administrative (G&A) expenses decreased 5.9% year over year to $5.3 million due to lower legal and consulting fees.Restructuring DetailsIn February 2018, the company announced an operational restructuring plan to focus on its existing factor D inhibitor candidates and reduce expenses. Achillion reduced its workforce by 20% under its restructuring plan. The restructuring is expected to save $10 million in 2018.Pipeline UpdateAchillion is planning to complete a phase II study on its most advanced candidate, ACH-4471, in C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) or immune complex-mediated membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (IC-MPGN) in 2018, with interim data planned for the third quarter of 2018. Two more studies are planned for 2018, which will evaluate ACH-4471 in C3G.Meanwhile, interim data from the ongoing phase II study evaluating ACH-4471 monotherapy in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (“PNH”) is planned for the fourth quarter of 2018. An add-on study is planned for the evaluation of ACH-4471 in combination with Alexion Pharmaceuticals’ (ALXN  -  Free Report) PNH drug, Soliris (eculizumab). Interim data is expected in the fourth quarter of 2018.The company also targets to complete phase I studies on its two next generation factor D inhibitors – ACH-5228 and ACH-5548 – in the fourth quarter of 2018.CEO TransitionConcurrent with the earnings release, Achillion announced that Joseph Truitt, current president and chief operating officer, will take the responsibilities of chief executive officer. Milind Deshpande is stepping down from this role. Joseph will also be appointed to the board of directors.Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

29,ALXN,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report) posted first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of $1.68 per share which were higher than the year-ago earnings of $1.38 by 22%. Earnings also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.48. Strong product revenues drove the bottom line in the quarter.Revenues rose 7% year over year to $930.9 million and exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $918 million. Revenues were driven by increased sales of Soliris, Strensiq and Kanuma.  Year to date, Alexion’s shares have declined 11.3%, compared with the industry’s fall of 9.9%. Revenues in DetailSoliris (paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (“PNH”) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS)) sales were up 2.1% to $800.1 million in the quarter driven by strong volume growth. While Strensiq (hypophosphatasia [“HPP”]) contributed $110.7 million to revenues, up 50.4% year over year, Kanuma (lysosomal acid lipase deficiency [LAL-D]) contributed $19.6 million (up 63.3%) to quarterly revenues.Cost SummaryAdjusted research and development (R&D) expenses were $161.6 million, down 16.9% year over year.Adjusted selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $220.4 million, down 2.5% year over year.2018 GuidanceThe company raised its earnings per share and revenue guidance for 2018. It expects earnings per share to be in the range of $6.75-$6.90 up from the previous range of $6.60-$6.80. It projects revenues in the range of $3.93-$3.99 billion up from its previous expectation of $3.85-$3.95 billion. Revenues for Soliris are expected in the range of $3.38-$3.42 billion compared with $3.33-$3.40 billion expected earlier. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for 2018 was $6.90 per share while for sales it was $3.99 billion and both of them reflect the higher end of the guidance range.The outlook assumes unfavorable Soliris revenue impact of $90 million to $110 million from ALXN1210 and other clinical trial recruitment versus prior year.Alexion expects to incur additional restructuring and related expenses of approximately $15 million to $80 million related to the 2017 restructuring activities.Pipeline UpdateThe company announced positive top-line results from the phase III study of its long-acting C5 complement inhibitor — ALXN1210 which showed that patients with PNH can be effectively and safely switched from treatment with Soliris every two weeks to treatment with ALXN1210 every eight weeks. The study showed non-inferiority of ALXN1210 to Soliris in patients with PNH who had been stable on Soliris based on the primary endpoint of change in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, a direct marker of complement-mediated hemolysis in PNH. The study also demonstrated non-inferiority on all four key secondary endpoints.In addition, ALXN1210 achieved non-inferiority on the primary and all four key secondary endpoints in the phase III PNH Switch study of ALXN1210 administered intravenously every eight weeks compared to patients currently treated with Soliris. Alexion plans to file for regulatory approval for ALXN1210 in patients with PNH in the United States and EU in mid-2018, followed by Japan later in 2018.Enrollment of ALXN1210 in phase III study for aHUS is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2018 and Alexion expects to report data from this study in the fourth quarter of 2018.AcquisitionIn April 2018, Alexion announced that it will acquire Sweden-based Wilson Therapeutics. Alexion has offered SEK 232 in cash for each outstanding share of Wilson Therapeutics which translates into a total transaction value of $855 million. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018.The acquisition will add a late-stage candidate, WTX101 to Alexion’s pipeline. The candidate is currently in phase III for the treatment of Wilson disease, a rare genetic disorder.Alexion is looking to diversify its portfolio and reduce its dependence on Soliris. The deal will strengthen Alexion’s rare disease pipeline with a late-stage candidate.Our TakeAlexion exceeded earnings and sales estimates in the first quarter of 2018. We expect growth at Alexion to continue being driven by Soliris. In the meantime, other new products — Strensiq and Kanuma — are doing well and should boost revenues.We are also impressed by Alexion’s efforts to develop its pipeline and announced positive topline results from both the ALXN1210 phase III PNH Naive and Switch studies, and its announcement of the acquisition of Wilson Therapeutics to begin to rebuild the clinical pipeline. Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

32,ALXN,"BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (BMRN  -  Free Report) will report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 25 after market close. BioMarin delivered a negative earnings surprise of 25.0% in the last quarter.BioMarin’s earnings track record has been decent, with the company beating estimates in three of the past four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 63.71%.BioMarin shares have declined 8% this year so far. This compares favorably with 9.1% decrease registered by the industry during this period.Let’s see how things are shaping up for the company this quarter.Factors at PlayKey orphan disease drugs, Vimizim and Kuvan, which drove BioMarin’s top line in the past few quarters, are likely to maintain the trend this quarter too. Robust patient growth and penetration should propel the drugs’ sales.Also, Naglazyme and Vimzin revenues vary on a quarterly basis, primarily due to inconsistent ordering patterns from some countries. On the fourth quarter 2017 conference call, the company had said that it is cautiously optimistic that sales in Brazil will be steady in 2018 but uneven buying patterns may be observed quarter to quarter.Nevertheless, the drugs continue to witness steady patient growth and we expect the trend to continue this quarter.We expect management to discuss how the pipeline is progressing on the conference call. Brineura, for the treatment of children with CLN2 disease – a form of Batten disease  – was approved in both the United States and EU last year.  Brineura generated sales of around $9 million in 2017. On the Q4 call, the company said that the focus on the initial stages of launch is on disease awareness and early diagnosis The company mentioned that new site readiness can take longer than expected, which suggests slower revenue ramp up.On the Q1 investor call, we also expect management to comment on the launch preparation for pegvaliase. Pegvaliase, developed for treating phenylketonuria (PKU), is under review in the United States with the FDA expected to give its decision in May.Regarding pegvaliase launch, on the Q4 call management had informed that the initial sales ramp-up of pegvaliase would be slow due to education on disease awareness and lower doses per patient in the induction titration phase.  Also, the company mentioned that it expects to price pegvaliase at a modest premium to Kuvan (net annual treatment cost of about $150,000). An update is expected at the upcoming call.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that BioMarin is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Its Earnings ESP is -17.99% as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is 13 cents while the Most Accurate Estimate is pegged lower at 10 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: BioMarin’s Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderBiotech stocks that have both a positive ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank include:Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

The stock has lost 9.9% compared with the industry’s decline of 8.3%. What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model shows that Alexion is likely to beat on earnings in the to-be-reported quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — which have a significantly higher chance of beating estimates.Zacks ESP: Alexion has an Earnings ESP of +2.09% as the Most Accurate estimate is $1.51 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.48. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Alexion’s Zacks Rank #2, when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Note that Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors Likely to Impact Q1 ResultsAlexion’s blockbuster drug, Soliris, continues to perform well. Alexion continues to identify and treat a consistently high number of new patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (“PNH”) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) with Soliris, across its 50-country operating platform.Alexion is working on expanding Soliris’ label into additional indications. The FDA recently approved the drug for the treatment of refractory generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody-positive. The drug was approved in Europe for this indication. Approximately 60,000-80,000 patients are expected to have gMG in the United States.Additionally, a phase III study (PREVENT) on Soliris in patients with relapsing neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder is ongoing with enrollment was completed and data expected in mid-2018. Label expansion in additional indications will give Soliris access to a higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug significantly.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Soliris hints that the drug’s sales will increase to about 8.2% from the year-ago quarter to $803 million.Alexion recently announced that it will acquire Sweden-based Wilson Therapeutics for $855 million. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter. The acquisition will add a late-stage candidate, WTX101 to Alexion’s pipeline. The candidate is currently in phase III for the treatment of Wilson disease, a rare genetic disorder.Alexion is looking to diversify its portfolio and reduce its dependence on its blockbuster drug Soliris. The deal will strengthen Alexion’s rare disease pipeline with a late-stage candidate.The company plans to focus on rare diseases businesses in core areas of hematology, nephrology, neurology and metabolic disorders to enhance productivity. Alexion will reduce spending and headcount associated with the previously announced de-prioritized pipeline programs as well as optimizing additional R&D expenses.The company plans to relocate its headquarters to Boston, MA by mid-2018 with approximately 400 positions. As a result of the restructuring plan, the company will reduce its global workforce by approximately 20%. The company expects that the increased financial flexibility will allow it to reinvest approximately $100 million annually into R&D. Alexion expects pretax savings of approximately $250 million by 2019.In the meantime, the company’s efforts to develop its pipeline are impressive, particularly in case of ALXN1210. Currently, it is evaluating ALXN1210 (a longer-acting anti-C5 antibody that inhibits terminal complement) in phase III studies for both PNH and aHUS. A tentative approval for PNH is expected in 2019.Patients are also being dosed in a phase III trial with ALXN1210 administered intravenously every eight weeks in complement inhibitor treatment-naive adolescent and adult patients with aHUS.  The company is expected to complete enrollment in the second quarter and announce the results in the fourth quarter of 2018.Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

35,ALXN,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report) has been struggling lately, but the selling pressure may be coming to an end soon. That is because ALXN recently saw a Hammer Chart Pattern which can signal that the stock is nearing a bottom.What is a Hammer Chart Pattern? A hammer chart pattern is a popular technical indicator that is used in candlestick charting. The hammer appears when a stock tumbles during the day, but then finds strength at some point in the session to close near or above its opening price. This forms a candlestick that resembles a hammer, and it can suggest that the market has found a low point in the stock, and that better days are ahead.Other FactorsPlus, earnings estimates have been rising for this company, even despite the sluggish trading lately. In just the past 60 days alone 1 estimate has gone higher, compared to none lower, while the consensus estimate has also moved in the right direction.Estimates have actually risen so much that the stock now has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) suggesting this relatively unloved stock could be due for a breakout soon. This will be especially true if ALXN stock can build momentum from here and find a way to continue higher of off this encouraging trading development.

36,ALXN,"We expect biotech major Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 24, after market close. Amgen delivered a negative earnings surprise of 4.93% in the last quarter.Amgen shares have declined 0.6% in the past year. Still, this compares favorably with the 8.4% decrease registered by the industry during this period.Amgen’s performance has been modest, with the company delivering a positive surprise in three out of the trailing four quarters. The average earnings beat over the last four quarters is 2.93%.Amgen Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Amgen Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Amgen Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for the company this quarter.Factors at PlayThe first-quarter usually generates the lowest product sales for Amgen.Amgen’s newer products like Prolia, Kyprolis, Xgeva and Blincyto are likely to perform well backed by higher demand. This will make up for lower sales of mature brands like Enbrel, Aranesp, Epogen, Neulasta and Neupogen due to competitive pressure.In 2017 and early 2018, Amgen gained FDA approval to include overall survival data in the labels for Kyprolis and Blincyto, which may reflect in first-quarter sales of these drugs. In January, Xgeva gained FDA approval for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with multiple myeloma. The label extension can boost sales of the drug.Neulasta demand is being hurt by competition from PD-1s and other new cancer therapiesNeupogen sales are also being hurt by biosimilar competition in the United States, mainly from Zarxio, Sandoz’s biosimilar version of NeupogenWe expect Neulasta and Neupogen first-quarter sales to be hurt by competitive dynamics. Neulasta and Epogen are expected to start facing biosimilar competition in the United States this year. Also, Sensipar sales are likely to decline sharply the soon-to-be reported quarter as the drug lost patent exclusivity in March 2018.Enbrel sales are expected to be hurt by increased pricing and competitive pressure. Enbrel is one of the main drivers of Amgen’s revenues.On the fourth-quarter conference call, Amgen said that sales of Enbrel in the first quarter are expected to be the lowest in 2018, representing approximately 20% of full-year sales. Also Repatha sales in the first quarter are expected to be relatively flat sequentially hurt by insurance verifications and patient out-of-pocket costs. Also investors will be keen to know if sales of Repatha have improved with the inclusion of FOURIER outcomes data on its label.Amgen and partner Allergan’s (AGN  -  Free Report) biosimilar version of Roche’s cancer drug Avastin, Mvasi was approved in EU in January, which should boost first-quarter sales of the drug.Investor focus on the call will be on management’s comments on the preparations for the potential launch of migraine candidate, Aimovig. The FDA is expected to give its decision on Aimovig biologics license application (BLA) in mid-May.Meanwhile, higher investments to support product launches is likely to result in higher SG&A costs in the to-be reported quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Amgen is likely to beat on earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate ($3.34 per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate ($3.23 per share) is +3.34%. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Amgen has a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of Amgen’s Zacks Rank #3 and positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5), on the other hand, should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks to ConsiderBiotech stocks that have both a positive ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank include:Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

37,ALXN,"Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report), a well-known name in the multiple sclerosis (MS) market, will report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 24, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 3.31%.Biogen’s shares have declined 16.5% this year, underperforming the industry’s decline of 8.4% in the same time frame.Biogen’s earnings performance has been decent so far, having delivered a positive surprise in three of the last four quarters. The average earnings beat over the last four quarters is 6.91%.Biogen Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Biogen Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Biogen Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcementFactors to ConsiderIn the fourth quarter of 2017, Biogen witnessed higher sales of its multiple sclerosis drugs. Patient growth across major European markets and strong emerging market growth drove international Tecfidera sales while a $20 million inventory build in the quarter benefited U.S. sales. However, on the call, Biogen mentioned that seasonality and absence of inventory build (that benefitted fourth quarter 2017 results) will hurt the performance of its MS franchise in the first quarter.Continued competitive pressure, especially from Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) newly launched MS drug, Ocrevus will hurt the performance of Biogen’s MS franchise, particularly sales of Tysabri. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of Tecfidera for the first quarter is pegged at $1.02 billion while that for Tysabri (Global In-Market sales) is $462 million.On the fourth-quarter conference call, Biogen said that since Ocrevus launch, it has witnessed a decrease in the number of patient starts and an increase in discontinuation of Tysabri in the United States. The negative trend may continue this quarter.The combined number of patients using Avonex and Plegridy are expected to decline with patients transitioning to other oral MS therapies as well as due to higher discounts and allowance.Zinbryta is unlikely to have made any significant contribution to revenues in the quarter. In March, Biogen and partner AbbVie announced their decision to withdraw Zinbryta from the markets, less than two years of its approval, due to growing safety concerns and limited commercial adoption of the drug due to its restrictive label. Both companies decided to discontinue marketing of the drug on grounds of the complex and evolving benefit/risk profile of Zinbryta.  An update is expected on the first-quarter conference call.Biogen’s newly launched drug Spinraza approved for spinal muscular atrophy is likely to see strong demand trends, particularly in international markets. On the fourth-quarter conference call, Biogen management had said that in 2018, a significant portion of Spinraza’s revenue growth is expected to come from outside the United States.Biogen’s biosimilar products - Flixabi (a biosimilar referencing Remicade) and Benepali (a biosimilar referencing Enbrel) are also generating significant revenues. The trend should continue this quarter as well.On the fourth-quarter call, the company had also said that operating expenses are expected to be sequentially lower in the first quarter. However, earnings growth is expected to be higher in the second and fourth quarters of the yearEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Biogen is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Its Earnings ESP is -0.51% as the Most Accurate estimate stands at $5.90 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at $5.93. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Biogen’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderBiotech stocks that have both a positive ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank include:Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

38,ALXN,"The biotech sector witnessed a series of events over the past week. The FDA accepted Alkermes’ new drug application (“NDA”) for ALKS 5461. This provided a major a boost to the company’s stock. However, Celldex’s breast cancer study failed to meet the primary endpoint owing to which the stock plummeted significantly. In another news, Alexion announced plans to acquire Wilson Therapeutics for $855 million. Thus, the space remained one of the key areas of investors focus.Recap of Important Stories:Alkermes Jumps on FDA Decision:  Following the FDA’s decision to review the NDA for ALKS 5461 for the treatment of major depressive disorder (“MDD”), shares of Alkermes (ALKS  -  Free Report) moved up. The FDA had initially issued a Refusal to File letter on Mar 30 for the candidate stating that the NDA did not have enough evidence for the oral medication to work. The FDA suggested that additional studies might be required to demonstrate the drug’s overall effectiveness for the proposed indication. ALKS 5461, a once-daily oral medication has been developed for the adjunctive treatment of MDD in patients who have not responded well to standard antidepressant therapies. The FDA's acceptance of the ALKS 5461 NDA and rescission of the Refusal to File letter followed productive interactions with the Agency in which Alkermes clarified certain aspects of the NDA submission. No additional data or analyses were submitted by Alkermes to FDA. The FDA has set an action date of Jan 31, 2019.

The company consulted with the regulatory body and agreed to make amendments to the study protocols, which include guidance on monitoring and management of neurologic adverse events.Bellicum will resume patient enrolment in the studies after implementing the amended protocols in the clinical study sites. BPX-501 is being developed as an adjunct T cell therapy for the treatment of patients with hematologic cancers and inherited blood diseases, who have undergone haploidentical (partial match) hematopoietic stem cell transplant.However, Bellicum claims the clinical hold did not have any impact on the ongoing registrational study, BP-004, in Europe, which was evaluating BPX-501 in pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia and primary immunodeficiencies. Per interim data announced in March, BPX-501 has demonstrated anti-leukemic effect in patients with AML in the study.

The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter.The acquisition will add a late-stage candidate, WTX101 to Alexion’s pipeline. The candidate is currently in phase III for the treatment of Wilson disease, a rare genetic disorder. The candidate is a first-in-class oral copper-binding agent with a unique mechanism of action and ability to access and bind copper from serum and promote its removal from the liver.The candidate has also obtained Fast Track Designation in the United States and enjoys Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of Wilson disease in the United States and EU.  (Read more: Alexion to Acquire Wilson Therapeutics for $855M)Celldex’s Breast Cancer Study Fails: Celldex (CLDX  -  Free Report) plummeted as the phase IIb study, glembatumumab vedotin failed. The candidate failed to meet the primary endpoint of progression-free survival (“PFS”) benefit over Roche’s chemotherapy, Xeloda, in the treatment of metastatic triple-negative breast cancers that overexpress gpNMB. An assessment of the data from the mid-stage study showed that glembatumumab vedotin achieved a PFS of 2.9 months versus 2.8 months for Xeloda.The candidate was also not able to demonstrate significant advantage in key secondary endpoints, including overall response rate, duration of response and overall survival. Following the failure, Celldex has decided to discontinue studies evaluating glembatumumab vedotin across all indications. The company is currently restructuring its pipeline to focus on five candidates in ongoing clinical studies, which includes varlilumab. It may also reduce its workforce.

Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) inhibitor selonsertib was combined with either the Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) inhibitor GS-0976 or the selective, non-steroidal Farnesoid X receptor agonist GS-9674 as therapies.  Patients diagnosed with NASH and liver fibrosis stages F2 to F3 based on biopsy, or by magnetic resonance elastography and MRI proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) enrolled in the s tudy. They were treated with either selonsertib 18 mg plus GS-0976 20 mg (n=20), selonsertib 18 mg plus GS-9674 30 mg (n=20), or each monotherapy (n=10 per group) once daily for 12 weeks.Patients treatment the most notable change that were observed was the decrease in liver fat content (measured by MRI-PDFF), which occurred in regimens containing GS-0976. The results also showed improvements in liver biochemistry and/or markers of fibrosis across both combination arms of the study compared to baseline.  Moreover, patients treated with selonsertib plus GS-0976, kinetic labeling showed reduction in the fractional synthesis rate of lumican, a marker of fibrogenesis.Hence, the favorable results suggest that combination therapy with selonsertib and either GS-0976 or GS-9674 can be evaluated further in patients with NASH and F3 and F4 fibrosis.  (Read more:Gilead Presents Encouraging Data on NASH Therapies)PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return  Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return The NASDAQ Biotechnology Index gained 1.82% over the last five trading sessions.

39,ALXN,"The current year began on widespread optimism, predicting a significant increase in drug/biotech mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity, mainly buoyed by the new tax law enacted in December 2017 and purchasing newer technologies. The tax reform has lowered the tax rate and provided a low-tax window to bring back huge cash stashed overseas. These will certainly improve the cash position of the companies and fuel M&A activities amid struggling organic growth.With a quarter of the year already gone by, we have seen quite a few billion dollar buyout deals being inked. For instance, Celgene Corporation acquired Juno Therapeutics to add a CAR-T therapy to its pipeline for approximately $9 billion. Moreover, the company is in process to complete the acquisition of Impact Biomedicines for an upfront amount of $1.1 billion. Also, Sanofi in a bid to strengthen its blood disorder pipeline purchased Bioverativ for $11.6 billion and even offered to buy Belgian Biotech Company, Ablynx for $4.8 billion.Additionally, Pfizer is aggressively on the lookout for a buyer for its Consumer Healthcare unit after British firms Glaxo and Reckitt Benckiser Group withdrew from discussions. However, Glaxo announced its acquisition of Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) stake in their healthcare joint venture for $13 billion. Meanwhile late last month, Takeda also confirmed its intention to integrate Dublin-based Shire into its portfolio to boost its core therapeutic areas.Moreover, this week bore news of a couple of more M&A deals. A brief description of the two deals is as follows:Novartis to Buy AveXisNovartis inked a deal to acquire the U.S. based clinical stage gene therapy company, AveXis, Inc , to boost its presence in gene therapy and neuroscience space.AveXis’ lead gene therapy candidate, AVXS-101, is being developed to treat spinal muscular atrophy (""SMA""), a neurodegenerative disease, accounting for the highest genetic cause of death in infants. The only approved treatment for SMA is the Biogen’s Spinraza.Per the agreement, Novartis will close the acquisition in an all cash deal of $8.7 billion. The company proposed a cash-tender offer of $218 per share for AveXis’ common stock. The deal is expected to culminate in the second half of 2018. (Read more: Novartis Inks $8.7 Billion Gene Therapy Deal to Buy AveXis)Alexion-Wilson DealAlexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report) announced that it will consolidate Sweden-based Wilson Therapeutics in its portfolio to add a late-stage candidate to its pipeline for the treatment of Wilson disease, a rare genetic disorder. The acquisition is line with the company’s strategy to diversify its portfolio and lower its dependence on its blockbuster drug, Soliris.Alexion has offered 232 Swedish Krona in cash for each outstanding share of Wilson Therapeutics, which translates into a total transaction value of $855 million. The buyout is expected to get wrapped up this quarter. (Read more: Alexion to Acquire Wilson Therapeutics for $855M)In this article, we suggest three drug/biotech companies as logical acquisition targets this year. The parameters counting for buying a drug/biotech stock are the current sales performance of its drugs/products, prospects of future sales growth and the quality of the company’s pipeline. Takeovers of small-cap drug/biotech companies are very difficult to forecast and are quite frequent in the said space. Hence, these have been excluded from the discussion.Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AGIO  -  Free Report)Agios Pharmaceuticals’ share price is witnessed to rally this week on speculations that the company might be bought by other big players in the pharma and biotech industry.The company received an FDA approval for Idhifa (enasidenib) in August 2017 for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (“AML”) with IDH2 mutation, lending a huge boost to its immense commercial potential in the target market. Agios’ ivosidenib is under review in the United States as a therapy for relapsed/refractory AML with IDH1 mutation. The candidate is also being developed for addressing advanced hematologic malignancies.Agios’ pipeline also includes a mid-stage genetic diseases candidate. A consistent progress with its investigational candidates makes the company one of the most lucrative takeover options for other large players in the drug/biotech space at the moment. (Read more: Agios Pharmaceuticals Shares Rise on Buyout Speculation)Agios carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (BMRN  -  Free Report)Companies with product/pipeline portfolios comprising rare disease drugs are in great demand as there is less competition in the concerned space and the expensive treatments can garner huge profits. BioMarin is one such drug developer with a market cap of around $15 billion.BioMarin’s key orphan disease drugs, Vimizim and Kuvan, are doing well, backed by strong underlying patient demand trends. Also, another orphan drug Brineura’s earlier-than-expected approval this year for the treatment of children with CLN2 disease is likely to be a huge boost to BioMarin. A potential approval for pegvaliase is expected next month.BioMarin has already been a target of takeover speculation. Companies like Gilead, Amgen and Roche might be interested in buying BioMarin.BioMarin carries a Zacks Rank #3.Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (VRTX  -  Free Report)For Vertex, a consistent expansion in patient population raised revenues quarter to quarter throughout 2017. Moreover, the approval to its third cystic fibrosis (“CF”) drug, Symdeko (tezacaftor/ivacaftor combination), will further drive the company’s sales. The company is hopeful that a positive trend of CF sales will continue in 2018 as it gains additional reimbursement approvals for Orkambi in the ex-U.S. marketsMeanwhile, the company is focused on triple combination therapies for treating CF, which will further expand its patient population. The market cap of Vertex is more than $40 billion.Vertex carries a Zacks Rank #3.Incyte Corporation(INCY  -  Free Report)Incyte’s strong oncology portfolio makes it an attractive pick for companies, namely Gilead, Amgen and Bristol Myers. Incyte’s market cap is also around $15 billion.The primary reason why Incyte is ready for buyout is because of the encouraging performance of its two marketed products such as, Jakafi and Iclusig. Jakafi is seeing a strong sales performance, driven by solid patient demand in the approved indications.The company is also working on its further label expansion. Meanwhile, Incyte’s pipeline boasts candidates like immune therapy epacadostat, which is being studied in combination with other drugs for the cure of cancer and rheumatoid arthritis.Incyte carries a Zacks Rank #3.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

40,ALXN,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report) is the latest company to join the ongoing acquisitions spree in the biotech sector. The company recently announced that it will acquire Sweden-based Wilson Therapeutics.Details of The TransactionAlexion has offered SEK 232 in cash for each outstanding share of Wilson Therapeutics which translates into a total transaction value of $855 million. Alexion has already obtained shareholder support agreements from the four largest shareholders accounting for 57.4% of Wilson Therapeutics’ outstanding shares and two additional shareholders accounting for 8.7% for a total of 66.1% of the company’s outstanding shares. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter.Rationale Behind the TransactionThe acquisition will add a late-stage candidate, WTX101 to Alexion’s pipeline. The candidate is currently in phase III for the treatment of Wilson disease, a rare genetic disorder. The candidate is a first-in-class oral copper-binding agent with a unique mechanism of action and ability to access and bind copper from serum and promote its removal from the liver. The candidate has also obtained Fast Track designation in the United States and enjoys Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of Wilson disease in the United States and EU.   Our TakeAlexion is looking to diversify its portfolio and reduce its dependence on its blockbuster drug Soliris. The deal will strengthen Alexion’s rare disease pipeline with a late-stage candidate.However, investors weren’t much impressed with the news as the acquisition adds a candidate to the pipeline and not an approved drug. Thus, the stock lost 2.35% following the announcement. Moreover, the market opportunity for such a rare disease will be limited and might not boost the top-line as expected.  Alexion’s shares have lost 21.7% in the last six months, compared with the industry’s decline of 16.2%.Of late, quite a few biotech companies have been looking to strengthen their portfolio/pipeline. While 2017 was pretty ho-hum on this front with just a few key deals, 2018 is expected to see a surge in M&A primarily due to lower U.S. tax rates.  Taking a clue from Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) acquisition of Kite Pharma, Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) recently acquired Juno Therapeutics to gain traction in the promising CAR-T space.  Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) acquired Bioverativ Inc. which focuses on therapies for hemophilia and other rare blood disorders.Zacks Rank Alexion currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

41,ALXN,"Key highlights of the week include Alexion gaining on positive data on PNH candidate, Arena surges on ulcerative drug data, Solid Biosciences’ stock suffering a crash and Prothena teaming up with Celgene.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesAlexion Up on Positive Data From PNH Candidate:  Shares of Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN  -  Free Report) gained after the company reported positive data on candidate, ALXN1210 from a pivotal phase III study. This phase III randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multinational, and multicenter study evaluated the efficacy and safety of ALXN1210 compared to Alexion’s lead drug Soliris administered by intravenous infusion to adult patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (“PNH”) who are naïve to complement inhibitor treatment. ALXN1210 demonstrated non-inferiority to Soliris in complement inhibitor treatment-naïve patients with PNH based on the co-primary endpoints of transfusion avoidance and normalization of lactate dehydrogenase (“LDH”) levels. In addition, the study also demonstrated non-inferiority on all four key secondary endpoints — percentage change from baseline in LDH levels, change from baseline in quality of life as assessed by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (“FACIT”) — Fatigue scale, proportion of patients with breakthrough hemolysis, and proportion of patients with stabilized hemoglobin levels. Alexion plans to submit ALXN1210 in PNH in the United States, EU, and Japan in the second half of 2018.

SGT-001 is being evaluated for the underlying genetic cause of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (“DMD”) mutations in the dystrophin gene that result in the absence or near-absence of dystrophin protein. The clinical hold was placed after one of the patients was hospitalized due to laboratory findings which included a decrease in platelet count, followed by a reduction in red blood cell count and evidence of complement activation. As a result, enrolment and dosing has been stopped in the phase III study.

The results show that 58% of patients treated with Eylea experienced a two-step or greater improvement from baseline on the Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Scale at week 24, compared to 6% of patients receiving sham injection. The positive data from the trial will form the basis of a supplemental Biologics License Application which is expected to be submitted to the FDA later in 2018.  Eylea is already approved for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), diabetic macular edema (“DME”), macular edema following retinal vein occlusion, which includes macular edema following central retinal vein occlusion and macular edema following branch retinal vein occlusion. A potential label expansion will further boost sales. (Read more: Regeneron Eylea Hits 24-Week Primary Endpoint in Study)Regeneron is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock.

42,ALXN,"Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report), a well-known name in the multiple sclerosis (MS) market, will report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 25, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 10.70%.Biogen’s shares have risen 24% this year, better than the industry’s growth of 5.8% in the same time frame.  Biogen’s earnings performance has been pretty impressive so far, having delivered a positive surprise in each of the last four quarters. The average earnings beat over the last four quarters is 8.09%.Biogen Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Biogen Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Biogen Inc. Quote Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderOn the third-quarter call, the company had warned that seasonality and continued competitive pressure from Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) newly launched MS drug, Ocrevus will hurt the performance of its MS franchise in the fourth quarter.Meanwhile, the combined number of patients using Avonex and Plegridy will continue to decline with patients transitioning to other oral MS therapies as well as due to higher discounts and allowance.Spinraza, approved for spinal muscular atrophy in December 2016, witnessed faster-than-anticipated adoption in the United States in the first half of 2017 backed by robust underlying demand. However Spinraza U.S. sales were slow in the third quarter due to unfavorable timing of induction doses as patients transitioned from intensive Spinraza treatment to a less intensive maintenance schedule. On the third-quarter call, the company had said that due to the impact of the dosing scheduling, Spinraza sales in the fourth quarter will mainly be driven by ex-U.S. markets.Biogen’s biosimilar products - Flixabi (a biosimilar referencing Remicade) and Benepali (a biosimilar referencing Enbrel) are also generating higher revenues. The trend should continue this quarter as well.On the third-quarter call, the company had also said that operating expenses will be higher in the fourth quarter compared to the third with the company investing in its strategic priorities.Investor focus on the fourth quarter call will remain on management’s comments on the impact of Ocrevus competition on Tecfidera’s sales/prescription trends, performance of Spinraza, pipeline progress and acquisition plans.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Biogen is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Its Earnings ESP is -0.64% as the Most Accurate estimate stands at $5.42 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at $5.45. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Biogen’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderBiotech stocks that have both a positive ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank include:Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report), scheduled to release results on Feb 8, has an Earnings ESP of +5.93% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Emergent BioSolutions Inc. (EBS  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +22.65% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is expected to release results next month.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AILast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce """"the world's first trillionaires,"""" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

43,ALXN,"2017 was a good year for pharma and biotech stocks with the sector witnessing some positive developments that led to a much-awaited recovery.A key reason for the sector’s improved performance was the willingness of investors to look beyond the drug pricing controversy and focus more on fundamentals instead. Although the drug pricing controversy, which was a major overhang in 2016, will remain a headline risk, investors seem more comfortable with the issue. Moreover, a significantly higher number of FDA approvals in 2017 has restored investor confidence in the sector. The approval of the first gene cell therapy last year was a major breakthrough for the sector.Hopes of more mergers and acquisitions (M&As) have also gone up with tax reform in place and big players on the lookout for companies with innovative pipelines/technology. There has already been quite a bit of M&A buzz this year about potential deals with Celgene rumored to be interested in buying Juno , Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) in Acorda and Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) in Bioverativ. Meanwhile, Novo Nordisk recently confirmed that it is looking to acquire Belgium-based biopharma company Ablynx though Ablynx rejected Novo Nordisk’s offer.Looking forward, new product sales ramp up, R&D success and innovation, continued strong performance from key products, more M&A activity, growing demand for drugs especially for rare-to-treat diseases, an aging population and increased health care spending are some of the factors that should keep the momentum in 2018.Headwinds include drug pricing scrutiny, pricing pressure, increasing competition, the growing presence of biosimilars, generic competition, a slowdown in the growth of legacy products, concerns regarding Amazon’s interest in entering the healthcare arena and major pipeline setbacks.4 Biotech & Pharma Stocks to Keep an Eye on This Earnings SeasonAccording to the Zacks Earnings Trends article, the medical sector, which has been among the better performing sectors over the last several quarters, is expected to record earnings growth of 3% on revenue growth of 4.7% in the fourth quarter.Given this scenario and with medical sector earnings round the corner, it would make sense to look at some pharma and biotech stocks that are expected to report a positive earnings surprise in the quarter.Investing in such stocks could prove beneficial for investors as an earnings beat usually leads to significant share price appreciation.With the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have zeroed-in on four pharma and biotech stocks that sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) and have a positive Earnings ESP. Earnings ESP is a very valuable tool for investors looking for stocks that are most likely to beat earnings estimates. Moreover, adding a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 has produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. While you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here, you can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report): Alexion has a strong presence in the rare diseases market. Marketed drugs include Soliris (for the treatment of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (“PNH”), atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), and anti-acetylcholine receptor (AchR) antibody-positive generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG)), Strensiq (enzyme replacement therapy for patients with hypophosphatasia (“HPP”)) and Kanuma (enzyme replacement therapy for patients with lysosomal acid lipase deficiency (LAL-D)).Alexion is focusing on growing and maximizing its presence in the rare disease business. Core areas of focus include hematology, nephrology, neurology and metabolic disorders. Alexion has consistently surpassed earnings expectations in each of the last four quarters with an average surprise of 11.9%. The Zacks Rank #3 stock, which will report fourth quarter results on February 8, has an Earnings ESP of +5.93% for the quarter. While 2017 Soliris revenues are expected in the range of $3,090 million - $3,125 million, metabolic revenues are expected in the range of $385 - $400 million.Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report): Celgene is focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of treatments for cancer and inflammatory diseases through next-generation solutions in protein homeostasis, immuno-oncology, epigenetics, immunology and neuro-inflammation. Earlier this month, the company announced preliminary results for the fourth quarter with revenues expected to be about $3.5 billion and earnings to be approximately $2.00 per share. Celgene has surpassed earnings in each of the last four quarters with an average surprise of 2.5%. The Zacks Rank #3 stock, which will be reporting fourth quarter results on January 25, has an Earnings ESP of +0.94%.AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report): AbbVie, which is known for its blockbuster drug, Humira, is focused on the development of treatments across four primary therapeutic areas: immunology, oncology, virology and neuroscience. 2017 earnings are expected to be about $5.54 per share on revenue growth of approximately 10%. Humira is expected to remain a key growth driver with sales expected to cross $18 billion in 2017. AbbVie will be reporting its fourth quarter results on January 26. The company has a decent track record having surpassed earnings expectations in each of the last four quarters with an average surprise of 1.1%. The Zacks Rank #3 stock has an Earnings ESP of +1.3% for the fourth quarter. AbbVie’s shares are up 71.6% over the last one year, significantly surpassing the 23.9% rally of the industry it belongs to.Merck (MRK  -  Free Report): Merck will be reporting fourth quarter results on February 2. The company has a strong earnings track record and is expected to deliver a surprise of +1.06% in the fourth quarter. Growth drivers include Keytruda, Gardasil, a few hospital and specialty products and the Animal Health division which should help offset the impact of the genericization of Zetia and Vytorin. Merck is also a Zacks Rank #3 stock.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

44,ALXN,"The year 2017 has been better than expected for the biotech sector. The NASDAQ Biotechnology index was up 18.7% in 2017. While drug pricing issue, competition and a slowdown in growth of key drugs are expected to remain a hangover in 2018 as well, approval of new drugs and strategic acquisitions by several big wigs in 2017 are likely to boost investors’ sentiments. Thus 2018 needless to say, holds promise for generating stellar returns.The slowdown in mature products compelled bigwigs like Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) to undertake acquisitions to bolster pipelines. Gilead acquired erstwhile Kite Pharma and added Yescarta to its kitty. The company also inked an agreement to acquire Cell Design Labs. Gilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Recently, Celgene, Inc. (CELG  -  Free Report) inked a deal to acquire Impact Biomedicines for an upfront amount of $1.1 billion. The acquisition will add a late-stage candidate, fedratinib, a highly selective JAK2 kinase inhibitor, to Celgene’s pipeline.  The candidate is being developed for the treatment of myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera. Celgene was on the look-out of new deals and acquisitions given a lacklustre 2017, having suffered a few pipeline setbacks and weakness in Otezla sales. Celgene currently carries a Zacks Rank.Acquisitions and mergers will keep investors focused in the space in 2018.  In addition, new drug approvals and label expansion of existing drugs will boost the top line of prominent biotech companies.Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) looks poised for growth with several blockbuster drugs in its portfolio. Amgen’s new drugs — Prolia, Xgeva, Vectibix, Nplate and Sensipar — are performing well. The company recently won the FDA approval for the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) of Xvega to expand the drug’s label for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Amgen carries a Zacks Rank #3.Exelixis, Inc. (EXEL  -  Free Report) is another biotech which looks poised for growth in 2018. The recent FDA approval of the label expansion of lead drug Cabometyx for the treatment previously untreated advanced renal cell carcinoma is expected to drive growth. The drug has performed impressively since approval in 2016. Exelixis currently carries a Zacks Rank #1.Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s (ALXN  -  Free Report) blockbuster drug, Soliris, continues to perform well and the FDA approval of the drug for generalized myasthenia gravis will further boost sales. Among new products, while Strensiq is gaining momentum, the company redefined its strategy for Kanuma.  Alexion carries a Zacks Rank #3.Investors should also keep an eye on key upcoming PDUFA dates. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report) is looking to expand label for its newly approved drug Dupixent. The drug is already approved for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. The company is also evaluating the drug for treating asthma in adults (LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST study).  sBLA for the same is expected to be filed shortly. Regeneron is working on expanding lead ophthalmology drug Eylea label into additional indications. The FDA has accepted for review the company's sBLA for the label expansion of Eylea Injection. The company is seeking approval a for a 12-week dosing interval of Eylea Injection in patients with wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) based on physician's assessment. The action date set by the FDA is Aug 11, 2018. Regeneron carries a Zacks Rank #3.Another big biotech, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) is taking measures to strengthen its already dominant position in the cystic fibrosis market (CF). Vertex has two CF drugs — Kalydeco & Orkambi — in its portfolio with blockbuster potential.  The company has developed another CF corrector tezacaftor (VX-661) — in combination with ivacaftor.  Regulatory applications are under review in the United States (PDUFA Date: Feb 28, 2018) and the EU.  A potential approval would further bolster demand.  Vertex currently carries a Zacks Rank #1.Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return   Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnConclusion While the threat of biosimilars loom large on key drugs of most companies, we expect investors to remain focussed on this dynamic sector eying new drug approvals and important data read-outs.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

45,ALXN,"Omeros Corporation (OMER  -  Free Report) announced that it has entered into an agreement with the FDA on its protocol to start a phase III study to evaluate its lead pipeline candidate, OMS721, for treatment of patients with IgA nephropathy (IgAN). Enrollment of patients for the study is expected to start early next month.Notably, OMS721 is Omeros’ lead human monoclonal antibody targeting mannan-binding lectin-associated serine protease-2 (MASP-2).Shares of Omeros have outperformed the industry in a year. The stock has soared 88.2% compared with the industry’s rally of 26.7%.The single arm phase III study will be conducted on biopsy-confirmed IgAN patients aged minimum 18 years. In the trial, patients will be administered with intravenous doses of OMS721 through 12 weeks. The primary endpoint of the study will be reduction of proteinuria after the dosing starts. To further evaluate the safety and efficacy of the candidate, the initial sample size is estimated at 140 patients in either of the treatments including the placebo arm.The company said that based on the degree of effect on proteinuria, either full or an accelerated approval for the candidate is possible in the United States.We remind investors that in June last year, the FDA had granted a breakthrough therapy designation to OMS721. It is important to note that this designation enables expedited development and review of a drug candidate for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease. It has also been granted an orphan drug designation by the FDA for the given indication. Additionally, the orphan drug status for the candidate in the EU is pending.Meanwhile, OMS721 is also being evaluated in a phase III clinical program for atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) in both the United States and the EU. The candidate has been granted both fast track and orphan drug designations for aHUS by the FDA.Meanwhile, the company has recently initiated another phase III study for hematopoietic stem cell transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (HCT-TMA).Per the company, approximately 120,000 to 180,000 patients in the United States suffer from IgA nephropathy. Absence of an approved treatment for IgA nephropathy reflects a significant unmet need for the same. Approximately 40% of IgA nephropathy patients develop end-stage renal disease.The successful development and a subsequent approval of the candidate will significantly boost the company’s growth prospects.We note that Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'s (ALXN  -  Free Report) Soliris is also approved for aHUS.Omeros’ portfolio comprises a single approved drug, Omidria. The drug was launched in the United States in the second quarter of 2015 for its use during cataract surgery or intraocular lens or IOL replacement.Omeros Corporation Price Omeros Corporation Price | Omeros Corporation QuoteZacks Rank & Key PicksOmeros carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

46,ALXN,"In this blog, we highlight two large-cap biotech stocks — Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (VRTX  -  Free Report) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report) — that attracted investor attention last year and will likely remain in focus in the New Year as well.Both Vertex and Alexion enjoy dominant positions in medical areas - cystic fibrosis (CF) for Vertex and ultra-rare disorders for Alexion – that are not very competitive.  This puts these two companies in advantageous position to peers, which face rising competitive pressure.Vertex Vertex markets two CF drugs, Kalydeco and Orkambi.Year 2017 was a tremendous year for Vertex with positive data read-outs and regulatory approvals leading to an increase in eligible patient population for Kalydeco & Orkambi. With a consistent expansion in patient population, Vertex’s CF product revenues increased through 2017.The company is optimistic that the positive trend in CF sales will continue in 2018 as it gains additional reimbursement approvals for Orkambi in ex-U.S. markets and gets approval to launch tezacaftor (VX-661)/ivacaftor combination medicine.The stock surged 103.4% in 2017, substantially outperforming the 4.4% increase registered by the industry. Estimates have also moved northward in the past 90 days, driven by the company’s positive earnings surprises.Vertex’s CF pipeline is also quite strong with a broad portfolio of next-generation CF correctors. Vertex has also made decent clinical progress across multiple CF studies this year and has meaningful pipeline catalysts. Investor focus is on the triple combination CF regimens, which are crucial for long-term growth, as these have the potential to treat up to 90% of CF patients. Vertex plans to initiate pivotal phase III studies on up to two of the four triple combination regimens in the first half of 2018.AlexionAlexion is focused on the development and commercialization of life-transforming drugs for the treatment of patients with ultra-rare disorders. Its key drug, Soliris, approved for two severe and ultra-rare blood disorders — paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) — has been consistently doing well.Meanwhile, Alexion is working on expanding the drug’s label to include additional indications, which if approved, can boost further sales growth. In October, the FDA approved Soliris to treat refractory generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AchR) antibody positive.It has two other drugs for rare diseases called Strensiq and Kanuma, which are emerging as growth drivers. Alexion also has a robust pipeline of several candidates under development including Soliris follow-up candidate, ALXN1210. Data from some key studies on ALXN1210 are expected to be presented this year.Though Alexion’s share price declined slightly last year, estimates moved northward in the past 90 days while the company consistently delivered positive earnings surprises.ConclusionWith a strong product portfolio and consistently successful pipeline development, Vertex and Alexion will likely attract investor attention this year in an industry that struggles with increasing pricing and competitive pressure. Also, both the companies are viewed as attractive acquisition targets for larger companies.Both the companies have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

47,ALXN,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ((ALXN  -  Free Report) announced that the label expansion of its lead drug Soliris (eculizumab) has been approved by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) in Japan. The drug’s label is approved for the treatment of patients with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody-positive and display symptoms that are difficult to control with high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy or plasmapheresis (PLEX). Soliris is the first and only complement inhibitor approved in Japan as a treatment for these patients.The approval was based on the phase III REGAIN study and its ongoing open-label extension study. In the study, Soliris showed treatment benefits for patients with anti-AChR antibody-positive gMG who had previously failed immunosuppressive treatment and continued to suffer from significant unresolved disease symptoms.Alexion’s shares have underperformed the industry year to date. The stock has declined 2.5%, against the industry’s growth of 3.6%.We note that Soliris is approved for two severe and ultra-rare disorders resulting from chronic uncontrolled activation of the complement component of the immune system – paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS).In October, the FDA also approved Soliris as a treatment for adult patients with generalized gMG who are anti-AchR antibody-positive. In August, the drug received approval from the European Commission for the same indication.Additionally, a phase III study (PREVENT) on Soliris in patients with relapsing neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder is ongoing with data expected in 2018. Label expansion into additional indications would give Soliris access to a higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug significantly.We note that Soliris has received Orphan Drug Designation (“ODD”) for the treatment of patients with MG in the United States and European Union, and for the treatment of patients with refractory gMG in Japan. Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

48,ALXN,"Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ACHN  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has granted orphan drug designation to its lead factor D inhibitor candidate, ACH-4471, for the treatment of C3 Glomerulopathy (C3G), a serious renal disorder.We note that the orphan drug designation is granted to drugs capable of treating rare diseases that affect less than 200,000 people in the United States. The status makes ACH-4471 eligible for seven years of marketing exclusivity in the United States, following an approval for C3G. The designation also makes the company eligible for certain other benefits, including tax credits related to clinical trial expenses, exemption from the FDA user fee and assistance from the FDA in clinical trial design.Shares of Achillion have underperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has lost 31.7% in contrast to the industry’s gain of 3%.Preliminary data announced last month from a phase II study evaluating ACH-4471 demonstrated potential in treating C3G by reducing proteinuria, excess proteins in urine, by 50% over the treatment duration of 14 daysAchillion also announced the initiation of a phase I bioavailability study that will evaluate extended release oral tablet formulationsof ACH-4471. The endpoint of the study is to achieve once or twice daily dosing regimens of ACH-4471 with interim results expected by mid-2018.Apart from C3G, the company is also developing ACH-4471 in a phase II study in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (“PNH”).The candidate also enjoys orphan drug status for this indication.Achillion has plans to initiate a phase II study in the first half of 2018 to evaluate the long-term potential of ACH-4471 in combination with Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s (ALXN  -  Free Report) Soliris for treating PNH.We remind investors that Achillion faced a major setback when Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) sold its stake in Achillion last month, following the termination of the global license and collaboration agreement for developing hepatitis C treatments in September.

49,ALXN,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report) was a big mover last session, as the company saw its shares rise more than 7% on the day.

The move came after the company announced its collaboration with Halozyme Therapeutics, which will enable Alexion to use Halozyme’s technology for drug delivery.The company has seen one negative estimate revisions in the past few months, while its Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has also moved lower over the past few months, suggesting there may be trouble down the road.

50,ALXN,"Last week, we issued an article where we mentioned that mergers and acquisitions, which were quite lean in 2017, may pick up significantly in 2018 if the proposed tax reforms are finally approved.The reforms aim to cut the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, which can boost profits of large drug/biotech companies. The change in tax code will also allow companies to bring back huge cash held overseas at a one-time tax rate of 10%.These changes will definitely leave more cash in the hands of drug/biotech companies. Also, with focus on drug pricing taking a backseat and large drug/biotech companies struggling with organic growth, there is a lot of chatter about a possible increase in large M&As in 2018.Given that it takes several years and millions of dollars to develop new therapeutics from scratch, large pharmaceutical companies sitting on huge piles of cash may prefer to buy innovative small/mid cap biotech companies to build out their pipelines.In this article, we discuss some mid- and large-cap names that may be logical acquisition targets next year for companies like Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Merck (MRK  -  Free Report), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and others. What matters for buying a drug/biotech stock is the current sales performance of its drugs/products, prospects of future sales growth, and the quality of the pipeline.The four companies we discuss have most of these factors going in their favor. Acquisitions of small-cap drug/biotech companies are very difficult to predict and quite frequent. Hence, these have been excluded from the discussion.BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (BMRN  -  Free Report)Companies whose product/pipeline portfolio includes rare disease drugs are in great demand as it is a less competitive space and the expensive treatments can bring in huge profits. BioMarin is one such drug developer. Its market cap is around $14 billion.BioMarin’s key orphan disease drugs – Vimizim and Kuvan – continue to do well, backed by strong underlying patient demand trends. BioMarin expects sustained growth in both the drugs. Brineura’s earlier-than-expected approval this year for the treatment of children with CLN2 disease, a form of Batten disease, was also a huge boost for BioMarin.Its impressive rare disease pipeline is also progressing well with approval for pegvaliase for the treatment of phenylketonuria expected in 2018. On the pipeline, we believe both late-stage candidates – vosoritide - for achondroplasia, the most common form of dwarfism, and BMN27 – for hemophilia A -  have blockbuster potential.BioMarin has already been the target of takeover speculation. Companies like Gilead (GILD), Amgen (AMGN) and Roche may be interested in buying BioMarin.Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (VRTX  -  Free Report)For Vertex, 2017 so far has been a tremendous year with positive data read-outs and regulatory approvals leading to an increase in eligible patient population for its two approved cystic fibrosis (CF) - Kalydeco & Orkambi. CF is Vertex’s main area of focus. With a consistent expansion in patient population, Vertex’s CF product revenues have increased quarter to quarter throughout 2017.The company is optimistic that the positive trend of CF sales will continue in 2018 as it gains additional reimbursement approvals for Orkambi in ex-U.S. markets and gets approval to launch tezacaftor(VX-661)/ivacaftor combination medicine.Meanwhile, the company has also made decent clinical progress across multiple CF studies this year and has meaningful pipeline catalysts. The market cap of Vertex is around $36 billion.Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) Incyte’s strong oncology portfolio makes it a lucrative target for companies like Gilead, Amgen and Bristol Myers. The market cap of Incyte is more than $20 billion.The primary reason why Incyte is ripe for buyout is its two products on the market, Jakafi and Iclusig.Jakafi, a JAK inhibitor, is the first and the only product to be approved by the polycythemia vera (PV) and myelofibrosis (“MF”) – two rare blood cancers. Jakafi is seeing strong sales performance driven by strong patient demand for both indications.  In order to expand the patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug, the company is working on expanding its label further. Iclusig is approved for chronic myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.Meanwhile, Incyte’s pipeline boasts candidates like immune therapy epacadostat — being studied in combination with anti-PD-L1 agents of Merck, Bristol Myers and others — and Olumiant for rheumatoid arthritis – approved in Europe and regulatory application to be filed in the United States in January 2018.Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report)Like BioMarin, Alexion is also focused on the development and commercialization of life-transforming drugs for the treatment of patients with ultra-rare disorders. Its key drug is Soliris, approved for two severe and ultra-rare disorders — paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) — have been consistently doing well. Meanwhile, Alexion is working on expanding the drug’s label to include additional indications, which if approved, can boost further sales growth. It has two other drugs for rare diseases called Strensiq and Kanuma, which are emerging as growth drivers. Alexion also has a robust pipeline of several candidates under development including Soliris follow-up candidate, ALXN1210.Roche, Pfizer, or Novartis may be interested in buying Alexion. The market cap of Alexion is more than $25 billion.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

51,ALXN,"It has been more than a month since the last earnings report for Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 14.6% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Alexion Tops Earnings, Lags Sales, Ups 2017 ViewAlexion posted third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $1.44 per share which was higher than the year ago earnings of $1.23 by 17.1%. Earnings also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.13. Strong product revenues drove the bottom-line in the quarter.Revenues rose 8% year over year to $859 million, but slightly missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $869 million. Revenues were driven by increased sales of Soliris, Strensiq and Kanuma. However, sales declined sequentially by 5.8% as the order were shifted from the third to the second quarter of 2017 thus impacting the third quarter sales. The company benefitted by favorable timing of orders in the preceding quarter directly impacted sales growth in the third quarter. Negative impact of currency headwind on the top line was less than 1% ($5 million).Revenue in DetailSoliris (paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS)) sales were up 4% to $756 million during the quarter driven by strong volume growth. While Strensiq (hypophosphatasia (HPP)) contributed $87 million to revenues, up 44% year over year, Kanuma (lysosomal acid lipase deficiency (LAL-D)) contributed $16 million (up 79%) to quarterly revenues.Cost SummaryResearch and Development (R&D) expenses (excluding stock based compensation) were $175 million, down 2.2% year over year.Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses (excluding stock based compensation) were $230 million, up 14.4% year over year.2017 GuidanceAlexion increased] earnings guidance for 2017. The company expects adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.50 to $5.65 up from its previous expectation of $5.40 to $5.55.Meanwhile, the company also raised the lower end of the total revenue guidance, It projects revenues to be in the range of $3.475 to $3.525 billion versus  prior expectation of $3.45 to $3.53 billion. In fact, revenue guidance for Soliris was also tightened to a range of $3.09-$3.13 billion from the previous expectation of $3.07-$3.13 billion.Pipeline UpdateIn October 2017, Alexion received FDA approval for label expansion of Soliris to treat patients with refractory generalized myasthenia in adults who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AchR) antibody-positive. Further, the European Commission also approved the drug for the same indication in Augsust 2017. The label expansion should help the company in boosting the revenues.In August 2017, the company also strengthened its patent portfolio with three new United States’ patents for Soliris that extend protection into 2027.Currently, Alexion is evaluating Soliris in a couple of other phase III studies – PREVENT, for the treatment of relapsing neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder. The company completed enrollment in the study earlier this year and will report data in mid 2018.The company also advanced the ALXN1210 clinical development programs which is being evaluated in phase III studies for the treatment of PNH and aHUS in the third quarter.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Fresh estimates followed a downward path over the past two months. In the past month, the consensus estimate has shifted lower by 12% due to these changes.Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and Consensus  Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and Consensus | Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. QuoteVGM ScoresCurrently, Alexion's stock has an average Growth Score of C, however its Momentum is doing a bit better with a B. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Based on our scores, the stock is more suitable for momentum investors than those looking for value and growth.OutlookThe stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We are expecting an inline return from the stock in the next few months.

52,ALXN,"The biotech industry turned around this year after the drug pricing issue crippled its performance last year.It had a number of things going in its favor. Strong quarterly results, new product sales ramp up with rising demand, successful innovation and product line expansion, strong clinical study results, more frequent FDA approvals and continued strong performance from legacy products played a pivotal role in bringing the sector on track this year.However, after rising 15.4% in the first nine months of the year (January-September), the Medical-Biotech /Genetics industry has declined 13.4% so far in the fourth quarter (Oct 1 - to date). Both macro and industry specific factors resulted in the sudden downfall.Uncertain Macro PictureA big component of this sell-off is the confusion over the passing of the tax reform. The reform aims to bring down corporate tax to stimulate economic as well as employment growth.The proposed tax reforms, if approved, will leave more cash in the hands of biotech companies. The cash can be invested for mergers/acquisitions, which have been relatively fewer this year compared with the last. It goes without saying that significant uncertainty regarding the timely passing of the U.S. tax reform has cast a shadow over the future of the biotech sector.In October, President Trump once again criticized high drug prices. This came at a time when investors had started to expect that Trump's action on drug prices may not be as onerous as previously feared, sending health-care stocks lower.Tepid Q3 ResultsComing to some industry specific factors, most big biotechs beat estimates for earnings and sales in Q3. However, shares of most of these companies declined post earnings release for various reasons.Although Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) topped both earnings and revenue estimates in the third quarter, it witnessed continued decline in sales of its HCV drugs — Harvoni and Sovaldi — as a result of competitive and pricing pressure.Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) also beat expectations for both earnings and sales in Q3 and raised its earnings guidance for 2017. However sales declined year over year, which resulted in share price decline post the earnings call. Sales of its PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha, were also disappointing.Celgene’s (CELG  -  Free Report) shares plunged following the release of third-quarter results. Although Celgene’s earnings topped estimates, revenues fell short. Moreover, the company lowered its 2017 outlook for Otezla sales as well as its total revenue and earnings outlook for 2020.Although Biogen’s (BIIB  -  Free Report) third-quarter results were better than expected, shares were down 3.9% on concerns regarding the company’s multiple sclerosis franchise sales as well as U.S. sales of its recently launched spinal muscular atrophy (“SMA”) treatment, Spinraza.Alexion (ALXN  -  Free Report) topped earnings estimates but missed on revenues in the third quarter.Vertex (VRTX  -  Free Report) and AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) were the only two outperformers in Q3.ConclusionWe believe that the biotech space should be back on track if there is more certainty regarding the timing of the tax reforms. This is because the fundamentals of the sector remain strong. Meanwhile, with the Q3 earnings season now behind us, stocks should start picking up. Positive data from key clinical studies can drive the sector up as share price of biotechs is correlated to success in key studies. The major biotech players need an infusion of new growth drivers in their pipeline/product portfolios — either from internal development or from buying assets from outside. Strategic deals signed by these biotechs can also push the stocks higher.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

53,ALXN,"Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s (ACHN  -  Free Report) shares fell almost 7.9% in after-market trading on Tuesday, following the announcement that Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) will sell its stake in the company.We remind investors that J&J had terminated the global license and collaboration agreement with Achillion for developing hepatitis C treatments earlier in September. The decision was taken by J&J as part of its strategy to focus on areas of greatest unmet medical need.The termination of the agreement is a major setback for Achillion, as it has no marketed drug and was dependent on J&J for funds. The company has lost out on future revenues in the form of milestone payments.Achillion’s shares are down 10.7% so far this year, underperforming the industry which remained flat in that period.In a separate press release, Achillion also announced promising preliminary data from group 1 of a phase II study on its factor D inhibitor, ACH-4471, in renal diseases. The candidate demonstrated potential in treating C3 glomerulopathy (C3G), a serious renal disease. The study is evaluating the candidate in patients with C3G or immune complex-mediated membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (IC-MPGN).The phase II study is evaluating the candidate in two separate groups in patients with C3G or IC-MPGN. Group 1 evaluated a dose of 100 mg of ACH-4471 thrice daily for 14 days in two patients. Along with proteinuria, the study also measured the ratio of C3 fragments to intact C3 in plasma, which also decreased rapidly compared to baseline during the course of the study. Higher C3 fragments are believed to be responsible for kidney damage and loss of function seen in this disease over time.Presently, no FDA-approved therapies are available to treat C3G. However, the promise shown by the candidate is a boost for the company as it indicates a potential treatment under development.Achillion is currently selecting patients for enrollment in group 2 of the study.Moreover, the company has plans to initiate two separate phase II studies on ACH-4471 to evaluate it in C3G / IC-MPGN patients over six and twelve months during the first half of 2018.Other than C3G and IC-MPGN, Achillion is also developing ACH-4471 in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (“PNH”), atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, and dry age-related macular degeneration.In August 2017, the company had announced positive data from a phase II study in PNH patients. Achillion has plans to initiate another phase II study on ACH-4471 to evaluate the candidate in combination with Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s (ALXN  -  Free Report) Soliris for potential long-term treatment in PNH patients already being treated with Soliris.Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

56,ALXN,"Shares of Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report) gained 3.38% after the company reported positive data on candidate, ALXN1210 from a pivotal phase III study.Alexion’s shares have declined 11.7% in the last six months, worse than the industry’s loss of 8.8%. This phase III randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multinational, and multicenter study evaluated the efficacy and safety of ALXN1210 compared to Alexion’s lead drug Soliris administered by intravenous (IV) infusion to adult patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) who are naïve to complement inhibitor treatment.The study was designed to evaluate the non-inferiority of ALXN1210 compared to Soliris. ALXN1210 demonstrated non-inferiority to Soliris in complement inhibitor treatment-naïve patients with PNH based on the co-primary endpoints of transfusion avoidance and normalization of lactate dehydrogenase (“LDH”) levels.In addition, the study also demonstrated non-inferiority on all four key secondary endpoints — percentage change from baseline in LDH levels, change from baseline in quality of life as assessed by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (“FACIT”) — Fatigue scale, proportion of patients with breakthrough hemolysis, and proportion of patients with stabilized hemoglobin levels.ALXN1210 was well tolerated with a safety profile that is consistent with that seen for Soliris. The candidate was then evaluated for superiority testing as non-inferiority was achieved across both co-primary and all four key secondary endpoints. While ALXN1210 did not achieve superiority, a numeric trend in favor of ALXN1210 was observed for breakthrough hemolysis for Soliris with a p-value of 0.074. The data also showed that ALXN1210 provides immediate and complete inhibition of the complement C5 protein that is sustained over the entire 8 week dosing interval.The positive results should support ALXN1210 as the new standard of care for patients with PNH. Alexion plans to submit ALXN1210 in PNH in the United States, EU, and Japan in the second half of 2018.In addition to PNH, ALXN1210 is also being evaluated for atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), and anti-acetylcholine receptor (AchR) antibody-positive myasthenia gravis (MG).  ALXN210 is also being evaluated in a phase III study in complement inhibitor-naïve patients with aHUS, administered intravenously every eight weeks.The company also plans to initiate a single, pharmacokinetics-based phase III study of ALXN1210 delivered subcutaneously once per week as a potential treatment for patients with PNH and aHUS. Alexion also plans to initiate the development of ALXN1210 as a potential treatment for patients with generalized MG (gMG) and patients with immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN).The candidate has also received Orphan Drug Designation (for the treatment of patients with PNH in the United States and EU, and for the subcutaneous treatment of patients with aHUS in the United States.Alexion’s blockbuster drug, Soliris, continues to perform well and the FDA approval of the drug for generalized myasthenia gravis will further boost sales. However, the company relies heavily on Soliris for growth and sales of Soliris will be impacted by ramp of ALXN1210 trials.The successful development and commercialization of ALXN1210 will reduce the company’s dependence on Soliris and extend the patent of the PNH franchise as well.Zacks Rank & Key picksAlexion currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A few better-ranked stocks from the same space are Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN  -  Free Report) Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND  -  Free Report) and Enanta Pharma (ENTA  -  Free Report).

Earnings also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.13. Strong product revenues drove the bottom-line in the quarter.Revenues rose 8% year over year to $859 million, but slightly missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $869 million. Revenues were driven by increased sales of Soliris, Strensiq and Kanuma. However, sales declined sequentially by 5.8% as the order were shifted from the third to the second quarter of 2017 thus impacting the third quarter sales. The company benefitted by favorable timing of orders in the preceding quarter directly impacted sales growth in the third quarter. Negative impact of currency headwind on the top line was less than 1% ($5 million).So far this year, Alexion’s share price has increased 7.9%, outperforming the industry’s gain of 6.9%. Revenue in DetailSoliris (paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS)) sales were up 4% to $756 million during the quarter driven by strong volume growth. While Strensiq (hypophosphatasia (HPP)) contributed $87 million to revenues, up 44% year over year, Kanuma (lysosomal acid lipase deficiency (LAL-D)) contributed $16 million (up 79%) to quarterly revenues.Cost SummaryResearch and Development (R&D) expenses (excluding stock based compensation) were $175 million, down 2.2% year over year.Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses (excluding stock based compensation) were $230 million, up 14.4% year over year.2017 GuidanceAlexion increased] earnings guidance for 2017.

Further, the European Commission also approved the drug for the same indication in Augsust 2017. The label expansion should help the company in boosting the revenues.In August 2017, the company also strengthened its patent portfolio with three new United States’ patents for Soliris that extend protection into 2027.Currently, Alexion is evaluating Soliris in a couple of other phase III studies – PREVENT, for the treatment of relapsing neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder. The company completed enrollment in the study earlier this year and will report data in mid 2018.The company also advanced the ALXN1210 clinical development programs which is being evaluated in phase III studies for the treatment of PNH and aHUS in the third quarter.Our TakeAlexion exceeded earnings estimates but missed sales estimates in the third quarter. The company also raised its earnings guidance. Going forward, we expect growth at Alexion to continue being driven by Soliris.In the meantime, other new products – Strensiq and Kanuma – are doing well and should boost revenues.We are also impressed by Alexion’s efforts to develop its pipeline, especially the label expansion efforts for Soliris and the recent approval of Soliris to treat patients with refractory generalized myasthenia in both the United States and Europe.

59,ALXN,"The third-quarter earnings season is off to a strong start.  The results of the companies that have reported numbers show that earnings and revenue growth pace is accelerating from the first two quarters. In particular, revenue growth has shown significant momentum as evident from the proportion of positive revenue surprises. Total earnings for the S&P 500 index for the third quarter are expected to be up 3% on 4.9% higher revenues.As of Oct 20, 2017, 87 S&P 500 companies which account for 24.7% of index’s total market capitalization have reported results. Results reveal that earnings for these companies are up 9.4% from the year-ago quarter on a 7.3% increase in revenues. Among these, 71.3% beat earnings estimates while 70.1% beat revenue estimates.Medical Sector PerformanceThe Medical sector has performed relatively well till date and this quarter is not going to be any different as per estimates. Of the 5.4% companies that have reported so far, 66.7% beat on revenues while all the companies surpassed earnings expectations. Going forward, the sector is expected to record year-over-year growth of 4.8% in revenues and 1.9% in earnings in Q3.The bellwether of the sector, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected third-quarter 2017 results and raised its outlook. Swiss giant Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) too beat on both earnings and sales on the back of new drugs like Cosentyx and Entresto. Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) also reported better-than-expected results in the third quarter.Here we have four major biotech giants that are set to report third-quarter results on Oct 26. Let's see how things are shaping up for these:Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) is expected to beat expectations when it reports after the market closes. Per the Zacks model a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Gilead’s track record is pretty mixed, with the company beating estimates in two of the last four and missing in two. Last quarter, the company beat expectations by 17.4%. Overall, the company recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 6.4%. Gilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.57%. The combination of Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Strong HIV performance and other antiviral product sales are being driven by continued uptake of tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) based products — Genvoya, Descovy and Odefsey. We expect the trend to continue in the third quarter as well. Genvoya has already become the most prescribed regimen for both treatment-naïve and switch patients since its launch. This should drive the non-HCV product sales.  The TAF-based regimens now represent 51% of total Gilead HIV prescription volume following the launch of Genvoya and Odefsey and Descovy in 2016. Specifically, Genvoya is now the company’s bestselling HIV product with a treatment-naïve patient share of 41%. The Zacks Consensus estimate for Genvoya stands at $919 million. Strong uptake for Truvada for use in the pre-exposure prophylaxis setting is also expected to boost sales.  (Read more: Is Gilead Poised for a Beat This Earnings Season?)Gilead Sciences, Inc.

Meanwhile, Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) CAR T therapy gained earlier-than-expected FDA approval. Alexion (ALXN  -  Free Report) also got a regulatory boost with the FDA expanding the label of the company’s flagship product, Soliris.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesBiogen Beats on All Fronts: Although Biogen’s third quarter results were better than expected with the company surpassing both earnings and revenue expectations, shares were down 3.9% on concerns regarding the company’s multiple sclerosis franchise sales as well as U.S. sales of its recently launched spinal muscular atrophy (“SMA”) treatment, Spinraza. Spinraza U.S. sales were $198 million in the third quarter, more or less flat from second quarter sales of $195 million though the company reported a 75% increase in the number of patients on therapy in the United States compared to the end of the second quarter. However, second quarter sales included inventory buildup of $30 million (Read more: Biogen Tops Q3 Earnings & Sales, Spinraza Sales Up).Biogen has gained 11.3% year to date, outperforming the industry’s 8.2% rally.Gilead CAR T Therapy Yescarta Approved: Gilead’s Yescarta, which became a part of the company’s portfolio following the $11.9 billion Kite Pharma acquisition, gained FDA approval for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy. This makes Yescarta the first chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR T) therapy to gain approval for use in this patient population.Yescarta is the second gene therapy to gain approval in the United States, the first being Novartis’s Kymriah. Both treatments come with a Boxed Warning regarding the risks of cytokine release syndrome (“CRS”) and neurologic toxicities.Yescarta’s approval is a major boost for Gilead which is currently facing declining sales from its hepatitis C virus (“HCV”) franchise. According to information provided by the company, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (“NHL”) - about 7,500 patients with refractory DLBCL are eligible for CAR T therapy every year. Yescarta represents a new treatment option for these patients who have run out of treatment options and face a poor prognosis. Yescarta will be launched with a list price of $373,000 in the United States and is currently under review in the EU where a response is expected in the first half of 2018 (Read more: Gilead CAR-T Therapy Yescarta Clinches FDA Approval).Gilead also announced phase II results on its investigational treatment for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (""NASH""). The company said that the higher dose (20 mg) of GS-0976, an oral ACC inhibitor, achieved significant reductions in buildup of fat in the liver and a noninvasive marker of fibrosis (TIMP-1) compared to placebo. However, statistical significance was not achieved for other parameters like liver stiffness (by FibroScan and MRE), serum ALT and PIII-NP, a serum marker of fibrogenesis. Meanwhile, differences between the lower dose (5 mg) of GS-0976 and placebo were not statistically significant.Celgene Hit by Crohn’s Disease Study Discontinuation: Celgene’s (CELG  -  Free Report) shares were down 10.8% on news that the company will be discontinuing studies (phase III REVOLVE study and the extension study (SUSTAIN)) being conducted with its investigational Crohn’s disease drug, GED-0301 (mongersen). The decision was based on a recommendation from the Data Monitoring Committee in October following an interim futility analysis. No meaningful safety imbalances were observed in the analysis.Celgene also said that it will wait to review the full dataset from the phase II ulcerative colitis study on GED-0301 before deciding the path forward.

61,ALXN,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, Alexion’s track record is excellent as it has consistently beaten expectations in the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 11.12% over the trailing four quarters.Moreover, a Alexion’s shares have outperformed the industry year to date. The stock has been up 13.7% compared with the industry’s gain of 9.1%.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model shows that Alexion is likely to beat earnings in the to-be-reported quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – which have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings.Zacks ESP: Alexion has an Earnings ESP of +0.44% as the Most Accurate estimate is $1.34 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.33. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Alexion’s Zacks Rank #3, when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors Likely to Impact Q3 ResultsAlexion’s blockbuster drug, Soliris, continues to perform well. Alexion continues to identify and treat a consistently high number of new patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) with Soliris, across its 50-country operating platform.In order to further increase the commercial potential of the drug, Alexion is also working on expanding Soliris’ label into additional indications. Label expansion into additional indications would give Soliris access to a higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug significantly.In August 2017, the European Commission expanded the indication for Soliris to include the treatment of refractory generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in adults who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody-positive. In October, the FDA approved Soliris for the same. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Soliris indicates the drug sales to increase 4.9% from the year-ago quarter to $765 million.Meanwhile, Strensiq continues to perform well with revenues benefiting from a growing number of patients (both children as well as adults with pediatric onset disease) owing to hypophosphatasia (HPP) disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives. Going forward,  the company expects Strensiq to be a strong additional growth driver. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Strensiq indicates the drug sales to increase about 41% from the year-ago quarter to $86 million.Furthermore, the company announced some restructuring initiatives. In this context, Alexion plans to focus on rare diseases businesses in core areas of hematology, nephrology, neurology and metabolic disorders to enhance productivity.Notably, the company is expected to reduce spending and headcount associated with the previously announced de-prioritized pipeline programs as well as optimizing additional R&D expenses. Alexion also deprioritized ALXN1101 (cPMP replacement therapy) and ALXN6000 (samalizumab) as well as partnerships with Moderna Therapeutics, Blueprint Medicines and Arbutus Biopharma.Consequently, the company will reduce its global workforce by approximately 20% and expects that the increased financial flexibility will allow it to reinvest approximately $100 million annually into R&D.While, Alexion anticipates pre-tax savings of approximately $250 million by 2019, the total pre-tax restructuring and related expenses associated with the plan will be in the range of $340- $440 million. The company targets non-GAAP operating margin of 50% by the same year. Approximately 50% of the restructuring and related expenses will result in cash outlays while the same of approximately $240 million to $300 million are expected to be recorded in 2017.In the meantime, the company’s efforts to develop its pipeline are impressive, particularly in case of ALXN1210. Currently, it is evaluating ALXN1210 (a longer-acting anti-C5 antibody that inhibits terminal complement) in phase III studies for both PNH and aHUS.In fact, the company initiated a phase III PNH switch study of ALXN1210 administered intravenously every eight weeks compared to patients currently treated with Soliris. Therefore, we expect investors to focus on updates from ALXN1210 as the successful development and commercialization of the drug will boost growth prospects.However, Soliris’ quarter-to-quarter revenue growth will be impacted by the enrollment ramp-up of trials on ALXN1210 (by $70 million–$110 million), particularly in the second half of 2017.   Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

62,ALXN,"Investors in Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Oct 27th 2017 $137.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Alexion Pharmaceuticals, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Alexion Pharmaceuticals is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry that ranks in the Top 40% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analyst has increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one has dropped it. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.34 per share to $1.33 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Alexion Pharmaceuticals right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

63,ALXN,"BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (BMRN  -  Free Report) will report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, after the market closes. BioMarin delivered a positive earnings surprise of 168.18% in the last quarter.BioMarin’s earnings track record has been strong, with the company beating estimates in each of the past four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 99.93%.BioMarin’s shares are up 5.9% so far this year. This compares unfavorably with 10.2% increase registered by the industry during this period.Let’s see how things are shaping up for the company this quarter.Factors at PlayKey orphan disease drugs, Vimizim and Kuvan, which have been driving BioMarin’s top line for some time now, are likely to maintain the trend this quarter too. Robust patient growth and penetration are likely to propel sales of the drugs. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Vimizim and Kuvan for the third quarter is $103 million and $102 million, respectively.However, Naglazyme and Vimzin revenues may vary on a quarterly basis due to inconsistent ordering patterns from some countries. Last week, at its R&D day, the company said that a slowdown in Federal purchasing orders in Brazil will hurt Naglazyme and Vimizim product revenues in the third quarter. Moreover, the company said that if the slowdown continues in the fourth quarter, it will only be able to meet the lower end of the total product revenue guidance ($1.25 billion and $1.3 billion, not including a $35 million milestone payment from Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. [(SRPT  -  Free Report)]) for 2017. On the other hand, if orders in Brazil are as expected, it will meet the mid-point of the guidance. Nevertheless, the drugs continue to witness steady patient growth and we expect the trend to continue this quarter.We expect management to discuss how the pipeline is progressing at the conference call. Brineura was approved in both the U.S. and EU this year for the treatment of children with CLN2 disease – a form of Batten disease. Though Brineura generated sales of only $0.3 million in the second quarter, we expect higher sales this quarter.At the Q3 investor call, we also expect management to comment on Brineura’s early launch progress and also on the launch preparation for pegvaliase. Pegvaliase, developed for treating phenylketonuria (PKU), is under review in the United States with the FDA expected to give its decision in the first half of next year.Importantly, at the Q2 call, the company had said that due to the ramp up of BMN 270 and vosoritide programs, R&D spending is expected to be higher in the third and the fourth quarters. This will result in lower adjusted net income in these quarters compared to the first and second.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that BioMarin is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Its Earnings ESP is -9.65% as the Most Accurate estimate stands at a loss of 14 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 13 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: BioMarin’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderBioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.

64,ALXN,"Biotech major Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) will report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25 after the market closes. Amgen delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.83% in the last quarter.Amgen shares are up 25.9% so far this year. This compares favorably with the 12.1% increase registered by the industry during this period.Amgen’s performance has been pretty impressive, with the company reporting positive surprises consistently. The average earnings beat over the last four quarters is 5.85%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for the company this quarter.Factors at PlayAmgen’s newer products like Prolia, Xgeva, Kyprolis, and Blincyto, should continue to perform well backed by higher demand, thus making up for lower sales of mature brands like Enbrel, Epogen, Neulasta and Neupogen due to competitive pressure.Neulasta demand is being hurt due to competition from PD-1s and other new cancer therapiesNeupogen sales are also being hurt by biosimilar competition in the United States mainly from Zarxio, Sandoz’s biosimilar version of Neupogen, which was launched in September 2015.Neulasta and Neupogen sales are expected to be hurt by competitive dynamics in the third and fourth quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Neulasta and Neupogen are $1.10 billion and $133 million, respectively for the third quarter/However, management mentioned on the Q2 call that, “no new U.S. biosimilar competition” is expected this year. This suggests that Neulasta and Epogen may not start facing any biosimilar competition this year, contrary to previous expectations.Three companies - Mylan/Biocon, Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report), and Coherus - looking to launch generic versions of Neulasta and one company looking to launch generic version of Epogen have received complete response letter from the FDA for their respective applications, which can delay their launch.The bottom line will continue to be driven by the company’s overall cost-cutting efforts and share buyback. The company’s restructuring plan will likely make it leaner and more cost efficient.Investor focus will remain on the performance of the company’s PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha. Uptake of Repatha, which gained FDA approval in August 2015, has not been very encouraging so far due to pricing and re-imbursement issues/payer restrictions. However, in the second quarter, Repatha revenues improved sequentially driven by higher demand. Management said that the presentation of the outcomes study data (FOURIER) had a positive impact on Repatha share trends. It remains to be seen if the positive trends continue in the third quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Amgen is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

65,ALXN,"With biotech sector earnings season round the corner, there were not too many updates this week. Important news this week include priority review for Exelixis’s (EXEL  -  Free Report) label expansion plans for Cabometyx and a positive FDA panel outcome for Spark Therapeutics’s (ONCE  -  Free Report) Luxturna.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesExelixis Up on Priority Review from FDA: Exelixis’s shares shot up 17.2% on news that the FDA has granted priority review to the company’s regulatory application for the label expansion of Cabometyx. The company is looking to get Cabometyx approved for use in treatment-naïve advanced renal cell cancer patients. With the FDA granting priority review, a response should be out on Feb 15, 2018.Cabometyx is currently approved for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma who have received prior anti-angiogenic therapy. According to the American Cancer Society, kidney cancer is among the top ten most commonly diagnosed forms of cancer among both men and women in the United States.The five-year survival rate for patients with advanced or late-stage metastatic renal cell carcinoma is only 12%. According to information provided by the company in its press release, about 14,000 patients in the United States need first-line treatment for advanced kidney cancer every year (Read more: FDA Grants Priority Review for Exelixis' RCC Drug Cabometyx).Cabometyx is being evaluated for other types of cancer as well. In addition to announcing the priority review status, Exelixis presented positive late-stage data on Cabometyx for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (“HCC”), an aggressive form of advanced liver cancer. The study achieved its primary endpoint of overall survival and the company intends to submit a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) in the first quarter of 2018. Cabometyx has orphan drug status in the United States for this indication.Spark’s Luxturna Gets Full FDA Panel Support: Spark Therapeutics got a boost with the FDA’s advisory panel unanimously supporting the company’s investigational treatment for use in patients with biallelic RPE65-mediated inherited retinal disease.Timely approval would make Luxturna the first pharmacologic treatment for an inherited retinal disease (“IRD”) as well as the first gene therapy for a genetic disease in the United States.The gene therapy company should get to know about the approval status of the treatment by Jan 12, 2018. Luxturna, which is under priority review, has orphan drug, breakthrough therapy and rare pediatric disease designations in the United States. The gene therapy is under review in the EU as well.Regeneron’s Dupixent Tops in Allergic Inflammatory Disease Study: Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN  -  Free Report) and partner Sanofi announced positive phase II results on Dupixent (dupilumab) in adults with active moderate-to-severe eosinophilic esophagitis, a chronic, allergic inflammatory disease. Patients receiving Dupixent weekly reported a significant improvement in the ability to swallow versus placebo (Read more: Sanofi/Regeneron's Dupixent Succeeds in Phase II Study). The market could be huge for Dupixent if it gains timely approval given the lack of any FDA-approved treatments. Dupixent has orphan drug status in the United States for this indication.Dupixent, which has blockbuster potential, is currently approved for eczema and is being evaluated for additional indications apart from eosinophilic esophagitis. In fact, last month, the companies had announced positive top-line data from a late-stage study on Dupixent for uncontrolled persistent asthma.  Regeneron and Sanofi are also collaborating with Aimmune Therapeutics, a clinical-stage company focused on the development of treatments for potentially life-threatening food allergies. Under the clinical collaboration, Aimmune’s AR101 will be evaluated with adjunctive Dupixent in peanut-allergic patients in a mid-stage study that is scheduled to commence next year. The study will be sponsored by Regeneron while Aimmune will provide clinical supply of AR101 and food challenge materials.Regeneron has gained 20.6% year to date, outperforming the industry’s 12.5% rally.Ionis to get $10M Milestone Payment from Biogen on Study Initiation: Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS  -  Free Report) is set to receive a $10 million milestone payment from partner Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) related to the initiation of a phase I/IIa study on IONIS-MAPTRx in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (“AD”). Biogen has an option for the development and commercialization of the antisense drug. The companies already have a partnered drug, Spinraza (spinal muscular atrophy) on the market and are collaborating for other drugs for diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other neurodegenerative diseases.Ionis is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Immune Design Pivotal Study Design gets Positive FDA Feedback: The FDA has given its nod to Immune Design’s (IMDZ  -  Free Report) phase III clinical study design for CMB305 in patients with synovial sarcoma. The pivotal study, which will evaluate the cancer vaccine as a monotherapy compared to placebo, is scheduled to commence in mid-2018. While progression free survival (""PFS"") followed by overall survival (""OS"") are the co-primary endpoints, the FDA said that it could support full approval if the PFS endpoint is met (Read more: Immune Design's Sarcoma Candidate to Enter Phase III in 2018).PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NASDAQ Biotechnology Index slipped 0.5% over the last five trading sessions. Stocks were hit earlier this week by reports of President Trump criticizing high drug prices again. Among major biotech stocks, Biogen was up 3.5% with a couple of analyst upgrades boosting the stock. Regeneron was down 4% during this period. Over the last six months, Vertex was up 35.1% (See the last biotech stock roundup here: Amgen's Imlygic Data Promising, Regeneron Scores Win in PCSK9 Lawsuit).What's Next in the Biotech World?Watch out for third quarter earnings results from companies like Amgen, Biogen and Vertex. Alexion (ALXN  -  Free Report) should also get a response from the FDA regarding the label expansion of its flagship product, Soliris (eculizumab), for refractory generalized myasthenia gravis. The agency is expected to give a response by October 23.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

66,ALXN,"The FDA, which approved 22 novel drugs last year, has given its approval to 34 drugs so far in 2017 including three in September. Key approvals this year include Novartis’s Kymriah (the first gene therapy in the United States), Lilly’s Verzenio (advanced or metastatic breast cancer), Gilead’s Vosevi (hepatitis C virus), Puma’s Nerlynx (to reduce the risk of breast cancer returning), J&J’s Tremfya (moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis), Regeneron/Sanofi’s Kevzara (rheumatoid arthritis), Roche’s multiple sclerosis treatment, Ocrevus, Regeneron and Sanofi’s eczema treatment, Dupixent, Tesaro’s PARP inhibitor, Zejula, and BioMarin’s Brineura (treatment of a specific form of Batten disease) among others. Quite a few of these drugs have blockbuster potential.With the drug development process being lengthy and time-consuming and requiring the utilization of a lot of funds and resources, key pipeline events including data readouts and regulatory updates are of paramount importance and could act as major catalysts. Here is a look at a few important regulatory events scheduled for the month of October.Will Flexion Gain Approval for its First Drug?Specialty pharma company, Flexion Therapeutics (FLXN  -  Free Report) is awaiting FDA approval of its first product, Zilretta. The company, which is focused on the development and commercialization of novel, local therapies for the treatment of patients with musculoskeletal conditions, beginning with osteoarthritis (“OA”), expects a decision from the agency on Oct 6, 2017. Flexion is looking to get Zilretta approved for the treatment of OA related knee pain. Zilretta, a non-opioid, could provide OA patients with a new and alternative treatment option on approval. Flexion already has a sales leadership team in place and said that the pre-approval inspection of the Patheon manufacturing facility was concluded without any observations.Flexion stock has gained 27.1% year to date, substantially outperforming the 3.6% rally of the industry it belongs to.Alexion’s Soliris Label to be Expanded Again?Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN  -  Free Report) is working on expanding the label of its flagship product, Soliris (eculizumab). Soliris, currently approved in the United States for serious ultra-rare disorders like paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (“PNH”) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), brought in sales of $1.6 billion in the first half of the year. Alexion has a key catalyst coming up with a decision from the FDA expected by Oct 23, 2017 regarding the approvability of Soliris for refractory generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG). EU approval for this indication came in August making it the first and only complement-based therapy approved for an ultra-rare subset of gMG. The gMG indication represents incremental growth opportunity for Soliris.Alexion’s shares are up 14.7% year to date, compared to the industry’s 16.2% rally. Alexion is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.CRL Likely for PTC’s TranslarnaPTC Therapeutics (PTCT  -  Free Report) is expecting a decision from the FDA regarding the approval status of Translarna for the treatment of nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy (nmDMD). While approved in the EU, Translarna is yet to gain approval in the United States. The company had initially filed a new drug application (“NDA”) in the United States in December 2015. However, in February 2016, the FDA issued a refusal to file (“RTF”) letter saying that the NDA was not sufficiently complete to allow a substantive review. The company was told that both the phase IIb and phase III ACT DMD studies were negative and did not provide sufficient evidence of effectiveness and adequate information about the abuse potential of Translarna. PTC filed a NDA in the first quarter of 2017 and was assigned an FDA action date of Oct 24, 2017.However, chances of gaining approval seem low considering Translarna failed to gain the support of an FDA advisory panel last week. While the panel found the drug to be effective, they found the submitted data inconclusive and said that more data would be needed to support efficacy. Given this situation, we believe the FDA will issue a complete response letter (“CRL”) and ask for additional data.PTC’s shares are up 83.4% year to date, compared to the industry’s 3.6% rally.Apart from the above three companies, quite a few other companies are awaiting decisions from the FDA. Industry bellwether, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) is seeking FDA approval for a 10mg dose of Xarelto for reducing the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE). With the FDA granting priority review, a response should be out on Oct 28, 2017.Cancer-focused company, TESARO (TSRO  -  Free Report) is expecting a decision from the FDA for its intravenous (“IV”) formulation of rolapitant on Oct 25, 2017. The company had received a CRL earlier this year for the IV formulation.Specialty pharma company, AcelRx Pharmaceuticals (ACRX  -  Free Report) expects a response from the FDA regarding its NDA for Dsuvia (sufentanil sublingual tablet, 30 mcg) on Oct 12, 2017. Dsuvia is under review for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain in medically supervised settings.Meanwhile, Aerie Pharmaceuticals’s (AERI  -  Free Report) Rhopressa will be evaluated by an FDA advisory panel for the treatment of patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension on Oct 13, 2017.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

67,ALXN,"Mallinckrodt plc (MNK  -  Free Report) announced that it has acquired privately-held InfaCare Pharmaceutical Corporation.This specialty pharmaceutical company focuses on the development and commercialization of proprietary pharmaceuticals for neonatal and pediatric patients.InfaCare's product candidate, stannsoporfin, is expected to become the first and only pharmacologic option for the treatment of neonates for severe hyperbilirubinemia, or severe jaundice if and when approved.The company made an upfront payment of $80 million. Mallinckrodt is also required to pay up to $345 million as milestone payments. The acquisition to be dilutive to the bottom line by 15 cents to 20 cents for 2017 and modestly higher in 2018.Per estimates, the total number of term births is estimated at 3.7 million per year and, of those, approximately 750,000 infants are treated for jaundice. Among these, a large number are unresponsive to phototherapy. Hence, there is an unmet need for treatment of these infants. The combined potential patient treatments required annually in the United States for severe jaundice is approximately 70,000 to 125,000.We note that Mallinckrodt is currently focused on reshaping its product portfolio through strategic acquisitions and non-core asset divestitures to transform the portfolio and become a high-performing specialty pharmaceutical company.The acquisition will diversify its pediatric pipeline and strengthen the brands business.The company’s generic segment continues to face weakness as various product categories are witnessing stiff competition, which is hurting both volumes and prices. The company expects double-digit declines in revenues from this segment. In addition, continued expected weakness in this segment will adversely impact gross profit margins also. The company sold its Nuclear Imaging business due to persistent challenging conditions. The company also sold its Intrathecal Therapy business to focus on key areas. While Acthar sales continue to be strong on the back of increased formulary positions and access for appropriate patients in both the commercial and public environments, sales of Therakos is expected to decline.Investors interested in the healthcare sector can consider stocks stocks like include Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

68,ALXN,"Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ICPT  -  Free Report) provided a statement on the recent safety and dosing issues for lead drug Ocaliva.Ocaliva was approved in the United States in May 2016 (and subsequently in the European Union and Canada) for the treatment of patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) with an inadequate response to or intolerant to the standard of care, UDCA.The dose recommended for earlier stage PBC patients with no or mild hepatic impairment was 5 mg once daily, which was increased after three months to 10 mg once daily based on tolerability and treatment response. On the other hand, in late stage patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh B or C cirrhosis), recommended dosing starts at 5 mg once weekly, with the possibility to gradually increase to a maximum of 10 mg twice weekly.However, there have been a few safety issues. Deaths have been reported in PBC patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh B or C cirrhosis).Last week, shares of Intercept plunged after the FDA warned regarding the safety issues related with incorrect dosing.  The FDA reported 19 deaths due to Ocaliva and stated that the drug may also affect the liver.However, Intercept conducted an analysis and concluded that that these patients were prescribed once daily doses of Ocaliva, which is seven times higher than the recommended weekly dose. The analysis was conducted in consultation with the FDA. The company concluded that deaths occurred due to the overdosing of the drug.Consequently, Intercept issued the Dear Healthcare Provider (DHCP) letter. Thereafter, the FDA issued their own safety communication to reinforce recommended label dosing. Intercept is also working with the FDA on further updates to Ocaliva’s label for safety purposes.Nevertheless, the news gave a major blow to investors as Ocaliva is the company’s only approved drug and such side-effects will limit the sales potential.Intercept is evaluating Ocaliva for other indications primary sclerosing cholangitis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. We note that Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) and Gilead Sciences, Inc.

(INFI  -  Free Report) announced that it has expanded its existing clinical collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report) for evaluating IPI-549 in combination with  latter’s checkpoint inhibitor Opdivo. The collaboration will include patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), who have not been previously exposed to anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy.Very few patients with triple negative breast cancer respond to checkpoint inhibitors alone and so they are left with very limited therapeutic options. Thus expanding the collaboration to include patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), who have not been previously exposed to anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy. This, in turn, will enable Infinity to test whether IPI-549 in combination with Opdivo can increase the number of patients who respond to checkpoint inhibition.Markedly, IPI-549 is the lead pipeline candidate of Infinity Pharmaceuticals and is being evaluated in a phase I/Ib study for the treatment of patients with solid tumors. It is an orally administered treatment that selectively inhibits phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)-gamma.In November 2016, Infinity entered into a clinical trial collaboration with Bristol-Myers to evaluate IPI-549 in combination with Opdivo in patients with advanced solid tumors.Meanwhile, Opdivo is approved for varied indications in the EU and the United States.  Also, it has received approvals for several indications including melanoma, head and neck, lung, kidney and blood cancer.However, Infinity’s shares have underperformed the industry year to date. The stock has been down 10.4%, as against the industry’s gain of 2.1% in the same time frame.It should be noted that the phase I/Ib study evaluates IPI-549 as a monotherapy and in combination with Opdivo in about 200 patients with advanced solid tumors. Patient enrollment is complete in monotherapy dose-escalation, and monotherapy expansion is ongoing. Combination dose-escalation is also ongoing, and its expansion is expected to begin in the second half of 2017.Markedly, the combination expansion component comprise multiple cohorts designed to evaluate IPI-549 in patients with specific types of cancer that include patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), melanoma, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) whose tumors show initial resistance or subsequently develop resistance to immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Additionally, it will also have a cohort of patients with TNBC who have not been previously exposed to immune checkpoint blockade therapy.Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

70,ALXN,"AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) entered into a deal to evaluate the combination of AbbVie's investigational antibody drug conjugate, ABBV-399, and Bristol-Myers Squibb's immune-oncology drug, Opdivo (nivolumab), in c-Met overexpressing non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Currently, the combination is in a phase I study that evaluates the patients for second line treatment who have failed one prior line of chemotherapy. But the specific terms of the deal were not disclosed. Notably, AbbVie is the sponsor conducting the trial.AbbVie’s shares have outperformed the industry year to date. The stock has been up 39.7% compared with the industry’s gain of 17% in the same time frame.We remind investors that Opdivo is approved for varied indications in the EU and the United States. The drug has also received approvals for several indications including melanoma, head and neck, lung, kidney and blood cancer.ABBV-399 is an anti-c-Met antibody drug conjugate that targets both MET-amplified and c-Met-overexpressing tumors. It is currently being developed to treat advanced solid tumors.In fact, Opdivo continues to be launched globally on approvals and label expansions. Label expansion into additional indications would give the product access to a higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug, significantly.  Markedly, Opdivo is being studied in combination with Bristol-Myers’ other drug Yevroy.  In the melanoma indication, the Opdivo+Yervoy regimen is contributing to growth in both Opdivo and Yervoy. Also, the drug became the first PD-1 inhibitor to be approved for a hematological malignancy – classical Hodgkin lymphoma in the United States (May 2016) and the EU (November 2016).In the second quarter of 2017, Opdivo generated revenues of $1.19 billion, up 42% from the year-ago period.AbbVie Inc.

71,ALXN,"We issued an updated report on The Medicines Company (MDCO  -  Free Report) on Sep 21.Notably, the Medicines Co. has undertaken a restructuring program to boost shareholder value. In fact, the company is exploring options for optimizing capital structure and liquidity position by divesting certain non-core products and businesses in order to generate non-dilutive cash and reduce associated cash burn and capital requirements.In February 2016, the Medicines Co. divested its hemostasis portfolio, which included drugs such as Recothrom, PreveLeak and Raplixa to Mallinckrodt plc (MNK  -  Free Report) for up to $409 million.However, the Medicines Co.’s shares have underperformed the industry year to date. The stock has been up 3% compared with the industry’s gain of 15.8% in the same time frame.With the divestment of non-core products, The Medicines Co. is focusing on developing pipeline candidates targeting its key focus areas. Currently company has one candidate representing blockbuster potential, namely Inclisiran (formerly PCSK9si; hypercholesterolemia – currently in phase II ORION studies). In August 2017, the company announced new encouraging one-year safety and efficacy data from the ongoing ORION-1 phase II study.Also, The Medicines Co declared that the FDA has granted accelerated approval to its experimental antibiotic, Vabomere, a combination of meropenem and vaborbactam, for treating complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI), including the pyelonephritis in August, this year.The company expects to make Vabomere available in the market in fourth-quarter 2017. Markedly, the FDA’s accelerated approval of Vabomere is a huge positive for the company given the lucrative market it targets. The Medicines Co also filed a new drug application (NDA) for the antibiotic in February, which is currently under review in the EU.However, with The Medicines Co.’s flagship product Angiomax facing generic competition it has entered a challenging period where driving top-line growth will become increasingly difficult. Evidently, the company recorded lower sales from Angiomax in the second-quarter of 2017, due to the loss of exclusivity. The Medicines Company Price and Consensus  The Medicines Company Price and Consensus | The Medicines Company QuoteZacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderThe Medicine Co. currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

72,ALXN,"We issued an updated report on Bayer Aktiengesellschaft (BAYRY  -  Free Report) on Sep 21.Notably, Bayer is a life science company with core competencies in the areas of health care and agriculture. The company reports results under five divisions – Pharmaceuticals, Consumer Health, Crop Science, Animal Health and Covestro.The company has a robust pipeline ranging from phase I to phase III development. Interesting late-stage candidates include BAY 1841788 (ODM-201, AR antagonist; non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer), BAY 1841788 (ODM-201, AR antagonist; metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer), copanlisib (PI3K inhibitor; various forms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma) and finerenone (MR antagonist; diabetic kidney disease) among others.Bayer’s shares have outperformed the industry year to date. The stock has been up 26.8% compared with the industry’s gain of 16.6% in the same time frame. In September 2017, the FDA approved copanlisib under the brand name Aliqopa 60 mg vial for injection to treat adult patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma who have received at least two prior systemic therapies.Meanwhile, Bayer is looking for a label expansion of its oncology drug Stivarga, which is approved for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer and metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors. The drug was granted marketing authorization by the European Commission (EC) in Aug 2017, for the treatment of adult patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have been previously treated with Nexavar (sorafenib).Also, the company announced the submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) with FDA for its long-acting site-specifically PEGylated recombinant human Factor VIII (BAY94-9027) for the treatment of Hemophilia A in August.In fact, Bayer has made several acquisitions and entered into a number of deals to boost its portfolio in the past few quarters. It is planning to acquire Monsanto Company  in an all-cash transaction worth approximately $66 billion as well.Going forward, the combined business is expected to boost Bayer’s Crop Science business and provide accretion to its core earnings from the first full year of the closing of the transaction (slated to close by the end of 2017), followed by double-digit percentage growth.Furthermore, Bayer expects annual earnings contributions of around $1.5 billion from synergies after three years of closing the transaction as well as additional future benefits from integrated offerings. Markedly, we believe that the proposed Monsanto acquisition is a strategic move which will offer Bayer with a broad set of solutions to meet farmers’ current and future needs.However, the company is facing generic threats/competition for many of its products including the Yaz franchise (oral contraceptives). The genericization of key drugs might negatively impact revenues. Bayer AG Price and Consensus  Bayer AG Price and Consensus | Bayer AG QuoteZacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderBayer currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

74,ALXN,"On Thursday, shares of biopharmaceutical company Akari Therapeutics (AKTX  -  Free Report) are skyrocketing, up over 60% in midday trading—the stock was up 90% in premarket trading—after it announced it would advance its lead drug candidate.In a press release, Akari said that after an End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA and based on the agency’s feedback, the company would be pushing forward Coversin into Phase 3 development for the treatment of Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH) in the first quarter of 2018.In the U.S., the PNH indication has “Fast Track” status. PNH is a rare, life-threatening disease of the blood; it’s characterized by the destruction of red blood cells, blood clots, and impaired bone marrow function. PNH affects about 1 to 1.5 persons per million, and primarily impacts younger adults, according to Johns Hopkins.“Following our recent FDA meeting, we are working to initiate a Phase III clinical trial of Coversin in PNH in Q1 2018,” said Dr. David Horn Solomon, Chief Executive Officer of Akari Therapeutics. “We will continue to work closely with the FDA, benefitting from our Fast Track status in the U.S., and with the EMA towards submission of a BLA and MAA, respectively, for Coversin in PNH.”Akari said that it plans to perform two Phase 3 clinical studies, CAPSTONE and ASSET. CAPSTONE will carry out on “naïve” PNH patients where Alexion’s (ALXN  -  Free Report) Soliris, or eculizumab, is not the standard of care, while ASSET is a Phase 3 clinical study that switches PNH patients from eculizumab to treatment with Coversin.With Coversin delivered subcutaneously, patients may have greater independence due to self-administration. Phase II studies are also planned for a number of other indications where Coversin’s actions on both the complement and leukotriene (LTB4) pathways play a role. Its two leading targets in this area are atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC), a rare eye disorder and severe bullous pemphigoid (BP), a rare skin disorder,” added Solomon.Akari focuses on the development and commercialization of innovative therapeutics to treat orphan autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.

75,ALXN,"Shares of Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALNY  -  Free Report) soared by more than 50% after the company and its partner Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) announced that a pivotal phase III study on its pipeline candidate patisiran met its primary as well as all secondary endpoints.Alnylam’s shares have outperformed the industry year to date. The stock has been up 204.1% compared with the industry's gain of 16.4% in the same time frame.Patisiran is an investigational RNAi therapeutic which has been developed to treat patients with hereditary ATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. The phase III APOLLO study demonstrated that at 18 months, the mean change from baseline in the modified neuropathy impairment score (mNIS+7) - the primary endpoint was significantly lower in the patisiran arm as compared with placebo.Additionally, the study met its key secondary endpoint of improvement in quality of life. The patients who were administered patisiran experienced significant improvement in quality of life compared to placebo. The study also met all its other five secondary endpoints.APOLLO was the largest randomized study ever completed in this disease. The study also demonstrated the first ever positive results for an RNAi therapeutic. According to Alnylam, hATTR amyloidosis represents a major unmet medical need and affects about 50,000 people worldwide. Thus the potential approval of patisiran will be a huge boost for the people suffering from this often fatal disease.Based on these encouraging results, Alnylam expects to file its first New Drug Application (NDA) in late 2017 and the first marketing application in the EU in early 2018. Sanofi expects to make regulatory filings in Japan, Brazil and other countries in the first half of 2018.

76,ALXN,"Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc. (KPTI  -  Free Report) announced positive data from a phase II portion of phase II/III SEAL study, demonstrating superiority of its liposarcoma candidate, selinexor, in improving progression free survival (PFS) when compared to a placebo. The company’s oral Selective Inhibitor of Nuclear Export compound is being evaluated in patients with advanced unresectable dedifferentiated liposarcoma who have received prior treatment.Karyopharm’s shares were up more than 6% on Wednesday. In fact, shares of the company are  have risen 18.7% year to date, outperforming the industry’s gain of 1.5%.Data from the phase II study demonstrated that selinexor achieved the primary endpoint pf PFS by reducing the risk of progression or death in liposarcoma patients by 40%.

The FDA-approved PFS is the primary endpoint of the study. Top-line data from this study will be available in 2019.Liposarcoma is a rare form of cancer, which occurs in the soft tissues of the body, especially fatty tissues. The disease is generally treated with surgery in combination with radiation therapy. Hence, an oral dose medicine is a better option for patients.However, there are drugs that are administered intravenously for treating advanced liposarcoma patients.

78,ALXN,"We issued an updated report on Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) on Sep 19.Novartis has a strong portfolio of oncology drugs like Afinitor, Exjade, Jakavi, Zykadia, Tasigna, Jadenu and an improved formulation of Exjade. In February 2016, the company received a boost with the FDA approving Afinitor for advanced, progressive, nonfunctional, neuroendocrine tumors of gastrointestinal or lung origin. The drug has also been approved in the EU for the same indication.The recent approval of Kisqali, for use in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for the first-line treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 negative (HR+/HER2-) advanced or metastatic breast cancer is likely to boost the oncology portfolio further. The drug was also approved in Europe. Meanwhile, the FDA also approved a label expansion of Zykadia to include the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.In a major boost, the FDA recently approved its breakthrough gene transfer treatment, Kymriah suspension for the treatment of patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that is refractory or in second or later relapse. Kymriah, formerly CTL019, is the first chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy approved. The approval is a major boost for Novartis given the potential in the CAR-T therapy space. The approval opens up new frontiers in the treatment of cancer by advancing immunocellular therapy for children and young adults with r/r B-cell ALL which comprises approximately 25% of cancer diagnoses among children under 15 years and is the most common childhood cancer in the United States. Meanwhile, Novartis plans to make additional filings for Kymriah in the United Staes and EU this year for Kymriah for the treatment of adult patients with r/r diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In April, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to Kymriah based on data from the JULIET study.On the other hand, we are pleased with the progress in biosimilars pipeline. The company plans to launch five major oncology and immunology biosimilars between 2017 and 2020. This includes a biosimilar version of Roche Holdings AG’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Rituxan (rituximab), which was approved by the European Commission in June 2017 (marketed as Rixathon). Recently, the FDA accepted its Biologics License Application for a proposed biosimilar version of Rituxan.In August 2016, Sandoz’s Erelzi, a biosimilar version of Amgen, Inc’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) blockbuster drug Enbrel gained approval in the United States for five indications. Erelzi was also approved by the European Commission in 2017. In May, the European Medicines Agency also accepted the company’s Marketing Authorization Applications for biosimilar versions of Humira (adalimumab) and Remicade (infliximab) for review. Novartis’ stock has rallied 21.9% year to date compared with the industry’s 16.6% gain.Novartis is currently going through a transitional stage. The company’s blockbuster drug, Diovan, is facing stiff generic competition in the United States, EU and Japan. Gleevec lost exclusivity in the United States in February 2016. The company also lost patent protection for the drug in EU in December 2016 leading to generic competition.The loss of patent protection for these top-selling drugs continue to hurt sales. Hence, Novartis expects the next growth phase to begin in 2018 driven by Cosentyx (in psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis indications), Entresto, Kisqali and a deep pipeline with candidates like BAF312, AMG 334, RTH258.Zacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderNovartis currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Another  top-ranked stock in health care sector worth considering is Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

79,ALXN,"Pluristem Therapeutics, Inc. (PSTI  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has granted Fast Track designation to a phase III study evaluating its critical limb ischemia (“CLI”) candidate, PLacental eXpanded (PLX)-PAD cells. The candidate is being evaluated in patients who are not eligible for revascularization.The FDA grants fast track designation to help the development and a faster review of drugs, which treat serious and unmet medical conditions. With this designation, the drug is expected to be granted priority review once it files a New Drug Application (NDA).Pluristem’s shares were up almost 8.2% including after-market movement on Monday as investors cheered the FDA’s decision. However, shares of the company are down 0.7% so far this year, underperforming the industry’s gain of 15.6%.The phase III study is currently enrolling patients in the United States and Europe. The candidate has also been included in Adaptive Pathways program by the European Medicines Agency. Any positive results from interim analysis of the phase III study will help Pluristem to receive an early conditional marketing authorization for the candidate.Meanwhile, Japan’s Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency has also included PLX-PAD cells into its accelerated regulatory pathway for regenerative therapies.Critical limb ischemia is a severe form of peripheral arterial disease where blood flow is reduced in the arteries in the legs due to deposition of fatty acids. Revascularization, a method of restoration of perfusion of blood to the blocked parts in ischemia patients, is generally achieved by surgery. Patients with CLI remain at the risk of limb amputation and death, which may be prevented by revascularization.Per the press release, the number of CLI patients is expected to be around 5 to 6 million in the United States and Europe. The company estimates that 40% of CLI patients are ineligible for revascularization and the CLI market is estimated to be $25 billion per year.The company is evaluating PLX cells in multiple indications, which includes inflammation, ischemia, muscle trauma, hematological disorders, and radiation damage. The candidate has shown promising results in earlier studies.Pluristem Therapeutics, Inc. Price and Consensus  Pluristem Therapeutics, Inc. Price and Consensus | Pluristem Therapeutics, Inc.

84,ALXN,"Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) and its Japanese partner Astellas announced that their prostate cancer drug Xtandi met the primary endpoint in a late-stage study, which can expand the label of the drug to include early-stage patients.Top-line data from the phase III PROSPER study showed that treatment with Xtandi plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) led to a statistically significant improvement in metastasis-free survival (MFS) – the primary endpoint - in men with castration-resistant non-metastatic prostate cancer (CRPC) compared to ADT alone.Many prostate cancer patients with non-metastatic CRPC – an earlier stage of prostate cancer – can experience disease progression despite ADT. However, presently no FDA approved treatment options are available to cater to this condition until these patients develop metastatic disease.Xtandi is presently approved for the treatment of metastatic CRPC in patients who have previously received docetaxel. If approved for the non-metastatic patient population, the label of Xtandi can be expanded to cover all patients with CRPC.Shares of Pfizer were up almost 2% in response to the positive news. However, Pfizer’s shares have underperformed the industry this year so far. The stock has returned 10% during this period, comparing unfavorably with an increase of 16% for the industry.Pfizer plans to discuss the PROSPER study data with the FDA and other regulatory authorities and also present detailed data at a future medical meeting.Xtandi was added to Pfizer’s portfolio with the acquisition of Medivation in September. While Pfizer sells Xtandi in the United States in partnership with Astellas, the latter owns the marketing right outside U.S. markets. Pfizer recorded Xtandi alliance revenues of $141 million in the second quarter and $131 million in the first.In December 2016, Pfizer and Astellas had announced that a phase IV study — PLATO — evaluating the efficacy and safety of continued treatment with Xtandi did not meet the primary endpoint. The PLATO study evaluated Xtandi plus Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Zytiga and prednisone compared to Zytiga and prednisone alone.Xtandi is a key drug in Prizer’s oncology portfolio/pipeline. The New York-based pharma giant is aggressively working on expanding the labels of its marketed cancer drugs like Xtandi, Ibrance and Xalkori.Xtandi is in several studies including late-stage studies in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. It is also in mid-stage development for the treatment of advanced breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma.Pfizer carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

86,ALXN,"ProQR Therapeutics N.V. (PRQR  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has granted orphan drug designation to its genetic disorder candidate, QR-313, for the treatment of dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (""DEB"").ProQR’s share price has increased 2.1% so far this year, underperforming the industry’s rise of 15.3% in the same time frame.The company has already obtained orphan drug designation for its four other candidates, including its usher syndrome candidate, QRX-421, earlier this month.We note that orphan drug designation is granted to drugs capable of treating diseases that affect less than 200,000 people in the United States. The status makes QR-313 eligible for seven years of marketing exclusivity in the country, following an approval for DEB. The designation also makes the company eligible for certain other benefits, including tax credits related to clinical trial expenses, exemption from the FDA-user fee and assistance from the FDA in clinical trial design.QR-313 is a RNA-based therapy for treating DEB, which is caused by mutations in exon 73 of the COL7A1 gene. The mutation result in the loss of functional collagen type VII protein that makes the skin fragile.ProQR is also engaged in developing RNA-based therapies for other genetic rare diseases including cystic fibrosis (QR-010) and Leber’s congenital amaurosis (QR-110).In a restructuring move, the company spun off its central nervous system (""CNS"") disorders focused company, Amylon Therapeutics, in late August. Amylon will develop RNA-based therapies for the treatment of a rare genetic disease, which leads to strokes in mid-adulthood.

87,ALXN,"Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA  -  Free Report) announced a partnership deal with Nuvelution Pharma, Inc. to accelerate development of Austedo (deutetrabenazine) tablets for the treatment of tics associated with Tourette syndrome (TS) in pediatric patients in the United States.Per the agreement, Nuvelution will look into the funding and clinical development of Austedo that is expected to enter phase III by the end of 2017. Meanwhile, Teva will be responsible for the regulatory approval and commercialization of the candidate.Once Austedo is approved in the United States, Teva will pay Nuvelution a pre-agreed return on its invested capital. Earlier, Austedo was approved in the United States for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington disease (HD). Notably, Austedo’s label was expanded to include a second indication, tardive dyskinesia, a debilitating and often irreversible movement disorder in August, 2017.Shares of Teva have underperformed the industry year to date. The stock has been down 52.6% compared with the industry's fall of 20.4% in the same time frame. This lackluster performance was due to a challenging environment in the company’s United States’ generics business and the continued deterioration in Venezuela.Meanwhile, delay in the launch of some new generic drugs and fierce competition for some others has been hurting Generic segment sales.Teva is also facing several other challenges in the form of generic competition for branded multiple sclerosis drug, Copaxone, its key revenue generator, new competition for branded products, a high cost base and debt load.Furthermore, the company hired H. Lundbeck’s (HLUYY  -  Free Report) chief, Kåre Schultz, as its new CEO. The appointment ended Teva’s more than six-month long search for a permanent CEO after Erez Vigodman stepped down in February this year. Now, it remains to be seen if Schultz can use his 30 years of extensive global pharmaceutical experience to help the world’s largest generic drug maker regain lost ground.Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited Price Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited Price | Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited QuoteZacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderTeva carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

92,ALXN,"GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report) and partner Innoviva, Inc.  announced that the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has granted a positive opinion recommending approval of its once-daily single inhaler triple therapy in the EU.So far this year, Glaxo’ share price has increased 4.5%, comparing unfavorably with a gain of 16.4% recorded by the industry it belongs to.The once-daily single inhaler triple therapy is proposed to be called Trelegy Ellipta. Glaxo is looking to get Trelegy Ellipta approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in patients who are already being treated with a combination of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and a long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist (LABA) but require additional bronchodilation.Trelegy Ellipta is a combination of fluticasone furoate – an ICS, umeclidinium –   a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) and vilanterol – a LABA therapy. Trelegy Ellipta will be delivered in Glaxo’ Ellipta dry powder inhaler.Glaxo’s Ellipta products have been quite successful and are a key driver of the company’s sales. In the last reported quarter — second quarter of 2017 — Ellipta products recorded a 73% surge in sales, driven by market share gains and the ongoing rollout in Europe and other international markets.Trelegy Ellipta, if approved, will be the first single inhaler triple therapy to be approved anywhere in the world. We believe the therapy will enjoy strong demand as it can remove the need for multiple inhalers for COPD patients. This can further boost sales of Glaxo’s Ellipta products.A final decision from the European Commission is expected around the end of the year. The candidate is also under review in many countries including the United States.Glaxo carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked biotech stocks include Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

93,ALXN,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) announced that the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has granted a positive opinion recommending approval of its pipeline candidate, guselkumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in the EU.The drug was approved in the United States in July this year and is marketed by the trade name of Tremfya for the treatment of this immune system related skin disorder. A decision from the European Commission (EC) is expected later this year.So far this year, J&J’s share price has increased 16.7%, comparing favorably with a gain of 16.4% recorded by the industry it belongs to.The application in the EU was based on three studies – phase III VOYAGE 1, VOYAGE 2 and NAVIGATE – evaluating the efficacy and safety of guselkumab, an anti-IL-23 human monoclonal antibody, administered by subcutaneous injection for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.Data from the VOYAGE 2 trial (n=992) showed that significantly higher proportion of patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis treated with guselkumab achieved high rates of skin clearance compared to those receiving placebo. Around 70% of the patients receiving guselkumab achieved at least 90% clearer skin versus 2.4% on placebo.The VOYAGE 2 trial evaluated guselkumab versus AbbVie, Inc.’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) blockbuster drug, Humira. The study demonstrated the statistically significant efficacy of guselkumab compared to Humira at week 16, which was maintained through 24 weeks of treatment. Almost 46.8% of the patients treated with Humira achieved at least 90% clearer skin versus 70% for guselkumab.The NAVIGATE (n=871) study evaluated the efficacy and safety of switching to guselkumab in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis patients who were not achieving clear or almost clear skin with J&J’s other plaque psoriasis medicine, Stelara. Data from the study showed that patients who switched to guselkumab showed significantly greater improvements in skin clearance compared with patients who continued to receive Stelara.Meanwhile, a phase III head-to-head study of Tremfya against Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) Cosentyx for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis is ongoing. Also, a phase III study evaluating guselkumab in moderate-to-severely active psoriatic arthritis is also ongoing.J&J had previously mentioned that Tremfya has blockbuster potential and could rake in sales of more than $1 billion.J&J carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderA better-ranked biotech stock is Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

95,ALXN,"Within the Medical sector, biotech stocks have performed well in the first half of the year, despite challenges like rising competition, pipeline setbacks, slowdown in growth of mature products and generic competition for certain key drugs. The sector recovered from the pricing controversy of 2016 and defied uncertainties surrounding President Trump’s proposed healthcare policy.Some of the factors that are responsible for the biotech sector performing well in the current year so far are an increase in FDA approvals, new product sales ramp up, R&D success and innovation, strong clinical study results and continued strong performance of legacy products.A few other events also contributed to the rally in the sector in the past month. These include pharmaceutical giant, Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) decision to acquire immunotherapy focused company, Kite Pharma .The FDA’s approval of Novartis AG’s NVS gene transfer treatment, Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) suspension for the treatment of patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that is refractory or in second or later relapse was another good news for the sector. Kymriah, formerly CTL019, is the first chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy to be approved.Further, two companies -- Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report) and Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) -- announced restructuring initiatives including job cuts recently.

96,ALXN,"GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report) recently announced that an FDA advisory panel has unanimously voted recommending approval for its shingles vaccine candidate, Shingrix, in older patients.Glaxo said the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee were impressed by the efficacy/safety data from Shingrix studies, which evaluated the candidate for the prevention of herpes zoster (shingles) in adults aged between 50 years and more. In this regard, although the FDA is not bound to follow the Committee’s opinion but it usually does.So far this year, Glaxo’ share price has increased 4.1%, comparing unfavorably with a gain of 16% recorded by the industry it belongs to.Notably, the biologics license application (BLA) for Shingles was filed with the FDA in October, 2016. Regulatory applications are currently under review in the EU, Canada and Japan as well.The regulatory submission was based on data from a clinical trial program comprising two phase III studies — ZOE-50 and ZOE-70 — that evaluated the safety, efficacy and immunogenicity of the candidate in more than 37,000 individuals. The results showed that in addition to reducing the incidence of shingles, the candidate was able to reduce the overall incidence of postherpetic neuralgia, which is a nerve pain due to the damage caused by the varicella zoster virus.Glaxo expects approval of Shingrix in the United States and Europe in the fourth quarter of 2017.In fact, Shingles is a common but potentially serious condition in which the patients develop a painful itchy rash. Glaxo estimates that more than one in three people over 50 are likely to have shingles in their lifetime, which shows the disease has significant unmet need.Glaxo expects Shingles, if approved, to be a key contributor to its top line from the next year. Additionally, the company anticipates new pharmaceutical and vaccine products including Shingrix to deliver sales of £6 billion per annum by 2018.Glaxo carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked biotech stocks include Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

97,ALXN,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report) announced results from an interim analysis of an ongoing phase III REGAIN study of lead drug Soliris for the treatment of patients with refractory generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG), who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody-positive.We note that, Soliris is approved for the treatment of two severe and ultra-rare disorders resulting from chronic uncontrolled activation of the complement component of the immune system, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS).Alexion’s shares have outperformed the industry year to date. The stock has been up 19.6% compared with the industry’s gain of 16% in the same time frame.Coming back to the release, the study showed sustained treatment benefits of Soliris treatment for patients with refractory generalized myasthenia gravis. Additionally, it revealed that safety profile of Soliris was consistent with that observed in the REGAIN study.Furthermore, the evaluation showed that the benefits for patients treated with Soliris in REGAIN through 26 weeks were maintained in the extension study across all four assessment scales for an additional 52 weeks (78 weeks in total). In fact, the patients who received placebo in REGAIN and then were treated with Soliris in the extension study, demonstrated significant treatment benefits within 1 to 4 weeks and were sustained through 52 weeks across all four assessment scales.Meanwhile, Alexion has filed regulatory applications with the FDA as well as the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Soliris for the treatment of refractory gMG in patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody-positive. The FDA accepted the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) and set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act date of Oct 23.The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has also adopted a positive opinion for the same and the final decision from the European Commission (EC) is anticipated in the third quarter of 2017.Additionally, a phase III study (PREVENT) on Soliris in patients with relapsing neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder is ongoing with enrollment being expected to be completed in 2017 and data expected in 2018. Label expansion into additional indications would give Soliris access to a higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug significantly.Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

98,ALXN,"Roche Holdings AG (RHHBY  -  Free Report) announced results from a six-month study combining idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) drug Esbriet (pirfenidone) and Ofev. The data was presented at the European Respiratory Society (ERS) congress in Italy.The results revealed a similar safety profile for the combination treatment to that expected for each treatment alone.  A majority of the 89 patients included in the study tolerated the combination treatment.Patients were given a stable dose of Esbriet for at least 16 weeks before initiation of Ofev for the combination study. 16.9% of patients experienced at least one treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) related to Esbriet only, compared to 74.2% of patients who experienced at least one TEAE that investigators attributed as related to Ofev only.In addition, a second, retrospective, post-hoc, analysis suggests that treatment with Esbriet may be associated with a reduction of multiple progression events as well as reduction of deaths after one or more progression events.Moreover, a third study, involving real-world post-authorisation safety data from over 1,000 European patients receiving treatment with Esbriet and followed for up to 2 years, was also presented at ERS. Data from the study showed that occurrence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) was consistent with the known safety profile of Esbriet, with no new safety signals observed.Esbriet was approved in Europe in 2011 for adults with mild-to-moderate IPF. The drug was also approved in the United Stated for patients with IPF in October 2014. In 2017, the FDA and the European Commission approved the Esbriet 801 mg and 267 mg tablets as new options for administering the drug for the treatment of IPF. The new formulation offers patients a maintenance option for taking Esbriet with fewer pills per day.The drug was added to Roche’s portfolio with the 2014 InterMune acquisition. Roche’s respiratory portfolio includes Xolair, Pulmozyme for cystic fibrosis, and Esbriet while drugs like Alecensa, Avastin, Tarceva and Tecentriq are approved for the treatment of specific types of lung cancer.However, sales of Avastin and Tarceva continue to decline.Roche’s stock has lost 13.2% compared with the industry’s gain of 19.3% in the year so far.Roche has a strong presence in the oncology market. The company dominates the breast cancer space with strong demand for its HER2 franchise drugs like Herceptin, Perjeta and Kadcyla.Competition from biosimilars looms large on Roche's key drugs like Herceptin, Avastin and Rituxan.

99,ALXN,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report) announced that it will undertake a restructuring plan to re-align the organization with refocused corporate strategy.Details of RestructuringThe company plans to focus on rare diseases businesses in core areas of hematology, nephrology, neurology and metabolic disorders to enhance productivity. Alexion will reduce spending and headcount associated with the previously announced de-prioritized pipeline programs as well as optimizing additional R&D expenses.The three programs which have been deprioritized are — ALXN1101 (cPMP replacement therapy) and ALXN6000 (samalizumab) as well as partnerships with Moderna Therapeutics, Blueprint Medicines and Arbutus Biopharma (ABUS  -  Free Report).Alongside, the company will shut Alexion Rhode Island manufacturing facility and certain regional and country-based offices. The company will align investments with its core, high-growth markets, optimize the global operating structure to leverage synergies across regions and countries, reduce operating redundancies and focus on continuity of the field teams.Meanwhile, the company is also right-sizing certain G&A functions, such as Human Resources, Finance and Information Technology (IT), including out-sourcing certain non-core Finance and IT roles to support the realigned business. Alexion will continue to invest in other G&A functions, such as Legal and Compliance, to support its global business.Concurrently, the company plans to relocate its headquarters to Boston, MA by mid-2018 with approximately 400 positions.As a result of the restructuring plan, the company will reduce its global workforce by approximately 20%. The company expects that the increased financial flexibility will allow it to reinvest approximately $100 million annually into R&D.Financial ImpactAlexion expects pre-tax savings of approximately $250 million by 2019 while the total pre-tax restructuring and related expenses associated with the plan will be in the range of $340- $440 million. The company targets non-GAAP operating margin of 50% by 2019. Approximately 50% of the restructuring and related expenses will result in cash outlays and restructuring (pre-tax) and related expenses of approximately $240 million to $300 million are expected to be recorded in 2017.However, the company does not expect any changes to its annual revenue guidance due to the restructuring initiative.Our TakeAlexion has been facing challenging conditions in recent times and the company is looking to turn around things. In June, Alexion named Paul J. Clancy as its Chief Financial Officer effective July 31, 2017.Alexion’s stock price has increased 18.1%, outperforming the industry’s gain of 16.5%Earlier, in 2017, the company shares were hit after a Bloomberg report stated that it is under investigation by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG). The HHS has reportedly said it is conducting an ""open and ongoing investigation"" into the biotech, though it did not specify what it was about. The investigation is reportedly related to Alexion’s support of charitable organizations that provide financial assistance to Medicare patients who take drugs sold by the company.Alexion’s lead drug, Soliris continues to perform well but the company relies heavily on the drug for growth. The company is expecting Soliris revenues to be lower in the second half of the year due to an accelerating impact from the ALXN1210 trials. In addition, pricing will impact sales by 1%. Alexion is working on expanding Soliris’ label into additional indications.Alexion has filed regulatory applications with the FDA as well as the European Medicines Agency for Soliris for the treatment of refractory gMG in patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody-positive. The FDA accepted the supplemental Biologics License Application  and set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act date of Oct 23.We expect the restructuring plan to boost savings and positively impact margins.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderAlexion currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Other top-ranked stocks in the healthcare sector are Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Alexion is guiding toward operating margin growth of 50% in 2019 and expects to reinvest about $100 million every year in R&D starting from 2018.  Alexion is focusing on growing and maximizing its presence in the rare disease business. Core areas of focus include hematology, nephrology, neurology and metabolic disorders. As a result of the restructuring, the company expects to incur pre-tax costs of about $340 million - $440 million of which $240 million - $300 million will be recorded this year.Alexion is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. The company has gained 17.8% year to date, outperforming the industry’s 15.9% rally.Regeneron/Sanofi Asthma Drug Positive in Phase III: Regeneron and partner Sanofi announced positive top-line results from a late-stage study on Dupixent (dupilumab) for uncontrolled persistent asthma.  Dupixent was found to reduce severe asthma attacks and improve lung function. While overall results were good, less activity was observed in patients with lower eosinophilic cells. Regeneron and Sanofi intend to file for FDA approval by year end. The asthma market is huge with about one million people in the United States living with uncontrolled, persistent asthma despite being treated with standard therapies. Dupixent, which has blockbuster potential, is currently approved for eczema and is being evaluated for additional indications like pediatric atopic dermatitis, nasal polyps and eosinophilic esophagitis (Read more: Regeneron/Sanofi's Dupixent Asthma Study Meets Endpoints).AbbVie’s Upadacitinib Positive in Studies: AbbVie came out with positive data with the company saying that its experimental oral JAK1-selective inhibitor, upadacitinib (ABT-494), met all primary and ranked secondary endpoints in a late-stage study for moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (Read more: AbbVie's RA Candidate Meets Primary Endpoint in Phase III). The company also presented promising data on upadacitinib for atopic dermatitis or eczema from a phase IIb study (Read more: AbbVie's Upadacitinib Meets Primary Endpoint in Phase IIb).

101,ALXN,"Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ACHN  -  Free Report) announced that it has received a notice for the termination of the global license and collaboration agreement for developing hepatitis C treatments from its partner Janssen, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report).We remind investors that the agreement with Janssen was signed in 2015, which provided Achillion a strong and experienced partner and a major source of funds. With the termination of the agreement, we believe investors have become wary due to uncertainty in funds for Achillion.Shares of Achillion tumbled 22.1% on Monday. In fact, Achillion’s shares have fallen 7.4% so far this year, underperforming the industry’s gain of 15.9% in that period.Achillion and Janssen were developing JNJ-4178 for treating patients with hepatitis C. Janssen took the decision to discontinue further development of the hepatitis C treatment regimen, JNJ-4178, as it believes there are several highly effective therapies available for this indication.An ongoing phase IIa study is evaluating JNJ-4178, a triple combination regimen of J&J’s simeprevir & AL-335 and Achillion’s odalasvir. Data from the study announced in April demonstrated that the treatment regimen has the ability to shorten treatment duration in patients. Moreover, JNJ-4178 demonstrated a 100% cure rate after only six weeks of therapy, as published in the Journal of Hepatology. Janssen will complete this study as planned and stop further development thereafter.Achillion stated that it will now focus on developing its factor D inhibitor, ACH-4471 for the treatment of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). The interim results from the study, announced in August, showed clinically meaningful complement inhibition and a favorable tolerability profile for ACH-4471.Multiple phase II studies are planned for evaluating ACH-4471 in the second half of 2017. The studies will include PNH patients with sub-optimal response to Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s (ALXN  -  Free Report) Soliris or patients with C3G, a rare renal disorder.In a separate press release, Achillion announced the promotion of current executive vice president, Joseph Truitt as chief operating officer and appointed Avner Ingerman as senior vice president and head of ophthalmology.

102,ALXN,"AstraZeneca Plc. (AZN  -  Free Report) announced a subgroup analysis from SIROCCO and CALIMA phase III studies. The studies evaluated the efficacy and safety of a regular subcutaneous administration of benralizumab (fixed 30mg dose) for up to 56 weeks in exacerbation-prone adult and adolescent patients between 12 years of age and older.Moreover, the studies revealed the efficacy of benralizumab and also showed that this antibody provides increased benefits to patients who experience more frequent exacerbations, despite being on standard-of-care medicines and/or who present with higher baseline blood eosinophil counts. Furthermore, patients on oral corticosteroids and with nasal polyposis were more likely to have an enhanced treatment response.Currently, benralizumab is under regulatory review in the United StateS, European Union, Japan and several other countries, with a U.S. action date during the fourth quarter of 2017 and expected regulatory decisions elsewhere during the first half of 2018.Shares of AstraZeneca outperformed the industry year to date. The stock has been up 20.5% compared with the industry’s gain of 15.8% in the same time frame.In fact, asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of breathlessness and has a significant unmet medical need. This is because it affects 315 million individuals worldwide and up to 10% of patients who have severe asthma, despite high doses of standard-of-care asthma controller medicines and can require the use of chronic oral corticosteroids (OCS).Recently, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report) and partner Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) announced that Dupixent (dupilumab) met its two primary endpoints in a phase III study conducted on patients with uncontrolled, persistent asthma. Data from the LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST study also showed that Dupixent, when added to standard therapies, reduced severe asthma attacks and improved lung function. Astrazeneca PLC Price  Astrazeneca PLC Price | Astrazeneca PLC QuoteZacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderAstraZeneca currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

103,ALXN,"Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced final overall survival data from a phase III study (PROFILE 1014), evaluating its cancer drug Xalkori for first-line treatment of ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Xalkori is currently approved for the treatment of ALK+ or ROS1-positive locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. The product generated sales of $296 million in the first half of 2017, up 8% year over year.In the PROFILE 1014 study, a statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) rates was not observed in patients treated with Xalkori. After a median follow-up of 46 months, the median OS for patients treated with Xalkori was 45.8 months while it was 47.5 months for patients randomized to chemotherapy. Please note that OS was a secondary endpoint of PROFILE 1014 while progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint. Per data published in the past, a statistically significant improvement in PFS was noticed in the Xalkori arm compared with the chemotherapy arm.These data were presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress in Madrid, Spain.Pfizer’s shares have underperformed the industry this year so far. The stock has returned 5.7% during this period, comparing unfavorably with an increase of 14.8% for the industry.Pfizer’s boasts a strong oncology portfolio/pipeline. The New York-based pharma giant is aggressively working on expanding the labels of its marketed cancer drugs like Ibrance and Xalkori.Meanwhile, Pfizer’s newly approved immunotherapy, Bavencio, is expected to contribute significantly to the top line.Bavencio/avelumab received FDA approval for metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in March 2017 and for advanced bladder cancer in May. Bavencio is under review in the EU for MCC with a decision expected in the third quarter of 2017. Pfizer along with partner Merck KGaA is focusing on continuously growing and expanding Bavencio into new indications and markets globally.Pfizer’s two other oncology candidates have also been approved by the FDA recently. These include Besponsa for relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia in August and Mylotarg for new or relapsed CD33-positive acute myeloid leukemia in September.

104,ALXN,"AstraZeneca, plc (AZN  -  Free Report) announced data from a late-stage study on Imfinzi which showed that the new cancer drug led to superior progression-free survival to standard of care in lung cancer patients. Shares of AstraZeneca inched up more than 1% on Friday as well as in pre-market trading on Monday.So far this year, AstraZeneca’s shares have moved up 18% comparing favorably with the industry’s 14.8% increase.Interim data from the phase III PACIFIC trial study showed that treatment with Imfinzi improved PFS by more than 11 months in comparison to standard of care in patients with locally advanced, unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have not progressed following chemoradiation. The median PFS was 16.8 months for patients on Imfinzi compared with 10.2 months in the comparator arm.Presented at the European Society of Medical Oncology Congress (ESMO) in Madrid, the data was also published online in the New England Journal of Medicine. We remind investors that earlier in July, a Breakthrough Therapy designation was granted to Imfinzi for this indication.AstraZeneca claims that Imfinzi is the first medicine to have demonstrated superior PFS in the concerned patient population, which was til now left unattended for want of proper treatment options.The PACIFIC study continues to evaluate the other primary endpoint, overall survival (OS).In a separate press release, AstraZeneca announced full results of the phase III FLAURA study, evaluating another lung cancer drug, Tagrisso, in the first line setting. Disclosed data showed that treatment with Tagrisso reduced the risk of progression or death by more than half compared with other commonly-used EGFR inhibitors for the first-line treatment of patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC.The median PFS was 18.9 months for patients on Tagrisso as compared to 10.2 months in the comparator arm. Good news is that consistent benefit was observed across all subgroups, including patients with and without brain metastases. This significant data was also presented at ESMO.Notably, the positive lung cancer finds come as a huge relief post the failure of thepivotal first-line lung cancer study, MYSTIC, on Imfinzi.In July, AstraZeneca’s share price plunged sharply after it announced that the MYSTIC study on Imfinzi failed to show benefit on progression-free-survival. The failure to show PFS benefit brought into question MYSTIC’s ability to show an OS benefit. Final OS data from MYSTICare expected during the first half of 2018.Imfinzi (durvalumab) is presently marketed in the U.S. for one indication -- second line advanced bladder cancer -- since May this year. Meanwhile, Imfinzi is being evaluated for multiple cancers (either alone or in combination with other regimens), including phase III trials in first-line urothelial cancer, NSCLC, small cell lung cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) among others.AstraZeneca is working on strengthening its oncology product portfolio and has several candidates in its pipeline. The immuno-oncology therapeutic area is presently attracting a lot of interest and represents huge commercial potential.Other phase III oncology candidates in AstraZeneca’s pipeline include acalabrutinib (blood cancers – under priority review in U.S.), moxetumomab pasudotox (leukaemia), selumetinib (thyroid cancer) and savolitinib (kidney cancer).Lynparza, presently marketed for advanced ovarian cancerin partnership with Merck & Co, Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report), is also in different studies for a range of tumor types including breast, prostate and pancreatic cancers as well as earlier-line settings for ovarian cancer.

105,ALXN,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report) and partner Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) announced that Dupixent (dupilumab) met its two primary endpoints in a phase III study conducted on patients with uncontrolled, persistent asthma. Data from the LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST study showed that Dupixent, when added to standard therapies, reduced severe asthma attacks and improved lung function.Shares of Regeneron have outperformed the industry year to date. The stock has increased 28.4% as against the industry’s gain of 15.6% in the same time frame.Dupixent Injection is presently marketed in the United States for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD). It is the first and only biologic medicine approved for the treatment of adults suffering from AD. It was approved in the United States in March 2017. The European Medicine Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) rendered a positive opinion for the marketing authorization of Dupixent, recommending its approval for use in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis who are candidates for systemic therapy in Jul 2017.Coming back to the release, the LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST study showed that at 52 weeks , in the 300 mg dose group, dupilumab reduced severe asthma attacks by 46% in the overall population. In patients with high levels of eosinophilic cells, dupilumab reduced severe asthma attacks by 60% to 67%.The study also demonstrated that at 12 weeks, in the same dose group as above, mean improvement in lung function over placebo -- as assessed by forced expiratory volume over one second (FEV1) --  was 9% in the overall population. Lung function improvement was between 210 mL and 240 mL in patients with high levels of eosinophilic cellsBased on this positive data, the companies plan to submit a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) to the FDA by the end of 2017.Meanwhile, a phase III study of Dupixent in pediatric patients (6-11 years of age) with uncontrolled persistent asthma was initiated in second-quarter 2017.  The company expects to initiate two additional studies in the younger atopic dermatitis patients in the second half of 2017 – the first in children between the ages of 6 and 11, and the second in children between the ages of 6months and 5 years. Dupixent is also currently being evaluated for nasal polyps (phase III studies are enrolling) and eosinophilic esophagitis (phase III).Asthma, a chronic inflammatory disease of breathlessness, and approximately one million U.S. adults and adolescents live with uncontrolled, persistent asthma.

106,ALXN,"Biotech stocks are back in favor thanks to two recent major developments that led to a rally in the sector. The first catalyst was Gilead Sciences’ (GILD  -  Free Report) announcement that it will be acquiring immunotherapy focused company, Kite Pharma  while the FDA approval of the first gene therapy in the United States, Novartis AG’s Kymriah, boosted the sector further.The Gilead-Kite deal has raised expectations that the sector will finally see more merger and acquisition (M&A) deals in the coming quarters. Moreover, companies involved in CAR-T treatment like Kite saw their shares shooting up on hopes that more M&A deals will be announced in this segment of the market.   Meanwhile, the approval of Novartis’ CAR-T therapy, Kymriah, also gave the sector a boost indicating the beginning of a new era in the treatment of cancer. The path-breaking immunocellular therapy is a one-time treatment that uses a patient's own T cells to fight cancer.Year to date, the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index is up an impressive 26.1%, representing a sharp contrast to the Index’s performance during this same time period last year when it recorded a decline of 18.2%.A key reason for last year’s dismal performance was the drug pricing controversy which weighed on the sector a major part of the year. However, investors now seem to be more comfortable with the drug pricing scenario and are willing to look at the fundamentals of the sector.A key question that remains on the minds of investors is whether the rally will continue and what are the factors that will drive the same.Firstly, this is an industry that will continue to witness demand for its products given an aging population and the increasing prevalence of a wide variety of diseases. Strong pipelines, innovative treatments, impressive results, and increased health care spending should support growth. Trump's pro-business stand is also expected to benefit the sector.A faster drug approval process and the proposed removal of outdated regulations that drive up costs and slow down innovation should also work in favor of the sector. The FDA has approved far more drugs so far in 2017 than it did in the whole of 2016. The sector will receive an additional boost if more M&A deals are announced though companies are likely to adopt a “wait and watch” stance as they await more clarity regarding the drug pricing situation and tax reforms. Another major deterrent could be high valuations with companies remaining wary of bidding wars leading to over-priced deals.That said, licensing deals should continue especially in orphan and rare disease areas as well as highly sought after therapeutic areas like immune-oncology.Picking the Right StocksPicking biotech stocks can be a bit tricky given the “high risk - high returns” nature of the industry. Moreover, the estimate revision trend for the sector is not very encouraging. The growing presence of biosimilars, a slowdown in growth of legacy products and high profile pipeline setbacks are also challenges for the sector.Keeping these factors in mind, we have zeroed in on five biotech stocks that currently hold a strong Zacks Rank and look well-positioned.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report): Tarrytown, NY-based Regeneron's key areas of focus include eye diseases, heart disease, allergic and inflammatory diseases, pain, cancer, infectious diseases and rare diseases. While eye drug, Eylea, the company’s key growth driver continues to perform well, Regeneron has been working on diversifying its portfolio and gained FDA approval for two drugs this year - Dupixent (moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis) and Kevzara (moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis). Both drugs have blockbuster potential.The company also has a strong pipeline and has an eventful second half of the year coming up with key mid-to-late stage pipeline catalysts lined up. Regeneron just reported positive top-line phase III data on Dupixent for asthma and is now looking to go ahead with a U.S. filing by year end. Dupixent should also gain EU approval for the eczema indication in the third quarter. Regeneron is evaluating Dupixent in the pediatric atopic dermatitis setting. Another important data readout scheduled for the second half of the year is on the company’s PD-1 antibody REGN2810, for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (""CSCC""), the second most common skin cancer after basal cell carcinoma and the second deadliest skin cancer after melanoma. Positive data would allow the company to file for FDA approval in the first quarter of 2018.Meanwhile, Eylea is being evaluated in combination with nesvacumab. Top-line data from two phase II studies - one in wet age-related macular degeneration and another in diabetic macular edema - are expected in the fourth quarter of the year.Regeneron, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, has gained 28.4% year to date, substantially outperforming the 15.6% rally of the industry it belongs to.Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report): New Haven, CT-based Alexion’s flagship product, Soliris (eculizumab), continues to perform well and the company is working on expanding Soliris’ label for additional indications. Alexion has a key catalyst coming up with a decision from the FDA expected by Oct 23, 2017, regarding the approvability of Soliris for refractory generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG). EU approval for this indication came last month making it the first and only complement-based therapy approved for an ultra-rare subset of gMG. The gMG indication represents incremental growth opportunity for Soliris.Alexion, which had a rough 2016 with shares falling 35.9%, looks set to recover lost ground with shares gaining 15.4% year to date. The efforts of the company’s new management team to turn things around are impressive. Alexion’s R&D strategy is being redefined with a focus on key expertise areas. The company will continue to grow its rare diseases business which includes Soliris, Strensiq and Kanuma. To increase productivity, Alexion will focus its internal research efforts on its complement expertise and its development efforts on its core therapeutic areas of hematology, nephrology, neurology and metabolic disorders. The company has also decided to de-prioritize certain pipeline candidates and is discontinuing its preclinical programs with mRNA therapies as well as other preclinical programs that do not fall within the complement franchise. Alexion is a Zacks Rank #1 stock.

The company is focused on the development and licensing of biopharmaceutical assets. Ligand’s Captisol formulation technology has allowed it to enter into several licensing deals and generate royalties. Ligand’s partners include big names like Amgen and Novartis among others. The company also has licensing deals based on its OmniAb technology. Ligand, a Zacks Rank #1 stock, has gained 34.5% year to date, substantially outperforming the 15.7% rally of the industry it belongs to.Sangamo Therapeutics (SGMO  -  Free Report): Richmond, CA-based Sangamo is focused on translating ground-breaking science into genomic therapies using its platform technologies in genome editing, gene therapy, gene regulation and cell therapy. Sangamo got a major boost earlier this year following the signing of a collaboration agreement with Pfizer for the development and commercialization of gene therapy programs for hemophilia A.Shares of Sangamo, a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, have gained 341% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 15.7% rally.Fate Therapeutics, Inc. (FATE  -  Free Report): San Diego, CA-based Fate is focused on the development of programmed cellular immunotherapies for cancer and immune disorders. Fate’s hematopoietic cell therapy pipeline includes NK- and T-cell immuno-oncology programs and immuno-regulatory programs.

The drug giant plans to invest the savings in new drugs and overall growth of the company.Lilly is looking forward to launch two new medicines by the end of next year, probably galcanezumab for migraine prevention and galcanezumab and abemaciclib for breast cancer.Shares of Lilly were up 1.3% on Thursday. So far this year, Lilly’s share price has risen 10.8% compared with an increase of 12.6% for the industry.Lilly expects most of the layoffs to come from a U.S. voluntary early retirement program that it is offering to some employees. This plan is expected to be completed by December. It is also closing down several sites, a plant in Iowa, a R&D office in New Jersey and a R&D center in China to save costs.The job cuts are not expected to affect Lilly's adjusted earnings forecast for 2017. Lilly expects to achieve total operating expense efficiency of 49% or less of revenues by the end of 2018. Earlier, the company had expected operating expense efficiency of 50% or less.Lilly faces its share of challenges. Several key drugs in its portfolio like Zyprexa and Cymbalta are facing generic competition due to loss of exclusivity. Meanwhile, blockbuster drug, Alimta’s U.S. sales are also being affected by the entry of immuno-oncology agents in the market while outside U.S. sales are already being hurt due to loss of exclusivity in several countries.Other headwinds include competition from immuno-oncology agents as well as recent high-profile pipeline setbacks, the latest being a delay in approval of its rheumatoid arthritis candidate, baricitinib, in the United States. Also, Lilly’s Animal Health segment did not do too well in the first half due to worldwide competitive pressure. The cost savings will likely help Lilly offset the impact of some of these challenges to an extent.Lilly carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked biotech stocks include Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

114,ALXN,"The biotech sector got a shot in the arm last week thanks to two major developments that led to a rally in the sector. The first catalyst was Gilead Sciences’ (GILD  -  Free Report) decision to acquire immunotherapy focused company, Kite Pharma  and the second was the FDA approval of the first gene therapy in the United States – Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) Kymriah.Gilead has been under a lot of pressure to utilize its huge pile of cash for a major acquisition deal given the dwindling sales of its erstwhile top-selling hepatitis C virus (""HCV"") franchise. The $11.9 billion Kite acquisition, slated to close in the fourth quarter, will place Gilead among the top players in the emerging field of cell therapy. Kite’s expertise lies in developing engineered cell therapies that express either a chimeric antigen receptor (""CAR"") or an engineered T cell receptor (""TCR""), depending on the type of cancer.With the Kite-Gilead deal being announced, other companies involved in CAR-T treatment saw their shares shooting up on hopes that more merger and acquisition (M&A) deals will be announced in this segment of the market. These include companies like Juno Therapeutics  and bluebird bio (BLUE  -  Free Report).Meanwhile, the FDA approval of Novartis’ CAR-T therapy also gave the sector a boost indicating the beginning of a new era in the treatment of cancer. The path-breaking immunocellular therapy is a one-time treatment that uses a patient's own T cells to fight cancer.The NYSE ARCA Biotech Index was up almost 9% last week with most biotech stocks recording solid gains.Will the Rally Continue?  Biotech stocks were once a strong favorite chalking up impressive gains until 2015 when the drug pricing issue started weighing on the sector. But the sector rebounded in 2017 and is on a roll since the beginning of the year with the industry gaining 15.9% year to date, outperforming the broader market which is up 10.7%.A key question now facing investors is will the rally continue and is this the right time to invest in this corner of the market?The biotech sector is currently trading at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 40.5, well above the S&P 500 price-to-earnings ratio of 18.3, which makes it rather expensive.However, a look at the sector’s performance over the last five years shows that there is significant room for upside given the five-year high of 111.3%.So, what are the factors that could drive the rally? First and foremost, this is an industry that will continue to witness demand for its products given an aging population and the increasing prevalence of a wide variety of diseases. Strong pipelines, innovative treatments, impressive results, and increased health care spending should support growth. Trump's pro-business stand is also expected to benefit the sector.A faster drug approval process and the proposed removal of outdated regulations that drive up costs and slow down innovation should also work in favor of the sector. The FDA has approved far more drugs so far in 2017 than it did in the whole of 2016.With the Gilead-Kite deal, expectations are that M&A activity will pick pace. Finally, although drug pricing remains a headline risk this year as well, investors now seem to be more comfortable with the drug pricing scenario and are willing to look at the fundamentals of the sector. On the flip side, the estimate revision trend for the sector is not very encouraging. The growing presence of biosimilars, a slowdown in growth of legacy products and high profile pipeline setbacks are also challenges for the sector. And, as we mentioned earlier, drug pricing will remain a headline risk.As far as M&As are concerned, activity in this area could be muted given the “wait and watch” stance adopted by most companies regarding the drug pricing situation and tax reforms. Another major deterrent is high valuations with companies remaining wary of bidding wars leading to over-priced deals.However, licensing deals should continue especially in orphan and rare disease areas as well as highly sought after therapeutic areas like immune-oncology.The bottom-line is that although biotech stocks are definitely not cheap at current levels, there is still some room for upside in this “high risk - high returns” industry. 2017 is expected to be a catalyst-rich year for the sector with several major pipeline events lined up. Some buy-ranked biotech stocks include Gilead, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN  -  Free Report) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN  -  Free Report). While Gilead is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, Regeneron and Alexion are Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks.

The study met all primary and secondary endpoints.Meanwhile, Feraheme continues to grow in both the hospital and hematology/oncology segments.Going forward, AMAG expects service revenues from the Cord Blood Registry (CBR) services (AMAG acquired CBR in Aug 2015) to contribute significantly to the company’s top line owing to continued efforts to increase new enrollments of cord blood and cord tissue units in storage facility, and recurring revenue from a growing base of stored units.The label expansion once approved should further boost the sales of the company.AMAG Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

116,ALXN,"Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) announced that the European Commission has approved the marketing application for a pediatric formulation (granules in capsule for opening) of Mimpara for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT).With this approval, the drug’s label has been expanded to include use in children aged three years and above with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on maintenance dialysis therapy where standard of care therapy cannot adequately control secondary HPT.We remind investors that in June, the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) had rendered a positive opinion, recommending marketing approval of Mimpara for the expanded label.Amgen’s shares have rallied 17.8% this year so far, better than the industry’s 12.3% registered increase.The approval was based on data from studies assessing the use of Mimpara in pediatric secondary HPT patients, conducted by Amgen since 2007.Mimpara is already approved and marketed in the EU as an oral therapy for treating secondary HPT in adult patients with ESRD on maintenance dialysis therapy and for mitigating hypercalcemia in adult patients with parathyroid carcinoma. In the United States, the drug is marketed by the trade name Sensipar.Sensipar/Mimpara generated sales of $427 million in the second quarter of 2017, up 10% year over year. The label expansion is expected to boost international sales of the drug.We remind investors that Sensipar is set to face generic competition in March next year. Many companies are seeking to market the drug’s generic versions regarding formulation patent.Secondary hyperparathyroidism is often progressive in patients suffering from chronic kidney disease (CKD). It affects around 88% of CKD patients on hemodialysis. Meanwhile, very few treatment options are available to treat this condition.Investors must also note that Amgen markets another sHPT medicine, Parsabiv, approved in the United States earlier in February and in the EU, back in November 2016. Parsabiv is approved to treat sHPT in adult patients with CKD on hemodialysis, the first therapy in 12 years to be approved for this condition. The drug has to be administered intravenously thrice a week at the end of a dialysis session.Amgen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

117,ALXN,"Not only is September historically the worst month for the equity market, stocks presently look susceptible to a pullback due to Harvey, North Korea tensions and U.S. government shutdown. However, fresh data have indicated that the domestic economy continues to grow at a steady albeit slow pace. Corporate earnings also continue to impress and from a trading perspective, more market participants are expected this month as vacation time comes to an end.Thanks to these encouraging developments, Wall Street is expected to be more disciplined and prepared to withstand the habitually rough trading period. Thus, investing in solid stocks that have given consistent returns this month will be judicious. The Somber September  Investors shouldn’t sell based solely on the calendar, but, this seasonal peculiarity can’t be ignored as we head into a busy month of trading. Since the World War II, the S&P 500 Index has seen losses in September. Also, September has seen the worst monthly drop in equities on average.Stock Trader’s Almanac found out that since 1950, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones averaged a loss of 0.5% and 0.8%, respectively. The Nasdaq Composite, as incepted in 1971, averaged a loss of 0.5%, as did the Russell 2000 of small-cap stocks since it was started in 1979. Such a dismal performance compelled Jeff deGraaf, head of Renaissance Macro Research, to tell his clients that we are “entering the only month of the year that has statistically significant negative returns.”This year could also spring surprises. With North Korea attacking Japan, hurricane Harvey wreaking havoc and the political climate in the United States losing stability, possibilities of a market correction haunt investors.Market-Jolting Events that Spooked Investors North Korea’s ballistic missile launch over Japanese airspace reignited tensions. This has resumed the logjam between Pyongyang and President Trump that had unnerved markets in August. The South Korea military that was conducting a war game with the United States has been put on alert, while Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called the missile test an “unprecedented, grave and serious threat that seriously damages peace and security in the region.”On the domestic front, Harvey, the first major hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland in almost 12 years, has put vast areas under water. The rainstorm originated from a tropical depression which rapidly ballooned from a Category 1 hurricane to Category 4. It worsened due to a lethal confluence of meteorological events. While it is too early to gauge the financial impact of the hurricane, some experts are calling for losses in the double-digit billions. The hurricane disrupted oil refineries and led to a decline in shares of insurance companies (read more: 4 Home-Improvement Stocks to Buy Post Harvey Mayhem). As if all of that wasn’t enough, anxiety gripping the Wall Street over the debate to raise the federal government’s debt ceiling has frayed relations between President Trump and the Republican leadership. Such disputes, may, further delay the implementation of the promised pro-business policies. In fact, with the disconnect growing, the chances that the government will shut down is 50/50, says Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS  -  Free Report).Positive Economic Environment & Earnings Buoy MarketsBut, let’s be optimistic. Not everything is as dampening about the markets. The U.S. GDP expanded 3% in the second quarter, the fastest rate of growth in more than two years. An uptick in consumer outlays and business investment helped the economy gain traction. Increased spending on goods and services pushed consumer expenditure up 3.3% in the said quarter. Consumer spending – the biggest driver of the economy – picked up on higher income for consumers and low inflation.The second-quarter earnings season, in the meanwhile, has come to an end for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with results from 491 S&P 500 members or 98.2% of the index’s total membership already out. Total earnings for these companies are up 11.2% from the same period last year on 5.6% higher revenues, with 74.3% beating EPS estimates and 68.4% beating revenue estimates (read more: Plenty of Small-Cap Earnings Still to Come).Investors Will be Back, Market to See Some UpsideWith the Labor Day fast approaching, the summer months and vacations are soon to be over. During such holiday periods, major market participants don’t make big moves. Big decisions are often postponed. But, once the summer months come to an end and the markets get back to normal, the major decisions are taken.This suggests that trade will increase and market leaders will return and take control of the equity market in a commanding manner. Furthermore, typically after Labor Day, the market is slow for a day or two before things pick up pace.5 Top-Performing Stocks for SeptemberSeptember may be a rocky month for the stock market. But, as mentioned above, there are positives that may propel the broader markets.

118,ALXN,"Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved a label expansion for its drug, Austedo. With the latest FDA approval, Austedo’s label has been expanded to include treatment of tardive dyskinesia, a debilitating and often irreversible movement disorder.We remind investors that Austedo was approved for treating chorea associated with Huntington’s disease in April 2017. Both TD and chorea are characterized by involuntary or diminished voluntary movement of muscles.Shares of the company are up almost 2.4% in pre-market trading. However, shares of Teva have underperformed the industry so far this year as it is facing challenges in the U.S. generic industry. The company’s shares have plunged 57.1% while the industry has lost 20.1% in that period.Coming back to the news, the FDA approval for TD was based on data from two pivotal studies - AIM-TD and ARM-TD - demonstrating statistically significant reduction in severity of abnormal involuntary movements associated with tardive dyskinesia.Teva's chief scientific officer said that Austedo has a flexible dosing regimen and it also doesn’t affect the ongoing treatment for the underlying condition, which caused the TD disorder.Teva is also evaluating Austedo in a phase I study for another involuntary movement disease, Tourette syndrome.Per the company’s press release, TD affects approximately 500,000 people in the U.S. In April 2017, the FDA had approved Neurocrine Biosciences’ Ingrezza as a treatment for adults with TD, which is expected to give competition to Austedo in this indication.Teva is offering free service to provide support to new patients as well as those already on Austedo therapy.Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited Price and Consensus  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited Price and Consensus | Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited QuoteZacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderTeva Pharma has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the health care sector include Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

119,ALXN,"Roche Holding AG’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report), member, Genentech announced that the FDA has approved a label expansion for Actemra (tocilizumab).  Actemra is now approved for the treatment of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell-induced severe or life-threatening cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in patients aged between two years and older. CRS, which is caused by an overactive immune response, has been identified as a potentially severe and life-threatening side effect of CAR T cell therapy for certain cancers. This is the first FDA-approved treatment to manage severe cytokine release syndrome associated with CAR T cell therapy.Roche’s shares have underperformed the industry year to date. The stock has gained 10% compared with the industry’s gain of 11.1% in the same time frame.We note that Actemra is already approved for the treatment of adult patients suffering from moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have used one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as methotrexate (MTX) that did not provide enough relief.  Actemra is also approved to be used as an IV formulation for patients with active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (PJIA) or systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) aged between two years and older. Actemra subcutaneous injection is also approved for the treatment of adult patients with giant cell arteritis (GCA).Coming back to the release, the FDA’s approval was based on a retrospective analysis of pooled outcome data from studies of CAR T cell therapies for blood cancers, which evaluated the efficacy of Actemra in the treatment of CRS.The FDA had granted priority review and orphan drug designation to Actemra for treating CAR T cell-induced CRS based on the rare, severe, and life-threatening nature of CRS and available data on the safety and efficacy of Actemra.A label expansion of the drug will boost Actemra sales.On August 30, the CAR-T cells space got a significant boost when the FDA approved Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) suspension for intravenous infusion, the first chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy, for the treatment of patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that is refractory or in second or later relapse.

120,ALXN,"BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (BMRN  -  Free Report) announced that the Biologics License Application (BLA) for pegvaliase has been accepted by the FDA for priority review. A decision is expected on Feb 28, 2018.BioMarin is looking to get pegvaliase approved for lowering blood phenylalanine (Phe) levels in adult patients with phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic enzyme deficiency disorder, who have uncontrolled blood Phe levels with existing treatment options.However, the regulatory body has requested additional information onchemistry, manufacturing, and controls related to pegvaliase. The company expects the submission of the information to the FDA to be classified as a major amendment that will extend the review process by three months.An application in the EU is expected to be filed by the end of the year.BioMarin’s shares are up 0.2% so far this year, which compares unfavorably with an increase of 9.7% registered by the industry during this period.We remind investors that pegvaliase’s development/regulatory process has not exactly been smooth. The drug has faced several delays and setbacks, which makes the latest announcement a big positive for BioMarin.BioMarin is hoping that pegvaliase, if approved, will supplement BioMarin’s phenylketonuria portfolio, which also includes Kuvan. A potential approval will strengthen BioMarin’s commercial leadership in the treatment of PKU, which can drive the company's revenues going forward.Kuvan generated revenues of $194 million in the first half of 2017, up 16.4% year over year.However, Kuvan is set to face generic competition from 2020. The approval of pegvaliase will help BioMarin to offset any loss of revenues from Kuvan.According to information provided by the company, approximately 50,000 individuals in the developed countries are diagnosed with PKU, which represents a significant need for such therapies.BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.

122,ALXN,"Advanced Accelerator Applications S.A.  announced that the FDA has accepted and considered complete the resubmission of the New Drug Application (NDA) for its investigational drug lutetium Lu 177 dotatate (Lutathera). The FDA has set an action date of Jan 26, 2018.Advanced Accelerator is looking to get Lutathera approved for the treatment of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) in adults.Advanced Accelerator’s shares have outperformed the industry year to date. The stock rallied 82.5% as against the industry’s decline of 1.2%, over the same time frame.We remind investors that Advanced Accelerator received a complete response letter (CRL) from the FDA for the NDA for Lutathera in December last year. The FDA showed concerns about issues related with format, traceability, uniformity, and completeness relating to the NETTER-1 (phase III study that compared treatment using lutetium Lu 177 oxodotreotide with a double dose of Octreotide LAR) and Erasmus (Phase I/II study conducted in patients with a wide range of NET indications) clinical datasets.Further, the CRL requested subgroup analyses for gender, age and racial subgroups, as well as other stratification factors and important disease characteristics. The CRL also noted that that any observations made during inspections of manufacturing facilities supporting the NDA need to be resolved prior to approval of the NDA. However, the FDA did not request for additional studies.The company resubmitted the application in July 2017 after taking into consideration the concerns expressed by the FDA.  As part of this process, the company sent a test dataset to the FDA to confirm that the data and format were compatible and able to be analyzed. Further, the company also engaged a team of consultants experienced in FDA reviews to perform a rigorous critique of both the datasets and the major clinical sections of the dossier prior to resubmitting.Last month, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued a positive opinion recommending the marketing authorization of lutetium for the treatment of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) in adults.Advanced Accelerator Applications S.A.

Sales of Tresiba increased 149% in local currencies in the first half of 2017.Consequently, Novo Nordisk’s shares have outperformed the industry year to date. The stock has rallied 29.9% compared with the industry’s gain of 11.3% in the same time frame. Earlier this week, Novo Nordisk announced that the FDA has approved the label expansion of Victoza. The diabetes drug is now approved as a treatment to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular (CV) events including heart attack, stroke and CV death, in adults with type II diabetes and established CV disease.The FDA’s approval was based on data from the pivotal LEADER study on CV outcomes, which evaluated the drug in more than 9,300 people with type II diabetes at high risk of major CV events. Markedly, the data from the study demonstrated that Victoza significantly reduced the risk of CV death. The drug lowered the risk of non-fatal heart attack or non-fatal stroke by 13% compared with placebo and showed an absolute risk reduction of 1.9%.We believe the Canadian approval for Tresiba and the label expansion for Victoza should improve the diabetes revenues of the Danish phama giant going forward.Novo Nordisk A/S Price Novo Nordisk A/S Price | Novo Nordisk A/S QuoteZacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderNovo Nordisk currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

125,ALXN,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) announced that its regulatory applications for tezacaftor/ivacaftor (Kalydeco) combination have been accepted by the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for review.The regulatory applications have been filed to seek approval of Kalydeco in combination with tezacaftor (VX-661) for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients (12 and older) with two copies of the F508del mutation.We note that Kalydeco is already approved for the treatment of patients (two years and above) with CF who have one of 33 mutations in their cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene.Meanwhile, the application in the U.S. has been granted a priority review with the FDA expected to give its decision on Feb 28, 2018.Shares of Vertex were up 1.9% on Thursday. In-fact, Vertex’s share price is up a massive 111.9% so far this year, comparing favorably with an increase of 7.9%for the industry.Coming back to the latest news, the regulatory applications in the U.S. and EU were submitted on the basis of positive outcome from two phase III studies – EVOLVE and EXPAND. Data from the studies was announced in March this year. Both studies met their primary endpoints and demonstrated statistically significant improvements in lung function in patients with CF.The combination had also been granted Orphan Drug designation by the FDA.Per the company’s press release, approximately 75,000 people in North America, Europe and Australia suffer from CF. In fact, more than 29% people of ages 12 years or older have two copies of the F508del mutation, and more than 1,500 people of the age 12 have one mutation. Hence, approval of the drug will provide the company access to a huge base of patients affected by the disease and bring it closer to the goal of serving people with the disease.In fact, Vertex’s CF pipeline is quite strong with a broad portfolio of next-generation CF correctors.Vertex is evaluating some next-generation CFTR correctors (VX-152, VX-440, VX-659 and VX-445) as part of a triple combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor.Data from VX-152 and VX-440 phase II and VX-659 phase I triple combination studies, conducted on CF patients who have one F508del mutation and one minimal function mutation (F508del/Min), were presented in July 2017. The data demonstrated that all three combinations led to pronounced improvement in lung function. In fact, these are the first data to show the potential to treat the underlying cause of CF in patients who have a severe and difficult-to-treat type of the disease.Following discussions with regulatory agencies, Vertex will initiate pivotal phase III studies on one or two of the four triple combination regimens in the first half of 2018.Its triple combination CF regimens are considered crucial for long-term growth. If the triple-combo regimes are successful, Vertex can address a significantly larger CF patient population– almost 90% of patients with CF - in the future.Vertex carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked biotech stocks include Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

130,ALXN,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN  -  Free Report) got a boost with the EU approving its key revenue driver Soliris for an additional indication. Meanwhile, Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) was in the news with an investigation being launched into the rising prices of multiple sclerosis (""MS"") drugs. The investigation has been launched by Rep. Elijah E. Cummings and Rep. Peter Welch with letters being sent to seven companies including Biogen requesting information about their pricing strategies for their MS drugs.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesEU Label Expansion for Alexion’s Soliris: Alexion’s flagship  product, Soliris, gained EU approval for the treatment of patients with refractory generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) making it the first and only complement-based therapy approved in the EU for an ultra-rare subset of gMG. Alexion will launch Soliris for this indication initially in Germany and is evaluating additional EU launches.The gMG indication represents incremental growth opportunity for Soliris and enables the company to enter the neurology therapeutic area. Soliris is currently under review in the U.S. and Japan (response expected early next year) for the gMG indication. With the EU granting approval, it looks like Soliris will gain approval in the U.S. as well where a decision is expected by Oct 23, 2017. According to information provided by the company, about 60,000 – 80,000 people in the U.S. suffer from myasthenia gravis (MG) – Alexion’s targeted population will be approximately 5%-10% of the total MG patient population. Results from a late-stage study (REGAIN) conducted by the company indicate that about 60% of these refractory gMG patients will respond to treatment with Soliris.Soliris is Alexion’s key growth driver with the drug bringing in sales of $1.6 billion in the first half of 2017. The company expects Soliris revenues of $3,075 - $3,125 million in 2017, assuming the identification of a steady number of new patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) across the globe (Also read: Alexion's Soliris' Label Expansion Approved in Europe).Alexion is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock.

132,ALXN,"The second quarter earnings season is drawing to a close with 94.8% of S&P 500 stocks having reported results as of Aug 18, 2017. Thirteen of the 16 Zacks sectors recorded earnings growth with total earnings increasing 10.6% from the year-ago period on revenue growth of 5.6%. While 74.9% beat earnings estimates, 68.4% topped revenue expectations.  The Medical sector is one of the sectors to consistently record earnings growth over the last few quarters. The sector, which recorded earnings growth of 5.7% on revenue growth of 5.8% in Q1, has recorded earnings growth of 6.7% on the back of revenue growth of 4.3% so far in Q2. A look at the beat ratio shows earnings beat of 82.7% and revenue beat of 67.3%.Biotech stocks specifically fared pretty well with most of the key players topping earnings and revenue expectations. Quite a few companies raised their outlook for the year as well. Biotech stocks have had a strong run so far in 2017 with the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index soaring 15% year-to-date (YTD). This is in sharp contrast to last year’s performance when the Index was down 19.1%. There were several reasons for the sector’s dismal performance last year foremost being the drug pricing controversy. Although drug pricing remains a headline risk this year as well, investors now seem to be more comfortable with the drug pricing scenario and are willing to look at the fundamentals of the sector.The FDA has also approved more drugs so far this year than it did in the whole of 2016. Last year, 22 drugs were approved while 28 have gained approval so far in 2017. Some of the drugs approved this year represent blockbuster potential.The second half of 2017 is expected to be catalyst rich for quite a few companies with data expected across a wide range of therapeutics areas. As far as mergers and acquisitions are concerned, we do not expect much activity in this area given the “wait and watch” stance adopted by most companies regarding the drug pricing situation and tax reforms. Another deterrent could be high valuations with companies remaining wary of bidding wars leading to over-priced deals.However, licensing deals should continue especially in orphan and rare disease areas as well as highly sought after therapeutic areas like immune-oncology.Our ChoicesHere is a look at four biotech stocks that delivered positive earnings surprises in the second quarter and are witnessing upward revisions in earnings estimates for 2017. All these companies are either Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stocks - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report): New Haven, CT-based Alexion delivered a “beat and raise” quarter with flagship product, Soliris (eculizumab) continuing to perform well. Alexion is working on expanding Soliris’ label and has a key catalyst coming up with a decision from the FDA expected by Oct 23, 2017, regarding the approvability of Soliris for refractory generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG). Alexion got a boost this week with Soliris gaining EU approval for this indication making it the first and only complement-based therapy approved for an ultra-rare subset of gMG. The gMG indication represents incremental growth opportunity for Soliris.Alexion, which had a rough 2016 with shares falling 35.9%, looks set to recover lost ground with shares increasing 9.1% so far in 2017, outperforming the 4.9% rally of the industry it belongs to. The efforts of the company’s new management team to turn things around are impressive. Alexion is redefining its R&D strategy with a focus on its key expertise areas. The company will continue to grow its rare diseases business which includes growing Soliris, Strensiq and Kanuma. To increase productivity, Alexion will focus its internal research efforts on its complement expertise and its development efforts on its core therapeutic areas of hematology, nephrology, neurology and metabolic disorders. The company has also decided to de-prioritize certain pipeline candidates and is discontinuing its preclinical programs with mRNA therapies as well as other preclinical programs that do not fall within the complement franchise. Alexion, a Zacks Rank #1 stock, has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 5.3% upward over the last 30 days.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report): Tarrytown, NY-based Regeneron's key areas of focus include eye diseases, heart disease, allergic and inflammatory diseases, pain, cancer, infectious diseases and rare diseases. While eye drug, Eylea, the company’s key growth driver continues to perform well, Regeneron has been working on diversifying its portfolio and gained FDA approval for two drugs this year - Dupixent (moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis) and Kevzara (moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis). Both drugs have blockbuster potential.The company also has a strong pipeline and has an eventful second half of the year coming up with key mid-to-late stage pipeline catalysts lined up. Top-line phase III data on Dupixent for asthma are due later this quarter – positive data would allow the company to go ahead with a U.S. filing in the fourth quarter. Dupixent should also gain EU approval for the eczema indication in the third quarter. Regeneron is evaluating Dupixent in the pediatric atopic dermatitis setting. Another important data readout scheduled for the second half of the year is on the company’s PD-1 antibody REGN2810, for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), the second most common skin cancer after basal cell carcinoma and the second deadliest skin cancer after melanoma. Positive data would allow the company to file for FDA approval in the first quarter of 2018.Meanwhile, Eylea is being evaluated in combination with nesvacumab. Top-line data from two phase II studies - one in wet age-related macular degeneration and another in diabetic macular edema - are expected in the fourth quarter of the year.Regeneron has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 15.2% upward over the last 30 days.

Moreover, the launch of an educational campaign in Oct 2016 to encourage testing of baby boomers has led to an 80% increase in HCV antibody screening by baby boomers, which in turn has led to an increase in diagnosis. The company’s HIV franchise also continues to do well and the company is progressing with its pipeline that includes treatments under evaluation for cancer, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and inflammatory diseases.

133,ALXN,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report) announced that the European Commission (EC) approved a label expansion of lead drug Soliris.The European Commission expanded the indication for Soliris to include the treatment of refractory generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in adults who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody-positive.We note that Soliris is approved for two severe and ultra-rare disorders resulting from chronic uncontrolled activation of the complement component of the immune system – paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS).In order to increase the commercial potential of the drug further, Alexion is working on expanding Soliris’ label into additional indications. Alexion has aslo filed regulatory application to the FDA for expanding the use of Soliris for the treatment of refractory gMG in patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody-positive. The FDA accepted the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) and set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date of Oct 23.A potential label expansion in the U.S. will boost sales further.  Soliris will be launched for this new indication initially in Germany while Alexion is evaluating launches in additional EU countries.Alexion’s stock price has increased 9.1%, outperforming the industry’s gain of 5.3%.Additionally, a phase III study (PREVENT) on Soliris in patients with relapsing neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder is ongoing with enrolment being expected to be completed in 2017 and data expected in 2018. Label expansion into additional indications will give Soliris access to a higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug significantly.We note that Soliris has received Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) for the treatment of patients with MG in the U.S. and EU, and for the treatment of patients with refractory gMG in Japan.We expect growth at Alexion to continue being driven by Soliris. Other new products – Strensiq and Kanuma – are doing well and are expected to boost revenues. However, Soliris quarter-to-quarter revenue growth ($70 million - $100 million) will be impacted by the enrolment ramp-up of trials.The company is expecting Soliris revenues to be lower in the second half of the year due to an accelerating impact from the ALXN1210 trials.

135,ALXN,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Adamas Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ADMS  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further confirms weakness in ADMS.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen three estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from a loss of $3.52 a share a month ago to its current level of a loss of $3.90.Also, for the current quarter, Adamas has seen three downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to a loss of $1.07 a share from 94 cents over the past 30 days.  The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 20.4% in the past month.Adamas Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

(REGN  -  Free Report) - fared in the second quarter and which one looks better-positioned for the second half of the year.An In-Depth Look at 2Q17 Results: Both Regeneron and Alexion surpassed earnings as well as revenue expectations in the second quarter. Regeneron’s earnings results were driven by strong Eylea sales as well as a lower tax rate. Flagship drug, Eylea, continued to perform well though PCSK9 inhibitor, Praluent, continues to lag. The company is in discussions with payers with respect to improvement in utilization management criteria. Meanwhile, CVS announced that it would provide co-preferred access to Praluent through its CVS Caremark commercial formularies, which cover approximately 25 million lives (Also read: Regeneron Beats on Q2 Earnings & Sales, Raises View). Focus was also on new product launches – Dupixent (eczema) and Kevzara (rheumatoid arthritis).  Alexion’s results were driven by the performance of flagship drug, Soliris, and continued momentum of Strensiq. The company, however, noted that revenues benefited by $35 million reflecting the favorable timing of orders (Also read: Alexion Tops Q2 Earnings & Revenues, Ups 2017 View).2017 Outlook: Regeneron raised its U.S. sales growth outlook for Eylea to approximately 10% (old guidance: single digit percentage). The company also lowered its expected tax rate for the year.Alexion also raised its outlook for the year. The company expects earnings of $5.40 - $5.55 per share on revenues of $3,450 - $3,525 million (old guidance: $5.10 - $5.30 per share on revenues of $3,400 - $3,500 million).Pipeline Catalysts: For any pharmaceutical or biotech company, the pipeline is of utmost importance and plays an important role in investment decisions. So, it always makes sense to take a look at a company’s pipeline and upcoming catalysts.Regeneron, which has 17 candidates in its pipeline, has an eventful second half of the year coming up with key mid-to-late stage pipeline catalysts lined up. Top-line phase III data on Dupixent for asthma are due later this quarter – positive data would allow the company to go ahead with a U.S. filing in the fourth quarter. Dupixent should also gain EU approval for the eczema indication in the third quarter. Regeneron is evaluating Dupixent in the pediatric atopic dermatitis setting with a phase III study in children 12 to 17 years of age currently enrolling while two additional studies in younger atopic dermatitis patients (the first in children between the ages of 6 and 11, and the second in children between the ages of six months and five years) expected to commence in the second half of the year.Another important data readout scheduled for the second half of the year is on the company’s PD-1 antibody REGN2810, for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), the second most common skin cancer after basal cell carcinoma and the second deadliest skin cancer after melanoma. Positive data would allow the company to file for FDA approval in the first quarter of 2018. REGB2810 is being evaluated for additional indications as well.Meanwhile, Eylea is being evaluated in combination with nesvacumab. Top-line data from two phase II studies - one in wet age-related macular degeneration and another in diabetic macular edema – are expected in the fourth quarter of the year.Regeneron also expects to report top-line data in the second half of the year from a late-stage program on REGN2222, which is being evaluated for prophylaxis of respiratory syncytial virus.Meanwhile, Alexion is redefining its R&D strategy with a focus on its key expertise areas. The company will continue to grow its rare diseases business which includes growing Soliris, Strensiq and Kanuma. To increase productivity, Alexion will focus its internal research efforts on its complement expertise and its development efforts on its core therapeutic areas of hematology, nephrology, neurology and metabolic disorders. The company has also decided to de-prioritize certain pipeline candidates and is discontinuing its preclinical programs with mRNA therapies as well as other preclinical programs that do not fall within the complement franchise.Alexion has a key regulatory event coming up with the FDA expected to give a decision by Oct 23 regarding the label expansion of Soliris for refractory generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG). A decision in the EU should also come out in the third quarter. Moreover, enrolment for a phase III study on Soliris for relapsing neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is expected to finish this year.Estimate Revisions: Both companies have been witnessing upward revisions in earnings estimates for 2017. While Regeneron has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 31.3% upward over the last 30 days, Alexion has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 4.8% upward during this period.Price and Valuation Perspective: A look at Regeneron’s year-to-date (YTD) price performance shows that its shares have gained 27.1% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 6.2% rally.Alexion has also performed better than the industry with shares gaining 8.7 % YTD.Going by the current price-to-earnings multiple, which is often used to value profitable biotech stocks, Regeneron is trading at a P/E multiple of 41.4, well above the S&P 500 P/E multiple of 17.8. Alexion looks slightly cheaper given its P/E multiple of 25.7.Bottom LineAt present, Regeneron looks like the better pick to us. Eylea continues to show strength and we are encouraged by the company’s progress with its pipeline. Regeneron has a deep and promising pipeline and has some important pipeline events this year which could act as positive catalysts.As far as Alexion is concerned, we are impressed by the new management’s efforts to turn things around. Alexion had a rough 2016 with the company facing several challenges including a probe into improper sales practices, the departure of key executives and pipeline setbacks. We are encouraged by the company’s decision to re-prioritize its efforts toward core areas. However, it could take a while before things fall into place. Soliris sales are expected to be lower in the second half of the year taking into account the favorable order timing in Q2 as well as the accelerating impact of the ALXN1210 studies.Regeneron and Alexion are both Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks.

145,ALXN,"It’s not been a good quarter for Israel-based generic drug maker, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (TEVA  -  Free Report). Teva missed on both second quarter earnings and revenues and lowered its outlook for 2017. The company’s shares are down significantly following the release of disappointing second quarter results. Year-to-date (YTD), Teva has lost 52.6% of its value versus the 17.4% decline of its industry.What Went Wrong?A key reason for Teva’s dismal performance was generic pricing erosion. The sharp decline in generic drug prices, while a blessing for patients, is proving to be a major challenge for generic drugmakers as well as drug distributors.On its second quarter call, Teva said that the ongoing consolidation of customers has led to increasing price erosion and decreasing volume. The consolidation in the industry has increased the ability to negotiate lower prices for generic drugs. Teva said that the finalization of both prices and volumes of its inline products with one of its largest customers, Claris One, and other new contracts had a greater-than-expected negative impact on second quarter results and the outlook for the rest of the year.Moreover, the FDA is speeding up the approval of generic drugs which means more competition, increasing price cuts and decreasing volume. Teva said that price erosion was around 6% in the second quarter and is expected to increase to high-single digits over the remainder of the year. All these headwinds will persist for the U.S. Generics unit in the near future, resulting in lower revenue and profit in this segment in 2018 and potentially 2019.Meanwhile, the company said that it does not expect any earnings contribution from its businesses in Venezuela given the significant devaluation of the Venezuelan currency.Teva also cut its dividend by 75% and could be at risk of breaching its covenants if cash flow is hit by lower-than-expected proceeds from potential divestments or if there is a delay into early 2018 (Also read: Teva Plunges to 10-Year Low, Credit Rating in Jeopardy).Zacks Rank & Estimate RevisionsTeva is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock. With the company reporting disappointing results and lowering its outlook, Teva has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 10.3% downward over the last 7 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings was revised 14.9% downward over the last 7 days.  Teva has many challenges ahead – paying down debt, divesting non-core businesses to increase focus on core areas and generate cash, hiring a permanent CEO, delivering on the pipeline and getting the U.S. generics business back on track.While Teva deals with these challenges, here is a look at 4 drug companies that sport a strong Zacks Rank and look well-positioned.Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report): New Haven, CT-based Alexion reported a “beat and raise” quarter with flagship product, Soliris (eculizumab) continuing to perform well. Alexion is working on expanding Soliris’ label and has a key catalyst coming up with a decision from the FDA expected by Oct 23, 2017, regarding the approvability of Soliris for refractory generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG). Meanwhile, a decision in the EU, where a positive CHMP opinion was received, is also expected in the third quarter.Alexion, which had a rough 2016 with shares falling 35.9%, looks set to recover lost ground with shares increasing 8.1% so far in 2017, outperforming the 5.6% rally of the industry it belongs to. The company’s new management team is focusing on Alexion’s expertise area of complement biology and core therapeutic areas of hematology, nephrology, neurology, and metabolic disorders. Alexion will be working on growing its rare disease business.

(REGN  -  Free Report): Regeneron's key focus areas include eye diseases, heart disease, allergic and inflammatory diseases, pain, cancer, infectious diseases and rare diseases.

Both drugs have blockbuster potential. The company also has a strong pipeline comprising 17 candidates including for cancer and has key data readouts lined up for the second half of the year. Regeneron has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 31.3% upward over the last 7 days.Regeneron, a Zacks Rank #1 stock, has gained 25.3% year to date, substantially outperforming the 5.6% rally of the industry it belongs to.

Sanofi has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 3.1% upward over the last 30 days. Although the company’s diabetes segment will remain under pressure, new product approvals and sales ramp up of recently launched products should provide some support.Sanofi is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock.

146,ALXN,"Investors in Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the August 18th, 2017 $65.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Alexion Pharmaceuticals shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Alexion Pharmaceuticals is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) in the Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry that ranks in the Top 39% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one analyst has revised the estimate downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.16 per share to $1.13 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Alexion Pharmaceuticals right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

147,ALXN,"Puma Biotechnology, Inc.

The company had reported a loss of $2.05.Shares of Puma Biotech were down 1.9% on Wednesday. However, so far this year, Puma’s shares have outperformed the industry. Specifically, the company’s shares have risen 159% this year while the industry registered an increase of 8.8%. Puma Biotechnology’s lead pipeline candidate, neratinib received FDA approval in July as an extended adjuvant treatment for patients with early-stage HER2-overexpressed/amplified breast cancer, who have also been previously treated with Roche Holding AG’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Herceptin-based adjuvant therapy. The FDA approval was a huge boost for the company, given the immense commercial potential in the target market.The drug was launched by the trade name of Nerlynx in early August. However, no sales from the drug will be recorded in the second quarter.Neratinib is also under review in the EU for the same indication with an opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the EMA expected in the first quarter of 2018.With no other approved products in Puma Biotech’s portfolio, the company did not generate any revenues in the second quarter.In the second quarter, research and development (R&D) expenses were $53.3 million, down 1.7% from the year-ago quarter due to lower clinical trial costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses however increased 102% year over year to $24.9 million due to higher professional fees, payroll costs and other corporate expenses.Additional Studies on NerlynxSeveral additional studies on Nerlynx targeting different types of breast cancer patient populations and in earlier line settings are currently underway. Puma believes that Nerlynx can also be developed for the treatment of other cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and other tumor types, which over-express or have a mutation in HER2. In June, at the annual meeting of American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the company announced positive results from a single cohort of a three-arm phase II study evaluating neratinib for treating HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer that has metastasized to the brain.In addition, several phase II combination studies on neratinib for the treatment of breast cancer are ongoing.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderPuma currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Puma Biotechnology Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Puma Biotechnology Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Puma Biotechnology Inc QuoteSome better-ranked stocks in the pharmaceutical sector are Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.56 million. Revenues comprised royalty and license fee revenues received under various non-imetelstat license agreements.Research and development (R&D) expenses declined 45.6% to $2.5 million due to lower costs for the proportionate share of clinical development costs for imetelstat. General and administrative expenses declined 2.2% to $4.4 million due to reduced consulting costs.The company ended the quarter with $117.2 million in cash and investments compared with $121.7 million at the end of the first quarter.Pipeline UpdateGeron is developing anti-cancer therapies based on telomerase inhibitors. The company currently has one candidate in its pipeline, imetelstat. It is being developed for the treatment of hematologic myeloid malignancies like myelofibrosis (MF) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Geron has a collaboration with Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) subsidiary Janssen for imetelstat.In Sep 2016, Janssen announced unfavorable findings from the planned internal reviews of initial data from the two studies of imetelstat,  IMbark (phase II) for the treatment of MF and IMerge (phase II/III) for the treatment of MDS.However, in Apr 2017, Geron informed that Janssen has completed the second internal data review of the two studies and as a result of the review, both trials are continuing unmodifiedFor IMerge, Janssen said that the benefit/risk profile of imetelstat in the treated patients supports continued development in lower risk MDS indication. Geron mentioned that if Janssen decides to proceed to Part 2 of IMerge (a larger, 170 patient, phase III study), patient enrollment will begin in the fourth quarter of this year. Last month, Geron announced that Part 1 of IMerge will be expanded to enroll additional patients in a refined MDS population to confirm the clinical benefit and safety observed from the current result.For IMbark, the results suggested that the clinical benefit and a potential overall survival benefit observed supports continuation of the trial without modifications. Janssen is expected to evaluate maturing data from the IMbark study during next year, including an assessment of overall survival.Last month, Geron said it expects Janssen, upon examining overall survival, to make a continuation decision in the third quarter of 2018.Geron Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Geron Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Geron Corporation QuoteStocks to ConsiderGeron currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

149,ALXN,"Life science company, Bayer AG (BAYRY  -  Free Report), reported a mixed second quarter with earnings surpassing expectations but sales falling short. While the Pharmaceuticals, Animal Health and Covestro segments recorded a year-over-year increase in sales, the Crop Science and Consumer Health divisions recorded a decline.The Crop Science business was hit by high channel inventories in Brazil, the world’s second-largest agriculture market, while a difficult environment in the U.S. market weighed on the performance of the Consumer Health segment. Given the performance of these two segments, the company now expects 2017 sales of more than €49 billion instead of sales of about €51 billion.Core earnings per share from continuing operations are now expected to grow by a low- to mid-single-digit percentage (old guidance: mid- to high-single-digit percentage).The Life Science businesses are expected to generate sales of €35 billion - €36 billion (previously: approximately €37 billion). The company lowered its outlook for the Consumer Health and Crop Science segments. The second half of the year is expected to be weak for the Consumer Health business with sales expected in the range of €6 billion (previously: more than €6 billion).The Crop Science business is now expected to generate sales of less than €10 billion (previously: sales of more than €10 billion).Given the lowered outlook, Bayer has been witnessing downward revisions in earnings estimates for both 2017 and 2018 over the last 30 days.

151,ALXN,"The earnings season is off to a flying start with almost 75% of the companies having surpassed expectations. The performance has been quite impressive for Biotech companies, with major players beating market estimates. President Donald Trump’s failure to implement the healthcare bill was a positive for the biotech space (read: Can Biotech ETFs Continue to Surge Higher?).This week four major biotech players announced their quarterly results. Amgen Inc (AMGN  -  Free Report), Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report), Biogen Inc (BIIB  -  Free Report) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN  -  Free Report), all beat earnings and revenue estimates (read: Forget Big Tech, Biotech ETFs are Soaring Higher).Earnings in FocusAmgen reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $3.27 per share on July 25, 2017, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.09 and increasing more than 15.1% from $2.84 per share in the year-ago quarter.

154,ALXN,"The second quarter earnings season is off to a strong start. As of July 25, approximately 128 S&P 500 companies or 36.1% of the index’s total membership have reported results.  A deep look into the results show that earnings for the companies reported so far are up 7% year over year on 4.2% higher revenues. Of these, 77.3% have topped earnings estimates while 70.3% have beat on revenue estimates. However, the pace of growth is below the first quarter but in line with the four-quarter average and has improved over the 12-quarter average. Going forward, estimates for the third quarter are going down. The estimate for Q3 growth is 4.8%, down from 6% at the start of the quarter.The Pharma sector has more or less combated the overall decline in the financial markets and maintained momentum.  Last week, industry bellwether Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) reported mixed second-quarter results, beating on earnings but missing on sales. Swiss major Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) reported encouraging second-quarter results. Meanwhile, biotech giant Biogen Inc.

Last quarter, the company beat earnings estimates by 16.7%.Bristol-Myers has a decent track record so far. The company’s earnings beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 8.39%. Currently, the company has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and a 0.00% Earnings ESP .

Other key products – Pomalyst/Imnovid, Abraxane and Otezla continue to perform well. In the second-quarter call, investors are expected to remain focused on the company’s performance and label expansion efforts, along with updates on the pipeline front.

155,ALXN,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Alexion Pharmaceuticals is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for ALXN in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.15 per share for ALXN, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.08 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for ALXN, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +6.48% heading into earnings season.Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

156,ALXN,"Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ICPT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 31.In the last reported quarter, the company beat expectations by 15.4%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Intercept’s share price movement in the year so far reveals that the stock outperformed the industry. The company’s shares have rallied 18.3% during this period compared with the industry’s 12.8% gain.Surprise HistoryIntercept’s track record has been decent so far, with the company surpassing expectations in three of the last four quarters. The company has posted an average positive earnings surprise of 0.06% over this period.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Intercept is likely to beat estimates this quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients, a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is at +9.39%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at a loss of $3.28 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of $3.62. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Intercept currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors at PlayIntercept received a major boost with the FDA’s approval (in May 2016) of its lead drug, Ocaliva, in combination with ursodeoxycholic (UDCA), for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA or as monotherapy in adults unable to bear with UDCA. In Dec 2016, the European Commission also granted conditional approval to Ocaliva for the same indication.Ocaliva generated sales of $20.6 million in the last quarter.The initial uptake of Ocaliva has been encouraging and sales of the drug is expected topick up further in 2017.Meanwhile, Ocaliva is being evaluated for other indications including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).Intercept expects operating expenses in the range of $380–$420 million in 2017 to support the continued commercialization of Ocaliva in PBC in the United States and other markets, sustained clinical development for OCA in PBC and NASH and the continued advancement of INT-767 and other pipeline programs.The company initiated a phase III study (REGENERATE) on Ocaliva for the treatment of non-cirrhotic NASH in patients with advanced liver fibrosis. The FDA approved a redesign of the REGENERATE trial for the safety and efficacy in treating NASH patients with liver fibrosis. The company now needs to achieve only one co-primary endpoint – either fibrosis improvement or NASH resolution as compared to the earlier target of achieving both. The sample size of the trial has also been reduced to approximately 750 patients or about 250 patients per arm. The company plans to complete enrolment for the interim analysis cohort in the REGENERATE trial soon (data readout in 2019).Intercept also initiated a phase II study, CONTROL (Combination OCA aNdsTatins for monitoRing Of Lipids), on OCA. Enrolment in the study was completed in third-quarter 2016, with top-line data expected shortly. The company also plans to initiate a phase III trial on Ocaliva in NASH patients with cirrhosis in the second half of 2017. The company also expects top-line results from the phase II trial, AESOP, in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). We expect investors to remain focused on sales ramp-up of Ocaliva and pipeline updates on the call.Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

157,ALXN,"Exelixis, Inc. (EXEL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 2, after the market closes.Exelixis’ track record is outstanding. The company has surpassed expectations in all the four trailing quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 512.1%.Exelixis’ share price has increased 82.6% year to date compared with the Zacks classified industry’s gain of 11.7%.Factors Likely to Impact ResultsExelixis received a major boost with the FDA approval of Cabometyx tablets in Apr 2016 for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).The initial uptake of the drug was encouraging and is expected to propel the top line in the forthcoming quarters in 2017. The sequential increase in Cabometyx sales is also a positive. Moreover, Cabometyx was also approved in the EU.Meanwhile, Exelixis is developing cabozantinib in a broad development program. In Oct 2016, the company announced positive results from the phase II CABOSUN study on cabozantinib versus sunitinib in formerly untreated advanced RCC, which was presented at ESMO 2016. Based on the CABOSUN results, the company has planned to submit a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for cabozantinib for treating first-line advanced RCC in the third quarter of 2017. The company presented further positive analysis from the trial in Jun 2017. A potential label expansion of the drug will further boost results.In early 2017, Exelixis collaborated with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report) to evaluate cabozantinib in combination with Opdivo alone or in combination with Yervoy in a phase III trial in first-line RCC, and potentially in other tumor types including (HCC and bladder cancer. Exelixis will also evaluate Cabometyx in combination with Tecentriq, an anti-PD-L1 antibody, in patients with advanced RCC or bladder cancer. In Jun 2017, Exelixis initiated the dose-escalation stage of a phase Ib trial of cabozantinib in combination with Tecentriq. The drug will be evaluated in patients suffering from locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) or RCC. These collaborations allow Exelixis to earn milestone payments and royalties that boost its top line.However, expenses will continue to increase. Exelixis expects total costs and operating expenses for 2017 in the range of $290 million–$310 million.Exelixis, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Exelixis, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Exelixis, Inc. QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Exelixis is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) to be able to beat earnings. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -33.3% since the Most Accurate is 2 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 3 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks Rank: Exelixis sports a Zacks Rank #1 which is favorable. However, this when combined with a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and #5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some health care stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +33.3% and a Zacks Rank #1.

Net product sales are expected around $13.0–$13.4 billion.Celgene’s key product, Revlimid, should continue to be the main growth driver as in the first quarter, driven by share gains in important markets and longer treatment duration in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM).  Revlimid sales are projected between $8 billion–$8.3 billion.Currently, Celgene is working on expanding Revlimid’s label further. FDA approved Revlimidfor use as a maintenance treatment in NDMM patients after they receive an autologous stem-cell transplant. The drug was also approved in the EU for the same. NDMM market share continues to grow outside the U.S., with a positive uptake both in the EU and in Japan. A label expansion of the drug is expected to boost sales further.Meanwhile, a broad phase III program evaluating Revlimid in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is underway.Other key products – Pomalyst/Imnovid, Abraxane and Otezla continue to perform well. Both Otezla and Pomalyst achieved blockbuster status in 2016, recording over $1 billion in sales. Otezla sales in the first quarter were impacted by managed care dynamics that led to lower total marketplace prescriptions for psoriasis therapies although the pressure is expected to ease as the year goes.Pomalyst/Imnovid is being evaluated in multiple combination studies in relapsed/refractory MM. The drug’s label was recently updated in the U.S. and the EU to include data from a pooled pharmacokinetics analysis of patients with relapsed and/or refractory MM and impaired renal function.  Pomalyst, in combination with Darzalex and dexamethasone for relapsed/refractory myeloma, is under FDA review.For 2017, Abraxane sales are estimated to be around $1 billion. While Pomalyst’s revenues are projected around $1.6 billion, the same for Otezla are estimated around $1.5 billion– $1.7 billion.Meanwhile, R&D expense as a percentage of revenues is expected to increase throughout the year.In the second-quarter call, investors are expected to remain focused on the company’s performance and label expansion efforts, along with updates on the pipeline front. Celgene has submitted a new drug application to the FDA for Idhifa in relapsed refractory AML in 2016. The NDA for Idhifa was granted Priority Review with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date of Aug 30. We note that Celgene has inked an agreement with Agios Pharmaceuticals (AGIO  -  Free Report) for Idhifa.Celgene Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Celgene Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Celgene Corporation QuoteStocks Poised to Beat EstimatesHere are some other health care stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +33.3% and a Zacks Rank #1.

159,ALXN,"Investors in Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the August 18, 2017,$65Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Alexion Pharmaceuticals shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Alexion Pharmaceuticals is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry that ranks in the Top 46% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter moved from $1.09 per shareto $1.08 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Alexion Pharmaceuticals right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?

160,ALXN,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul  27, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, Alexion’s earnings surpassed Zacks Consensus Estimate. Alexion’s track record is excellent as the company has consistently beaten expectations in the last four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 7.49% over the trailing four quarters.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.A look at Alexion’s share price movement year to date shows that the stock has underperformed the Zacks classified Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry.  While the company’s shares have gained 4.1%, the industry witnessed an addition of 10.6% in the same period.Factors Likely to Impact Q2 ResultsAlexion continues to identify and treat a consistently high number of new patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) with Soliris, across its 50-country operating platform. In order to further increase the commercial potential of the drug, Alexion is working on expanding Soliris’ label into additional indications. Label expansion into additional indications would give Soliris access to a higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug significantly. Additionally, the company is working on the launches of both Strensiq and Kanuma.Strensiq continues to perform well with revenues benefiting from a growing number of patients (both children as well as adults with pediatric onset disease) owing to HPP disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives. These initiatives are leading to steady identification of new patients with hypophosphatasia (HPP). In fact, the company expects Strensiq to be an additional growth driver in 2017, and beyond.Alexion is also looking to achieve annual cost synergies, which are expected to touch at least $150 million in 2017.Meanwhile, Alexion continues to progress with in-country funding processes for both the products in additional countries in the EU this year.Notably, the company’s efforts to develop its pipeline are impressive, particularly in case of ALXN1210. Currently, it is evaluating ALXN1210 (a longer-acting anti-C5 antibody that inhibits terminal complement) in phase III studies for both PNH and aHUS. Additionally, the company is conducting a phase I study on a new formulation of ALXN1210, when administered subcutaneously in healthy volunteers.Alexion plans to initiate a phase III PNH switch study of ALXN1210 administered intravenously every eight weeks compared to patients currently treated with Soliris. in 2017. Therefore, we expect investors to focus on updates from ALXN1210 as the successful development and commercialization of the drug will boost growth prospects.However, with Soliris accounting for majority of revenues at Alexion, the company relies heavily on the drug for growth. Going forward, Soliris’ below-par performance might hurt the stock severly as it is considered to be Alexion’s key growth driver. It is to be noted that the drug is already witnessing challenges in Latin America. Also, Soliris’ quarter-to-quarter revenue growth will be impacted by the enrollment ramp-up of trials on ALXN1210 (by $70 million–$110 million), particularly in the second half of 2017.  Soliris revenues are expected to be down in the second quarter of 2017.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model shows that Alexion is likely to beat earnings in the to-be-reported quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – which have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings.Zacks ESP: Alexion has an Earnings ESP of +6.48% as the Most Accurate estimate is $1.15 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.08. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Alexion carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP of +6.48% makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

161,ALXN,"Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 26, after the market closes. Last quarter, the company beat expectations by 0.92%.Gilead Sciences, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Gilead Sciences, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Gilead Sciences, Inc. QuoteGilead’s track record is pretty mixed, with the company beating estimates in three of the last four and missing in the other one. Overall, the company recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 3.52%.Shares of Gilead have moved up 1.5% in the year so far, underperforming the Zacks classified Medical-Biomedical and Genetics industry’s gain of 10.5%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this biotech major for this announcement.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Gilead is likely to beat on earnings estimates this quarter. This is because it has the right combination of two key ingredients, a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +3.32%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is $2.18 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at $2.11. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Gilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors at PlayConcurrent with the first-quarter earnings call, Gilead reiterated its guidance for annual guidance for 2017.  Gilead expects net product sales in the range of $22.5–$24.5 billion. Non-HCV product sales are projected between $15 billion and $15.5 billion.  HCV product sales are projected between $7.5 billion and $9.0 billion.Strong performance by HIV and other antiviral product sales driven by continued uptake of its tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) based products – Genvoya, Descovy and Odefsey continue to boost sales. We expect the trend to continue in the second quarter as well. Genvoya has already become the most prescribed regimen for both treatment-naïve and switch patients since its launch.By the end of first-quarter 2017, the TAF-based regimens made up 42% of Gilead's HIV prescription volume in the treatment market. Strong uptake for Truvada for use in the pre-exposure prophylaxis setting is also expected to boost sales.  However, Gilead will lose exclusivity for Viread in 2017 in some countries outside the U.S. which might impact sales.However, the HCV franchise continues to be under competitive and pricing pressure leading to a massive decline in Harvoni and Sovaldi sales in 2016. Harvoni and Sovaldi has been facing competition from AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak and Viekira XR among others. Higher discounts and payer mix continue to impact sales adversely. Total HCV treatment starts in the U.S. were an estimated 231,000 in 2016, approximately 25,000 less than 2015. The company expects a further decline in patients starts in 2017.On a positive note, the HCV portfolio received a major boost when Epclusa gained approval in 2016 to become the first and only all-oral, pan-genotypic, STR consisting of Sovaldi and velpatasvir (an NS5A inhibitor), for the treatment of adults with genotype 1–6 chronic HCV infection. Initial uptake of Epclusa has been encouraging while formulary reviews are on track. The recently approved HBV drug Vemlidy is also expected to start contributing to the top line. The FDA recently approved Vosevi (Sovaldi, velpatasvir 100 mg/voxilaprevir 100 mg) tablets as a single-tablet regimen (STR) for the re-treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in adults with genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, previously treated with an NS5A inhibitor-containing regimen, or with genotype 1a or 3 previously treated with a Sovaldi-containing regimen without an NS5A inhibitor.During the second-quarter call, investors are likely to keep an eye on Gilead’s performance while pipeline updates will also be keenly awaited. Focus would also be on the performance of Epclusa and TAF-based regimens.Other Stocks Poised to Beat EstimatesHere are some other health care stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +66.7% and a Zacks Rank #1.

162,ALXN,"Key highlights this week include impressive data from Vertex’s (VRTX  -  Free Report) cystic fibrosis (CF) pipeline while companies like Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) and Puma (PBYI  -  Free Report) got FDA approval for their hepatitis C virus (HCV) and breast cancer treatments, respectively.  Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesVertex CF Data Impresses: Vertex got a major boost with positive data on three different triple combination regimens in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have one F508del mutation and one minimal function mutation (F508del/Min). These are the first data to show the potential to treat the underlying cause of CF in these patients, who have a severe and difficult-to-treat type of the disease. The company is looking to start a pivotal program in the first half of 2018. Vertex’s shares were up significantly in pre-market trading.CRL for Amgen/UCB Osteoporosis Drug: Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and partner UCB got a Complete Response Letter (CRL) from the FDA for Evenity (romosozumab), their investigational treatment for postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. However, the CRL doesn’t come as a surprise considering the emergence of a new safety signal in a late-stage study (ARCH). Although Evenity met both the primary endpoints and the key secondary endpoint in the study, the companies said that an imbalance in positively adjudicated cardiovascular serious adverse events was observed.The FDA has asked the companies to include data from the ARCH study in the resubmission as well as data from the BRIDGE study in men with osteoporosis (Read more: Amgen Gets CRL for Osteoporosis Drug Evenity's BLA). Amgen is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock -- you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.FDA Nod for Gilead HCV Drug: Gilead has added another drug to its hepatitis C virus (HCV) portfolio with the FDA granting approval to Vosevi, a single-tablet regimen for the re-treatment of adults with chronic HCV. Vosevi provides physicians with a new therapeutic option for their hardest-to-treat patients. However, Vosevi comes with a boxed warning regarding the risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation in HCV/HBV co-infected patients -- this could limit uptake.Gilead’s HCV franchise, which was a major revenue generator, is under considerable strain due to new competition and pricing pressure. The company has underperformed the Zacks-categorized Medical-Biomedical/Genetics industry so far in 2017 with shares gaining 0.1% while the industry is up 8.9%.Puma Up on FDA Approval of Nerlynx: Puma gained FDA approval for its breast cancer treatment, Nerlynx (neratinib), which has blockbuster potential. Nerlynx, the first approved drug in Puma’s portfolio, is indicated for the extended adjuvant treatment of early-stage, HER2+ breast cancer, an aggressive type of tumor. This means that Nerlynx can be taken after an initial treatment so that the risk of the cancer coming back can be reduced further. Nerlynx’s approval was in line with expectations considering a favorable advisory panel vote earlier this year. Puma’s shares were up 8.5% on the news. Year-to-date (YTD), Puma’s shares are up a whopping 204.4%.Sarepta-BioMarin Settle Patent Dispute: Sarepta (SRPT  -  Free Report) and BioMarin settled their patent dispute regarding the use of Sarepta’s Exondys 51 and all future exon-skipping products for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The companies signed a licensing agreement providing Sarepta with global exclusive rights to BioMarin’s DMD patent estate for Exondys 51 and all future exon-skipping products. BioMarin has the option to convert the license to a co-exclusive right if it decides to proceed with an exon-skipping therapy for DMD. Terms of the deal include a one-time $35 million payment from Sarepta as well as certain milestone-based payments and royalties. Sarepta’s shares were down 3%.PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NASDAQ Biotechnology Index was up 1.1% over the last five trading sessions.
