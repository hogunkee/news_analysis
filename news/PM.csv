0,PM,"A day before April 20, when a dome of pot fumes will account for approximately 90% of the smog over Los Angeles and its hot marijuana business, Big Tobacco stocks giants Altria Group (MO), sister firm Philip Morris International (PM) and British American Tobacco (BTI) tanked on fresh signs of declining demand.The reason was that Philip Morris, which sells outside the U.S., fell short of Q1 sales expectations, amid an ongoing consumer flight from cigarettes in most of the world. Weaker-than-anticipated demand for reduced-risk devices that aren't cigarettes, particularly in Japan, also hurt.One place where none of this is a problem, at least right now, is the rapidly growing, quasi-legal marijuana business. More users, perhaps accepting that they don't enjoy coughing or pot smoke's armpit-spice smell, are turning to vaping devices. Some analysts say that trend could be an opportunity for firms like Altria and Turning Point Brands (TPB), which owns rolling-paper-maker Zig Zag and two vaping companies.""Vaping is one of the fastest-growing segments in both nicotine and cannabis,"" Cowen analyst Vivien Azer said in 2016. ""Upon federal legalization, Big Tobacco could leverage its expertise to explore the legal cannabis market through vapor.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseShe estimated then that Big Tobacco companies could nearly double their underlying growth via cannabis. Overall, assuming full legalization, Big Tobacco could scoop up around a fifth of the overall share of the marijuana business by 2036, she said in a report then.The marijuana delivery platform Eaze said last year that ready-to-use products, which include vaping devices, for the first time made up a greater portion of its sales than ""flower,"" the industry's term for buds. Vaporizers in November and December made up a greater percentage of sales than dry, loose buds, according to data from the company, which operates in California. ""Not a lot of people know how to roll a joint, or they don't have the paraphernalia to consume the flower,"" Sheena Shiravi, Eaze's director of communications. ""So (with) prerolls, they can just consume flower, or even better, a vaporizer.""Even so, people do, in fact, still roll joints. Turning Point Brands said in March that ""there will be a whole new audience of consumers"" of people rolling their own in Canada, where recreational pot legalization kicks in this year. Turning Point Brands at that time said it widened its offering of its Zig Zag Orange and King-Size Slim rolling papers in Canada, and that its partners were ""exploring additional opportunity products"" beyond this year.At a conference in January, Turning Point Brands CEO Larry Wexler said that it saw the marijuana business as an ""exciting opportunity"" that it was still trying to understand. He added: ""I suspect that there probably are some people who buy our products that were intended for tobacco — my lawyer's sitting here — intended for tobacco and they go off and they credibly use it for other products.""Even as it remains enthusiastic about the marijuana business, Turning Point Brands said in January that it had no plans for any prerolled products. Azer suggested that tobacco companies pushing lower-health-risk products might not want the extra glare from regulators that could come with trying to sell their own joints.""The tobacco industry is highly scrutinized and highly regulated,"" she said. ""And that's true in the U.S. and it's true globally as well. Right now, one of the key priorities for global tobacco companies are their reduced-risk product platforms.""The marijuana business, however, has its own big health problems. In California, new cannabis industry regulations on pesticides take hold in July. Those rules have raised fears that the vast majority of the pot sold via dispensaries would come up short, choking off supply and pushing prices higher. The changes would likely favor the state's small portion of licensed, deeper-pocketed pot growers.Despite the marijuana industry's rebranding efforts — the rustic-chic packaging and the chipper, minimalist startup logos — a lot of pot is still loaded with chemicals that are bad for you, a Rolling Stone article from March notes. That story also notes that because marijuana is illegal on a federal level, the EPA hasn't approved or rejected what pesticides to use for pot the way it does for other plants.Meanwhile, other tobacco companies have made quieter moves that may, or may not, signal interest in the marijuana business. Philip Morris International planned to invest roughly $20 million in Syqe Medical, an Israeli company that makes a cannabis inhaler, according to reports in 2016. Syqe ""will develop technologies for Phillip Morris that will help reduce health risks associated with smoking,"" Reuters said, citing the Israeli news outlet Calcalist. Philip Morris declined to provide any extra information beyond existing press accounts. The overseas Big Tobacco firm said it ""has no plans to develop or commercialize cannabis products."" Similarly, Altria, which owns Philip Morris USA and spun off Philip Morris International a decade ago, said ""Marijuana remains illegal under federal law and Altria's companies have no plans to sell marijuana-based products.""Imperial Brands (IMBBY), the U.K. company whose brands include cigarettes like Winston and Kool, last year appointed Simon Langelier to its board. Langelier is a 30-year Philip Morris International veteran who is also chairman of a medical cannabis company. Imperial, in a release, cited his experience in ""wider consumer adjacencies.""When asked about how Imperial was viewing the cannabis market, Simon Evans, a spokesman for the company, said it is ""tracking developments in what is a fast-growing segment."" Evans stressed that Langelier's experience at Philip Morris was the main reason for his appointment. But Evans indicated his cannabis industry experience wasn't just an afterthought. ""So, is it irrelevant? No. It's not,"" he said.  YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Will Marijuana Industry Overtake Beer As Legalization Spurs Innovation?These Marijuana Stocks With Second-Hand Exposure May Surprise YouThe Apple Store For Weed Partners With Nasdaq's First Pot StockBeer Giant To Take More Active Role In Cannabis, Boost Pot SpendingLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

1,PM,"Falling smoking rates may be good for global lifespans, but it's bad news for Philip Morris International (PM), whose bet on reduced-risk products has been slow to pay off.XThe seller of Marlboros outside the U.S. reported revenue excluding excise taxes of $6.9 billion, less than the $7.03 billion that analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had been projecting. Shares sank 16.6%.As global smoking rates decline, tobacco companies are trying to keep up performance by boosting prices and introducing new products. That didn't fully pan out last quarter as sales were hit by increased taxes in Saudi Arabia and slower demand. Cigarette shipments fell 5.3% in the first quarter, offsetting a rise in heated tobacco unit deliveries.Philip Morris has developed four ""platforms"" it says are less harmful than cigarettes. The first, called iQos, heats a tobacco plug without setting it on fire. Chief Executive Officer Andre Calantzopoulos has said he envisions a world where all 1 billion smokers have switched to reduced-risk nicotine delivery systems.Other tobacco companies' shares also fell in Thursday trading. Imperial Brands PLC was down as much as 5.2%, while British American Tobacco (BTI) dropped nearly 8%, triggering a halt in trading.IQos was available in 38 markets as of February. Platform 2 was introduced in a city test in the Dominican Republic in December. That product, called TEEPS, is a second heat-not-burn offering that resembles a regular cigarette with a tip that prevents it from setting on fire. The company plans to launch a consumer test for the third platform, a nicotine inhaler, this year, and it expects to release a next-generation version of Platform 4, an e-vapor offering.IQos could soon be available in a major market: the U.S. Philip Morris's sister company Altria Group (MO) would sell the product under a licensing agreement in the event that it receives Food and Drug Administration approval.The company raised its earnings guidance for 2018 by 5 cents to between $5.25 and $5.40, primarily due to a lower tax rate. That new forecast takes into account lower-than-expected growth in Japanese device sales.""We are now reaching more conservative adult smoker segments that may require, at least at first, slightly more time for adoption,"" Calantzopoulos said in a statement. ""Even if this temporary dynamic in Japan persists, we remain on track to double our worldwide in-market sales of heated tobacco units compared to 2017.""Wells Fargo & Co. analyst Bonnie Herzog said the lower-than-expected Japanese demand for non-cigarette products will pressure stock prices Thursday. However, she said she isn't concerned because it ""reflects iQos entering a more mature phase of growth"" and ""doesn't detract from its strong growth prospects globally.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Leaderboard: Daily Updates On Stocks With Potential For Big GainsBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

34,PM,"Federated Kaufmann Small Cap Fund owes much of its success in investing in growth stocks to great team work. And this top-performing mutual fund's team is bigger than most funds' — big enough to field a baseball team.The $1.5 billion Federated Kaufmann Small Cap(FKASX) has nine portfolio managers. Each covers stocks in industries in which they have expertise. As a result, the portfolio recently has been investing in growth stocks such as Veeva Systems (VEEV), Grubhub (GRUB), Canada Goose Holdings (GOOS), RealPage (RP) and Tyler Technologies (TYL). All are market leaders with IBD EPS Ratings of 90 or higher and Relative Strength Ratings ranging from 99 to 83.This year through June 30, investing in growth stocks like these have brought gains ranging from 24% by enterprise software maker RealPage to 86% by upscale winter wear maker Canada Goose.Federated Kaufmann Small Cap Fund has another trait that stands out. The portfolio has held many of its heavy-hitting stocks since they first came to market.With its team of experts working together to find new companies that the fund can hold long-term, this top mutual fund as of Dec. 31 has beaten the S&P 500 in the past one, three, five and 10 years. That feat makes it a 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAnd it's won the award in three categories: U.S. diversified equity funds, growth funds and small-cap funds. And that's no easy feat: Only 10.4% of eligible U.S. diversified stock funds made the Best Mutual Funds Award list.Fund lead manager Stephen DeNichilo, 42 years old, has been with federated since 2012 and has 20 years investment experience. He discussed his fund's hot streak and other aspects of the team's investment approach with IBD from his team's offices in Manhattan.Best Mutual Funds Monthly Performance ReportBeyond Q2: Stock Fund Managers' Outlook NowMoney Market Funds Back In Bond MixSee Which Stocks The Best Mutual Funds Have Been BuyingBest Mutual Funds: Six Month LeadersBest Mutual Funds: Quarterly LeadersMutual Fund Category PerformanceIBD: Nine portfolio managers guide this fund. Why so many?DeNichilo: There are two lead managers, me and John Ettinger. Each portfolio manager has buy and sell discretion. ... Each manager focuses on different sector verticals — technology, biotech, consumer, financials, software and so on. Industrials, materials and energy are my areas. Our arrangement brings buy and sell decisions closer to the research process.IBD: You've outpaced the broad market in four varying time periods. What enables the fund to outperform so consistently?DeNichilo: The consistent focus of our process. Our sole focus is to find innovative, growing companies regardless of the macro environment's noise.We at Federated have used the same philosophy on our flagship Kaufmann Fund (KAUAX) (now a $6.6 billion midcap growth portfolio) for 30 years. And members of the small-cap fund's team have been working together on average over 15 years.IBD: Why use so many portfolio managers rather than analysts?DeNichilo: When you have companies that are small and growing 15%, 20%, 30% sequentially, things are moving very fast. You need to be on top of those. Our process brings the portfolio manager closer to the research process. The closer, the better. And on top of it, we have senior managers — I am one of them — monitor the portfolio, monitor risk management. They provide a sort of check and balance.IBD: Why does your fund participate in so many initial public offerings?DeNichilo: The team analyzes virtually every IPO that comes to market. I would say, broad brush, we buy anywhere from 25% to 50% of IPOs we see, varying widely throughout the years based on the quality of deals.Each IPO is vetted by the sector PM, who often has a solid working understanding of the company and market segment before the deal comes to market.Over 50% of the fund's holdings were initially bought on IPO. That's one of the most inefficient parts of the market. And buying at IPO gives us a first-mover advantage with a stock.IBD: Why has Veeva Systems trended higher the past couple of months?DeNichilo: This is a stock we've owned since the IPO. It has a fantastic combination of experienced leadership who know what to build and how.This is a SaaS (software as a service) solutions company for the life sciences market. Sort of a Salesforce.com (CRM) for life sciences.They have a proprietary content management platform that's used for medical promotions and regulatory-clinical trials. And it enables their customers to move critical functions in regulatory submissions and manufacturing quality to the cloud. They have a knack for hiring people with deep industry knowledge, who work closely with customers to build what their most advanced customers want, and apps that can be tailored and integrated for high levels of customer success.IBD: Grubhub's earnings per share growth has sped up for three quarters. Why?DeNichilo: This is another name we bought on IPO. They're in an enormous and rapidly growing total adjustable market. They stand to benefit. They're expanding into additional cities. They're signing major restaurant chains like Yum Brands.There's some concern about competition from Uber Eats and DoorDash. But we think the market is large and growing, with room for more than one player. And Grubhub has first-mover advantage and a strong brand name.IBD: Enterprise software maker RealPage has eight straight quarters of increasing ownership by mutual funds. What's this feeding frenzy about?DeNichilo: This is another stock we bought on IPO in 2010. They are a real estate software company that helps solve huge inefficiencies in the property management vertical.They enable property managers to better manage renter life cycles and property management workflow. They are a leader in helping apartment owners manage their property, their tenants, their buildings, schedule repairs and take rental payments.They have a huge amount of recurring revenue, a nice history of hitting their numbers and they are a nice consolidator in the industry.IBD: After two quarters of declining EPS, Canada Goose posted gains of 39%, 48% and 166%. What do you like about them?DeNichilo: We think there's big growth in the consumer functional luxury space. Canada Goose is successful in their wholesale business, and is in the early stages of developing its retail business with just a handful of stores in the U.S. and Canada and Europe. And it's moving its brand beyond winter garments into an all-seasons assortment.The company limits distribution and inventory growth to maintain premium pricing and avoid discounting, which is the death knell for any retailer. Sales have grown in excess of 30% (annually). We think estimates for only 25% growth will prove conservative.IBD: Tyler Technologies is in the same IBD enterprise software group as RealPage. It provides IT management services and software for various levels of government. Why is that attractive to you?DeNichilo: They are a SaaS company for municipalities. They make government more efficient. Their software automates processes. It's used in everything from public safety to small-claims arbitration. It lets everything be done online.IBD: Government is often rapped for being slow and resisting change.DeNichilo: After the financial crisis, when municipalities found themselves in fiscal trouble, they saw the payback and return on investment for using Tyler was so large that they couldn't ignore it.IBD: What's your thesis for Novanta (NOVT), which makes photonics and motion control systems?DeNichilo: We think they are still an undercovered company on Wall Street. Management has done a fantastic job turning the company around, pivoting from cyclical to secular areas. Now they're focused on such secular growth areas as 3D printing, DNA sequencing, robotic surgery and warehouse automation.Novanta allows customers' (devices) to have precise movements down to the micron level. They've reduced their semiconductor exposure from 50% of revenue to less than 10% today. And they're focusing more on industrial automation and next-generation medical processes.IBD: What's the appeal of At Home Group (HOME)?DeNichilo: They're a value player that is taking share in retailing. They showcase a broad, inexpensive assortment of home decor in large-format stores. They were created out of the bankruptcy of the former Garden Ridge.Their productivity remains relatively low with significant opportunity for growth in same-store sales. They have plenty of real estate opportunities as other large-format stories like Sears and Kmart close.They have ability to grow 20% annually. They're not online currently, but that's a longer-term opportunity.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Millennials: Tips For Reaching Goal Of Becoming A MillionaireYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

52,PM,"Looking for some ideas for your portfolio? Want to boost the octane in your retirement account? Then check out how American Funds and Fidelity Investments — the second- and third-largest mutual fund complexes after Vanguard as of Dec. 31, according to Morningstar Inc. — were allocating their shareholders' money.The main lesson for individual investors? Even the smart money, in the form of these two fund families, can disagree about some key decisions.The three sectors in which their stock fund weightings differed from each other the most were information technology, consumer staples and energy.Fidelity's stock funds overall had 26% of their shareholders' money in tech, the group's largest sector weighting, according to Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund research for research firm CFRA.American Funds was well below that, with just 18% in tech.American Funds had more in consumer staples, 9% vs. only 7% for Fidelity.And American Funds had more in energy, 10% vs. just 6% for Fidelity.We recently dissected recent big buys by Fidelity, so here's a look at some big fourth-quarter buys by American Funds, whose 64 stock mutual funds were up 4.90% year-to-date as of Feb. 28, according to Morningstar Inc. The broad market, measured by the S&P 500, was up 5.94%.American Funds boosted its share count in chipmaker Analog Devices (ADI) by a whopping 43%.Analog Devices has a top-notch 98 Composite Rating from IBD, a peg under the highest possible on a scale from 1-99. The stock's earnings per share rose 6%, 2% and 68% in the past three quarters. Share price is up 14% this year going into Monday.Drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) was another stock in which American Funds made a big increase in its share count, adding 40% more to its stake.Bristol-Myers has a weak 61 Composite Rating. Share price has been trending lower since mid-July. Shares are down 2% this year but have rallied 22% since Jan. 26, when the company reported fourth-quarter earnings that fell short of analysts' consensus view and cut its 2017 guidance.One reason for Bristol-Myers' rally is that its cancer drug Opdivo recently won approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat metastatic urothelial carcinoma, the most common type of bladder cancer. It got a similar green light in Europe last year.American Funds jacked up its number of shares in Facebook (FB) by a net 39% in Q4. The stock has a good 92 Comp Rating. Shares have climbed 19% so far this year.Alphabet (GOOGL) is another name in which American Funds raised its bet, by 16% in the social-media giant's case. Share price is up 7% so far this year.Additional tech-oriented bellwethers were among the stocks in which American Funds made net new buys, including consumer electronics giant Apple (AAPL), chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO) and software titan Microsoft (MSFT).But the big fund family hedged its bets in some other tech titans, including net redemptions in chipmaker Intel (INTC) and Amazon (AMZN). It also trimmed big-box building products chain Home Depot (HD).Trims did not mean that individual mutual funds within the family had lost faith totally with individual stocks. Home Depot, a Q4 trim, remained a top-10 position in some of American Funds' largest portfolios.Home Depot was a top-10 holding by $84.9 billion Fundamental Investors (ANCFX), whose 10 biggest positions also included Amazon. Three net new buys — Broadcom, Microsoft and energy equipment and field services company Schlumberger (SLB) — were also top-10 positions in the fund, according to Rosenbluth.The $90.6 billion American Funds Washington Mutual Investors (AWSHX) also had top-10 positions in Home Depot, Microsoft and Schlumberger.While Schlumberger was prominent in some individual funds, American Funds overall also made Q4 net big buys in integrated energy giant Chevron (CVX), boosting its share count by 4.8% to 70 million by the end of Q4.The fund group also boosted its share count in Royal Dutch Shell by 7.3% to 96 million.American Funds trimmed its share counts in several consumer-staples stalwarts. It trimmed 15% of its shares in household products giant Procter& Gamble (PG), soft drink leader Coca-Cola (KO) by 9.2% to 234 million and tobacco company Philip Morris International (PM) by 4.1% to 157 million.RELATED:Despite Brief Jitters, Investors Still Favor Online Leaders And Infrastructure PlaysMutual Fund Managers Cite Tech, Financial, Energy And Industrial Names They Like For '17

54,PM,"Global tobacco giant Philip Morris International (PM) earnings missed forecasts Thursday, but not as strong as Wall Street expected. But accelerating sales growth cheered investors.Philip Morris earned $1.10 a share in Q4, up 11% vs. a year earlier but 3 cents below views. Sales excluding excise taxes rose 9% to $6.97 billion, vs. forecasts for a 4% gain. Sales have shown an improving year-over-year change, from smaller declines to faster gains, for several quarters.While traditional cigarettes continue to see weaker demand, Philip Morris reported booming demand for its ""heat-not-burn"" products. It shipped 3.7 billion Heat Stick units, compared with 62 million in the same quarter last year.The company sees 2017 adjusted EPS of $4.70-$4.85 vs. analyst estimates for $4.72.Shares rose 3% to 98.84 on the stock market today, hitting their highest level since late September. The stock moved above its 200-day moving average after finding resistance at that key level for the past four months.Philip Morris sells Marlboro and other cigarette brands outside the U.S., while Altria Group (MO) sells the same brands on the domestic market.IBD'S TAKE: Looking for strong-performing income stocks? Look no further than the Income Investor. In the latest Income Investor column, IBD highlights five companies with 25%+ dividend growth in recent years. Altria on Wednesday reported Q4 EPS that just topped forecasts, but revenue came in a little light as cigarette demand continues to fall.Altria shares edged up 0.1%. On Wednesday, the stock initially tumbled, but rallied to hit all-time highs.There has been speculation that Philip Morris and Altria could recombine, especially following another big industry deal. British American Tobacco recently reached a deal to buy the 58% of Reynolds American (RAI) it doesn't already own for $49 billion. Reynolds owns such cigarette brands as Camel and Newport. British American Tobacco, or BAT, has brands such as Lucky Strike.BAT shares rose 0.1%. Reynolds American fell 3 cents to 59.92.Tobacco companies tend to be big dividend payers. Philip Morris has hefty 4.3% dividend yield, with Altria at 3.4%.

56,PM,"The stock market wasn't moving much in afternoon trading Thursday ahead of Friday's jobs report. Wall Street shrugged off another strong earnings report from Facebook (FB). Financials lagged.The Nasdaq composite eased 0.2%, while the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 fell fractionally. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking slightly lower than Wednesday's levels.In the stock market today, Costco (COST) was a nice winner after reporting strong January sales. Shares jumped nearly 4% to 168.04. It's still in buy range from a 165.05 buy point. Facebook rose 1.7% early but reversed lower.

The stock was featured recently in The New America.High-yielder Philip Morris (PM) gapped above its 200-day moving average, rising 3% to 98.78. Earnings missed expectations but revenue was better than expected.

The stock is in range of that entry until 72.33.Altria has a strong dividend yield of 3.4%, making it a favorite among income investors.Philip Morris International (PM), which sells Marlboro cigarettes and other brands outside the U.S., slipped 0.2% to finish the regular session at 95.95. Analyst consensus puts Philip Morris Q4 earnings up 13%, which would be its first gain in five quarters.

60,PM,"Consumer staples have been slumping lately, and key exchange traded funds tracking the sector are down from 6% to 13% this year, through Tuesday's close.So what's the culprit? One of the key reasons: higher interest rates. The 10-year Treasury is now yielding about 3.08%, up sharply from around 2.4% at the beginning of the year. That makes bonds more attractive than dividends.Consumer staples stocks are considered a defensive play because people need these products no matter how the economy is doing, and the companies often offer steady dividends. When bond yields are low, dividend stocks look more compelling. But when bond yields rise, dividend stocks can look less attractive.Add to the sector's woes are a stronger dollar and weaker emerging-markets currencies, where consumer staples giants like Procter & Gamble (PG) and Colgate-Palmolive (CL) generate a sizable percentage of sales.

79,PM,"Prime Minister Theresa May faces a new set of hurdles in delivering Brexit after the U.K.'s highest court ruled she needed to pass an Act of Parliament before she can open negotiations.The decision by the Supreme Court, announced on Tuesday in London, hands lawmakers the chance to constrain what May wants to achieve in splitting from the European Union, a week after she laid out her vision for a clean break with the bloc. Some will seek to place roadblocks such as holding her to account through the two-year Brexit process or pushing her to hold another referendum.The ruling won't stop Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty being triggered, with almost all members of Parliament saying they'll vote in favor of that. It may still jeopardize May's plan to do so by March 31, despite the government reiterating confidence it can keep to that self-imposed deadline.""Things can go wrong in Parliament, but I don't see what those things are at the moment,"" said Philip Cowley, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London. ""Even though there's a majority of members of Parliament who want to stay in the single market, I don't know how they amend the legislation to force her to do that.""The pound was 0.7 percent lower at $1.2441 as of 12:36 p.m. London time as investors concluded there is still no brake on Brexit.May lost her argument that she alone could invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty as judges voted 8-3 against her. Having once hoped to avoid a vote for fear lawmakers would bog down her plans, she will now try to rush through a short bill, designed to keep her timetable on track and give as little scope for amendments as possible.The legislation will have to go through five stages in each of the two chambers of Parliament, where supporters of leaving the EU are in the minority. Although it's possible to pass emergency legislation in as little as one day, it is rare and the process can take months. There are votes at each stage, and lots of opportunities for dissenters to propose amendments. Both houses must agree on the wording of the final law.The government will try to pass a so-called ""program motion"" to speed things up.While May's spokesman, Greg Swift, told reporters the ruling did ""nothing to change the timetable,"" former Attorneys General Peter Goldsmith and Dominic Grieve both said it could be tricky to pass a bill in time to begin the withdrawal by the end of March.In one piece of good news for May, the court ruled unanimously that legislatures in Scotland and Northern Ireland don't get to vote on the Article 50 process that starts to wrest the U.K. from the EU after 44 years. Scotland probably would have sought to block the exit.Parliamentary critics of May, including some within her own Conservative Party, will now seize the opportunity to shape her strategy amid concern she risks hurting the economy by jeopardizing trade to win control of immigration.The chance of amendments rose last week after May pledged to leave the EU's single market to win control of immigration and lawmaking — essentially a so-called hard Brexit.Economists said there was now a greater chance that plan would be diluted. It is ""a positive for the long-term U.K. economic outlook,"" said Kallum Pickering, an economist at Berenberg Bank in London. ""MPs will likely nudge government toward a softer Brexit — one that prioritizes EU single market access over migration controls — to get the bill over the line.""Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said that while the opposition won't frustrate Article 50, it will try to amend the bill. He aims to ""build in the principles of full, tariff-free access to the single market,"" to ensure the government is accountable to Parliament through the negotiations and to put the final deal to a ""meaningful"" vote.Tim Farron, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, former coalition partners of May's Conservatives when her predecessor David Cameron was premier, said his party will vote against Article 50 unless the government agrees to subject the ultimate Brexit pact to a referendum.The Scottish National Party said it would make 50 amendments, including one which would require May to include the semiautonomous governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in its Article 50 decision.Paul Nuttall, leader of the U.K. Independence Party, had this warning: ""Woe betide those politicians or parties that attempt to block, delay or in any other way"" subvert the will of the people.The judges said leaving the bloc will mark a fundamental change to British law by altering legal rights and cutting off EU laws. The U.K.'s constitutional arrangements require such changes to be clearly authorized by Parliament, and lawmakers must be involved in triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, they ruled.Any hope the Supreme Court's ruling might herald an end to May's legal headaches are likely to be disappointed, as at least two new challenges gather pace. A Dublin court is being asked if the two-year exit process can be terminated at a later date, while two campaigners filed a lawsuit claiming the referendum didn't grant May the authority to pull Britain from the European single market.The case was initiated Gina Miller, who runs an investment startup, and Deir Dos Santos, a hairdresser. Separate claims brought by others were consolidated behind Miller's, who became the public face of the lawsuit and has endured death threats.""I sincerely hope that going forward, people who stand in positions of power and profile are much quicker in condemning those who cross the lines of common decency,"" Miller said on Tuesday.Some U.K. newspapers revived the criticisms they made in November when the High Court ruled against the government. ""Yet again the elite showed their contempt for Brexit voters!,"" the Daily Mail said on its website.

83,PM,"The top large-cap, small-cap and midcap ETFs of 2016 focus on dividend payers, giving them a value skew that paid off big in a year when investors grew wary of expensive names amid tepid earnings growth.Here is a look at the winning trio:Click Here To See The Best And Worst ETFs Of 2016Oppenheimer Ultra Dividend Revenue (RDIV), the top-performing large-cap ETF of 2016, selects the 60 highest-yielding stocks from the S&P 500 and S&P 400. It then ranks or weights them by top-line revenue rather than the traditional market capitalization.Revenue weighting offers diversified exposure to the market unlike some smart-beta or alternatively weighted strategies, according to Oppenheimer. And it is less likely to be full of trendy, overpriced stocks than a traditional, market-cap-weighted strategy, the firm's analysts say.Additionally, revenue, unlike earnings, is less susceptible to manipulation and, unlike dividends, is less vulnerable to shifts in management decisions, in Oppenheimer's view.The fund rebalances on a quarterly basis.In 2016, RDIV jumped 28.3% vs. a 12.0% gain for large-cap peer SPDR S&P 500 (SPY).Assets under management: $337.2 millionInception date: Sept. 30, 2013Expense ratio: 0.39%Yield: 3.27%Number of holdings: 60Assets in top 10 holdings: 49.72%Top holdings: Phillip Morris (PM), Verizon (VZ), Duke Energy (DUK)ProShares Russell 2000 Dividend Growers (SMDV), the top-performing small-cap ETF of 2016, invests in Russell 2000 companies that have grown dividends for at least 10 consecutive years.That's a tough bar for most small companies, and gives the ETF an extremely concentrated portfolio.Companies that grow dividends have historically outperformed those that do not, according to ProShares. Additionally, the typically strong fundamentals and stable earnings of dividend growers help them to deliver strong returns with lower volatility.The fund employs a 30% cap on any individual sector weighting to reduce risk, and rebalances four times a year. Stocks are equal weighted.In 2016, SMDV vaulted 35.7% vs. a 21.6% gain for iShares Russell 2000 (IWM).AUM: $349.2 millionInception date: Feb. 3, 2015Expense ratio: 0.40%Yield: 1.40%Number of holdings: 60Assets in top 10 holdings: 19.49%Holdings include: GATX Corp (GATX), Cass Information Systems (CASS), York Water Co. (YORW)ProShares S&P MidCap 400 Dividend Aristocrats (REGL), the top-performing midcap ETF of 2016, focuses on companies in the S&P MidCap 400 index that have grown dividends for at least 15 consecutive years.Like its small-cap sibling, this ETF is equal-weighted, caps sector weightings to no more than 30%, and rebalances four times a year.In 2016, REGL advanced 33.7% vs. a 20.5% gain for SDPR S&P MidCap 400 (MDY).AUM: $311.8 millionInception date: Feb. 3, 2015Expense ratio: 0.40%Yield: 1.34%Number of holdings: 44Assets in top 10 holdings: 24.96%Holdings include: Bank of the Ozarks (OZRK), Lincoln Electric (LECO), Brown & Brown (BRO)RELATED:2017 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2016 Stock Market ReviewSmall-Cap Value ETFs Show Again Why They Are Darlings Of The Market

A positive recommendation would have been a key step toward its IQOS system winning FDA approval for general sale in the U.S.  The IQOS is a cigar-shaped product that creates an aerosol supposedly less toxic than cigarette smoke.The FDA's Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee voted 8-0 with one abstention against Philip Morris' claim IQOS cuts the risk of tobacco-related diseases, and in a 5-4 vote rejected its claim that it is less risky than continuing to smoke cigarettes.The panel did vote 8-1 in favor of the Philip Morris' claim that the product reduces the body's exposure to harmful or potentially harmful chemicals, but then ruled 5-2 against the claim that these reductions are reasonably likely to translate to a measurable and substantial reduction in morbidity and or mortality.""Early votes were largely in line with our expectations, as we'd asserted the group would generally argue that more research would be required,"" Cowen tobacco analyst Vivien Azer said. ""The initial stock reactions seemed excessive, as the voting outcome has no impact on PM or MO's commercialization plans.""Other rulings included there being a low to medium likelihood U.S. smokers who used IQOS would switch to exclusive use, however the votes were split three high, five medium and one low on the likelihood they would become duel users of IQOS and cigarettes. There was a mixed response to the question of how likely it is Americans who never smoke, particularly young people, will become established users of the product, with four voting low, two high, on medium and two abstaining.Philip Morris, up slightly before the late morning announcement, tumbled as low as 103.02 on the news before closing down 2.8% at 107.49 on the stock market today. U.S. partner Altria (MO) was down 2.3% to 69.91. Philip Morris International was split off from Altria nearly 10 years ago.British American Tobacco (BTI) lost 3.4% and Vector Group (VGR) fell 1.5%.The FDA usually follows its advisory panels' recommendations, but not always. The agency is expected to decide in the next few months whether Philip Morris can sell IQOS, but will decide separately whether to authorize the modified-risk claims ruled on by the committee Thursday.""We don't view today's events as a total disaster given... much of the panel's concerns were around how PM worded its proposed reduced risk claims and how PM 'messages' those claims to the consumer."" Wells Fargo Senior Analyst Bonnie Herzog said in a research note. ""She was also sunny  on the prospects of the product coming to market, adding, ""We expect premarket approval of IQOS and continue to believe this could be in the next few months.""The IQOS devices works by heating up a stick of tobacco, but not to the point that it burns and generates smoke. The company has produced three products, each with Marlboro branding, with two having menthol flavoring.Philip Morris released the following statement following the FDA advisory panel's meeting:""Philip Morris International appreciates the open, positive dialogue and the serious consideration the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee (TPSAC) has shown during the last two days in discussing the complex science presented in our Modified-Risk Tobacco Product (MRTP) application. We are encouraged by the recognition of the risk reduction potential of IQOS that clearly emerged from the statements of the Committee members.""Philip Morris is aiming to bring the product to market this year, and has said it hopes to convert every adult smoker into an IQOS user.The system is already used by nearly 4 million people in 30 markets outside the U.S.In its application the company argued the product will ""significantly reduce harm and the risk of tobacco-related disease,"" however it does not say that the product is risk-free.IQOS is said to come somewhere between trendy vaping products and traditional cigarettes on the scale of harm.Last November the FDA said it was considering measures to speed development of products that help people quit smoking.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:How To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple RoutineThese Are The Top 20 Stocks Millennial Investors Are Holding, Says Robinhood

96,PM,"ETF investors saw rosy visions postelection of dilapidated roadways getting repaired and insufficient waterways getting built out. A change in the political guard raised hopes for infrastructure spending and economic growth.So exchange traded funds investing in metals with industrial and commercial uses were red-hot in November, while gold sold off as the stock market rallied to new heights.However, one precious metal sizzled last month as its peers fizzled. ETFS Physical Palladium (PALL) swung 24% higher in November, setting a new 52-week high on the last day of the month.Why did it buck the trend?""Palladium moves more in line with industrial metals such as copper, steel and zinc,"" said Maxwell Gold, director of investment strategy at ETF Securities, which runs a suite of precious metal funds including PALL. ""It's a metal that sees strong auto catalyst demand.""In fact, 66% to 76% of palladium's demand stems from the automotive sector and another 21% to 25% from industrial and technological uses, while only 3% to 8% is tied to jewelry, according to ETF Securities.Its No. 1 use is in catalytic converters to reduce air pollution from gasoline-powered automobiles. Besides the U.S., a key market for car sales is China. There, in Gold's view, a growing population and more stringent environmental controls bode well for demand for both cars and catalytic converters.Palladium also is attractive from a supply-side perspective, he said.Named after the Greek goddess of wisdom Pallas Athena, palladium is one of the rarest metals on Earth and is 15 times more scarce than platinum. The vast majority of output comes from South Africa and Russia, and any unrest in either country can dent supplies.The palladium market has been in a huge supply deficit for the past five years, with another big one in the works for 2017, according to Gold. A drawdown in aboveground stocks, combined with expectations of a rebound in global economies, contributes to palladium's strong fundamentals, he added.PALL holds $189.6 million in assets and trades on average 32,500 shares a day. Its underlying liquidity is solid and trading spreads are tight, according to Gold.It vaulted 17.5% in the month ended Dec. 6 and is up 30.2% year to date.By comparison, SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), the bellwether commodity ETF, plunged 10.4% in the past month and is now only up 9.8% in 2016 so far.And iShares Silver Trust (SLV) gave up 9.2% and rose 20.2% over those respective time periods.The palladium ETF is modestly more costly than those gold and silver peers, at a 0.60% expense ratio. However, investors get easy and reasonably priced exposure to this extremely scarce metal.The fund is physically backed with palladium bars held in a secure London vault.Investing in commodities can help to diversify investment portfolios and reduce equity risk. While palladium offers tactical opportunity, an alternative such as ETFS Physical PM Basket (GLTR) offers stronger diversification benefits.GLTR invests in gold, silver, platinum and palladium. Its core holding is gold, but the other precious metal holdings offer further potential upside when gold lags, Gold said.This diversified fund stumbled 8.4% in the past month but is still up 13.5% year to date.In terms of flow of money, GLTR has seen $83.2 million in net inflow in 2016 through Nov. 30. Its palladium sibling ETF saw $40.2 million in net outflow over the same period.One risk tied to palladium is significantly higher volatility than other precious metals, Gold said. He also thinks PALL could be challenged if the run-up in industrial metals proves to be a speculative rally.It may, in that case, see a short-term correction despite its constructive fundamentals, he added.PALL was falling on the stock market today in early trade and sits 5% below its recent high.RELATED:Why Some Strategists Still Like Gold Despite Its Recent Weakness

97,PM,"The major indexes are back in rally mode even after heady gains in recent weeks. As of 2:45 PM New York time on Tuesday, the Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrials all rallied with gains of 0.1% to 0.4%.Meanwhile, Dow 30 components Verizon Communications (VZ) and Apple (AAPL) helped lead the market's upside with gains of 1.4% and 0.6%, respectively. Also up within the Dow: financial plays Goldman Sachs (GS) (up the biggest amount points wise among the 30, rising 2.59 or 1.1%) and American Express (AXP) (up 0.4%).Small cap names lagged a little bit, with the Russell 2000 up 0.3%.The NYSE Composite led the way with a 0.5% boost higher. Diversified operations, auto retailing, staffing, air conditioning and heating, movide and airline stocks paced the upside, all up 1.8% or more. The market also saw strength in fabless semiconductor, homebuilding, auto parts and life insurance plays.Apple, gaining some steam following news that CEO Tim Cook defended the strength of Apple Watch sales during the holiday shopping season, is still a laggard among most large- and mega-cap names. With a weak 51 RS Rating and a poor Accumulation/Distribution Rating of D+, the former huge winner from 2004 to 2015 needs to prove it has the institutional support to finish a new base and stage a new breakout.The current action is encouraging in the sense that Apple has held above its 200-day moving average, but it's still below its 50-day moving average.One key IBD rule is to avoid stocks that ""live"" below the 10-week moving average (see a weekly chart) for nine weeks or more. Such behavior indicates flagging demand among mutual funds, hedge funds, pensions, insurers, banks and large investment advisors.Verizon, a big winner in the first half of 2016, is up 1.4% to 50.47. The stock recently rebounded back above its 50-day moving average. Watch to see if it can climb back above its 200-day line, which flattened out last month. Q4 profit is expected to be flat at 89 cents a share.Verizon's integrated telecom services group is now a laggard, ranked in the bottom half of IBD's daily ranking of 197 industry groups. Group peer AT&T (T) is also in base-building mode, up nearly 2% to 39.36 and just shy of possibly retaking its own 200-day moving average. The broadband and telecom giant had rallied 25% after breaking out past a 35.09 saucer with handle buy point before beginning its current correction.Elsewhere in the stock market today, large-cap and mega-cap names showing more strength include Broadcom (AVGO), part of IBD Leaderboard; Lockheed Martin (LMT), a defense play and hovering near a 267.03 cup entry; and JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which has moved past a tight, narrow consolidation at 80.54 and gave advanced traders an aggressive entry point to add a small amount of shares to a winning position.JPMorgan, covered frequently in the Stock Market Today column in the summer to early fall, has rallied sharply since clearing a 65.08 narrow cup with handle entry within a long bottoming base pattern.In economic news, unit labor costs for the third quarter jumped a revised 0.7%, up from a 0.3% gain. The new data points to added evidence of wage inflation, which may further cement a decision by the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates during a Dec. 13-14 meeting.RELATED:Why Apple May Be Creating A New BaseWhen Did Apple Initially Break Out?The Case For A Trump Era New Secular Bull RunApple iPhone Business Outlook Set To Improve Next Year, But China Still A Worry

Goldman shares rose 2%, while Morgan Stanley tacked on 1.5% in early trading.

Goldman shares are up 28% since early November.Arista Networks (ANET) was cut to equal-weight from overweight by Morgan Stanley. The cloud networking provider edged up 0.1% and is up about 5% from its 87.72 flat base entry. The company has two quarters of accelerating quarterly earnings growth and a 98 EPS Rating.Goldman Sachs downgraded Marvell Technology (MRVL) to sell from neutral.

99,PM,"Wasn't one vapid pretty boy named Justin from Canada enough?At least Justin Bieber is eye candy without the heartburn. Justin Trudeau, on the other hand, is the twinkly-eyed boy toy who makes informed adults wanna hurl.For more than a year, the liberal Canadian prime minister enjoyed drool-stained global press coverage as the ""hot hipster"" and ""dreamy sex symbol"" with great hair and a tribal Haida tattoo. He basked in Ryan Gosling-esque memes about his commitment to feminism and touched off ""Trudeau-mania"" with a series of shirtless selfies and photobombs.But this weekend, the sane world saw the baby-faced Commie apologist for the naked twit he truly is.Mourning the death of repressive dictator Fidel Castro, Trudeau hailed his longtime family friend as a ""larger than life leader"" who ""served his people for almost half a century."" Actually, El Comandante ruled with an iron fist and firing squads — serving himself to all of the island's land, private businesses and media, along with his own private yacht, private island, 20 homes, fleet of Mercedes limos and bevy of mistresses.Trudeau's ridiculous mash note to the ""legendary revolutionary and orator"" caused the social media backlash of the year. The hashtag #TrudeauEulogies erupted to mock Trudeau's soft-soaping of tyranny.""As we mourn Emperor Caligula, let us always remember his steadfast devotion to Senate reform,"" one Twitter user jibed in Trudeau-speak.""Although flawed Hitler was a vegetarian who loved animals, was a contributor to the arts & proud advocate for Germany,"" another joked.""Kim Jong Il will always be remembered fondly for his leadership and contributions on climate change,"" another chimed in.Stung, the Canadian tundra hunk's office announced Monday that he will not attend services for his beloved Uncle Fidel, who had served as a pallbearer at his former Canadian PM father's funeral. But if Trudeau thinks the damage to his celebrity brand is temporary, he has another think coming.Our neighbors to the north are now discovering what disillusioned Barack Obama worshipers realized too late: Beneath the shiny packaging of supermodel progressivism lies the same old decrepit culture of corruption.Political watchdogs have been buzzing about Trudeau's shady fundraising ties to Chinese communist moguls. Like Obama, Trudeau promised unprecedented transparency in government — ""sunny ways"" that would shed open light on how the Liberal Party was conducting the people's business. Dudley Do-Right's party declared there would be ""no preferential access, or appearance of preferential access"" in exchange for campaign cash and purported to ban favor-seekers with direct business before the government from attending political fundraisers.Behind closed doors, however, Trudeau was selling out to wealthy Chinese-Canadians and Chinese nationals seeking government green lights for their business deals. According to his conservative critics, Trudeau and the Liberal Party have held 80 such cash-for-access fundraisers crawling with lobbyists and access traders over the past year.The Globe and Mail newspaper revealed last week that Trudeau and his Liberal Party fundraisers had secretly organized one tony $1,500-per-head private residential gala in May attended by Chinese billionaires and bankers gunning for federal approval of projects. Echoing the operations of the Clinton Foundation pay-for-play money machine, the nonprofit Trudeau Foundation and the University of Montreal raked in $1 million from a wealthy Chinese businessman a few weeks after the fundraiser. The donation includes funding for a statue of Pierre Trudeau, who once wrote a book hailing Chairman Mao.The self-aggrandizing Commie fanboy apple doesn't fall far from his cultural Marxist tree.

100,PM,"Stocks were mixed Tuesday morning after upbeat economic data and a rally in oil prices.The Nasdaq gained 0.6%, while the S&P 500 added 0.3%. The Dow Jones industrial average dipped 0.2% as Financials and Home Depot's (HD) earnings weighed on the blue chip index. The market-leading Russell 2000 fell 0.4%. The small-cap index has been on a seven-day winning streak.Volume was tracking modestly lower in the stock market today on both the NYSE and Nasdaq.Home Depot reported its fiscal third quarter earnings this morning of $1.60 per share, surpassing the consensus estimate of $1.58. On the revenue side, Home Depot recorded $23.15 billion. Same-store sales rose 5.5%, which also beat Wall Street's 4.4% estimate. The stock was down 2% after trading higher in the premarket following the earnings beat.Home Depot has been in a downtrend since early August and may be in the process of building the right side of a base. The stock has a great earnings track record and an EPS Rating of 94. However, the RS Rating is a weak 36. Ideally, the RS Rating will improve over the next few weeks if the company's earnings report can prove to be a positive catalyst for the stock.NetEase (NTES) jumped 4% after management authorized up to 1$ billion repurchase of its American depositary receipts. The 13th ranked IBD 50 member dived below its 50 day moving average line last week after reporting Q3 earnings; the first time it has been below this support level since breaking out of its cup with handle base in June 2016.Financials took a breather on Tuesday. Goldman Sachs (GS) fell 1.5% and JPMorgan (JPM) declined 2%. The money center banks industry group has been up almost 10% over the past six straight days as investors place their bets on higher interest rates.Large-cap technology rallied early this morning after several rough days. Facebook (FB), Google (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) all gained at least 2.5%.There was positive economic data out Tuesday morning before the market open. October Retail Sales were 0.8% versus an expected 0.6%. The Empire State Manufacturing Survey came in at 1.5 ahead of the -2.5 estimate. Lastly, US import prices rose 0.5% in October vs. 0.4% estimate, and export prices were up 0.2% vs. 0.1% estimate.The Boston Federal Reserve Bank President Eric Rosengren seemed to reinforce the notion that rising interest rates are imminent in December. ""Absent significant negative economic news over the next month, the market's assessment of the likelihood of tightening in December seems plausible,"" Rosengren said. According to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool, there is an 85% change of a quarter-point rate hike next month. The forecaster uses 30-Day Fed Fund futures prices to forecast the likelihood of changes in U.S. monetary policy.Other Fed Speakers due up today are Robert Kaplan of the Dallas Federal Reserve and Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer at 1:30 pm ET.Oil surged 4% to $45 a barrel on expectations that an OPEC meeting later this month will result in a production cut. Oil prices have bounced off the 200-day moving average in recent sessions after declining as low as $42.20 on Monday.

108,PM,"Total dividends in the S&P 500 reached a near record in the second quarter, although the pace of dividend growth continues to slow.Aggregate dividends in the S&P 500 totaled $105.8 billion in Q2, a figure that was topped only by the total of this year's first quarter. The second quarter also was the 10th straight quarter that the trailing 12-month composite per-share dividend for the S&P 500 hit a new high, according to a study by FactSet.Breaking it down by sector, information technology and consumer staples led in rewarding shareholders. The IT sector ended Q2 with dividend payments of $16.4 billion and $64.7 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. In consumer staples, $14.3 billion was paid out in dividends and $56 billion in the trailing 12 months.Procter & Gamble (PG), Philip Morris (PM) and Wal-Mart (WMT) -- companies with a reputation for dependable dividends -- were the top payers in the sector. Philip Morris is in IBD's Dividend Leaders screen, as the stock forms a new base with a 104.30 buy point. Its annualized dividend yield exceeds 4%.But while dividends continue to expand, FactSet also found they increased 6.1% in Q2. That's well below the 10.8% average of the past three years. Also, Q2 dividend growth was at a single-digit pace for the third consecutive quarter.Future gains are likely to slow further. Analysts expect the S&P's dividends to rise only 4.7% over the next 12 months. (Three months ago, the estimate was for a 4.9% increase.)""This slowing growth has been an ongoing trend in the S&P 500 for over a year,"" the FactSet report said, but it didn't elaborate on the reasons.The trailing 12-month dividend yield of the S&P 500 was 2.07% at the end of Q2, and that also showed a decline, from 2.5% a year ago.There's a softening trend also in yield-rich stocks. FactSet notes that in the first six months of 2016, the ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NOBL) had risen more than 10%. The S&P 500 utilities and telecom sectors were each up more than 21%. Over the same time period, the S&P 500 index climbed less than 3%. But since the end of June, the Dividend Aristocrats ETF has lagged the S&P 500 by about 3 percentage points. The utilities and telecom sectors have underperformed the S&P by even larger margins.Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and General Electric (GE) came out on top when combining dividend payments and share buybacks over the trailing 12 months. Apple dividends totaled $3.19 billion. Combined with $10.9 billion in buybacks, Apple's contribution to shareholders was more than $14 billion, FactSet says.Microsoft's combined dividend and buyback spending was $6.4 billion and GE's $9.8 billionRELATED:Don't Give Up On These Utility Leaders Just YetHow Apple, Amazon, Alibaba Could Disrupt Google's Mobile Ad Business

109,PM,"Smart investors are dusting off their ETF investing playbooks. While the November election may or may not prove to be an inflection point for stocks, it is sure to mark a turn of the page, revealing new investing scenarios.Still, as the Nov. 8 vote approaches, many investors in exchange traded funds are uncertain of exactly what to expect. Volatility in the near term surely, but then what?""It appears the least unsettling outcome for stocks would be a Clinton win, with both houses of Congress remaining in Republican control,"" Liz Ann Sonders, the chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, said recently.Indeed, which party controls Congress may matter more for U.S. stocks than whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump wins. And the stock market's direction over the longer term will be far more influenced by the global economy and the Federal Reserve's actions than by any individual player.It's something to keep in mind as you hunt for ideas on how to make money investing in stocks within a shifting landscape.Click Here For A List Of The Best-Performing ETFs Of 2016With low-cost and broad-based ETFs in your toolbox, you can prepare your portfolio for any election result or stock market outcome, whether good or bad.So say strategists at top firms that help investors profit with ETFs and manage portfolio risk. Maxwell Gold of ETF Securities makes a case for investing in gold in an election year where both presidential candidates have taken populist stances.Simeon Hyman of ProShares sees tactical opportunity in specific sectors including infrastructure, with both Clinton and Trump talking up federal expenditure. And Sylvia Jablonski of Direxion discusses how some investors are using inverse and leveraged trades to make bullish or bearish bets on industry groups that are in the political spotlight.Here they are in their own words:Maxwell Gold is director of investment strategy at ETF Securities in New York City. The firm has roughly $22 billion in global assets and its innovations include developing the world's first gold ETF (in Australia) in 2003, and ETFS Physical PM Basket (GLTR), the first physically backed precious metals basket ETF in the U.S., in 2010.Against a backdrop of uncertainty this year, many investors have sought defensive and safe-haven assets like precious metals. With the U.S. presidential race heating up, investors are trying to gauge the election's potential outcome and its impact on precious metals, in particular gold.Looking at historical election results is not a perfect measure, but it may yield some helpful insights. On average, gold's performance was 5.9% in the 12 months following a U.S. presidential vote since 1972.Gold's return was more than double when Democratic candidates have won (over 8% on average) vs. their Republican counterparts (4% on average).Additionally, gold has historically seen higher performance when there is an administration change in the White House. When the incumbent party remained in office, gold rose approximately 2.0% in the subsequent 12 months.Following a change in political administration, however, gold has risen over 10% on average. Therefore, investors looking to hedge against equity volatility and political uncertainty may benefit from including gold as part of their portfolio allocations.Rising uncertainty has been a consistent theme this year, both globally and in the U.S., partly driven by increased populist sentiment. Regardless of the success of populism at elections, populist momentum can be a powerful catalyst for reform among incumbent parties.In this year's U.S. election, both presidential candidates agree on the need to increase fiscal spending on America's deteriorating infrastructure, while low interest rates combined with cheap commodity prices have reduced expected project costs. Populism and pricing together bode well for increased infrastructure spending, which could boost U.S. manufacturing, industrials, transportation and energy sectors, as well as U.S. commodity demand.While infrastructure investment creates economic growth, social initiatives are likely to lead to an increase in consumer spending with the end result being a likely rise in inflation.Rising inflation in the U.S. from these populism-driven factors, along with supply-side destruction in commodities, could potentially add further to inflationary pressures.Additionally, populist policies in the U.S. -- which are likely to include tax cuts, prompting a widening of the budget deficit — could weaken the U.S. dollar in the coming years. Investors can help protect investment portfolios by gaining exposure to assets that perform well in an inflationary environment, including precious metals.For gold investment, physically backed ETFs, like ETFS Physical Swiss Gold Shares (SGOL), are favored over gold mining equity ETFs.Unlike gold, gold miners historically have served as ineffective hedges against large equity market drawdowns over the past three decades.During these market periods, the gold price has posted an average return of 7% during market drawdowns of more than 10% in the S&P 500 since 1987. The gold mining equity index, on average, has posted a total return of -7%, offering limited downside protection against an average 21% drop in U.S. equities.Moreover, during these large drawdowns, gold has posted positive returns nearly 80% of the time vs. only 30% for gold miners.Not all precious metals behave the same, however, and there may be benefits to holding a diversified precious metals basket ETF, like ETFS Physical Precious Metals Basket Trust (GLTR), as opposed to just one metal.Exposure to a precious metals basket may offer diversification benefits across a full economic cycle. Silver, for example, is much more sensitive to the global industrial production cycle than gold, with half of its annual demand stemming from industrial applications.Both platinum and palladium demand, on the other hand, emanates from global auto and jewelry sales, both cyclical factors tied to the global consumer. Each precious metal has diverse fundamentals that occur at different stages of a full cycle, while still providing a low correlation to equities and other financial assets.While investors vary by risk tolerance and investment objectives, the optimal portfolio allocation to precious metals is never zero.Precious metals are a core risk management tool. They provide a hedge against market turmoil and volatility, help preserve purchasing power over long periods of time, and offer a unique source of diversification that can help improve portfolio efficiency.Simeon Hyman is head of investment strategy of ProShares in Bethesda, Md. The $31 billion firm offers one of the largest suites of alternative ETFs in the U.S., including geared (leveraged and inverse) exchange traded products. Launched in 2006, ProShares ETFs help investors go beyond the limitations of conventional investing strategies by reducing volatility, managing risk and enhancing returns. Election season tends to create anxiety for many investors. Financial market forecasts are difficult enough without this additional wild card. Investors looking to position their portfolios may feel forced to come up with a scenario that includes a forecast on the election. That's a daunting challenge.For ETF investors looking at the stock market, a focus on investing strategies that have exhibited effective downside mitigation might make sense.ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats (NOBL) is one such ETF strategy. Stocks that have a long track record of dividend growth have outperformed historically through a wide variety of economic cycles, according to research conducted by Ned Davis Research, and a chunk of that outperformance has come from downside mitigation.The long-term outperformance and downside mitigation of dividend growers could be just the sort of strategy that might serve buy-and-hold investors across a range of market environments. ProShares offers an entire suite of dividend growth ETFs across the equity spectrum, both domestic and international.About the only thing Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump agree on in this election is the need for the federal government to spend more on infrastructure.This year has seen an uptick in the performance of infrastructure stocks, and for those who see a bipartisan commitment to infrastructure spending as a sign this momentum will continue, we offer the only ""pure play"" infrastructure ETF.ProShares DJ Brookfield Global Infrastructure (TOLZ) follows a strategy that focuses exclusively on companies that own and operate infrastructure across the transportation, communications, energy and water sectors. With a requirement that every stock in TOLZ derive more than 70% of cash flows from infrastructure lines of business, TOLZ may be an effective way to position for this long-awaited policy shift.What about bonds? There is indeed some evidence that the Fed has historically been reluctant to raise rates right before an election. But does this mean that bonds are safe for now? Far from it.The Fed only controls the federal funds rate, not the rest of the yield curve. Historically, the yield on 10-Year Treasuries tends to run about 2.5% above inflation. So even if inflation is running at 1.5%, rather than the Fed's target of 2%, a ""normal"" 10-year yield should be around 4%.That could happen without any change in the fed funds rate and, if it did, bond prices would take a big hit.We offer two exchange traded funds that combine portfolios of bonds with built-in hedges against the effects of rising rates. Both ProShares Investment Grade — Interest Rate Hedged (IGHG) and ProShares High Yield — Interest Rate Hedged (HYHG) target a duration of zero and have almost no sensitivity to interest rates.While the current U.S. election cycle is unlike anything we have ever seen, investors should keep in mind that resources and strategies are available to help them better manage their portfolios, regardless of the election outcome.[Editor's note: The small asset size and trading volume of IGHG, HYHG and TOLZ may merit a closer look.]Sylvia Jablonski is managing director of capital markets and institutional ETF strategist at Direxion in New York City. The $11 billion firm provides nontraditional investments to accommodate various market cycles, including ETFs that position portfolios opportunistically, deliver broader diversification, dampen volatility and generate income or excess returns.The stock market is forward-looking and hates uncertainty. With the presidential race still too close to call, traders are preparing to protect against the unknown.If you're a buy-and-hold investor, there's probably little to concern yourself with. But no matter which party ends up in the White House in November, tactical managers will look for a way to find opportunity over the next few months.Looking beyond the U.S. election cycle, we anticipate a trader's environment in the short and medium term. The landscape may change, but we see a few areas that are attracting interest and volume.Both Clinton and Trump have made it known they want to keep drug prices low, which will likely boost some managed health care companies but may have a negative effect on pharmaceutical and biotech companies.The biotech space has become popular for traders. We've seen an uptick in trading for both the Direxion Daily S&P Biotech Bull 3x (LABU) and Biotech Bear 3x (LABD). For those interested in an inverse trade without a multiplier, we have the Direxion Daily S&P Biotech Bear 1x Shares (LABS).The energy and financial sectors also are in the cross hairs of political discourse. Depending on their outlook for these sectors, investors may benefit from opportunistic trades in the Daily Financial Bull 3x Shares (FAS), Daily Financial Bear 3x Shares (FAZ), Daily Energy Bull 3x Shares (ERX) and the Daily Energy Bear 3x Shares (ERY).Leveraged ETFs aren't for all types of investors. In leveraged ETF trading, the impact of seeking daily objectives has to be understood. Having said that, our leveraged ETFs are tools for hands-on traders looking to take advantage of short-term trends in both up and down markets. In many cases, we have bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade, so they allow you to stay agile.The real power is in the idea and expertise of the trader. The opportunity is only won if you get the direction right.Using leveraged ETFs (with ""2x"" or ""3x"" in their names) may allow a manager to gain equity asset class exposure, while letting half or a third of the capital do the work. This allows the balance of capital to be redeployed for other investment and risk-management purposes, such as exposure to yield-enhancing fixed income asset classes.Inverse or ""bear"" ETFs may be used to hedge the market. As their name reveals, inverse ETFs go up when the market goes down, and they go down when the market goes up. These funds will lose value so long as the market keeps going up, but the potential rewards can be attractive. Used appropriately, even a small allocation of your capital could help make up for any losses you sustain in a market crash.No matter which party ends up in the White House in November, these funds and others like them hopefully will allow managers to find opportunity in the uncertainty.RELATED:Which Of The Best ETF Investment Strategies Is Right For Your Portfolio?

112,PM,"Year to date, gold mining stocks still look shiny. But in recent weeks, they're showing a bit of tarnish.IBD's Mining-Gold/Silver/Gems industry group sat atop the table of 197 industry groups for months. But it's fallen off that vaunted perch and slipped to 26th in terms of six-month relative price performance, as of Monday's market close.The group slid 1.6% on Tuesday for its fourth-straight drop, even as the Nasdaq composite rose 0.9%; the S&P 500 still punched up 0.6% despite the broad decline in commodity-related equities.While there may be plenty of explanations for why gold stocks took a back seat in Tuesday's growth-stock rally, two reasons are indisputable.One, gold prices have cooled off. Mining companies' fortunes depend heavily on the day-to-day price of the commodities they sell.London PM Fixing gold prices have shot up 30% from a December 2015 low near $1,049 an ounce to as high as $1,366 on July 6. Since that peak, prices have gone sideways for more than two months, losing no more than 4%. However, both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite have gone on to notch all-time highs.Why have gold prices slumped lately? While the forces of supply and demand are ultimately the reason, some market observers are quick to note factors such as the increased prospect of higher interest rates in the U.S., which would reflect increased confidence in the economy. Higher interest rates would also likely boost the U.S. dollar and hence make gold more expensive to buy.Here's another viable reason: Gold bugs simply need a break.Consider Newmont Mining (NEM), one of the industry's giants ($20 billion market cap, $7.7 billion in sales last year). The big cap rumbled out of a 10-month bottoming-style cup-with-handle base in the week ended April 8. That week, the Greenwood Village, Colo., firm not only rallied 9%, but it also jumped past a 28.49 buy point (10 cents above the handle's intraday high of 28.39). Even with commodity plays, the cup with handle can serve as a useful timing tool to generate profits in equities quickly.Indeed, the gains came quickly.Newmont surged for four weeks in a row, then went sideways for four weeks while touching its 10-week moving average. That action offered a follow-on entry point near 25.29. By August, Newmont cruised to a 52-week high of 46.09, up 62% from the original 28.49 pivot.Few stocks in IBD's entire database can match that kind of advance so far in 2016. So, today's action in Newmont is perfectly normal. An 18% slide over three weeks is perfectly normal as the stock works on a new cuplike base.A good cup with handle can feature a decline of as much as 33%. Any more than that, though, and the risk of a failed breakout goes up fast.Spy the charts of Yamana Gold (AUY), AngloGold Ashanti (AU) and Randgold Resources (GOLD), all of which fall within the small-to-midcap range, and you see larger corrections in the works. The three have fallen 33%, 35% and 26% from their 52-week highs, respectively. Meanwhile, the S&P SmallCap 600 is less than 2% below its 765.55 peak.Remember that when the economy is buzzing, gold loses its luster as a hedge. While the shares of high-growth companies reflect the opportunity to receive dividends or strong increases in earnings per share, gold bullion lacks these qualities. On Tuesday, the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index rose sharply in September to 104.1, crushing the Econoday consensus forecast of 98.8 and well above the 101.1 August reading.RELATED:What Does A Great Cup-With-Handle Base Look Like?Some Cup Bases Are Flawed: How Can You Spot Them?

119,PM,"Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Apple (AAPL) led all S&P 500 companies in stock dividends paid in the second quarter, says a new report from FactSet Research.Exxon Mobil paid $3.13 billion in dividends in Q2, barely edging Apple at $3.12 billion. But Apple dominated the field in dividends and share buybacks in Q2 combined, totaling $14 billion, followed by General Electric (GE), then Microsoft (MSFT), says FactSet.FactSet said aggregate quarterly dividends for the S&P 500 amounted to $105.8 billion in Q2, an increase of 0.8% from Q2 2015. It was the second-largest dividend total in at least 10 years, following Q1 2016. Firms in the S&P 500 also spent $125.1 billion on share buybacks during Q2, the smallest quarterly total since Q3 2013.IBD'S TAKE: A dividend is a payment made by a company to its shareholders, usually as a distribution of profit, in order to return wealth. Dividends put cash in shareholders' hands, while stock buybacks are also a popular way to return capital to shareholders, tending to boost a stock and per-share earnings. Current and annual earnings are keys to IBD's CAN SLIM.At the sector level, companies in information technology led all 10 S&P industry groups in terms of aggregate dividends paid during Q2, at $16.4 billion. Over the trailing 12-month period, the IT sector paid out dividends totaling $64.7 billion, led by Apple, Microsoft and IBM (IBM). The consumer staples sector was second, with $56 billion in dividend distribution over the 12-month period, led by Procter & Gamble (PG), Philip Morris International (PM) and Wal-Mart Stores (WMT).The total dividend payout for the 12 months ending in Q2 amounted to $427.5 billion, up 7.1% year over year and the largest total in at least 10 years. It also marked the 10th consecutive quarter that the trailing 12-month dividend payout for the S&P 500 index hit a new high.Apple stock rose nearly 1% in the stock market today, to 114.62. Exxon Mobil stock rose a fraction, to 83.54.

120,PM,"Traders are the best salespeople in the world.  Why is this?  A trader, once in a position, can deceive himself or herself into believing half-truths faster than a house cat pouncing on a freshly escaped hamster.When faced with a loss, Joe Trader will look at a chart and tell whomever is within spitting distance, ""The market is acting as if a reversal is about to happen.""  Net result: He does not exit the position.When faced with a profit, Joanne Trader hesitates to pull the trigger, telling her goldfish, ""The market is acting great.  It would be premature to sell at these levels.""  Net result: She does not exit the trade.The mistake these traders are making is a common, yet fatal, affliction found in most beginning traders.  The net result is a trader who ""eats like a sparrow, and defecates like an elephant."" This is a situation that no account can withstand.  Worse, this cycle of emotional slavery will never end until it's met head on.  By stepping back and examining this process in more detail, the trader can learn to use their own emotional reactions as indicators.  Properly tuned, these emotional indicators, instead of leading to mistakes, can create great triggers to enter and exit a market.The problem is simple.  Many traders feel they can rely on their judgment while in a trade.  On paper, this makes a lot of sense.  After all, before a trade is placed, a trader is at his most objective.  However, once the trade is on, the degree of objectivity diminishes immediately and in direct proportion to the number of shares or contracts being traded relative to the account size.This perpetuates a vicious cycle. Instead of following a game plan about when to exit a position, the trader in this situation will close a position for one of two reasons.  First, the pain of holding becomes so great he cannot ""take it"" any longer.  Once he reaches this ""uncle"" point, he starts frantically banging his keyboard to sell (or cover) ""at the market"" in order to relieve the pain.  Second, a broker exits the position for the trader.  Not because he is a nice guy, but because the account has run out of margin.  This trade is also placed ""at the market.""This act of capitulation - traders exiting a position because they have to, not because they want to - is emotions-based trading at its finest. And these acts are responsible for the major moves in all markets, on all time frames, whether it is a sustained multi-month move to the downside due to continuous capitulation selling, or a quick 10-minute rally due to shorts being forced to cover. In the end, markets don't move because they want to.  They move because they have to.This imbalance of market orders causes rip-like movements that result in even worse fills.  Disgusted with themselves and red in the face, the victims of these trades stalk off to contemplate the insanity of the universe.  Meanwhile, another group of traders took the opposite side of this ""capitulation trade"" and made great profits.  How does a trader get on the winning side of these trades?  The key is for the trader to use his or her own emotions as triggers to take advantage of these ""get me the hell out of this position"" panic runs.  To fully understand how to do this, we must first step back and understand why traders continually and instinctively sabotage themselves in the first place.The problem is that the tactics an individual uses to achieve his or her goals in everyday life do not work in trading, and, in fact, are one of the main reasons for failure.  While ""good judgment"" is critical to an individual who wants to climb the corporate ladder or start a business, we have already seen why it doesn't work in the middle of a trade.  In addition, stubbornness and determination are prerequisites for success in many aspects of life, yet in trading these qualities will get you killed.In addition, traders who ""play the markets"" with a mental framework oriented towards how external society rewards and punishes ""good"" and ""bad"" behavior are set up to lose from day one.  For example, ""cutting losses short"" is difficult when there is the possibility of the market coming back to the breakeven point.  At breakeven, the trader is not a ""loser.""  Thus, according to the benchmarks of society, if the trader can exit a position with a gain, they are ""successful"". This leads to the removal of stops ""once in a while"" in the hopes of getting out at breakeven . . . in order to be a winner in the eyes of society (sigh).  This can work ten times in a row, but it is the one time it doesn't work that knocks a trader flat on his backSo now we have a basic understanding of why and how traders get themselves into trouble.  Let's shift our focus and see how to take advantage of these unfortunate souls.  (It sounds cruel when stated that way, but it's the truth.  Any money that a trader loses is sitting comfortably ensconced in the account of a better trader).1. Four Seasons: When I am in a trade that is going my way, and I start to feel overly excited and feel the urge to add to my position, I instead use this as my trigger to set up a ""double stop order.""  As an example, let's say I'm long 10 E-mini S&P contracts.  The market is screaming higher.  I find myself thinking of how many nights I could live at the Four Seasons on Maui with the day's profits.  I take the ""Four Seasons Trigger"" and place a trailing 2 point stop for 20 contracts; double the size of my current position. I will stay in the trade as long as it is moving higher, but once the market turns, not only am I out of my position for a nice profit, I simultaneously get short 10 contracts.  This process takes advantage of the market dynamics of human emotion in a very clean fashion.  The sell-off that occurs will be from other traders who succumbed to their emotions to buy at the top, due to fear of missing a move or the euphoria of having a current winning position.  Once the market does reverse, it will be these traders that provide the fuel for the move down, as they start dumping their positions once they can't take the pain of losing any longer.2. Thank You Sir May I Have Another: When in a trade, I visualize what a newer trader would be doing – or what I would have been doing years ago.  ""If I entered here, where would be my pain point?""  I've found on the S&Ps a move of 6 points without any meaningful retracements is the maximum ""uncle point"" for most traders.  When I see this, I picture myself with a newbie entry, and try to imagine the pain they are feeling.  After about 6 points, I know they won't be able to take the pain any longer, and I step in and take the opposite side of this move.3. When I Tick You Tick We Tick: A more technical way to measure emotion is to watch the ticks.  Whenever I see readings of over +1000 or -1000 Ticks, I start fading the move.  If we get a +1000 tick reading and I am already long, I start exiting the move and initiating a short position.  The reverse is also true.  In these instances, I am using a 4 ½ point stop and a 3 point target on the E-mini S&Ps.  If neither my stop or target is not hit after 25 minutes, I exit the trade at the current price.4. Dive, Captain, Dive: My trading partners and I run a trading room, and one of the things we all like to do is watch how the newer traders react to the market action.  There are ""noises"" that the people in the room can use.  One of the classics is when the market is falling, and one of the newer traders initiates the ""submarine dive, dive, dive"" noise.  Immediately upon hearing this, I know it is time to cover my shorts and go long.  The experienced traders in the room also know this, and of course we then share this information with the newbie trader.  Once he catches on, we just have to wait for the next free trial to show up.5. High Five, Baby: Whenever traders I work with start slapping each other on the back as the result of a trade (or if I do it for that matter), I immediately close out my position.  This is the result of extreme emotion, and extreme emotion is not sustainable.  I call this the ""high five sell signal.""The financial markets naturally take advantage of and prey upon human nature, especially when it comes to greed, hope, and fear.  The key to remember is that the biggest movements in the markets do not occur when traders in general ""feel like buying.""  They occur because groups of traders are all getting skewered at the same time, and are forced out of a position.  In reality, traders are not trading stocks, futures or options.  They are trading other traders.  The profitable trader learns to be aware of the psychology and emotions behind the person who is taking the opposite side of their trade.  In addition, they go a step further and learn to recognize their own feelings and emotions, letting them run amok, generating buy and sell signals worth their weight in gold.And if you want to learn more about how we look to take advantage of emotions, as well as some indispensable technical tools, you can join me for a free webinar. On Tuesday, September 6 at 7 PM Central, we will be Hunting for Tops and Bottoms. We will discuss low risk option strategies for catching high probability reversal trades.

121,PM,"Philip Morris International (PM) stock fell early Tuesday, pulling the sector down, after the tobacco giant reported lower-than-expected second-quarter earnings and revenue amid shrinking cigarette shipments.Earnings per share minus one time items for the maker of Marlboro, Lark and other cigarette brands slid 5% to $1.15 on a 3.1% drop in revenue to $6.65 billion. Wall Street was looking for $1.20 EPS and $6.77 billion revenue. Cigarette shipment volume of 209.3 billion units was down by 4.8% vs. the same quarter a year ago.Excluding unfavorable currency translation of 8 cents a share, EPS would be up 2 cents to $1.21, the company said. It was the second earnings miss in a row for Philip Morris. But the company revised its full-year 2016 earnings outlook upward to $4.45-$4.55.New York City-based Philip Morris International, spun off from Altria (MO) in 2008, earns all its revenue outside the U.S. Philip Morris USA is the U.S. division of Altria.Philip Morris shares ended trading down 3% to 99.89, undercutting a recent 102.65 buy point and its 50-day line. Its stock formed a first-stage flat base from late May to early July and rose above that entry point on July 5.IBD's TAKE: Tobacco stocks often are top dividend payers.

125,PM,"Some pockets of the stock market invariably do well when investor optimism is wobbling. Several consumer staples ETFs are making new highs or trading near highs as heightened uncertainty raises the sector's appeal.It's easy to see why it does. Consumers are going to need their soft drinks, bleach, cereal and flour no matter how the economy goes.The consumer staples sector generally outperforms during recessionary periods and, to a lesser extent, late in a market cycle, writes Morningstar analyst Robert Goldsborough. It tends to underperform in the early innings.""As such, investors interested in this fund should hold a strong belief that the economy is at least headed toward a recessionary environment,"" Goldsborough noted. Unless, of course, it's part of a diversified portfolio where its role is to help limit portfolio volatility.Investors have hardly been dashing for the stock market exits in recent sessions, but Europe is a niggling worry. The fear is that the U.K's vote to leave the European Union could stoke a regional recession and even perhaps a broader economic slowdown.Against that backdrop, Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight Consumer Staples (RHS) climbed on the stock market today to its best level in more than two years. This exchange traded fund holds 36 large-cap stocks in the consumer staples sector.As its name implies, the ETF veers away from the traditional weighting of stocks by market capitalization (or, the total value of all a company's shares of stock). Instead, each stock gets an identical weight in the portfolio.Procter & Gamble (PG) accounts for roughly 3% of portfolio assets. So does Whole Foods Market (WFM).By contrast, Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (XLP), a cap-weighted rival holding the same stocks, gives a 12% weight to Procter & Gamble, its largest stock holding. It has 0.6% weight in Whole Foods Market, its smallest holding.The top 10 holdings in XLP account for 62% of its portfolio assets vs. 29% in RHS.The equal-weighting method followed by the latter prevents a small handful of stocks from having an unduly large impact on performance.That may sometimes work in an investor's favor. But an investor can be sure they'll always get less of a bias toward large companies and a shot at outperforming traditional, cap-weighted rivals with lower volatility.RHS has delivered on that promise both year to date and over the longer run. It's up 11.7% in 2016 through July 1 -- far outpacing the S&P 500 -- and produced an average annual 17.5% gain over the past five years.By comparison, larger peers XLP and Vanguard Consumer Staples (VDC) gained roughly 10% and an average annual 14.8% over those same periods.VDC holds 101 cap-weighted stocks, including Coca-Cola (KO), tobacco giant Philip Morris (PM) and Monster Beverage (MNST), a top-rated IBD Leaderboard stock.Both XLP and VDC also made new multiyear highs on the stock market today.A potentially stronger dollar post-Brexit could act as a headwind for multinational firms such as Procter & Gamble, whose earnings rely on overseas sales. At the same time, investors are discounting the odds of a near-term rate hike. That should boost this dividend-paying sector.""Consumer staples stocks tend to be sensitive to interest-rate hikes because most experience less earnings growth during economic expansions to offset the negative impact of rising interest rates,"" Goldsborough writes.Guggenheim recently launched the 15th in its equal-weighted ETF suite. Guggenheim S&P 100 Equal Weight (OEW) invests in 100 of the largest and most stable companies in the S&P 500, giving each stock an equal portfolio weight. The cap-weighted S&P 100 Index (OEX) is widely used for derivatives and underlies OEX options.The oldest ETF in this innovative suite, S&P 500 Equal Weight (RSP), has, since its 2003 inception, outperformed the cap-weighted S&P 500 in 100% of 10-year monthly rolling periods, 86% of five-year monthly rolling periods, and 81% of three-year monthly rolling periods, according to Guggenheim.Guggenheim's equal-weighted strategies are helped by a disciplined quarterly rebalancing to target weights, which helps them buy stocks low and sell high.

126,PM,"Just days after one of the worst two-day stock market selloffs in years, stocks of some highly rated companies were breaking out Wednesday, including Chinese online gaming company NetEase (NTES) and tobacco products giant Reynolds American (RAI).Meanwhile, novel drug developer Medivation (MDVN), lighting products maker Acuity Brands (AYI) and Broadcom (AVGO), an Apple (AAPL) chip supplier, were all retaking or trying to retake their key 50-day line.NetEase, which boasts a best-possible 99 IBD Composite Rating, meaning it's outperformed at least 99% of all stocks on key metrics including sales and profit growth in recent quarters, shot up 4.9% to 181.48 in heavy volume  in the stock market today. It rose above the 179.20 entry point of a four-month-long cup-with-handle base in heavy volume.M Science analyst Henry Guo said NetEase is likely to deliver revenue above current consensus estimates for the second quarter.The IBD 50 list stock has climbed an amazing 375% from a 38.75 low on Dec. 14, 2014, amid robust sales and earnings growth.For annotated charts of NetEase and other top-rated stocks that are at or near buy range, take a free trial of IBD LeaderboardReynolds American has been working on a flat base for about two-and-a-half months and topped its 52.64 buy point in above average volume, closing up 1.2% at 52.89.The maker of Camel, Winston, Kool and other brands of cigarettes, along with snuff and vapor release devices, was on track for its fourth straight higher close after investors fled to ""safe"" stocks, including shelf stable food makers, utilities and cigarette companies last week.Consumers need food and electricity and tend to keep buying commodities like cigarettes even during market dips. Stocks of its rivals, Altria (MO), British American Tobacco (BTI) and Philip Morris International (PM) have also done well in recent days.Broadcom gapped up 3.5% to 155. The wireless chipmaker continues to grow rapidly despite declining sales of the Apple iPhone. Singapore-based Avago bought the former San Diego-based Broadcom in a deal valued at $37 billion last year and took that company's name. Broadcom hit a record 166 on June 3, after its latest quarterly earnings.Apple rose 0.9% to 94.40.Medivation, which has been forming a flat base for a little more than a month, climbed 5.5% to 60.95, rebounding over the 50-day line after tumbling below that support area in the post-Brexit sell-off. Wednesday's gain may be partly in sync with the 108% jump in share price for Tesaro (TSRO) to a record high. Tesaro said its experimental ovarian cancer drug niaraparib met the main goal of increasing survival rates for patients in a late-stage trial.Medivation has resisted an unsolicited bid from French drugmaker Sanofi (SNY).Acuity Brands, a lighting fixtures maker that has been expanding into adjacent markets including digital lighting products, on Wednesday reported a 50% earnings surge to $2.06 for its  third quarter on a 25% revenue increase to $851.50 million, both beating analyst estimates. Acuity Brands rose 0.8% to 246.61, failing to close above its 50-day line after crossing that support area intraday.

129,PM,"Most stock mutual funds in May extended the rally that began in March. And some strategists are figuring ways to deal with expected stock market headwinds in the summer months.The average diversified U.S. stock fund in May rose 1.55% vs. setbacks in January and February, followed by a 6.50% rally in March and a 0.48% inch-up in April, leaving it 1.92% higher year to date. By comparison, the S&P 500 advanced 1.80% in May.Going forward, most investors who spoke with IBD expect market volatility into the summer. But they're ready.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersLew Piantedosi, manager of four Eaton Vance mutual funds with total assets of $1.2 billion, has a guardedly optimistic, glass-half-full outlook. ""We believe in a core portfolio of secular growers,"" he said. ""Those include names like Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL).""Another such name he likes is NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). ""They provide semiconductor content to the automobile and industrial spaces,"" said Piantedosi, who is a manager of Focused Growth (ELCIX), Focused Growth Opportunities (EIFGX), Tax-Managed Growth (EITGX) and Tax-Managed Multi-Cap Growth (EACPX). ""There's a huge secular shift in those areas toward automation and other new technologies that are driving demand for new semiconductor content.""He added, ""In cars, the new features include crash avoidance, music, rear-view cameras, driver-assisted sensors, other safety systems and an overall trend toward electrical vehicles."" In industrial products, there's a comparable shift into robotics and other forms of automation, he said. ""In both areas, NXP is a leading provider,"" he said.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category PerformanceAmong more cautious investors, with a glass-half-empty view, is James Wong, lead manager of $716 million Payden Equity Income Fund (PYVLX). ""I'm bracing for volatility,"" he said. ""We're entering the summer, when it does not take a lot of bad news to move the market. So, because I'm an equity income investor, I will drink my own Kool-Aid and say investors would be served well by focusing on companies that continue to provide income in a low-volatility manner.""Theme-parks operator Six Flags Entertainment (SIX) is the sort of stock he likes right now. ""They came out of bankruptcy at the start of this decade,"" Wong said. ""They're improving their revenue stream. Management has improved the quality of their parks and introduced new rides. They've increased membership rates, which means people go more often and spend more money. And they've introduced go-to-the-front-of-the-line passes that people gobble up.""The changes have helped. ""They've improved their recurring-revenue model,"" Wong said. ""So they're a steady-cash-generating company, able to maintain and grow their 4% dividend yield.""The market notched a modest gain in May because investors were emboldened by stock market news that turned out to be less scary than they had feared at the month's outset, Wong said.""Earnings season was negative, but not as bad as people had expected,"" Wong said. The prospect of a ""Brexit"" -- a U.K. exit from the European Union -- faded slightly, he added. And the price of oil rose, from just under $46 a barrel on April 29 to just over $49 on May 31.In addition, many investors grew more comfortable with the prospect of an interest-rate hike as soon as June or July.Small-cap growth funds led by tacking on 2.46% in May.Science and technology funds paced sectors by jumping 4.83%. ""When investors are optimistic, they gravitate toward growthier areas of the market,"" Piantedosi said. ""That's tech.""World equity funds fared far worse, losing 0.35%.Japanese funds did best abroad, gaining 2.38%.Taxable bond funds lost 0.14%. U.S. Treasury funds edged up 0.19%. Tax-exempt funds gained 0.55%.May capped a streak of three months in a row of market gains. ""The fear that dominated at the start of the year kept fading in May,"" Piantedosi said.He added, ""U.S. consumers have been strong. Housing was robust. Europe was looking better.""In the near term, investors will focus on day-to-day events such as the Brexit decision, Federal Reserve meetings, November's U.S. elections, monthly jobless reports and the monthly Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), an indicator of the health of the manufacturing sector.Amid all of that noise, remember that the Fed will raise rates because it sees signs of a strengthening U.S. economy. ""And that should help corporate earnings,"" said Karyn Cavanaugh, the senior market strategist for Voya Investment Management and a member of its multiasset strategies and solutions group. ""At the end of the day, stock buying boils down to buying corporate earnings.""Cavanaugh expects an uptick in corporate earnings in Q3 and Q4. Still, if that fails to occur, don't expect U.S. consumer spending to stay strong, warned Cavanaugh, who is also a manager of $39 million Voya Global Perspectives (IWPVX).Wong, for one, says the market's winning streak is likely to end. Valuations are high and earnings growth is weak, he noted.Piantedosi expects disruptive innovators to continue to grab market share. So he likes Amazon instead of brick-and-mortar department stores. Macy's (M), Dillard's (DDS) and Kohl's (KSS) all reported lower quarterly earnings per share in May. All suffered stock-price declines.Amazon reported a 992% EPS gain in April, accelerating from 122% and 118% in the prior two frames. Shares gained 10% in May.He likes Facebook and Google for similar reasons. ""The huge shift continues in advertising (spending) from traditional media to online and social media,"" he said.Ditto for health care. Despite political talk about potential drug-price regulation, he's bullish in the long term on big-cap biotechs like Gilead Sciences (GILD), Celgene (CELG) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX). ""Who knows how the pricing issue will shake out,"" he said. ""But there's plenty of growth in these companies as they continue to innovate.""Piantedosi is not confining bets to high-flyers. ""In any diversified portfolio, you don't want to be pedal-to-the-metal at all times,"" he said. ""Some names in consumer staples, while not cheap, provide stability and predictability and yield.""Philip Morris International (PM) is a favorite. He said, ""It is 100% focused overseas, where the anti-smoking headwind is less than in the U.S. It has a lot of pricing power. The currency headwind is (diminishing) and likely to turn to a tailwind.""Its dividend yield is 4.1%.Pinnacle Foods (PF) is another he likes. ""It's a nice Steady Eddie food company with decent growth characteristics in a food group that doesn't show great characteristics,"" he said.Pinnacle's dividend yield is 2.4%.

132,PM,"Three exchange traded funds that specialize in dividend stocks are tracing bullish patterns on their charts. Moreover, they seldom drop more than 15%.Slow and tight price activity characterizes this trio of ETFs, reflecting the quieter nature of stocks that tend to belong to mature companies whose dividends appeal more to investors than share appreciation.For investors content with dividends and moderate price appreciation rather than the immediate satisfaction of a price rally, the three funds -- all part of IBD's ETF Leaders screen -- are sound choices. But there's a trade-off with the low volatility of dividend ETFs because price performance is dull.PowerShares High Yield Equity Dividend Achievers Portfolio's (PEY) worst drop since the 2009 market bottom was a 19% correction in May 2010. (That excludes the Aug. 24 market mini-crash.)The fund's dividends produce an annualized yield of about 3%. In the latest monthly payout, investors got about 3.5 cents a share. The ETF is up about 13% this year, but it declined 12% in a November-January correction.The Dividend Achievers fund tracks a portfolio of stocks with solid dividends and dividend growth rates. The ETF is close to new highs after finding support at the 10-week moving average, despite the fact that some of its top holdings are oil companies that have been battered lately. Murphy Oil (MUR), the largest component, is about 30% below a 52-week high.As its name implies, the mission of PowerShares S&P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility Portfolio (SPHD) is not just to tap dividend companies, but also stocks with historically subdued price performance. Its steepest decline since the fund launched in 2012 was 10% in 2014. Shares are finding support at their 50-day moving average.The ETF's annualized yield is about 3%. Shareholders were paid about 11.5 cents a share at the end of April. The bulk of the portfolio is in financial, utility and industrial companies.IShares Select Dividend (DVY), which is also rising slowly from its 50-day average, had a couple of 18% declines in 2010 and 2011, but the worst drop since then was a 9% correction in 2014. Shares are near highs as they test the 50-day line. Shareholders are paid dividends on a quarterly basis. In March, they got a little over 63 cents a share.IShares Select Dividend tracks a Dow Jones index of 100 of the highest-dividend-yielding securities, excluding real estate investment trusts. Top holdings include Lockheed Martin (LMT), CME Group (CME), Chevron (CVX) and Philip Morris (PM).The comfort of steady performance, however, was nowhere to be found on Aug. 24, when machinations in electronic trading resulted in a mini crash for most stocks. PowerShares S&P 500 High Dividend collapsed as much as 38% before paring most of the loss. IShares Select Dividend crashed 35.5%, and PowerShares High Yield plummeted 29% before both erased most of those huge losses.The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

133,PM,"Philip Morris (PM) said the greenback's adverse impact on its profit appeared to have peaked during the second half of last year and boosted its 2016 earnings forecast.The seller of Marlboro cigarettes internationally now sees earnings of $4.40-$4.50 a share this year, up from its prior view of $4.25-$4.35 a share. Analysts project full-year EPS of $4.47.But shares closed down 1.3% on the stock market today as Q1 results missed views. Despite the stock market's recent volatility, Philip Morris has been among its better performers, gaining nearly 13% so far this year and is extended from buy range after breaking out of a flat base in February.Among other tobacco giants, Altria (MO) stock fell 0.7%, Reynolds American (RAI) lost 0.8%, and British American Tobacco (BTI) climbed 0.9%.Philip Morris earned 98 cents a share in Q1, down 15.5% from a year earlier, and missed by 13 cents estimates of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue fell 8.1% to $6.1 billion, missing estimates of $6.3 billion.Excluding the unfavorable currency impact of 19 cents, adjusted EPS rose a penny, or 0.9%, compared with the $1.16 earned in the year-ago quarter. Though that negative impact was up from Q4 2015's 18 cents a share, it's nearly half the EPS impact of Q3 2015's 37 cents.The dollar index is off 6.2% from late November 2015, though it's still up significantly from its mid-2014 levels around the time crude oil prices began to plummet. The Federal Reserve's caution about further raising interest rates also is having an impact.
"
134,PM,"The dollar has been the not-so-jolly green giant for corporate America since mid-2014, cutting top- and bottom-line growth. But with the buck retreating, the negative impact for IBM (IBM) and other U.S. multinationals faded in Q1 results, with even more improvement expected going forward.The U.S. dollar index fell Tuesday to its lowest levels since last August's flash market crash. That continued a downtrend this year after a huge run from mid-2014 to late last year. S&P 500 companies with heavy overseas exposure already are seeing smaller FX losses and raising full-year guidance on currency trends.""About 50% of (Johnson & Johnson's) sales come from overseas,"" said Lindsey Bell, senior analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence. ""That’s an encouraging sign.""The dollar index shot up 25% from June 2014 to November 2015. That made U.S. exports less competitive, while reducing the dollar value of overseas income and revenue.The strong buck also contributed to the huge sell-off in dollar-priced commodities, with crude oil falling as much as 75%, hurting energy companies and emerging markets, both of which hurt the industrial sector.The dollar rose in large part because the Federal Reserve was moving toward raising rates, which it finally did last December, while other central banks eased policy. But the Fed has turned more dovish this year amid sluggish economic growth and financial turmoil earlier this year. The Fed now indicates just two rate hikes this year, down from four previously, with markets seeing just one tightening step, perhaps not until September.Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan and European Central Bank pushed ahead with negative rate policies, but their currencies unexpectedly rallied on those moves.  Also, China's yuan recovered its early 2016 losses vs. the dollar.""The dollar index was up 14% (year over year) as of August 2015,"" said Robert Keiser, vice president at S&P Global Market Intelligence.The dollar is now down about 4% vs. a year earlier, suggesting that the FX impact will continue to fade or even start to turn positive. The weaker dollar also has helped U.S. crude prices rise back above $40 a barrel from the mid-$20s in January.A slew of corporate giants with huge international exposure likely will report less of a dollar impact in the next week or so. General Motors (GM) and Alphabet (GOOGL) report on Thursday, with McDonald's (MCD) and General Electric (GE) on Friday.  Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN) are on tap next week.But ""less bad"" isn't quite the same as good. Apple is expected to post a rare sales decline. Overall S&P 500 Q1 earnings likely fell 7.6% while sales dipped 1.3%, according to analysts polled  by Thomson Reuters. Excluding energy, earnings are forecast to slip 2.3% with revenue up 1.7%.
"
135,PM,"And welcome to the real world....stocks failed to continue the rally built upon hope and free money - using cocaine and heroin (think central bank stimulus) to get the mkts where they are..........The catalyst yesterday? Well take your pick.......Was it the lack of a move by the BoJ? How about that weak GDP print? Or maybe the realization that earnings are really going to be down 8% this qtr? Glut in oil inventories? BoE announcement to leave rates unchanged? How about the reality of the FED comments the day before......the FED is unable to raise rates because although jobs are strong, economic activity is slowing? (Now that IS a conundrum - and flies in the face of logic). What about nervous investors that just decided it was time to take some money off the table after the most recent rally? What about the news that Uncle Carl (Icahn) has sold his position in Apple (AAPL) (after chalking up a $2 billion gain) - could that have been the reason that the selling accelrated into the bell? (We'll get back to the announcement by Uncle Carl in a bit).Stocks started the day deeply in the red - as Asian and European mkts were setting the tone.... but my mid-day - traders and investors seemed to put all of that behind - taking the mkt into positive territory - celebrating almost.......but that was not to be....was it sellers that got anxious or was it the buyers who were exhausted? Either way - the pressure started at about 1 pm.......buyers backed off and then the selling accelerated.....the indexes began to roll over......look - the Nasdaq has been leading this rollover for several days now and closed at its lowest level since late March and yesterday just allowed the Dow and S&P to join in the fun. The sell off was broad....The Dow Jones Trucking Index dropped 2.8% (weak earnings), Housing stocks also saw significant weakness, Energy names under pressure, Financials not happy and of course TECH taking the blame for an inflated mkt.Timing is key - because the mkt appeared to be ok after that weak GDP report, weaker earnings, and news from abroad.....but when billionaire investor Carl Icahn, told CNBC that he sold his stake in Apple, the algo's went into 'frenzy mode'.....and the herd mentality caused these same guys to rush the door..... Apple subsequently got hit even harder falling some 3.1%, extending its move lower from Wednesday in reaction to their disappointing earnings....But here is the funniest part of this whole story.....Carl Icahn did NOT sell his position in Apple yesterday......he had already sold it...I mean you don't move 70+ mil shares in a day or two......or even 3 or 4 (unless of course one of the big investment banks 'takes him out of the position in one print - which did not happen)...so you see - Uncle Carl has been quietly liquidating his position over time......not saying anything, keeping his mouth shut, and swearing anyone else in the chain to do the same.....Why? Because ""Loose Lips Sink Ships' - if he announces before he sells it -what do you think happens? Come on, really? (Let's be clear - he did nothing wrong at all - there is nothing untoward here, no one has an obligation to tell the mkt what they are up to....just like when he bought it, he only announced his increased position AFTER he bought it - sending the mkt into a BUY frenzy then - as all the algo's wanted in....stupid really). So he sells it over whatever period of time it took him and then he announces his sale....when there is no more risk of such a negative reaction to his holdings.....What I find so incredibly amazing is how the algo's react to this news.....it's ridiculous...I mean look - he is but one investor - what about Vanguard's 326 mil share holdings, or Blackrock's 315 mil shares? Go down the list - State Street owns some 217 mil shares while Fidelity is lugging 156 mil or so.....Are these asset managers any less savvy? (Who by the way - represent you and me via mutual funds etc.) What about what their position says about the quality of this holding...in fact -Carl's announcement is seen as a gift to any asset manager that wants to add to his position in Apple.....(If you believe the long term story, then buying on weakness is not a negative at all) In the end - it was all about the 'Carl Show' and the drama of it all....look the headline said -""We're Out of Apple and It's China's Fault"" - Really? China's fault? It's a bit dramatic - no?So back to reality....GDP (Gross Domestic Product) - at this point in the game the news is terrible..... - the sharp pullback - causing a reality check in aisle 5. It marks the worst performance in 2 yrs for the US economy......but as expected - we did hear from both sides of the aisle.....and while the economy seems to be struggling, is it as bad as the report implies? Have we seen this movie play out before? Flash back to 2014 and 2015.........we had the same issue - only to see the economy improve as those years went on....but is this year different? Did Janet all but say that? Hasn't the IMF also said it? What do the actions of global central leaders suggest? but then this has been expected for a long time now. Yesterday's GDP report said gross domestic product rose by 0.5% in the 1Q compared to the 1.4%increase in the 4Q. (Economists had expected the pace of growth to be 0.7%).
"
136,PM,"The slower growth due to a larger decrease in non-residential fixed investment, a deceleration in consumer spending and a downturn in federal government spending. But - inflation signals were larger than expected, as the government reported that core consumer prices, which exclude food and energy prices, surged up by 2.1 percent in the first quarter after rising by 1.3 percent in the fourth quarter. So it remains confusing.....Does this mean that June is on the table or not - because in the end - mkt drivers will be about what the FED is going to do....... James Knightley, Senior Economist at ING, had this to say:“Looking at these two outcomes together, the report doesn’t really give us a clear guide as to whether the Fed is more likely to hike at June. We think we will need to see a decent bounce in the activity data for a June hike to occur. We still favor a September move with the Fed then waiting until 2017 before hiking again.”So - no matter what - unless there is a real shift in economic fundamentals - the mkt will most likely go into a tailspin whenever the FED chooses to raise rates....so get used to it.....we have been so pumped up on artificial stimulus - it can't do anything but go lower as it needs to re-price based on changing rates. And guess who does not want that to happen? The Democrats! So expect some hand holding as we move into the summer conventions ahead of the November elections. Let me be clear: Don’t expect a rate hike until after the election in November.....It was indeed a broad sell-off today. The Dow Jones Trucking Index dropped 2.8 percent on weak earnings in this sector. Housing stocks also saw significant weakness as the Philadelphia Housing Sector Index dropped by 2.7 percent. Home related earnings in this sector also showed net losses.A slew of U.S. economic data is scheduled to be released on Friday, including reports on personal income exp of +0.3%, and pers spending of +0.2% and REAL Pers Spending of +0.1% and Chicago-Purchasing managers report.US futures are now down 3 pts -...having broken the 2080 support level...so what is next? I would guess if it does not rally and hold above 2080 - then look for 2050 ish the next stop. Expect more chatter about the Icahn comments and trade as everyone lives vicariously thru the drama.....All very exciting....Take good care.KpFollow Kenny Polcari on Twitter and Kenny Polcari.comKenny Polcari is Vice President and director of NYSE Floor Operations on behalf of O’Neil Securities, Inc., a sister company of Investor's Business Daily.

145,PM,"So which one will she choose to give?Stocks were little changed yesterday as investors/traders held their breath all day waiting on the release of the Apple earnings, the results of the primaries, and speculation over what Janet would say next.....trading was light yet again as the economic data continues to point to growing weakness in the US economy.2 pm today brings us the long awaited FOMC speech......Now do not expect the FED to address any of the politics at all....but you can be sure that Saturday Night Live will have a field day with it.....Technically overbought? From a technical perspective the markets continue to hover in highly overbought territory - if you look closely at the indexes you will see that there is a technical weakening occurring across the broad number of issues despite prices mostly going sideways in April. We can credit the efforts by the FED as we headed into tax season and the April FOMC meeting – especially coming off a disastrous beginning to the 2016 year...now while the 1Q may have been a bit overdone to the downside - this 'forced' rally has clearly taken us well beyond on the upside as well.....which is why we keep struggling at 2100 on the S&P.After yesterday's key earnings disappointments and continued weaker eco data - a Hawkish FOMC speech will be the catalyst the mkt needs to back off.....how can anyone really expect the mkt to surge higher on a hawkish speech in light of all the negative data points? So clearly then, a Dovish speech will cause the algo's to hit the BUY button - sending the mkts higher - but will it change the psychology.....because in the end - a dovish speech at this point in the game (7 yrs) should not be taken as a positive at all...... Tomorrow brings us 1Q GDP and the estimates are all over the place - with some suggesting a negative print while the majority see a barely positive print. Either way - it is NOT suggestive of a strong, robust economy just yet.As noted - yesterday's Durable Goods report was a fairly large disappointment - now while it was positive - it was below expectations while Durable Goods EX transports missed miserably - coming in at -0.2% vs the expected +0.5%.Today's eco data includes Mortgage Apps - reported at -4.1%, Pending Home Sales exp at +0.5% and the big decision at 2 pm. Earnings include BHI, BA, GD, GT, IPP, GCI to name a few...but expect that much of the conversation will be all about Apple.....as nearly every station will be tearing the results apart as they try to connect the dots around the world..... Apple is currently trading down 8 pts or 7.5% at $96.50....it has clearly broken all major support and will have to work hard to hold the line.....US futures are now down 5 pts - while we still remain in the 2080/2100 trading range....now while individual names will get clobbered today.....and the Nasdaq may come under more pressure - both the Dow and the S&P will be less affected. It does not feel like a disaster is looming at all....but as the day progresses - and the speculation builds over what Janet will do - watch as the mkts react.....if they hold steady then expect speech B.....which is exactly what I expect we will hear. That being said - buyers will defend the position - because in the end - has anything really changed? ...None of the headlines are really new.....most of what we are seeing have been the expectations all along.....and we continue to live in La, La land.....Overnight in Asia - mkts all lower - but there was not the Apple implosion that so many expected.....the word is that investors there are much more interested in the comments by the FED as well as the BoJ and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand due out tomorrow. Japan -0.36%, Hong Kong -0.21%, China -0.37% and ASX -0.63%.European mkts are bucking the trend...all in slightly positive territory - seemingly unfazed by the Apple earnings at all.....Banks rallying on the back of some positive forward guidance coming from Barclays. Oil moving higher +1.7% - has now broken thru resistance at $44.23/barrel - paving the way for a surge to the psychological $50 number. FTSE -0.27%, CAC 40 + 0.22%, DAX + 0.32%, EUROSTOXX +0.01%, SPAIN +0.47% and ITALY -0.25%Take Good CareKPFollow Kenny Polcari on Twitter and Kenny Polcari.comKenny Polcari is Vice President and director of NYSE Floor Operations on behalf of O’Neil Securities, Inc., a sister company of Investor's Business Daily.

146,PM,"Stocks came under selling pressure early yesterday morning as expected, but then did a complete 180 degree turn around closing mostly higher with the Dow up triple digits, piercing the psychologically important 18k level while the S&P surged 13 pts ending the day right on the highs as the rally that people love to hate moves on. Pressure on oil prices worked against stocks in the first moments of trading but investors/traders and the big banks ended up ignoring the news out of Doha in a move that surprised many.Mkts around the world are all celebrating today...taking their cue from the turnaround in US equities....US futures are rocketing higher - currently up 11 pts as we kiss the psychological 2100 level.....but as my friend Scott Redler (@RedDogT3) tells me on twitter this morning""The first kiss us usually meets some opposition, then the romance gets you around the bases"" - to which I say - Yes, but it is the first kiss that is the sweetest which makes you want to go back for more.....and more is what it looks like we are gonna get today.....Remember - the mkt is a discounting mechanism....it is looking 4 - 6 months out....the trading today is not about today.....(Just sayin.....) - it is really about what the mkts expect in the fall......and by the looks of it - the mkt is expecting great things...Asian mkts were all higher overnight - Japan which got clobbered on Monday - snapped back and regained 100% of Monday's losses.....as we saw the Yen weaken a bit....a stabilizing oil mkt is also helping to support mkts today....After yesterday's mkt action - it appears that investors are disconnecting from the whims of the oil mkt....at least for now and concentrating on earnings.....European mkts are also enjoying an explosive rally....because why? Earnings and oil......and the sense is that maybe - the whole Mid-East OPEC summit was all hype.....to confuse the conversation.....interesting that the possibility of increased production has caused oil to stabilize and rally a bit from the Monday lows.....Does it feel like something else is going on? FTSE +0.56%, CAC 40 + 1.21%, DAX + 2.22%, EUROSTOXX +1.58%, SPAIN +0.88% and ITALY + 0.57%.Now just a thought or two about yesterday.....and the role that the Deputy Crown Prince is now playing......Look the big story was OIL and POLITICS – Mid East politics – and after two months of all the hype about this pending agreement in a production freeze – traders and the mkts had to deal with the fact that there was no deal – which now sets up the oil mkt for a possible 'free for all'….Keep your eyes on Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman – for he is now the name to know – for it was this 30 yr old son of King Salman who has now turned over the apple cart and merged the commercial considerations of the kingdom with his political stance – a move that is in complete contrast to what was existing policy.......You see for the past 20 yrs – Ali Al-Naimi – the current Saudi oil minister has kept those two issues on separate pages – keeping supply and pricing as the main drivers of any production decisions, always cooperating with the other members – including Iran – no matter what their politics were – in the past to cut production to boost oil prices. The Deputy Crown Prince is not sure he agrees with this policy and so while all the talk has been about how the Saudi's were cooperating with Russia, Venezuela and Qatar – Iran was still the thorn in Prince Mohammed's side….so in a bid to establish himself as an emerging 'force' - as the potential heir to the throne - he nixed the oil deal sending oil mkts into a tailspin on Sunday night/Monday.What is important to understand is that the deputy Crown Prince has now burst onto the global stage since his father became King last year and appears to have every intention of letting the world know. He was appointed the Defense Minister – and is the one responsible for launching the latest military campaign in Yemen while also chairing the country's 'economic planning body' and the council that controls the massive 'state owned' oil company. In a telling interview last week with Bloomberg – the Prince was very clear –""We don't care about oil prices, $30 or $70, they are the same to us. We have our own programs that don't need high oil prices.""This is not how the rest of the OPEC and non OPEC members feel at all – so by nixing any deal he has protected the Saudi's mkt share, and has secured their role as a 'leader' while at the same time laying the groundwork for continued political instability in the region.OK - back to the mkts.....After the initial concerns over these recent developments – the focus returned to US earnings…the day started off with better numbers from Pepsico (PEP), Hasbro (HAS), JB Hunt (JBHT) and in a another surprise move – we learned that Morgan Stanley (MS) – while reporting horrible numbers did in fact ""beat all the estimates."" Net Income FELL 54%, Equity trading revenues FELL 34%, Fixed Income trading revenues FELL 52% and Investment Banking Revenues FELL 15% - but yet they somehow managed to beat the 'much lower' EPS expectation….so all this means is that we must watch out for Goldman Sachs (GS) report this morning.....Analysts expect EPS of $2.48......Now remember – Uncle Lloyd pre-announced this 're-structuring' plan late on Friday – so investors/traders have been prepped about all the bad news and how he has dealt with it head on…. – and like Cousin Jamie (Dimon) of JP Morgan (JPM)– Uncle Lloyd knows how to 'massage' the street analysts – so what I expect to hear this morning is a 'BLOW YOUR SOCKS OFF EPS' beat to rival even the most generous estimate….and the clock ticks towards 7:30 am......In other news - United Health (UNH) just reported a better number - $1.81 vs. exp of $1.72, Philip Morris (PM) on the other hand missed - $0.98 vs. exp of $1.10..... Watch for Brinker (EAT), Comerica (CMA), Genuine Parts (GPC), Harley Davidson (HDI), Kansas City Southern (KSU),Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).Take Good Care

148,PM,"So yesterday at about 3 pm EST the news hit the tape, the twitter sphere and the media outlets.....Headlines screamed:***BREAKING NEWS – SUNDAY APRIL 17, 2016 - ***Failure In Qatar - OPEC ministers unable to come to an agreement - oil mkts began to tremble - investors/traders now had to re-assess the reality of a fractured oil mkt......Oil which has rallied 18% from the early April lows and 30% off of the January lows and are now front and center as Asian mkts prepared to open - initial reactions saw oil plunge 6% as investors hit the sell button first only to ask questions later.....the headlines saturated the web.....who would be first to announce this failure and then the resulting mkt action? The headlines began...""Doha Summit Fails to Agree on Output Freeze""""Oil Freeze Talks End in Failure Amid Saud Demands Over Iran""""Oil Tumbles 5% on Doha Deal Disappointment""""Asia Stocks at Mercy of Post Doha Oil Moves""""Oil's Grand Bargain Falls Victim to Saudi Arabia's Iran Fixation""Futures around the globe plunged as day turned to night and the sun began to set in the US just as it began to rise across Asia….US futures were down 11 pts at 8 pm Sunday evening – while futures across Asia pointed in a similar direction as investors dealt with the fallout. News stories began detailing the talks that took place in Doha – the Qatari capital – which dragged on and on – going some 10 hrs past the original scheduled end time – as ""Howie Mandel"" shouted out –No Deal!Oil ministers from 16 nations, representing 50% of the world's production, gathered in the Qatari capital as they worked towards stabilizing the global mkt with artificial production quotas - the first real attempt at coordinating output among OPEC members and nations outside of the group since 2001. The barriers were numerous - would everyone fall into line? Would Iran come to the table? Could they really commit to restraining production? As we know - the Saudi's made it very clear from the beginning......they wouldn't restrain their production without commitments from other major producers including Iran, which had already made it clear that they had no such intention.The breaking story about a failure to agree on output or production quotas among the world's biggest oil producers now opens the flood gates to what many now expect to be a new retreat in oil prices.""Discussions stumbled after Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations wouldn't agree to any deal unless all OPEC members joined including Iran, which wasn't present at the meeting…""Angus Nicholson – an analyst at IG Ltd in Melbourne, Australia had this to say:""The market has been so heavily positioned for a deal to go through, The change of tone from the Saudis, particularly driven over the last few weeks by Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has been quite a surprise to the market. With Saudi Arabia fighting proxy wars with Iran in Yemen and Syria/Iraq, it is understandable that they had little inclination to freeze their own production and make way for newly sanctions-free Iran to increase their market share.""So then what happened? Was there really a change in tone from the Saudi's? Did investors get this all wrong? Once the idea of a freeze was floated (two months ago) – trader types started buying up oil – as it was assumed that any freeze would trim supply just as summer was about to begin and the driving season was about to take off… Oil rallied 30% off the lows as the excitement built…..but hey, buyer beware – remember it was the news sources that reported this ‘cease fire' all while the Saudi's and the Russians never really confirmed or denied the story - they let it play out in the media - they never explicitly committed. ….It all sounded good – but it did require that all members fall into line and Iran had said from the very beginning that they had no intention of ‘playing nice in the sandbox'.Overnight oil suffered a bit - with Brent down 4% and WTI (West Texas Intermediate) down about 4.5% - makes some sense - but equity mkts did NOT follow suit and implode the way many thought they might.....In fact - we have to ask: Is a ‘No-Deal' actually better for the mkts in the long run as it allows for supply and demand to find its ‘natural' level of equilibrium vs. ‘artificial production controls' which will only put off the inevitable? ( I mean look - we all know what artificial controls can do to mkts - think massive QE programs instituted by every central bank)As Asian mkts opened – the pressure came to bear - mkts sold off - but not to the extent that many were prepared for.....…..Japan was the outlier - falling some 3+% - but this had more to do with the major series of earthquakes in the past 3 days – vs. the oil story.... South Korea (Kospi) moved 0.28% lower, Australia stumbled by 0.4%, Hong Kong lost 0.9% and China was off 1.43% by the end of the day.As the sun sets on Asia it rises in Europe and as the clock ticked – European mkts were the next to react.....they too are under a bit of pressure – taking their cue from investor angst in Asia - but again - equities are not getting clobbered by any stretch.......Currently Brent North Sea Crude oil is off by 2% while WTI (West Texas Intermediate) is down by nearly 3% trading at $39/barrel. FTSE - 0.07%, CAC 40 - 0.04%, DAX +0.06%, EUROSTOXX - 0.18%, SPAIN -0.35% and ITALY +0.11%.US futures which were down 11 pts Sunday evening have recovered a bit from the initial ‘knee jerk' reaction trading last night – currently they are lower by 7 pts as the reality of this OPEC decision permeates the psyche. Since the equity mkts did not implode on this news (as many had expected) – we need to ask: Are investors trying to separate action in the oil/energy space from the rest of the mkt. Now while energy names will get hit today – think transports and manufacturers as beneficiaries of lower oil prices.Earnings will continue to ramp up this week as we enter the thick of it. Last week- the message was all about the banks….now while we saw trading revenues decrease and loan loss reserves increase and most reports miss revenue estimates - they all managed to beat the on the bottom line. Uncle Lloyd (Blankfein) released a strategic restructuring plan ahead of his earnings this week - Headlines read:""Goldman's Blankfein Demands Deepest Cost Cuts in Years"" -on the chopping block? Travel limits, Entertainment, deferring projects and Layoffs as he""has already adjusted his workforce, relying more on JUNIOR bankers, moving support staff to cheaper locations and investing in technology to improve productivity""(Junior bankers? I mean if you want a Jr banker there are so many other places to go - You don't go to GS for a Jr. Banker)The stock rallied on this news taking it to its down trending 100 dma at $163.... earnings are due tomorrow...so the clock is ticking....did he do a good enough job of acknowledging the disastrous industry environment for the sake of investors?Earnings today include Morgan Stanley (MS) - they beat the estimate - reported 0.55 cts/sh vs. exp 0.46 cts/sh, Pepsico (PEP) - beat reporting 0.89 cts/sh vs. the 0.81 cts/sh expected. HASBRO (HAS)toys also beat 0.38 vs. 0.23 cts/sh.....later in the week we will hear from American Express (AXP), McDonald's (MCD), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), IBM (IBM), Intel (INTC), Cocoa Cola (KO) and Microsoft (MSFT)There is not major economic data points today..so the chatter will be about earnings and oil.....and the 3 FED speakers today....Dudley at 8:30 am, Kashkari at 12:30 pm and Rosengren at 7 pm....Take Good Care

"
150,PM,"Stocks managed to rally yesterday as the game of 'cat and mouse' continues. Interestingly enough – the rally was led by Energy and Financials…two sectors which are expected to be the biggest disappointments in this month's 'big reveal'.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) only minutes away from their qtrly confessional - now expectations are for them to report $1.25/sh - but we all know that Jamie will not be embarrassed.. AND LIKE CLOCKWORK AT 6:48 AM - JPM reports earnings of $1.32 handily beating the expectation resulting in every analyst around the street singing his praises and telling us how - this brilliant CEO has managed to surprise the street yet again in the face of the current difficult environment that the industry is facing........The report notes that 1Q profits declined by 6.7% but that trading revs were not as bad as expected......(can't wait to hear how they spin this...) Expect top line revenues to miss, but bottom line earnings to beat.........(love how that happens - don't you?) .......Then we will all be treated to that 'follow up' conference call at 8:30 to explain how they pulled this rabbit out of the hat....If you look at the chart - you will see that is has recovered from the lows of February quite nicely ...as it readies for today's rally that could easily see it test $60.85 before it stalls out....Just sayin..After the announcement the stock jumped 3.2% easily piercing the $60.85 number.....now trading at $61.10.......Futures are pointing higher - UP 11 pts in early pre-mkt trading as the excitement from around the world builds......Given that the stock mkt has bounced back recouping the losses from January, it is hard to say what the banks are going to report - clearly JPM has now set the tone - given the creative handiwork of their accountants. Still, you have to think given the massive losses occurring to banks in Europe and Asia that there must be some spillover effect for US banks which have huge investments overseas. Pay attn to the conference call at 8:30 am.And why all the excitement in global mkts this morning? Well - let me count thy ways.....1. Yesterday the Saudi's and the Russians tentatively agreed to 'freeze production' ....AT CURRENT LEVELS....which by the way - is at all time highs.......so we are freezing production at rates that in reality will not crimp supply, but the mere talk of such a freeze makes all of the analysts and traders tremble in their seats as they somehow assume that the current glut has just gone 'POOF' sending oil up 4+%.......It's ridiculous really....the world is producing oil at a rate of 96 mil barrels/day-(Non OPEC produces at 57 mil/b/day while OPEC produces at 32 mil/b/day +)Never mind that neither the Saudi's nor the Russian actually confirmed this report and Iraq and Iran have no intentions to scale back production – Look - the Saudis may try to hold the line BUT the Russians need cash desperately and US shale producers have openly said that when oil gets back to $40/barrel that they'll fire up the pumps again. as the Economist points out -""US Shale-oil producers, using technology that is both cheaper and quicker to deploy than conventional oil rigs, have made the industry more entrepreneurial"" and so the jury is out until Sunday when the group gets together in Doha, Qatar to discuss......(More to follow...)2. China export numbers blow the doors off the bus....... exports jumped the most in a year - Overseas shipments rose 11.5% in dollar terms in March and declines in imports narrowed, adding to evidence of stabilization in the world's second-biggest economy. Stocks rallied. This export rebound suggests that China's economy has fared better than expected in the first quarter, and on Friday - they are due to report GDP for the qtr....expectations call for a rate of 6.7%But beware - ""Figures around this time of year are enormously impacted by seasonal factors,"" said Ben Simpfendorfer, founder of research firm Silk Road Associates in Hong Kong.""Exports are weak and likely to remain so over the coming months.""Asian stocks surged, with the MSCI Asia Pacific Index rising 2% - headed for its highest close since the first trading day of the year..... This news only added to the excitement for the beaten up commodity space - so we saw traders and investors slide in and scoop up some of the raw-material producers.3. Pent up Demand......investors and traders have been on the edge for a while.....stuck in this 2040/2070 trading range since early March....so all they needed was for a morsel of good news to ignite the rally.....and it looks like they are gonna get today....but will we break out?4. U.S. consumer spending is expected to gain momentum in March as households went on a buying spree - buying a range of goods, a positive sign after growth appeared to have stumbled in the first quarter. Exp are for Retail sales to be +0.1% but EX autos and gas - it should be closer to +0.4% with some calling for a +.7% whisper number!US futures are now screaming higher on the back of the JPM results.....S&P's are up 11 pts while Dow Futures are up triple digits......The mkt remains stuck in the 2040/2070 range but if the rally continues today - then a test of 2070 is upon us right at the opening......a successful test of this will surely allow the mkt to run for the psychologically important 2100 on the S&P........ I guess my suggestion that a test of support at 2015 is not in the cards for today! My sense still is that the underlying tone of the mkt is suspect at best - and after the 15th - April tends to run into trouble.....We can all breathe a sigh of relief - there are NO FED speeches today....but ECO data includes Retail Sales, Mortgage Apps - which surged by 10%, PPI - exp of +0.2%, ex food and energy of +0.1% and the FED's Beige Book - due out at 2 pm. This is a regional read on local business conditions around the country....I suspect that this report will be very positive as they try to ready the mkts for a June rate hike.Take Good Care

152,PM,"It is POST TIME! That time defined as the 'specific time' when the race begins.....when all participants need to be locked and loaded in the narrow gates awaiting the starters call......Yes folks - its RACE day or rather RACE month....when the CEO's & CFO's must confess the financial condition of publicly traded companies....and on each race day - the grooms - in this case the IR guy/gal leads the 'horse' to the 'saddling paddock'. The identifier checks the horse's identity (listed company) to make sure that the results correspond with the proper 'horse'. Then the horse is saddled up and the jockeys (usually the CFO) are given instructions on how to proceed. The jockey adorned in the 'silks' of the horse's owner ( in this case the CEO) are given instructions on how to proceed and together the jockey and the owner take their places....And they are OFF!Last night - post close - we got the first taste of what is expected to be a tough race.....Alcoa (AA) comes out of the gate stumbling....1Q earnings of .07 cts/sh were down 92%, Yes - earnings BEAT the estimate but top line revenues missed big time......coming in at $4.95 bil vs. the expectation of $5.20 bil....... Klaus Kleinfeld (CEO) discussed weak aluminum prices (down 40% over the last 5 yrs) and the state of the global economy.....2000 jobs are on the line because of weak mkts around the world......The stock fell 4% in after hours trading and is currently trading at $9.34 down 0.40 cts off of last night's close....'and so it was written' the season has begun.....'Stocks popped at the open but the rally was short-lived....stocks failed to sustain the early upside spike and stocks turned lower...sellers dominating the day and selling into the rally. The pullback attributed to the beginning of what is predicted to be a disappointing earnings season.What also added to the sour mood was the double secret meeting between Yellen and the Fed governors. Following this surprise expedited meeting, Janet Yellen met with President Obama to discuss the state of the economy. Now just an FYI - this was the first time since November 2014 that the sitting Fed chair has met one on one with the president....and the media was not invited...so what did they discuss? Rate hike - nah, GDP - maybe, the real unemployment rate? Doubtful - as Obama thinks it's all a bed of roses.....How about the state of the banking industry and how the global contraction has affected the industry....How about the quality of assets, how about margin compression and growth prospects in this less than stellar environment....... especially after two central banks - the ECB and the BoJ initiated negative interest rates. Oh boy.....so much to say....Now as discussed - we are expecting earnings to be down y/y - and as of the end of March - that number has been 'adjusted' to -8.5%....(slight improvement...) Energy, financials and industrials to take the brunt of the blame...... this will be the 4th straight qtr of EPS (Earnings per share) declines....but do not be concerned.....because as usual - expect to see 70% of those earnings 'beat the estimates' - but like Alcoa - will they beat due to cost cutting or will they actually GROW top line revenues? The jury is still out - but my money says - the majority of the 'beats' will come from 'expense management' vs organic growth.....Today we get a bit of a reprieve before the financials line up in the starting gate.....Wednesday - look for JPMorgan Chase (JPM) followed by the usual suspects - Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Bank Of America (BAC)..... Will weak earnings be discounted? Are we really expecting that 'hockey stick' recovery in the second half of 2016? And if so then this is a gift for the longer term investor...because if this as bad as it gets - then future action can only be UP......unless of course the mkt does not believe it and the guidance is less than stellar.....Now the VIX - is giving us a whole different storyline.....this index (otherwise known as the FEAR Index) - has fallen to a 7 month low.... What its telling us is that the mkts are not concerned about almost anything at the moment and some of the industry's recent surveys confirm this lack of concern.......The American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) reveals that pessimism is at a 5 month low of 32.2% - well below the historical average of 39%. Bank of America's ""Bull & Bear"" index recently surged to 4.1, up dramatically from the March low of 0.1......,suggesting the most bullish reading in 9 months. So when everyone is so bullish - what's left??? But buyer beware....this can change in a heartbeat - as any number of things could cause a change in psychology....or sentiment.Yes - it's all nice when everyone plays nice on the jungle gym....but as soon as we get something unexpected then we could see a rather swift and painful sell off...Remember - as I have pointed out - the next two months is traditionally weak and with the US in the middle of a nasty presidential election cycle - so much can happen that will change the direction of the conversation.Risk remains high.....FED policy is uncertain and if the FED is forced to raise rates too quickly - then prepare for the massacre, Europe's economy is on the edge, China is slowing, a Yuan devaluation is NOT out of the question, negative interest rates causing concern around the globe, and continued currency wars and the geopolitical risks of terrorism, war and immigration could easily ignite mkt volatility and are only a few of the risks that exist.US futures are higher by 5pts this morning - no matter what the Alcoa earnings say.....The mkt remains stuck in the 2040/2070 range but feels a bit heavier each day.....a decisive break below 2040 will take us back to support at 2014. Remember - the underlying tone of the mkt is suspect at best......Bank earnings are now the next big thing for investors to watch and mkts to digest.We have 3 FED speeches today....Philly's Patrick Harker at 9 am, San Fran's John Williams at 3 pm, and Richmond's Jeffrey Lacker at 4 pm. Can't wait to hear what prophetic words are on the teleprompter....How will mkts react or have the mkts now decided that all of this FED speak is just noise?Take Good Care

154,PM,"T-10 hrs days until the official start of earnings season and T-5 days until Uncle Sam comes knocking on your door asking for money…..all while the big banks are working extra hard to hold prices nearer the recent highs as the tax deadline approaches….Stocks ended lower last week with the S&P and Dow finishing in positive territory for the day but about 1% lower for the week….energy tried to make a comeback while financials and tech came under continued pressure. In initial trading – stocks gapped UP on the open – continuing to reflect the inverse relationship between the weaker dollar and oil – you see - as the dollar weakens, oil, other commodities and stocks tend to strengthen – but the strength in stocks was short lived as sellers took advantage of the move ahead of the weekend and buyers grew weary.There was plenty of conflicting data to deal with during the week - First we had a bevy of Fed Presidents giving their views on the state of affairs – as they try to show that they are in control of both monetary policy and the dollar – Does the word 'conflicting' mean anything to anyone? (Yellen - FED Chair - says rates are not going anywhere while members of the Peanut Gallery suggest that rates are going up at the end of the month) So once again the conflicting speeches did nothing but cause confusion and frustration among investors as the reality of exhausted monetary policy initiatives begins to bubble to the surface.And speaking of an 'exhausted monetary policy' – Did you hear all of the chatter around how the Yen continues to advance in the face of NEGATIVE interest rates? Yes – ma'am – the BoJ (Bank of Japan) last month introduced negative rates - as another source of stimulus - to try and force the Yen to weaken – thereby helping their export economy – but in a perverse twist of fate – the Yen has only strengthened vs. the dollar which is sending PM Shinzo Abe, Finance Minister Taro Aso and BoJ Governor Hauhiko Kuroda into a rage….And not to be outdone - negative interest rates imposed by the ECB (European Central Bank) two months ago are also NOT accomplishing the stated goals as the Euro continues to strengthen as well – sending Uncle Mario (Draghi) and other members of the ECB closer to the edge.But this leaves us to ask – are the strength in these currencies due to the recent FED inaction over the future of US interest rates or due to healthier Asian and European economies? The smart money is betting the former....(Remember: The expectation of a rate rise in March caused the dollar to rally vs. these currencies - from early Feb thru Mid March....but then - a NO action move by the fed, coupled with a clear concern over the state of the global economy caused the dollar to weaken sending these other reserve currencies higher and this is causing angst and panic among the paparazzi).Next up – we got a range of macroeconomic data points – all showing continued weakness in the economy which did nothing to help investor psyche – add in the chatter from some of the Fed representatives who discount the data and tell us that we are all wrong and that the economy is firing on all 12 cylinders and you have a perfect recipe for paralysis…..How's that working for you?And this week – there is plenty of global macro data points to digest. Retail sales from the US, China and Brazil. PPI's from the US, UK, Japan and China. CPI's from the US, UK, Euro zone, China. Industrial Production numbers from the US, Euro zone, China, Japan. Capacity Utilization and Empire Manufacturing from the US. We will also here from the BoE and the PBoC on additional monetary policy initiatives.Next up - Earnings! and while they tell us that we are NOT in another recession - there is no argument that US Corporate earnings are......As we know - this qtr is set to be the WORST season in 6 yrs.....with earnings projected to FALL by 9% - but with all of the most recent downgrades to earnings - the joke begins again.....You see - In the end – analysts cut the estimates to the bone, lowering the bar and making it almost impossible for companies NOT to beat the expectations and then the street gets to celebrate and the conversation turns to how the season 'wasn't so bad'…… (Psychology 101)Tonight after the bell - we get Alcoa (AA) - no longer considered the bell weather that it was when it was a member of the DOW - but their results will set the tone for some of the large multi-nationals.....The real kicker is going to be the major banks - think JP Morgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Bank of America (BAC) which begin their confessional period on Wednesday...…..so watch for much more stock specific activity in the days ahead as the reports hit the tape. In the next couple f weeks - we will get the regional banks, energy and oil companies, retailers, drugs, healthcare, home builders, industrials/conglomerates and technology. What will the multinationals say about the state of affairs in their respective industries and the impact of monetary policy on their businesses – (Think dollar) vs. what will US businesses say about the condition of the US economy and the health of the US consumer?Remember – earnings are now history – they are what they are – what investors and the mkts want to see are the seeds of real top line revenue growth and projections for a more vibrant, robust future vs. continued talk of layoffs and cost cutting to support the bottom line…A quick glance back at mkt action over the past half dozen years and beyond reveals a seasonal weakness right after the 15th….and I would not expect this year to be any different at all…..I mean – What has changed in 8 yrs? Nothing really –Oh yes….the Obama administration will tell us how the economy has created some 14 mil new jobs and that the unemployment rate is below 5% and wages have stabilized and the consumer has never been stronger – and to that I say BS! Because if that were really true then FED policy would be different……rates would have normalized long ago, GDP would not be the pathetic sub 2% that it is, inflation would be greater than the 2% target and we would be seeing strong upward pressure on wages as companies compete for employees – and that is NOT happening at all. In fact – wages continue to weaken because of the massive supply of underemployed and unemployed Americans, older workers are getting thrown out in favor of younger less experienced workers (think expensive senior level people), other jobs continue to get shifted overseas where the minimum wage is maybe $3.50 an hr…Take the banking and credit card industry as an example – every time you call the 800 number – you get someone in a third world country that wants you SS number, your physical address, your IP address and your DOB... and then we wonder how we get our identities stolen?Overnight – Asian mkts were mixed. Japan (-0.5%) continues to be assaulted by a rising Yen sending exporters deeper into negative territory. BoJ Governor Kuroda is keeping a close eye on how a rising Yen is creating instability in the Nikkei and is prepared to act if need be. He will be in NY on Thursday - so expect to hear more from him then. In China (+1.4%) – The gov't released their March inflation data – CPI rose by 2.3% y/y – in line with forecasts while the monthly read fell by 0.4% m/m. The PPI fell by 4.3% y/y marking the 49th consecutive month of lower readings and this news only suggests that we can expect more monetary easing.
"
155,PM,"The World Bank also warned of slowing economic growth in East Asia and the Pacific Rim due to a weaker China.....(more of the same....but it is a reason for some of today's Asian weakness) .European mkts are all in positive territory now that oil reversed its course lower in early trading. The Euro is trading flat vs. the dollar and the expectation of additional monetary stimulus continues to support those mkts. so the focus for them is also the coming earnings season. FTSE +0.01%, CAC 40 + 0.59%, DAX + 1.19%, EUROSTOXX + 1%, SPAIN +1.42% and ITALY +1.74%US futures are higher by 9 pts this morning - in a continued game of 'cat and mouse' ....suggesting that the S&P will try to test the most recent highs of 2075 before the onslaught of earnings begins. Remember - the underlying tech tone of the mkts is suspect at best......Companies that are in buyback mode are effectively out of the mkt for now - so let's see how investors really feel about the quality of earnings and the quality of the global macro data. I continue to believe that we will remain in the 2040/2070 range until we get bank earnings beginning on Wednesday.....And then the real test begins.Take Good Care

157,PM,"Investors looking for stocks that are beating the market in terms of both price performance and dividends may want to consider these four companies. Up first: Reynolds American (RAI), which has a 96 Relative Strength Rating. Shares have risen 10% this year, vs. a 2% loss for the S&P 500. They're still in buy range from a 49.66 flat-base buy…
"
158,PM,"Stocks got clocked yesterday - in a continuing game of 'boom-er-rang' - The S&P plunged 25 pts breaching the psychologically important 2040 level - which then opened the flood gates - causing the algo's to go into panic mode sending the mkt down another 7 pts to test the 2033 level.....before finding any support at all....(let me remind you - 2033 is NOT really a support level at all.....it is just temporary as the mkt continues to dissect the conflicting commentary). The real next important support level is the 200 dma at 2016...... The boom-er-rang action underscores continuing concerns about global economic health as we are about to enter earnings season...The selloff yesterday credited to weakening global growth (yawn.....) and a renewed emphasis on failing global monetary policy mandates highlighted by a rising Japanese YEN - You see a rising YEN is raising all kinds of alarm bells as the Japanese economy continues to struggle..... when the latest BoJ move was a blatant attempt at halting the YEN's move...........Remember - the BoJ (along with the ECB) has introduced NEGATIVE rates....in another attempt to stimulate their economies.....Negative interest rate policy (NIRP) is an unconventional tool and one that screams desperation and in THEORY is intended to:1. Weaken the currencies of those countries - which should help exports be more competitive and....2.Invcentivize banks to lend money more freely to businesses and individuals to invest, lend and spend vs. saving - thereby helping the economy recover.(Theoretically - that all sounds great - but in reality that is NOT how it is working.....kind of like when the brain surgeons in this country dictated that we needed 80+ trading venues, decimals and sub-decimals to make mkts be more liquid and tradeable - How's that working for you? Remember - there is Theory and then there is Reality......and the reality is that the current path of global monetary policy is about to BLOW.......so hold on....)You see - negative rates have not weakened these currencies at all....in fact the YEN (and the Euro) have only gotten stronger and this is a bit of problem.....you see what this says is that monetary policy is growing weary after 8 yrs...The YEN's rise is sending central bankers into the 'romper room' as they struggle to contain the mkt dislocations that are becoming more common undermining investor confidence in the ability of central banks to control the situation........The fear now is that central bank policies run the risk of becoming self defeating - causing a massive recalculation of risk which has the ability to generate more volatility, which will drive investors out of RISK assets into SAFE HAVEN assets - think Treasuries, Gold and Currencies.And all this comes right back to the lack of foresight from elected officials to initiate real fiscal structural reforms to assist 21st century economies....Look - this ain't your grandmothers economy any longer.....the rules that governed how economies worked back in the 20th century do not appear to be working in the 21st century....so maybe someone should think about 'disrupting' it.....I mean isn't it all about DISRUPTION? (Think UBER, AirBNB, Facebook (FB), Twitter (TWTR), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), Netflix (NFLX), Yahoo (YHOO), etc...)OK - so we are only days away from earnings season (and TAX DAY).....and institutions are clearly focusing on what's going to get hit in this next earnings cycle..... and as you might have expected, yesterday's losses were led by banks and tech companies.Decisions by the FED, BoJ and ECB are set to hammer bank earnings at home and abroad.....so it makes some sense to re-allocate capital ....now that being said - as the banks come under pressure then they begin to look attractive again....so be careful here......Once the earnings are announced - we may see a rush to buy these beaten global names... Financials represented by the XLF have had a wild ride this year and are now down about 10% ytd.....sitting right on support at 21.70....Watch how they act over the next week - as we await their announcements.This morning US futures are ricocheting higher once again - currently up 10 pts.....as the mkt continues to digest the conflicting macro data points and speeches given by a range of central bankers....The YEN is down (slightly), Oil is up, Gold is down and the Dollar is churning......Mkts remain unpredictable - and moves become exaggerated in either direction as investors try to bring valuations back into line based on expectations of futures policy shifts. I expect that the mkt will test support at 2016 sometime next week....where I think it will hold. On the upside I think we top out at 2055/60 today...in this 'snap back' move.Overnight Japan's Finance Minister Aso - said the recent rise of the YEN was undesirable and promised action......Recall my thoughts on Tuesday as the Nikkei plunged...""..... the Yen rallies (bad for exporters) - How are those negative rates working? How much more can the Yen rally before we enter 'intervention territory'? Will PM Shinzo Abe announce another stimulus plan?""Last night (again), IMF head Christine Lagarde said that growth has been ""too low for too long,"" that many people were ""simply not feeling it"" warning that the IMF may lower its global growth forecast.(Bernie take note: Socialism - as we see in Europe - isn't working for them and it won't work for us either.....(Just my opinion - Just sayin...) .So please - go home to Vermont and take NYC Mayor Bill DiBlasio with you..... - Do we need to discuss what has happened to NYC since his election? - Think one word - DISASTER).Today's calendar is pretty quiet....there are no material economic reports today but we will be entertained again by two Fed speakers: NY's Dudley at 8:30 am and Dallas's Kaplan at 9:30 am - just as the opening bell rings.So, expect the focus to remain on the YEN, the Dollar, Oil and failing global monetary policies. If the YEN begins to move lower, the dollar stays stable and Oil moves higher then just maybe we can find stability today....and possibly take back yesterday's losses.....but don't get too comfortable just yet....Next week is sure to provide more excitement....Take Good Care

160,PM,"In a follow up to yesterday's 'Capital Castration' commentary - the Obama administration has temporarily succeeded in snuffing out progress.....you see - Pfizer & Allergan have now called off their proposed merger as a result of this NEW REGULATION - The Journal headlines with:""Pfizer to Walk Away From the Allergan Deal"" -The article goes on to detail how the Obama Administration took direct aim at the deal.... a deal that would have made Pfizer more competitive due to the lower taxes that they would have enjoyed via this move to Ireland... Now before you all go screaming suggesting that I am somehow in bed with the enemy - I am NOT.Here is the deal - I am not in favor of US companies bypassing the system at the expense of the US....BUT - what I am in favor of is that the US Gov't FIX or SOLVE this problem so that US companies are not FORCED to exploit this loophole.How loud do US corporations need to scream before elected officials and legislators in DC hear them about the BROKEN, DEFECTIVE, BUSTED, RUPTURED, FRACTURED Corp TAX CODE that drives large American Blue Chip companies out of the country causing massive job losses, loss of talent and loss of intellectual capital? What is it that those clowns do not understand? How many more years - going on 20 now - do we need to have this conversation? WAKE UP! SMELL THE COFFEE.....The world is eating us for lunch! And just think what will happen if Bernie Sanders gets anywhere near 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue! (Can you say ""Back to the USSR?)Ok - onto the mkts..... stocks fell again yesterday as investors continue to fret over a weak earnings season, a larger than expected trade deficit and a couple of GDP downgrades as we get ever closer to the start of the confessional period. Are investors now concerned that all of these central banks have run out of real options?Be warned.....earnings are expected to be weak and after some of the recent macro data reports and yesterday's latest trade data - the stakes for even more disappointment have been raised yet again....You see....the U.S. trade deficit widened to $47.1 billion in February, which is a bigger drag on growth...and as a result guess what? Moody's downgraded the 1Q US GDP to just 0.2%, while the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow was lowered to 0.4% down from 0.7% only 4 days ago saying:""The GDPNow model for real GDP in the 1st qtr of 2016 is now 0.4%...after yesterday's mornings light vehicle sales release from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis and the manufacturing report from the US Bureau of the Census, the forecast for real GDP growth declined from 0.7% to 0.4% due to declines in the forecasts for real consumer spending growth.""So basically, the US economy is stalling out, the consumer is exhausted and the Obama administration is more concerned about punishing and regulating behavior rather than creating opportunities to fix behavior and ignite real economic change -which brings us back to what kind of an earnings season are we likely to see and how will the stock market react given that we are trading at 22 times earnings for the S&P - which would not be all bad - IF the economy were really functioning properly....but since it is not and the FED ( and every other central bank) is 'juicing it' we are setting ourselves up for some very strong headwinds as we move into mid April. (On the positive side, the ISM non-manufacturing - Service index did show some improvement - but one report does NOT discredit the prior 10 that remain disappointing - HELLO????)From a technical perspective, the broad market - represented by the NYA Index -(New York Stock Exchange Composite Index - lesser known but equally important), along with the Nasdaq, the Russell and the Dow Transports are all still trading in what some technicians call 'bear market territory' because they still have not pierced their 200 dma's with any commitment. The Nasdaq and the Russell 2000 still struggling to pierce it while the Dow Transportation index pierced it but then swiftly slipped below it again.... This is not what we want to see if a true change in psychology is on the horizon...... but do not discount one more short term bounce as we move into April 15th.This morning US futures are up 3 pts.....as the mkts continue to gyrate. Oil is up 2% after the weekly API inventory report showed a drawdown of 4.3 mil barrels vs. the expected +3.3 mil build - Some better macro Chinese and German data while positive is not a real mkt mover. As expected the S&P did find support at 2040 yesterday - so that is giving some support to the idea that the buyers are willing to defend this position. The only eco announcement today of any importance are the FED mins - which are due out at 2 pm....Will they change the direction of the conversation - most likely not.Look for commentary from 3 FED members today.....Cleveland's Loretta Mester (Hawk) is due at 12:20 pm, St. Louis's James Bullard (who plays both sides) and Dallas's Kaplan (more Hawkish - yet still not sure) both speak post close - so any comments from them will be reflected in trading tomorrow - unless of course the Hi-Freq trader types pay for copies of those speeches so that they can 'trade ahead'....but that's a story for another day......Take Good Care

163,PM,"Wake Up....Global mkts under pressure. Gold up, Oil down as recent comments by the Saudi's raise doubts over the ability of anyone to agree to freeze output......Earnings season is upon us and concern continues to mount....Overnight Christine Lagarde - IMF (International Monetary Fund) Managing Director sounding alarm bells about the state of the global economy..........trying to balance her statement to sound somewhat positive - she says that'while we have growth and are not in crisis mode - the recovery remains far too slow and too fragile and RISKS are INCREASING'........so many people 'are not feeling it...'Couple that with Boston's Fed Pres - Eric Rosengren - who said""If, as I expect the economy data continue to show a moderate recovery, it will likely be appropriate to resume the path of gradual tightening sooner than is implied by financial-market futures,""And that Wall St is 'mistaken' about the timing and direction of rates ( here we go again with the inmates running the asylum...)..... Back up one min, won't you.....'economic data continuing to show moderate recovery'? ....OK? And we have the perfect recipe for RISK OFF.....US futures are getting smashed...down 19 pts in early pre-mkt trading...sending the S&P future down and thru 2040......(must be all that good news......)Yesterday the gov't reported that Factory orders for manufactured goods in February FELL 1.7%, marking the third time in the last four months that they have been down. Total factory orders are down 1.7% year-over-year while orders, excluding transportation, are down 3.4%. (Eric - those are negative numbers...not positive numbers....just sayin...). This supports Friday's NFP report that showed nearly 30,000 lost jobs in manufacturing (another negative number) ....Never mind that Producer prices in Europe continued to fall, resuming their downward deflationary path falling at -4.2% y/y! (grossly negative number...)Overnight - The Nikkei plummeted by 2.4%, the Yen rallies (bad for exporters) - How are those negative rates working? How much more can the Yen rally before we enter 'intervention territory'? Will PM Shinzo Abe announce another stimulus plan? Kathy Lien - Managing Director at FX Strategy at BK Asset Management had this to say:""With the high level of long yen/short dollar positions, this is the prime time for the BoJ to intervene....however Japanese policy makers have not confirmed any intervention thus far....""Hong Kong and Australia both lower by 1.5% - China bucking the trend rallies by 1.3% .This morning European mkts also getting slammed.....Euro zone macro data supporting the recent Lagarde statements as they show little signs of improvement. Euro zone composite PMI - both output and services coming in below the earlier flash estimates.....Now Chris Williams - Chief Economist at Markit - tried to stop the bleed by saying:""This Euro zone data is by no means a disaster....it's just disappointing growth......""He tried to accentuate the positive by saying that there are 'pockets of growth' in both Spain and Ireland.....well that's all well and good - but when you take Germany, France, and Italy out of the equation - it sends a very clear message....and so investors are voting with their feet and heading for the exits today.....FTSE - 1.4%, CAC 40 - 2.2%, DAX -2.3%, EUROSTOXX - 2.25%, SPAIN -2.1% and ITALY -2.2%This morning's WSJ headlines with another round of gov't REGULATION that will serve to further CHOKE the economy.....Jack Lew - another Harvard Educated rocket scientist - announces""New Rules on Tax Inversions Threaten Pfizer/Allergen Deal....In a move , which is far more aggressive than anticipated, sent Allergen's shares tumbling...""Now yes, these new rules - 'the 3rd wave of administrative action against inversions will make it harder for companies' and will curb corporate inversions - but here is the issue.Instead of addressing the 'structural issues' that cause inversions (corp tax structure) - the gov't decides to 'castrate big business"" with more regulation . And so this seems to be the Obama Administrations (and by default the Democrats) way to the future.....Castrate capitalism!And in another attempt to become a listed exchange - BATS has launched a new road show - marketing itself to investors 4 yrs after that massive humiliating failed attempt the first time around...... The offering is expected to generate about $212 mil - and allow the private investors an opportunity to 'get out'..... Price talk is in the $17/$19 range. Once again - they are choosing to list their shares on their exchange....let's hope that they fixed that 'software glitch'......Eco data today includes: Markit US Services PMI - exp of 51.2, ISM Non Manf Composite of 54.2 and the JOLTS job openings - Not a major data point at all - unless of course they can use it to sell their story.I suspect that if the mkt remains weak into the opening and we break 2050 on the S&P cash - then a test lower to the 200 dma at 2015 - is not out of the question...as it now appears that all of the excitement at month end has turned into caution ahead of today's slew of mixed to negative news - at the moment there is no reason for mkts to rally....buyers will be patient as they watch sellers squirm....Take Good Care

165,PM,"Tobacco stocks have been smoking in recent weeks, fueled by a move to defensive stocks and by vague rumors about mergers.

Tobacco, foods, household staples and utilities -- all dividend-paying stocks -- historically fill the bill. Tobacco…

166,PM,"And as expected - stocks did very little yesterday...in yesterday's note - I suggested that we would remain in the 2055/2065 range with no reason at all to do much else....in fact yesterday's range was 2057/2063 - and there were no fireworks, no end of month or end of qtr surprises at all as investors were just happy to see the end of the qtr come (and go)! In the end the Dow end the qtr with a 1.5% gain and the S&P had a 0.8% gain.Now you could credit yesterday's lack of activity to both exhaustion and reluctance by anyone to do anything ahead of today's NFP report and the host of other macro data points that will bombard us today......... Remember today is April 1st - otherwise known as April Fool's Day around the world....now while its origin is unknown - it is a day defined by tricks, tomfoolery and hoaxes - all designed to make someone look like an April Fool..... So the question today is:Will today's NFP report just be an April Fool's joke? Mkt expectations are calling for an increase of 205k jobs created in March - now remember last month the call was for +195k and the gov't came out and told us that we really created 242k jobs! (Now THAT is a joke.....).....on Wednesday - the ADP reported a slightly higher number of jobs created + 200k (vs. the expected 195k), and they raised the prior month from 205k to 214k......this now suggests that we will get a stronger NFP report.... and to that I say - ""April Fools!!!""Other eco data due out today includes:

174,PM,"Ward's Domestic Vehicle Sales of 13.8 mil and Total Vehicle Sales of 17.5 milSo as you can see - it will be a day of data points...and the mkt appears to be taking a breather. US futures are down 9 pts in early pre-mkt trading.....Now remember - it is a NEW qtr...the slate has been wiped clean and the odometer has been reset to zero.....The dollar continues to come under pressure, oil appears to be de-coupling from the broader mkt - the recent rally in oil driven more by the dollar action vs. any real change in fundamentals.....Gold - which has seen a dramatic 16% gain over the past 3 months is now coming under a bit of pressure as investors decipher the tea leaves over the future of US and global economics. If the data begins strengthen then logic tells us that Gold should weaken (think other more dynamic opportunities) but if the global economies continue to stall or weaken then watch Gold spike higher yet again (think the safe haven play)....Earnings are now clearly in the bulls eye as investors prepare themselves for the onslaught of coming earnings over the next 3 weeks.The WSJ runs with a headline article this morning detailing the state of the IPO (Initial Public Offering) mkt.""Lackluster IPO Market Flashes Warning - Pace for initial public offerings is slowest first qtr since 2009, and analysts warn that second period may not bring much relief""In this article the writer tries to connect the dots between the lack of new product and investor appetite for risk...... I am not sure that is the connection...investor appetite will be fed by interesting and dynamic product as well as realistic valuations for these untested products.....it is the purest form of mkt dynamics that rewards proper risk taking......Investment by PE firms, Venture Capital Firm and large asset management firms have push valuations to extremes and maybe investors are finally waking up the idea that these extreme valuations reward nobody but the investment banks and the insiders looking to unload these 'over valued' shares.Yesterday we learned that many of the big asset managers (Fidelity, Blackrock, TRowe Price etc....) - the same ones that have invested in private start ups (PRE-IPO) have pushed valuations to 'extreme' levels and are now taking - 'hair cuts' ( I think it was described as an AX) to valuation estimates for these privately held (difficult to value) companies. I would argue that it was THESE asset managers themselves that are responsible for the crazy valuations creating ' Unicorns' that they now are the focus of investor angst.[A Unicorn is usually a startup company that does NOT have any established performance metrics but have a supposed stock mkt valuation of more than $1 billion dollars]So now that all of these asset managers are having a 'V-8' moment and becoming more realistic - we are beginning to see a change in psychology.....Should these companies really have such ridiculous valuations? Apparently not! And these very markdowns have sucked the life out of the momentum - making it harder for investment banks to 'sell this story' at the ridiculous valuations that they have tried to convince us all of....So now you get untested, overvalued private companies that think they are going to cash out at 'X' and are now told that ""maybe that is not the case""......they may have to settle for something more realistic like 'Y'....and they don't want that - so they don't come to the mkt....It's like the guy that says my house is worth $1 mil while everything around him is trading at $400k......HELLO??? Does this remind anyone of the late 90's DOT.COM bubble?????Global mkts begin the new qtr all in the RED - (no one should be surprised at all).
"
175,PM,"As noted - US futures a pointing lower - now down 9 pts at 2044 - in pre-mkt trading as we prepare for the US jobs report. If we don't find support on the future right here at 2040 - then a move into the low 2030's would be expected.Global mkts also started the new qtr in the RED - In Asia - all mkts ended the day lower.....In Japan the March Manufacturing PMI dropped to 49.1 while the important Tankan Survey also missed estimates coming in at 4 vs. the exp of 6 - and this only causes more angst over the Japanese economy. Next door in China - we did see China Manf PMI rise (surprise) to a 9 month high of 50.2 vs. the est of 49.4. All of this just noise as all eyes are focused on the US - after all the drama of the past couple of weeks. Japan - 3.5%, Hong Kong -1.34%, China +0.12% and ASX -1.64%.In Europe - PMI""s were than the flash estimates, but the weakness in Japan ended up stealing the show....Volumes remain subdued as European investors count the minutes until the US jobs report.

179,PM,"Ok...so what happened last night? All that hype about the China macro data kept everyone on edge over the weekend...what would they report? Would it be a disaster? What would that say about the health of the Chinese economy and then by default the global economy? In the end - it was NOT a blockbuster, in fact it was rather boring really....
"
180,PM,"At 10:00 pm est - China released a bunch of data - and it was mixed.....no disasters but no upside surprises either.........3rd Qtr GDP came in above expectations at 6.9% (exp was for 6.8%), Industrial Production did rise 5.7%, but that was below the exp of 6%. Fixed Asset Investments (FAI) - a key reading - came in at 10.3% - below the expectation of 10.8% and Retail Sales - that beat at 10.9% vs. the exp of 10.8%... So what does it all mean? Well - to start with - the data implies that the world is not ending and that the Chinese economy appears to be stabilizing - which in the end is a positive.
"
181,PM,"Angus Nicholson - Market Analyst at IG sums it up like this:
"
182,PM,"""It's hard to be overly optimistic about the headline number, especially given the range of other data released today. Nonetheless, markets have clearly been buoyed by the better than expected headline number, and it shows that China's economy has not deteriorated as much as some had thought""
"
183,PM,"James Laurenceson - Deputy Director of the Australia-China Relations Institute added that:
"
184,PM,"""The data show a rebalancing away from growth driven by investment and secondary sector production towards consumption and the services sector. It's time we accept that Chinese growth isn't solely at the mercy of industrial production and fixed asset investment""
"
185,PM,"So maybe, just maybe this is the 'new normal' for China. Maybe the world will see a China growing at a 6 handle and that's ok. Analysts are already looking out to the 4th qtr and suspect that by year end China will achieve annual growth of 6.8% -7% on continued fiscal and monetary support.
"
186,PM,"Global markets are not panicking with on these reports. In fact - there appears to be a little bit of 'risk on' as the investors/traders are relieved that the data was NOT as bad as analysts had prepared us for. Asian markets essentially ended flat. Japan - the worst performer - ended the day -0.88%, Hong Kong + 0.04%, China + 0.14% and ASX +0.03%.
"
187,PM,"European markets are also higher - discounting the China data and refocusing on earnings. FTSE flat, CAC 40 +0.32%, DAX + 0.86%, EUROSTOXX + 0.53%, SPAIN flat, and ITALY + 0.61%.
"
188,PM,"France's Danone Group up 2.5% beat estimates, Germany's Deutsche Bank +3.1%, announces a big management shakeup and restructuring plan - heads to roll and that is helping to send other financials higher. German retailer Metro - announces a rise in sales and is talking all bullish about the coming Christmas season sending this stock up by 3.7%. Air France- KLM announces job CUTS in 2016 and investors love it - sending that stock higher.... and not to be left in the dark - Italian carmaker Ferrari is getting ready to price its IPO tomorrow and will start trading on the NYSE on Thursday.
"
189,PM,"This morning US futures are off 1 pt.....Now prior to the China report - US futures were pointing lower on the expectation that we were gonna get hit hard....and when that did not happen - Futures moved to the plus side and are now flat. I suspect that the market will test resistance at 2040 and then back off trying to find support in the 2025 range - if not, then definitely the 1980 range.
"
190,PM,"As much as there is plenty of US macro data this week - the focus will now return to US corp earnings. This week and next week will see hundreds of reports for investors to chew on. Earnings to include: HAS, MS, HAL, GPC, IBM, ZION, AXP, BA, KO, MCD, MSFT, and PG to name just a few.

191,PM,"NOTE: Fed's Lacker is due to speak today at 12 pm.

192,PM,"Up til now - earnings have been, well, not so good. Not horrible, but not great. 70% are beating the estimates while only 48% of those are beating on top line revenue growth. Despite the economic weakness and a bunch of downgrades - stocks have not done so badly.....with the DOW, S&P and Nasdaq all closing close to 2 month highs.... All of these indexes have now pierced their down trending 50 dma's and are now challenging their intermediate term resistance - or 100 dma's. Now here we may hit some trouble - but I think that is just a matter of time....unless earnings completely implode - then I suspect that we will test resistance one or two more times before 'breaking out' and challenging the longer term resistance levels defined by their 200 dma's. And as is usual - as we move thru the 4th qtr - FOMO (fear of missing out) will help to lift stocks going into year end.
"
193,PM,"Now on the other hand - small caps are lagging...... The most recent lows for small caps came early October and it was much lower than the August 24th sell-off lows. The most recent highs were just two weeks ago and those highs were lower than the highs set in mid-September. - suggesting that a bearish downtrend (lower lows and lower highs) remains intact from a small cap perspective. And why would this be so?
"
194,PM,"Well - it is earnings season, and it is more common for the large cap/mid cap companies to be able to borrow money to buy back shares which will serve to 'doll up"" their earnings per share. (Small cap companies are not nearly as active buying back stock to create the illusion of better earnings and so you have the disconnect.) Or it could be that small caps are more risky and at a time of global nervousness - investors may want the security of large cap, liquid, dividend paying names....It's just a thought.....
"
195,PM,"The fact that small caps continue to lag might suggest that the selling pressure is not over yet....but until we get thru earnings season the divergence will continue. Then it will be Thanksgiving, and the debt debacle in DC, and then the FED December decision.... so there is plenty ahead to keep investors on their toes the question is: Does the market have enough strength to support another ""Santa Clause"" rally into the end of the year?

Stocks rallied yesterday on the rumor or chatter that the FED has to delay raising interest rates even as they tell us how appropriate it is to raise rates in October or December, but the most recent readings on the U.S. economy and global economy appear now to force the Fed to wait until 1Qtr of 2016.

244,PM,"Overnight Asian markets were mostly higher due to the news that the TPP (Trans Pacific Partnership) agreement seems to be finished.

Remember when Batman and Robin were taking on the Joker, The Penguin, Mr. Freeze, Mad Hatter, The Riddler or even King Tut - do you remember how they showed the fights? Words like POW, BOOM & SMACK appeared in bubbles on the TV screen -.....the fight was left to the viewers imagination.....and so ladies and gentlemen - that is what it appears to be today with the markets.......It's all about your imagination as words like GLOBAL WEAKNESS, CHINA, INTEREST RATES, QE, STIMULUS flash across computer screens causing stocks to jump yesterday sending the S&P, the DOW and the Nasdaq higher for the 5th straight day....Ok, look - The last week was another example of a manipulated market......traders feel forced to buy stocks to cover short bets as the media and the industry celebrates the weaker macro data and new evidence of economic weakness.....Celebrate? Why yes - because that means that the FED (and the ECB, BoJ and PBoC) will all come to the rescue (again) in one way or another. Stocks rallied yesterday on the rumor or chatter that the FED has to delay raising interest rates even as they tell us how appropriate it is to raise rates in October or December, but the most recent readings on the U.S. economy and global economy appear now to force the Fed to wait until 1Qtr of 2016.(Just to add another notch in the belt - Yesterday we learned that the ISM Service sector report missed analysts' expectations - although to be fair - it IS still in expansionary mode - but so many took the opportunity to accentuate the negative which then translates into a positive for risk assets....)And did you see that the treasury sold a 'new gov't security' with a 3-month yield of ZERO for the first time in history? Ok...so just so we understand - investors gave the gov't a 3-month FREE loan......no interest, Here! - just take it. See the Money and Investing Section of today's WSJ -""Yield of 0%, a First at 3 -Month T-Bill Sale""As the article points out:""The result reflects diminishing expectations in financial markets that the Federal Reserve would raise short-term rates before year end after Friday's disappointing jobs report....""And so - the prospect of loading up the punch bowl with more 'Kool Aid' creates demand for 'riskier assets' and this sent both stocks and commodities higher......Technically speaking we can expect more volatility in the weeks ahead as we enter earnings season.... We have seen how analysts have slashed estimates and repositioned themselves ahead of what is likely to be a volatile couple of weeks.Last night we learned that Ellen Kullman - CEO at DuPont (DD) is the first casualty of this 'hurricane season'. News out last night that she is 'retiring' (convenient) just as her company slashed its profit forecast - (dollar strength, global weakness...blah, blah, blah) and the activist investor, Trian, boosted its stake in the company - citing Kullman's failure to meet her targets..... Remember that Trian - owned by Ed Garden and Nelson Peltz - wants to break up the company saying that the parts are worth more than the sum of its whole. The stock is trading UP $2 or 4% in pre-market trading.....This morning Pepsico (PEP) announces a surprise earnings report : $1.35 vs. exp of $1.26....which is contra to what the expectation was.... Revenues of $16.3 bil vs exp of $16.1 bil and they are on track to deliver $5 bil of productivity savings thru 2019 and return $9 bil to shareholders this year.....the stock is trading UP 3 pts (3%) at $98.57/sh.Later today we will hear from YUM Brands (YUM) - and on tomorrow afternoon - we will hear from AlcoaAA.On a side note Uncle Benny (Bernanke) took to the media circuit yesterday - announcing the publication of his new book - ""The Courage to Act"" . In this book - Benny discusses what went wrong and what went right during the GFC of 2007/2015 and counting......He points his finger at corporate executives saying that:""It would have been my preference to have more investigation of individual action, since obviously everything that went wrong or was illegal was done by some individual and not by an abstract firm.""He also acknowledges that so many were slow to realize just how serious the crisis would become and he 'faults himself for not doing more to explain to Americans why it was in their interest to rescue the financial firms that had helped cause it'.And finally he calls out a defective congress that 'failed to do its part' in helping to navigate the turmoil that engulfed this country - turmoil that caused untold hardships and crisis on so many Americans - The book is available today on Amazon and is a must read for anyone interested in how close the country was to financial Armageddon.Overnight Asian markets were mostly higher due to the news that the TPP (Trans Pacific Partnership) agreement seems to be finished.

"
253,PM,"In what many thought was going to be another bold attempt at a strong rally on the back of Janet's dovish commentary – well they were disappointed….- Why? The S&P ended the day UP 8 pts....yes they did... led by tech stocks as the Nasdaq has now joined its counterparts and pierced to the upside its 200 dma - but that is a bit deceiving….You see – stocks gapped up - as the sellers also expected the buyers to remain aggressive.....but after the open - the buyers retreated, not so anxious to just buy 'em.......so then the sellers came back and put pressure on stocks for the rest of the day....With the advances of late – many investment managers are not finding those 'bargains' that existed just weeks ago…..momo (momentum) buyers have driven stocks higher yes, but those buyers do not fit the classic 'buy and hold' long term investor profile. So the classic long term investor - is NOT chasing this latest rally as many expect the seasonal weakness that we see every April.It seems that all the jawboning about how rates are not going anywhere anytime soon has helped prices rebound…..but – 'caveat emptor' (buyer beware) yesterday's selling into the opening gap up only suggests caution ahead. And with the start of the second qtr on Friday – the process begins anew as we await the all important NFP report. (Non Farm Payrolls). What will it tell us?Now this time around – this report which is due out at 8:30 am April 1st – will be even more closely watched. Why? Well – after what happened on Tuesday – when Janet made it crystal clear that she remains concerned and that there will be no rate hike in April – analysts/strategists stand ready to pull this report apart looking for any signs of strength - (to somehow discredit her) - because if they find it – then they will surely talk about how she is 'out of touch' and revisit the talk of an April hike* (still not happening) but more likely a June hike…..And if they don't find it then – the conversation about then next hike gets put off until the second half of the year……which means what really? A late November/December time frame. Look, if they don't do it by June – then I think her hands are really tied behind her back as the country enters the final turn in the presidential election cycle….So now – we must ask – will she get 'railroaded' into a June hike (like she did in December) – to get it out of the way – or will she remain dovish?[*Yesterday while doing my weekly SkyAustralia mkt update from the floor of the NYSE - Leanne - the anchor asked me : ""If the jobs report was stronger than expected - should the mkts expect that Janet could put April back on the table""?Are you kidding me! Hello!!! After her spiel on Tuesday and on March 16th where she expressed concern and took April off the table - any suggestion that April is back on the table is like standing up and screaming that ""I have no clue what is happening!"" She might as well pack her bags and fade into the sunset - she will have done nothing but destroy any credibility that the FED has left.........April is NOT happening - no matter what tomorrow's NFP report says.....]Yes – the latest commentary emphasizes – lower for longer and is forcing the 'risk on' trade that we have seen in the past 2 weeks.... – but that does not mean there is no concern. The latest move in stocks leaves many wondering whether it is really based on fundamentals or is it just money looking for a home that has forced prices higher. Remember - the continued accommodative policy is pushing the dollar lower – fueling the latest global currency war – which is helping to ignite the 'risk on' story …..commodities and stocks enjoying the limelight.The other part to this story is end of qtr 'window dressing' – remember – back in January/February – it looked like the bottom was falling out….stocks got clobbered as the S&P gave up 13% and many mkts around the world entered 'bear mkt' territory (We did not – came close, but no cigar) so the rally off of the February lows has rescued so many people. Both the Dow and S&P are setting up for a 1% gain this qtr – vs. the 13% losses registered in February – so yes – many are breathing a sigh of relief as the marking period comes to a close at 4 pm today. As a result - I would expect that the mkt will hold in tight - no reason for it to sell off hard, but nor is there any reason for it to rally and challenge 2075 again. I suspect today's trading range to look like 2055/2065.From a global perspective the US is the best horse in the race.....Asian mkts closed out the qtr all in the red....Japan - 12.9%, Hong Kong -5.1%, China - 13.7% and ASX -4%. European mkts - while still trading are on track also to end the qtr in solidly negative territory. FTSE - 1%, CAC 40 - 5%, DAX - 7%, EUROSTOXX -7.7%, SPAIN -8% and ITALY -15%Now it was a fairly busy night of eco data in Europe.....but the most watched is their CPI report - known as the HICP (Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices) - and it is their list of final costs paid by consumers for a basket of common goods. Each member state produces their own report and then they 'harmonize' it to help guide the ECB.... Last night the HICP came in at +1% - better than exp of +0.9%...this causing the Euro to rally while putting more pressure on the $. (Which should help to support stocks and commodities - wink, wink!)Today we get 2 more FED speakers.....Chicago's Charlie Evans (again) at 9:30 and NY's William Dudley at 5 pm. But it is the last day of the qtr so I do not expect them to say so much.Tomorrow is a big day.....the start of a new qtr & the NFP report. Next week begins earnings.... mkt action always sees weakness as we move thru April - why should this year be any different at all?Take Good Care

255,PM,"Reynolds American (RAI) may be a takeover target for British American Tobacco (BTI) as the tobacco industry continues to consolidate amid shrinking cigarette sales.British American, which makes Dunhill and other branded cigarettes, in January acquired a $5 billion stake in Reynolds. An unconfirmed report by the Telegraph over the weekend said the British company is working with bankers on a deal to acquire the rest of Reynolds.No. 2 U.S. tobacco company Reynolds American makes Newport, Camel and Pall Mall cigarette brands. Last year, it was part of a three-way deal in which it bought Lorillard for $25 billion.Reynolds and Lorillard agreed to sell a combined $7.1 billion in cigarette brands and other assets to U.K. based Imperial Tobacco Group, now called Imperial Brands, to win Federal Trade Commission Approval. The FTC gave its blessing to the merger in late May 2015.Tobacco companies have seen sales of cigarettes shrink in recent years amid health concerns. According to Statistica, the number of cigarettes sold globally fell to 5.8 trillion in 2014, the latest year for which figures were available, from 5.88 trillion the year before.But tobacco companies have diversified to other products, including food, beverages and smokeless electronic vapor devices, which are benefiting from the rising popularity of vaping. As a result, the tobacco group is a strong No. 13 on IBD's list of 197 industry groups.Shares of Reynolds American, an IBD Leaderboard stock, closed up less than 0.1% Monday. The Winston-Salem, N.C.-based company has a best-possible 99 IBD Composite Rating, meaning it's outperformed at least 99% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales and profit growth in recent quarters.British American Tobacco has recorded spotty revenue and earnings growth the last couple of years. It reported a 1% rise in 2015 earnings per share, and last year EPS shrank by 9% year over year. Consensus is for the company to just break even this year. British American was closed down 0.7%.Among other major tobacco companies, Philip Morris (PM) -- the sector's revenue leader, with about $74 billion annual sales -- fell 0.6%. Like Reynolds, it's outperformed the market, and its stock is trading near an all-time intraday high of 96.73 set in May 2013.Altria Group (MO), which sells Marlboro, Parliament, Virginia Slims and other cigarette brands, fell 1.9%.
"
256,PM,"Dividend mutual funds as a group lagged the S&P 500 stock index over the 10 years that ended going into Monday.The reasons for the underperformance are worth keeping in mind whenever you make buy or sell decisions in your portfolio, particularly the diversified portion -- your mutual funds and ETFs. They could boost the octane in your funds' fuel tank.Dividend funds lagged despite having outperformed as a group over the first half of the decade. But as the post-financial-crisis bull market picked up steam, the S&P 500 began to top dividend funds in total return.Many dividend funds are value-oriented, and many are willing to give up more in potential price appreciation for a shot at higher dividend yield.The average dividend funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. rose an average annual 5.24% in the past 40 quarters plus this current quarter to date.In that same span, the S&P 500 rose an average annual 6.75%.If you had invested $10,000 on Dec. 31, 2005, in funds with ""dividend"" in their name, your money would have grown into $17,753 by March 4.Invested in the S&P 500, the same $10,000 would have ballooned into $19,892.So putting money into a fund tracking the big-cap benchmark would have helped your overall portfolio more -- and your retirement planning in particular.One silver lining: dividend funds average a current 12-month yield of 2.22%. That's slightly higher than the 2.17% 12-month yield of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY).Also, the top-performing dividend funds have skated past the S&P 500 in 10-year performance, though only three of the top 13 have higher yields.In the past 10 years, the top-performing dividend fund with more than $100 million in assets is $10.2 billion SunAmerica Focused Dividend Strategy Portfolio (FDSAX). The fund averaged a yearly gain of 9.52%. It also yields 2.47%.The fund had 99.63% of its money on U.S. stocks as of Dec. 31. It had 67% of assets at work in giant- and large-cap stocks. Another 28% was in midcaps. The balance of the portfolio was in small caps.The fund's biggest sector bet was consumer cyclical, with a 26% weighting.Industrials were its next biggest sector, with a 20% weighting. Energy was its third-largest sector, with a 16%.Energy was followed by consumer defensive, with a 14% weighting. In contrast, technology was only the fund's seventh-largest sector, with a modest 6.63% weighting.Recent top holdings include Verizon Communications (VZ), which is up 12% this year.The telecom giant has a Composite Rating of 99 from IBD. The Composite Rating combines IBD’s five stock-performance ratings, including EPS and RS Ratings, with 99 being the highest.Verizon pays a 4.4% dividend yield. Earnings per share grew 14%, 17% and 25% the past three quarters.Procter & Gamble (PG), another top holding, is up 5% this year.The cosmetics and personal-care products titan has a strong 87 Comp Rating and a 3.2% dividend yield.The stock has rewarded shareholders by raising its dividend 59 years in a row.EPS grew 9% in the fiscal second quarter. They fell 1% in the prior stanza.Philip Morris International (PM), yet another top holding, is up 7% this year. It has an 83 Comp Rating and pays a 4.3% dividend yield.Q4 EPS fell 4%, reflecting currency translation losses.
"
257,PM,"So yesterday Janet came out swinging - admitting that the world is on the edge or a recession saying:""Given the risks to the outlook, I consider it appropriate for the committee to proceed cautiously in adjusting policy.....the key is that the global economic and financial backdrop looms more threateningly now than before.........and even though officials expect the US economy to weather any further rough patches, the dangers can't be ignored""Let me be clear - she did NOT give any details on timing whatsoever and now the feeling is that if we get any rate rise at all - it will just ONE and it may not be in June....So we can forget all the chatter about 'multiple increases'.... and should the economy take a turn for the worse - she assured the invitees that the FED could still take steps to resuscitate the economy - think 'forward guidance' (which is just another word for Jawboning - which is what she did yesterday as she 'guided' expectations), the other trick up her sleeve would be the launch of an ECB style bazooka..... but either way - she put the idea of any increase to bed and she essentially told the 5 non-compliant FED mouthpieces to 'assume the position' and prepare to get spanked for insinuating last week that rates are due to rise in April -.......And the mkt roared! Investors and traders immediately hit the BUY button on their computers sending the S&P up 17 pts or 0.8% and the Dow up 97 pts or 0.6%.....Remember - last week - CNBC.com ran with a headline article about how ""Fed Chair Yellen has a mini revolt on her hands"" as 5 FED presidents took to the airwaves to suggest that the FED was falling behind the curve and that the mkt (and investors) should expect rates to rise in April. Now it appears that Janet was not happy about that development - And whether or not there is a bit of dissension in the ranks - as the French proverb goes: ""Il faut laver son linge sale en famille"" ......or ""Never wash your dirty laundry in public"".... and that is what they were doing.......washing their 'dirty laundry' for all to see in the name of 'transparency'. And what does that transparency show - it shows a complete mess within the ranks as no one really knows what to do....so staying the course appears to be the best answer for now.....Oh boy.....this story gets more interesting as the hours tick by.....I am beginning to re-think this whole transparency issue - Is it in fact the best thing for the mkts? Does it create more angst and instability for investors and traders? Would Paul Volker ever run the FED like this? (A: NO) Does the FED secretly want more instability to keep everyone guessing? As far as I am concerned - they can do what they want 'behind closed doors' but once they open those doors and the FED chair speaks then that should be it. Period the end. Whatever happened to loyalty? This business of then letting everyone in the FED run hog wild over any network that will have them is getting a bit exhausting. Because in the end - what does it really accomplish besides mass confusion and mkt instability? It is not helpful for investors nor businesses that are trying to plan for the future - it also does not help the individual as he/she plans for the future. The constant sense of angst concerning (global) monetary policy is unnecessary - and quite honestly has created a global monster...Just look around the world and tell me what you see....I think the worst part of all this is what are we really talking about? 25 bps?
"
258,PM,"Moving rates from an absurdly low level to another absurdly low level? I mean we are talking about going from 0.05% to 0.75%....not from 4% to 5%. And still this tiny move is creating all of this drama.....For those of you too young to remember 1982 - let me remind you....rates were 21% , the Dow was trading at 792 - and then on Tuesday Aug 17th - Chair Volker cut rates by 10% or a full 2%age points when he decided to take the bull by the horns and do something dramatic.....He took rates down to 19% - and the world celebrated, the mkt surged by 4.5% on that day......volumes exploded and the greatest bull mkt of our lifetime was born....... THAT WAS DRAMATIC! (But that was a different time......Ronald Reagan was president and America was on the verge of an incredible resurgence...)Once again - let's point out how legislators have done zero to assist the FED by being creative and pro-active with fiscal policy....But that's another story - one that we see unfolding right in front of us via the Presidential election......People are disgusted and rightly so.....Does anyone in DC understand that?Overnight - stocks rallied - (duh), credit mkts rallied, commodities (think oil) rallied and the dollar continued to slide lower - extending its worst month in 5 yrs. The VIX also moved lower - sliding 9% taking it to its lowest level of the year.....what does this mean? It means that there is a fair amount of complacency in the mkt - no real sense of fear...of course not - Janet has once again tucked it tightly in bed - kissing it on the head, saying 'Mommy loves you... now go to sleep'..... and this is right in front of what is expected to be a weak earnings season.... so the plot thickens.Stocks in Asia and Europe shot higher on the news....with the exception of Japan that got hit with a huge drop in Industrial Production - sending the Nikkei down 1.5%. Hong Kong +2.15%, China + 2.77% and the ASX +0.1%.European mkts following in lock step with Asia and the US....FTSE +1.7%, CAC 40 + 1.9%, DAX + 1.7%, EUROSTOXX +1.6%, SPAIN +1.5% and ITALY + 1.45%US Futures are up another 11 pts in pre-mkt trading......taking the futures index up to 2060.....which will send the cash index up to 2067 if this holds.....I suspect that 2075 should be another level of resistance - but anything is possible now.... Eco data today includes Mort Apps which fell by 1%, and the ADP employment report which is due to show an increase of something approaching +195k jobs.....We will be entertained by one FED speaker today.....Chicago's own Charlie Evans.....(an admitted DOVE). He will be on CNBC Squawk box at 8:30 just after the ADP release, he will also be speaking at the Forecasters Club of NY at 1 pm.Remember that this is end of month and qtr...so a rally would do so many people so much good - especially ahead of April 15th....(Tax day)..... Either way -Take Good Care

"
260,PM,"Stocks chopped as neither the bulls nor the bears made a stand, volume was the lowest so far for 2016, and many global mkts had remained closed for what is known as the Easter Monday Holiday......leaving very little for traders or investors to chomp on......and so the S&P did nothing really other than bounce around moving both north and south of the unchanged line some 20 times - and at the final bell was up 1 pt to close at 2037.The lack of action is more reflective of the uncertainty over the near term direction the 1Q earnings season and the uncertainty over FED policy.....Recall that last week - we saw a revolt within the central bank......on the 16th - Janet assured the world that rates were fine right where they were for now (all the while leaving June as the next launch date).....concern over global macro issues and mkt turmoil had given rise to continued caution in terms of US monetary policy...the mkts loved it and rallied hard exploding thru what should have been more significant resistance at the 200 dma....but on the back of the renewed ECB commitment to stimulus and Janet's commitment to 'lower for longer' - investors/traders went on a buying binge - some to 'get more long' while others scrambled to cover 'short positions' (or those bearish bets) on the future direction of stocks.That took us up and thru resistance only to fail at the 2050 level when the revolt began....5 different members of the FED came out and challenged her publicly....defying the data, ignoring the protocol.....each one suggesting that not only should rates rise - they should do so in April....smack in the middle of what is expected to be a weak earnings season.... the mkts stumbled, unable to advance as confusion set in..... but they did not collapse either - or not yet anyway.....Were these bozo's just testing the water? Were they trying to gauge investor sentiment? Was this all a ploy to divert the conversation away from the broader geo-political issues - ISIS, Brussels, Oil, a weakening Europe, Obama's visit to Cuba and his Tango in Argentina and even the comedic stupidity of the Presidential election as two of the GOP contenders running for the highest office in the country succumb to middle school antics?OK...so today - all mkts are back online and the focus is returning to what should be the drivers of mkt action. Investors and traders returned to their desks after the long weekend and now are focusing on the end of the month action, coming macro data and what Janet will say today when she speaks at the Economic Club of NY at 12:20 pm (est)....Overnight - San Fran's Fed President Williams is the latest to opine on monetary policy this morning.... You see - he is in Singapore - and gave 'prepared remarks' to an audience at the National University there about US monetary policy - because that is important.........and in it he appeared to join in with his fellow bankers while never really committing to any hard and fast date - as he said -""Others' economic fate do now spell our own.....My view is essentially, let's just stay on track. Let's not get sidelined by the noise and distraction commentary can sometimes cause. We're not quite where I'd like us to be, but recent developments have been encouraging and add to my confidence that we're on course to reach our (inflation) goal. Overall the US economy keeps chugging ahead.""And so there is another vote for a rate increase - at some point - leaving him squarely 'on the fence' but suggesting that the next move should be UP and not DOWN- as he tried to assuage investor/trader angst.Now eco data this week includes a fair amount of information.....today we get lots of Case Shiller Home Price data......(nothing to get excited about), tomorrow brings us the ADP employment report and expectations are for +195k jobs.....Thursday includes ISM Milwaukee and the Chicago Purchasing Managers report.....on Friday - we get the monthly Non Farm Payroll report - and this time the gov't is promising us an increase of 210k jobs, (How many of those are minimum wage?), they expect unemployment to remain at 4.9% and are looking for average hourly wages to increase by 0.2%. Look for ISM Manf, Construction Spending, Labor Force Participation rates, ISM Prices Paid and ISM New orders. All of this macro data will set the stage for more trader speculation on the next FED move. What do FED Fund Futures say about an April increase?US futures are down 4 pts at 2024.....right now....there is no reason for the mkts to really rally hard at the moment.....but remember it is end of month and end of qtr..so the next couple of days could see increased volumes as portfolio managers 'clean up' ahead of the marking period. I continue to believe that we remain range bound within the 2020/2050 trading bands.The next move will come from the FED and if Janet surprises us and tells us that so much has changed in the last two weeks - and SHE puts April squarely on the table.... then watch for the mkt to test lower.....breaching the 2020 support to test the 1996 support level.I don't expect that she is going to divine the tea leaves for anybody today. It will be more of the same - where she plays the Dove and then releases the boys to contradict her to gauge investor and mkt sentiment. After that - then the mkts will settle in for month/qtr end and then prepare for the coming earnings season....which kicks off the week of April 4th.In Asia - stocks traded with a downside bias on some soft economic data. In Japan - the Unemployment Rate and Retail Sales both missed. Japan -0.18%, Hong Kong +0.1%, China -1.28%, ASX -1.57%,In Europe - stocks are edging higher ahead of Yellen’s speech. The Europeans are not convinced that rates are due to rise in April.....Michael Hewson - Chief Mkt analyst at CMC markets sums it up last week's chatter this way:""What was all the more puzzling was that last week's chatter was completely at odds with the recent dovish narrative of the most recent FOMC meeting""So - sit back and enjoy the show.....remember the mkt is now flat on the year and that is a WIN for many asset managers as we close out the qtr.....I suspect the mkt will hold tight thru Thursday....but then Friday is April 1st and the beginning of a new qtr.....Take Good Care

262,PM,"And the mkts have come roaring back…even the trains, planes and automobiles are joining in on the fun as the Dow Transports (Trannies) are now back in 'official' Bull mkt mode having rallied 22% off of the January lows…..Now Dow Theory tells us that the mkt is in an uptrend when ONE of its averages (the industrials or the trannies) advances above a previous important high….it should then be followed by the other Dow index…Now while the Trannies have not pierced their November highs of 8286 - they have rocketed higher over the past 8 weeks – (as noted up 22%), they have pierced the down trending 200 dma at 7856 and look like they are 'breaking out'..... and appear to be on their way to challenge the November high -Now this is important really – because the Trannies represent the transportation sector of the US economy and its companies are tied to the shipping, rail, and trucking sectors – sectors that 'move stuff around' and send signals about the health of the economy…..now recall – this index got 'clocked' in the early part of the year……after concerns about global growth and a coming US recession caused investors to shift out of this important 'barometer group' - Because slowing global growth and a US recession would negatively impact these companies. And there were some real serious concerns – as investors took some 22% out of the index since late November - but remember simple math works in strange ways....if the index (or a stock or any asset) goes down in value by 22% and then rallies back by 22% - you are still short - you have NOT gone back to 0 - in fact the index needs to rally back 30% just to stay even. So it still has work to do.......The latest move now tells us that investors have changed their minds…..Global Growth Concerns? US Recession? – Bah Humbug……Apparently investors are convinced that the worst is over and they have gone out on a buying spree – scooping up some names for a fraction of their current value. Now the Trannies are trading at about 13 times trailing earnings – or a 32% discount to their 3 yr avg of 19.2 times. So there IS value there IF the supposed improving global macro data is true. A look at some of the participants reveals where investors are placing their bets....UPS (UPS) & FedEx (FDX) - have rocketed higher, piercing their 200 dma's....while , Kansas City Southern (KSU), CSX Corp. (CSX), Kirby Corp. (KEX) are all teasing these key trend lines....Now overnight - global mkts began the week a bit mixed.....There is not a lot of macro data due out this week - so we can expect the mkts to churn and digest the latest moves in this holiday shortened week.......Japan was closed for a holiday and China surged by 2% as investors there focused on loosening margin lending requirements.....Australia came under a bit of pressure as losses in commodities weighed on that mkt.In Europe - those mkts are flat to slightly higher after a weaker opening....There was no material news out to drive the mkts either way - so they churn. FTSE -0.09%, CAC 40 -0.2%, DAX +0.4% , EUROSTOXX +0.12%, SPAIN +0.19% and ITALY +0.83%.Oil once again under pressure as the dollar stabilizes and moves a bit higher....remember - much of the oil action has been dollar driven and more unprecedented global monetary easing has created a currency war but has helped to wipe out the losses suffered since January. Now while it makes everyone feel good - the weak dynamics of the global economy still exist....and with earnings season only 2 weeks away - it will be about the fundamentals once again.....And while the central banks have all created the fire - the latest move is sure to come under some pressure if the fundamentals disappoint..... If the fundamentals do not disappoint - then the conversation returns to FED policy and interest rates. I continue to believe that June will see a small hike of 25 bps - but then nothing more.US futures are flat, the dollar is flat and oil is now down 1% as the day begins.....We only have one data point and this is Existing Home Sales - expectations are for a drop of 2.9% m/m. Atlanta FED's Dennis Lockhart is due to speak today at 12:30 pm - I would not expect him to say anything so significant - as he tends to be Dove and is on the side of the latest FED move. - So if anything - look for him to remain cautious on the outlook.....Now the S&P at 2048 is well above the 200 dma which stands at 2017. In this holiday shortened week - with little eco data to digest - it would not be surprising to see the S&P test what is now support for the mkts. After the most recent rally - the mkt is a bit ahead of itself and some back testing is in order.Take Good Care

264,PM,"There's something for everyone in the vast universe of sector funds, from consumer staples to health care to technology.When a sector is in favor, those funds can rack up big returns. But they can also be prone to bigger declines, since they're more concentrated in specific areas than a diversified fund.IBD ran a screen of actively managed funds with at least $100 million in assets that have beaten their benchmarks in each of the past one, three, five and 10 years. Two sectors were the clear winner: The five best sector funds ranked by 10-year performance all focus on biotech or health sciences. (See our full list of best sector mutual funds.)To highlight the best mutual funds in the top-performing sectors, the ""best of the best"" list of IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Award winners includes the top fund in each of six sectors.Click Here To View A Table Of Top Performing Mutual Funds By CategoryFidelity Select Biotechnology Portfolio (FBIOX) came out on top with a 10-year average annual return of 16.9%, well ahead of the S&P 500's 7.31%. The fund held $9.7 billion in net assets as of Feb. 29. Its expense ratio is 0.74%. Rajiv Kaul has managed the fund since October 2005.Like most sectors, biotech has seen its fair share of volatility. But that's not necessarily a negative.""In the next five to 10 years, there's going to be a renaissance for the industry in terms of the golden age of innovation,"" Kaul told IBD. ""It's not going to be in a straight line. Biotech is volatile for investors. That's the amazing opportunity that happens.""As of Jan. 31, biotech stocks made up 86% of the portfolio and pharmaceuticals 13%. Fidelity Select Biotech held 277 stocks in all. Top holdings at the end of Q4 included Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Celgene (CELG).All five stocks belong to IBD's biotech industry group, which surged more than 800% from a November 2008 low to its July 2015 peak. Turnover in the fund tends to run fairly low, at about 29%.There are high barriers to entry in the biotech field, including expertise, capital and regulatory hurdles, Kaul points out. ""But when you do get a major breakthrough in a medication, you really improve people's lives and help save costs for the health care system.""How does Kaul pick stocks for the fund?""You have to understand the management and what is the track record of success,"" he said. ""We have that kind of historical understanding and depth of understanding of the industry and the individual players. Equally important is the ability of these companies to access capital at a low cost. I want my companies to be self-reliant.""The five top biotech funds all owned big-cap biotech and Soliris maker Alexion in their recently reported quarters. Four of the five funds also held biotechs Celgene and Gilead, which focus on cancer and hepatitis C, respectively. Generic drug makers tracked by IBD soared more than 900% from March 2009 to July 2015, while ethical drug stocks rallied nearly 750% from March 2009 to August 2015.T. Rowe Price Health Sciences (PRHSX) took second place among biotech funds, with a 10-year return of 16.8%. The fund, which has $11.7 billion in net assets, has been closed to new retail investors since June 2015. As of Feb. 29, the portfolio held 145 stocks. Services accounted for 35% of assets, followed by biotech at 25%, pharmaceuticals at 22%, products and devices at 10%, and life sciences at 6%. Top holdings included Aetna (AET), Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Allergan (AGN), Becton Dickinson (BDX) and Cigna (CI).""Focus on innovative medicines, diagnostics, devices and business models has been the core driver of success,"" Taymour Tamaddon, who has managed the fund since February 2013, said via e-mail. ""Over the past 10 years, strength has been broad-based, with biotech likely having the highest level of performance."" The fund's expense ratio is 0.77%.Prudential Jennison Health Sciences (PHLAX), with a 15.8% return over the past 10 years, has been closed to new investors since the end of June 2012. The fund has total net assets of $2.6 billion and an expense ratio of 1.1%. David Chan, Michael Del Balso and Debra Netschert manage the fund.Biotech made up the biggest weighting as of Jan. 31, at 38% of assets. Pharmaceuticals accounted for 30%, health care providers and services were 19%, health care equipment and supplies were 7%, and life sciences tools and services were 3%. The biggest holdings in the 98-stock portfolio included Celgene, BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Shire (SHPG) and Allergan.""We remain focused on the longer-term outlook of our fund, which we believe continues to be very positive based on a range of industry trends, from health care reform to the advent of oncology active immune therapy,"" the managers said in their Jan. 31 fund commentary. ""Although the realization of these companies’ values may encounter intermittent setbacks, we believe the market will recognize and reward them over the longer term.""Franklin Biotechnology Discovery (FBDIX), with $1.1 billion in total net assets as of Feb. 29, has a 10-year return of 15%. Biotech stocks made up 84% of the portfolio, followed by 13% in pharmaceuticals and nearly 3% in life sciences tools and services.""We focus on biotechnology and generally have limited exposure to other areas in health care,"" Evan McCulloch, senior vice president and lead portfolio manager of the fund, said. ""We avoid more traditional large-cap pharmaceuticals companies, which have less favorable growth prospects and do not show the same levels of innovation we see in biotechnology.""Celgene, Gilead Sciences, Biogen (BIIB), Amgen (AMGN) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals were among top positions in the 119-stock fund. The fund, which closed to new investors in July 2014, has an expense ratio of 1%.""Overall, we believe there are strong fundamentals underlying the biotechnology sector's recent growth which have also helped our fund,"" McCulloch said. ""Innovation remains very strong, with promising new treatments in areas like immuno-oncology, gene therapy, Alzheimer's disease, GI (gastrointestinal) disorders, central nervous system diseases and others.""Rydex Biotechnology (RYOAX) rounds out the top-five sector funds with a 10-year return of 14.7%. The expense ratio is 1.3%. Biotech accounted for 77% of net assets as of Feb. 29, pharmaceuticals 13%, and life sciences tools and services 9%. Top holdings as of March 8 included Gilead, Amgen, Celgene, Biogen and Regeneron.Health care clearly dominated sector funds over the past decade. But which other funds led their respective categories?T. Rowe Price Global Technology (PRGTX), with $2.4 billion in net assets at the end of February, led tech sector funds with a 14.3% 10-year average annual return. Media, semiconductors and software made up the biggest weightings in the 64-stock fund; top holdings included Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon.com (AMZN) and JD.com (JD). It has a 0.91% expense ratio.Leading the consumer cyclical sector is Fidelity Select Retailing Portfolio (FSRPX), with $1.8 billion in assets as of Feb. 29 and a 10-year average annual return of 14%. The expense ratio is 0.81%. Internet retail, home improvement retail and apparel retail accounted for the top three subindustries at the end of January. Amazon, Home Depot (HD) and Netflix (NFLX) were its top holdings.T. Rowe Price Media & Telecommunications (PRMTX) topped the communications sector with a 13.7% average annual return. The fund had $3.3 billion in net assets as of Feb. 29; its expense ratio is 0.8%. Media, telecom services and software were the three biggest investment areas, with Alphabet, Amazon and American Tower (AMT) among the 79-stock portfolio's recent top holdings.Rydex Consumer Products (RYCIX), with a 10.6% average annual return and a 1.3% expense ratio, led the consumer defensive sector. Food products, beverages and household products accounted for more than half of net assets; Procter & Gamble (PG), Coca-Cola (KO) and Philip Morris International (PM) were recent top holdings.Burnham Financial Services (BURKX), which held $250.1 million in assets, headed the financial sector with a 7.6% average annual return. Yadkin Financial (YDKN), BNC Bancorp (BNCN) and Atlantic Capital Bancshares (ACBI) were among the fund's top holdings as of Jan. 31. The fund's gross expense ratio is 1.64%, and its net expense ratio is 1.8%.

271,PM,"OK - Look - if you put earplugs in your ears and did not read any newspaper and just watched the indexes - you would think that the US economy is firing on all 12 cylinders...I mean you would think that we are pumping out product like crazy, manufacturing was in overdrive, the job mkt was overheating and wages were strong.You would think it was 1989 all over again....Ronald Reagan in the White House, Russia (Formerly the USSR) on the verge of collapse, The Berlin Wall - no longer a wall at all and now a distant memory, GDP was 2.7%, Inflation running at 5%, Unemployment at 5.4%, The FED Prime Rate was 10.5%, The FED Funds Rate was 9.5%, 30 yr fixed rate mortgages were at 10.3% + 2 pts, the S&P was at 341.91 and the Dow was 2,741.22, kids and athletes TIED their own sneakers and rode bikes...... and the country was proud, strong and vibrant.........Now fast forward - take out the earplugs - Ronald Reagan is dead, the USSR is gone per se, but Russia now stands at the precipice of world power, manufacturing is on life support, the Berlin Wall has been sold off in pieces to excited tourists, GDP is 1%, Inflation is 1%, unemployment is 4.9%, The FED Prime Rate is 3.5%, the FED Funds rate is 0.5%, 30 fixed rate mortgages (if you can get one) are 4% , the S&P is now at 2040.59, the Dow is at 17,481 and the country is in despair struggling to breathe and Marty McFly (Back to the Future) is alive and well, bikes have been replaced by hover boards and you don't tie your sneakers any more.....as technology destroys the very core of the American way of life..I mean did you see the NIKE (NKE) news yesterday? ""Self Tying Sneakers"" or as Mark Parker - CEO explains it - Adaptive Lacing! REALLY? Adaptive Lacing...is powered by an underfoot motor and it""proposes a groundbreaking solution to individual idiosyncrasies in lacing""Did you read that? 'Individual idiosyncrasies in lacing'..... Is it ME??? HELLO????""We've entered a new era of personalized performance....Today, athletes want more than just a dash board, they want a relationship""..... a relationship with what? A SNEAKER?? And the potential market for this product? HUUUUGGGEEEE! I am getting too OLD for this........what happened to the simple life -when kids were kids and they tied their own shoes and played ball in the street and rode their bikes to the playground and stayed there until dusk, went home kissed their mothers, ate dinner, took a bath and did their homework?Stocks rallied, the dollar got crushed, oil exploded up and thru $40/barrel and gold backs off as the message is: ""No worries, Be happy""!Yesterday's action erased any memory of the concern, fear and anxiety that has so consumed the global investor/trader since the beginning of the year as the 'central planners' go about doing ""God's work"" (as Uncle Lloyd so eloquently defined it) to support stocks and commodities going into April 15th........Income tax day....And while the media will credit the rally in crude oil prices as the catalyst for the global stock rally - let's not kid ourselves.....it is the 'dovish' action of the central banks around the world that has ignited the rally and forced this trade......Because WHAT has really changed in terms of the macro data? Nothing at all.....and the fact that all of these 'Harvard educated' central bankers have to keep throwing money at the problem only reveals that the 'black hole' is really just that - A Black Hole - with no bottom in sight......As we have pointed out - the data is pointing lower, corp earnings are due to disappoint, interest rates are flat to negative, the global economy continues to struggle, endless streams of migrants continue to test the human spirit, The euro zone crisis remains deeply unresolved, Britain is facing a key vote as to whether they will remain in the Euro, and Japan is entering its 3rd decade of despair - yet global developed mkts rally like there is NO tomorrow.....It is just another classic central bank ""pump (and then dump)"" but it is unsustainable given the macro environment......A look back at the charts reveals that nearly every year - the mkt convulses by mid-April, which is when 1Q earnings are released. Forward earnings estimates are going down yet the Dow and S&P are going up in a complete disconnect fashion - can this continue without real growth in our economy?Expect a lot of volatility this year as investors/traders once again re-price the risk from a fundamental perspective but also from an election year perspective. The FED and the Democrats do not want a crash in an election year, especially given that they (we) have spent some $5 tril coupled with the FED’s shift to the left during the Obama years....causing massive distortion of the real economic data. Watch as the FED along with their big bank counterparts remain committed to making sure the mkt stays right in here - at least thru April. But then - when the reality of corp earnings hits - do not be surprised to see another big plunge....because you can only play this game for so long.....without real and definitive growth.US Futures are up another 6 pts at 2036.......Overnight Asian and European mkts are also in the plus column as the rally continues.... ECB member Praet did make more dovish comments overnight saying that the ECB could lower rates further if need be.......so markets will digest yesterday’s rally and prepare for quadruple witching today. Quadruple witching is the simultaneous expiration of 4 sets of options...it usually creates massive volumes on the opening and closings, but does little for the mkts in between. There are not real notable reports this morning but there are 3 Fed speakers: NY's Dudley at 9:00 a.m., Boston's Rosengren at 11:00 a.m. and St Louis's own Bullard at 2:00 p.m. Now all of these will be important if for no other reason than the entertainment factor...but Dudley’s comments will be especially important following Janet's dovish surprise on Wednesday.March Madness continues today with games starting at 12:40pm and going thru 11 pm...in between the open/close - expect much of the chatter to revolve around the brackets...Take good care. Have a great weekend.Take Good Care

Lower gasoline prices, have also put some more spending money in the pockets of smokers when they stop at the gas station to get their fix. High dividend yields also appeal to the income investor.Reynolds American (RAI) has offered significant capital appreciation in addition to an attractive dividend yield of 3.4%. The stock moved 56.3% in one-year from a breakout at 31.69 in November 2014. The company has a best possible IBD Composite Rating of 99.The three-year annual earnings growth rate for Reynolds, comes in at 9% with an Earnings Stability Factor of 2, where the lower number reflects more stability in the earnings. Three-year annual revenue growth is lower at 6%, but has seen quarterly acceleration in the last four quarters from 5% to 43%.The stock formed a shallow base flat base and attempted a breakout from a 49.66 buy point at the end of January. It immediately faltered over the next couple weeks but closed back above the buy point last week.Altria (MO) also has a high Composite Rating at 95. The numbers are a little weaker for Altria with three-year annual earnings growth of 8% and annual revenue growth of just 1%. Quarterly revenue has been stuck in the single digits for five quarters after coming off of four quarters where quarterly revenue growth was either flat or declining. Altria focuses on the U.S. market for its marketing and distribution of brands such as Marlboro.The stock formed a shallow flat base and stands just below a 61.84 buy point. The dividend yield is 3.7%Philip Morris (PM) takes over where Altria leaves off with the international marketing and distribution of Marlboro and other cigarette brands. Emerging markets are a key area of growth for them where regulations and taxes tend to be less.The stock has the weakest Composite Rating at 84, mostly hindered by an EPS Rating of just 68. However, the stock has the highest dividend yield of the three stocks at 4.4%. The stock is still in the buy range from a recent breakout above a 90.27 buy point.

274,PM,"It's D-Day! Wednesday March 16 – FOMC Rate Decision Day….and the world anxiously awaits word from Janet Yellen over the fate of interest rates in this country…and do not expect it to be a 'barn burner' at all…… – no one expects her to announce a hike in rates…..but as discussed here in prior notes – they will be watching and listening to every word that she utters in the statement/press conference. What will she say? How will she say it? What words did she delete or insert that is different from the last statement? What is her body language telling us? Is April or May a possibility or has she drawn the line in the sand in June? Can she diverge from what other central banks are doing?Remember the twin mandates of the FED –""The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Open Market Committee shall maintain long run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates commensurate with the economy's long run potential to increase production, so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates."" (So it's inflation and employment)So let's talk inflation for a moment – for the past 7 yrs…inflation has been low due to the GFC (Great Financial Crisis) that walloped this country back in 2008…but in December we were told that Core CPI was on the rise which is why the FED raised rates.Now today we will get another read on CPI (Consumer Price Index) and Core CPI (which is EX food and energy) and this has the ability to cause some angst for the FED. If Core CPI is on the move then the hawks will scream that rates need to rise, if it remains under control then the doves will have the upper hand.What will be interesting will be if she ties the recent rise in oil prices to her statement….remember Core CPI is usually defined as EX food and energy – but then again – the definition can change based on who is doing the talking and what they are trying to achieve. So will the nascent rebound in oil prices over the past 3 weeks (up 35%) give Janet a reason to become 'concerned' and suggest that rising oil prices present an issue……..(read inflation) which would then give her a reason to suggest that she needs to 'get out in front' of it by raising rates? Remember - Economists always seem to use the definition that best fits the story.And now employment? They tell us that unemployment (U3) is running at 4.9% the lowest it has been in years and now essentially below their 5% target – so from that measure they have succeeded – but again – that depends on what definition you use – because if you use U6 – then unemployment/underemployment is still at 9.9%....a vastly different number.So yesterday stocks were just a bit weak on the back of the weak eco data (Retail Sales), weaker oil prices (down 2.3%), another 'Super Tuesday' primary voter day in the race for the White House (GOP continues to make a mockery of the process while Bernie professes the benefits of a Socialist State), a deteriorating economy, weaker corp earnings and the general sense of angst over the future of interest rates were all factors that cast a pall over the mkts. The choppiness of the last few days only highlighting the resistance at S&P 2020 that we have discussed.I think what the FED really wanted was for the mkt to pierce the 200 dma to the upside – which would have caused the algo's to run wild and initiate BUY orders which then would have appeared to change the psyche….but that did not happen. The technical downtrend remains firmly in place….and my guess is that no matter what she says today – is not going to be viewed as bullish enough to cause the mkts to rally even more. If anything – her comments may cause the mkts to test lower and see if the bulls are going to defend the position. If they do – then that means that they are ready for a hike – if they don't then it's back to the drawing board. Note that FED FUNDS Futures are still not convinced that we will get 1 never mind 2 hikes this year at all.S&P futures are essentially flat this morning as the mkt waits. I would not expect much in the way of action for the broader mkt until we get closer to 2 pm. I continue to see 2020 as resistance with S&P 2000 as near term support – a break below here will send us to 1975. Remember – in the end it's about the body language……so pay attention to the signals that Janet is giving.Take Good Care

277,PM,"Stocks rose for a 4th week in a row! Another jump in oil prices (due to rapidly declining production & rig count numbers) coupled with a new analysis of the latest ECB stimulus program ignited the latest rally which was led not only by energy stocks, but also by the financials – and that makes some sense – because when the buying starts – expect the underperformers (financials & Energy) to outperform on a strictly ‘trading basis’. Once the fundamentals start to disappoint those underperformers will go back to being ‘those underperformers’.So get this: Joe Davis – Chief Economist at Vanguard had this to say about the rally:“The gains are an acknowledgement that the past recessionary fears were somewhat overstated”So let me ask you something - this guy thinks that Friday’s rally is about past recessionary fears?HELLO???? Hey buddy turn on the TV - The ECB announced another ‘BAZOOKA’ stimulus program and NOT because they are hitting the cover off the ball - but because they are afraid that their recession may turn into another depression.Now just an FYI - the Germans are not happy with Uncle Mario (Draghi) and the latest move by the ECB. Surely the southern nations welcome the move - bank stocks in Italy, Greece and Spain rocketed higher on the news.....But the northern nations (read: GERMANY) are not happy at all.....German finance minister concerned that a 'one size fits all monetary policy ' will do nothing but undermine the German economy, investments, insurance and retirement plans.Oil prices which have rallied some 45% off the lows are only recovering from the slaughtering that they have taken because that slaughtering has resulted in major layoffs and massive cuts in the number of producing oil rigs – Last week the IEA (International Energy Agency) did tell us that the price of oil may have bottomed out due to lower output from the US and other NON-OPEC producers. (So calls for $20/barrel are no longer the rallying cry at GS - in fact - Let's see what they do now......will $50/barrel be the new $20?)So the perception is that rising oil prices must mean that the economy is turning around......think again....oil is moving higher because the massive cuts in production suggest that supply will diminish and if those rigs remain offline then current demand will begin to outstrip supply (basic Econ 101 – the Supply/Demand Equation). Now while the oil surplus may be easing - crude inventories are still at 80 yr highs - so don't expect any supply shortages just yet..... - Iranian production is expected to rise in the coming months and do not discount the cost savings that the major US producers have imposed after the 70% collapse in prices resulted in major cost overhauls.Chevron (CVX) is a perfect example. They have 16 rigs in the Texan Permian Basin that are due to come online by year end and CEO John Watson tells us that""We think that those wells that are being drilled will be economic at the kinds of low prices that we are seeing today""He went to say that some of those wells will make money at prices below $50/barrel and some at even below $30/barrel. Note that Oil closed at $38.50 on Friday.Next: The FED is on hold about what to do with rates – go up or go negative (precisely because of our stagnating economy) joining a large part of the world that now offers ‘negative interest rates’ – recall that the ECB lowered rates to -0.4% last week. Currency wars are breaking out again as individual nations protect themselves......here at home we continue to create minimum wage jobs to replace those higher paying jobs that we are losing on a monthly basis. The underemployment rate (U6) is still closer to 10% and this guy thinks that the rally is an acknowledgement that past recessionary fears were somewhat overstated? (Where do I send my resume?)I would argue that the move on Friday was due to a technical ‘break out’ rather than any change in fundamentals… I mean look – the mkt got off to a bad start this year…..the collapse in oil prices caused many of the sovereign wealth funds to hit the SELL button – unloading massive amounts of equities in order to raise cash with little regard to price - sending the mkts into a tailspin – artificially knocking them out whack – forcing some money managers to choke while others backed up the truck unafraid of the waves of sell orders.This – as we know – caused global mkts to tremor -sending some into BEAR mkt territory while others managed to remain in CORRECTION territory. Global Mkts suffered massive technical damage – and needed time to repair. Now yes – there is still concern about the health of the global economy as there will always be – but the action on Friday and the past couple of weeks has been all about central bank action and rebounding oil prices. I beg to differ with the fine gentleman from Vanguard – this is NOT about the overstated recessionary fears at all. Those fears existed before and continue to exist - the move is about technical's.Recall my comments from Friday morning’s note”""US futures are screaming higher....currently up 18 pts taking us right back to where exactly? S&P 2000 - Which is the 3rd time in 6 days that we have done so.....This could be key..... If futures remain strong then the S&P cash will open in the 2009 range - its 3rd time as well - giving it the momentum it needs to challenge the down trending 200 dma at 2020. I would not be surprised at all to see today be the day that traders take the mkt higher as the bull looks to take control of the situation yet again.""And so it was written……The S&P broke out of its most recent resistance level – the 100 dma and went ahead to test the next significant ‘technical resistance level’ – the 200 dma at 2020. Expect mkts to now digest and churn – unable to pierce this down trending resistance line - until we get some catalyst that CHANGES the conversation.......What will that be?Will it be the latest word from the FED on Wednesday at 2 pm? Now while Janet is expected to leave rates unchanged – the devil is in the details – Rates are not going up now, but the sense is that they are going higher in June. How will she say it? What words will she change from the January statement? Will she make note of the 'explosive rise' in the price of oil as a reason to 'get ahead of the inflation monster'? Expect Jon Hilsenrath- Chief Economic Correspondent at the WSJ otherwise known as ‘Deep Throat’ - to give you his blow by blow analysis – you see – he says what she can't say - and this way she gets to test the mkts reaction. Oh the intrigue and drama of it all.....….It’s so Frank Underwood…..After the FED announcement - investors will look for the fundamentals to play the supporting role…This week is full of US macro data points and with only 3 weeks to go before the start of earnings season – investors have to ask: Will earnings surprise or disappoint? (We have already seen an increase in the number of 'downgrades'). Will forward guidance be positive or negative? Is the S&P fairly valued based on these data points? Is the talk of recession no longer the subject of so many cocktail parties?This morning we see global mkts all higher - playing catch up with Friday's action.....US futures are now down 3 pts.....(not surprising). For the immediate future - my sense is that the short trading range is now 1998/2020. No eco data today, but tomorrow we get Retail Sales exp of -0.1%, Ex autos and Gas of +0.2%, PPI of -0.2% but ex food and energy of +0.1%, Empire State Manf of -11.50 (that would UP from -16.64). Later in the week look for Housing Starts, Mort Apps, Building Permits , CPI and CPI ex food and energy, Ind Prod, Cap Utilization and the FOMC RATE DECSION (Wed at 2 pm). You can feel the anticipation building....In the end – the mkt is now down 1% this year and still off some 5% from 2015 highs of 2134. This rally back to flat is probably where we should have been all along before the Sovereigns puked....so let's see what's next..... A decisive break ABOVE 2020 - will unleash the bulls......as there is not real resistance until we get back into the 2075/2100 range.....But any indication that rates are going higher in June will surely cause traders to re-think their strategy while the long term investor continues to look for the value.....

278,PM,"Some investors seek out high-octane growth stocks with the potential for big, fast gains. Others prefer slower, steadier companies that offer dividends and can be held for the longer term.The Income Investor column is almost tailor-made for the slow but steady crowd -- almost, because some fast-growth companies are also featured in the column from time to time.Each day, Income Investor (in today's IBD on page B9) highlights one or more companies that not only pay steady dividends but also meet key fundamental and technical criteria. The accompanying Dividend, Utility and REIT Leaders screens next to the column in IBD offers plenty of ideas, while the six minicharts above the lists provide detail about those stocks.Dividend Leaders, the broadest screen, shows names such as AT&T (T), Merck (MRK) and Philip Morris (PM) making the screen lately, thanks to their steady earnings track record and dependable dividends. Other younger tech stocks recently on the list include Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Microchip Technology (MCHP).Utility Leaders are often considered as defensive plays. When the broader market is ailing and growth stocks are getting hit, utilities tend to hold up well. Income investors can also count on a steady dividend due to utilities' reliable revenue streams. That's why utilities have topped IBD's ranking of 197 industry groups during the recent market volatility.REIT Leaders, the last screen, also offer a relative safe haven in a rocky market. Real estate investment trusts are set up in such a way that they can avoid paying corporate taxes if they pass the majority of their profits on to shareholders. They do so in the form of dividends, which is why many income investors also like REITs.While a slow economy can hurt these businesses as well, REITs also have a fairly steady revenue stream since they collect rent payments and lease proceeds from buildings or other real assets they own and operate. Due to their tax structure, they pay out most of their profits in the form of cash dividends.Keep in mind that even utility and REIT stocks can sink rapidly when the stock market goes into a deep decline. That's exactly what happened during the 2008-2009 bear decline. From July 2008 to March 2009, the Dow utility average fell 45%. So in severe situations, losses in every stock must be cut short and cash must be raised.The three screens provide annualized dividend yields and long-term dividend growth rates for each company, in the last two columns of each list. From there, investors can decide which ones they would like to research further. Most of these stocks won't look like the typical high-growth companies that are setting up for a breakout, but it's usually better to be buying and holding them when the long-term trend is up.AT&T has outperformed the market recently. The telecom giant has rallied 8% this year, after edging 2% higher in 2015. The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 were both slightly underwater last year and down 6% this year. AT&T, a S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat, tops the Dividend Leaders list with a 5.24% yield, well above the S&P 500's average payout of 2.26%.

279,PM,"Reynolds American's (RAI) fourth-quarter sales surged more than expected, aided by its recently acquired Newport brand and higher prices.Revenue jumped 43% in Q4 to $3.05 billion. Wall Street expected $3.04 billion. Earnings per share minus one time items grew 9.1% to 48 cents, 2 cents below consensus.In July 2015, Reynolds agreed to buy Lorillard for $27.4 billion.The tobacco company guided for 2016 EPS to $2.25-$2.35, with the midpoint is below analyst views for $2.34. Reynolds also raised its dividend 16.7% to an annualized rate of $1.68.Nomura analyst Owen Bennett said Reynolds is the best growth story in the tobacco space, and chances are good it will top its own guidance.""Given the company is likely to remain cautious early on in the year, then the top end of guidance can be seen as encouraging,"" Bennett said in a report.Reynolds American shares closed up 2.2%. Reynolds stock has a 99 IBD Composite Rating, meaning it's outperformed at least 99% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales and profit growth. It briefly rose above 50 on Feb. 1 to an all-time high before consolidating.Reynolds said Thursday that its U.S. cigarette volume rose 33.6% in Q4, driven in part by the addition of the Newport brand. Industry cigarette volume declined 0.5% during the quarter, and fell 0.1% for the full year, the company said. Reynolds expects the industry to return to its traditional 2% to 3% shrinkage in 2016.Last week, Philip Morris International (PM), which sells Chesterfield, Lark and Marlboro cigarettes outside of the U.S., reported a 21.4% drop in EPS and 11% slide in revenue. The company also forecast a third straight drop in full year 2016 earnings. Shares fell 1% Thursday.Altria (MO) on Jan. 28 reported slightly higher Q4 profit as its flagship Marlboro brand grew retail sales for a fourth year in a row, and announced layoff plans to cut costs. Altria dipped 0.1% Thursday. 
"
280,PM,"Philip Morris International (PM) sees 2016 earnings falling further after declines in 2015 and 2014.The maker of Chesterfield, Lark and global No. 1 seller Marlboro cigarette brands forecasts its full-year earnings per share to be $4.25-$4.35 at current exchange rates, down from $4.42 in 2015 and well below consensus of $4.52.That would follow drops of 12% in 2015 and 7% in 2014.Shares of Philip Morris closed down 0.9% on the stock market today. Among other large tobacco companies, Altria (MO) lost 0.6%, British American Tobacco (BTI) fell 1.75% and Reynolds American (RAI) dipped 1%.In Q4, Philip Morris' adjusted earnings fell 21.4% to 81 cents, in line with analysts' expectations. Unfavorable currency rates had an 18-cent impact in the quarter.Revenue dropped 11% to $6.39 billion, below consensus for $6.49 billion and the the fifth straight quarter of declines, as its cigarette shipment volume fell 2.4%, excluding acquisitions.The decline was largest in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, where revenue plunged 19% to $1.72 billion. The company doesn't sell in the U.S. since it was spun off from former parent Altria, which operates Philip Morris USA, in 2008.The Philip Morris namesake brand was its top gainer, as volume grew 20.2% to 9.8 billion cigarettes. Despite new packaging and marketing, its Marlboro brand saw a weak 0.7% rise to 71.8 billion units.Chief Executive Andre Calantzopoulos said efforts to develop electronic cigarettes and other cigarette alternatives picked up steam.“We continued to make exciting progress on the development, assessment and commercialization of our Reduced-Risk Products,"" he said. ""We significantly expanded the roll-out of iQOS (smokeless cigarette) in Japan and introduced it into several new markets.""

281,PM,"It was a SUPER TUESDAY in America.....March came in like a LION as global investors grabbed for anything that wasn't nailed down and......Some would have you believe it was a MAGA (Make America Great Again) rally.....I say - 'not so fast cowboy.....it ain't over until the fat lady sings......'Voters went to the polls to try and cull the Presidential field......Democrats pulling for Hill as she looks to be the anointed leader of that party (although Sanders has not conceded, but should) .....while the GOP is still struggling trying to find their next leader......The Donald would have you believe it is him as he continues to cause earthquakes every time he opens his mouth and now that it looks like he could really snatch it - the calls from the GOP establishment get louder and louder to STOP him.......as the party spins out of control.............. Kasich and Carson barely registered on the Richter scale while Teddy and Marco cause tremors across the nation .....tremors yes, but a real quake - not so much.......but they are not giving up so easy - vowing to take this fight to the convention in what would is known as a 'contested convention'.....the Democrats would LOVE this to happen.....as it just confirms that the GOP is a mess......[A contested convention (or brokered convention) is a situation where no one single candidate has secured the required number of delegates to be the clear front runner - so the process then goes to 'political horse trading' at the summer convention......At the convention - if there still is no clear candidate then all of the delegates are released from their prior pledges and the slate is wiped clean. And the 'brokering' or 'horse trading' begins anew....after a couple of winks, some promises and a handshake - the party chairman calls for a new vote of the delegates. It is then hoped that this will result in a clear winner as a majority of delegates rally around one candidate....The interesting thing here is that a brokered convention does not necessarily reflect the will of the people and could end up being more divisive rather than inclusive - and then we will be saying congratulations to President Rodham- Clinton (again)]And as far as the mkts go - it was a Super Tuesday for stocks as well....Stocks around the world rallied hard.... In the US - all of the indices broke up and thru resistance....and in a vote of confidence - OIL also made history as investors in that asset class took WTI (West Texas Intermediate) up and thru its resistance as well to end the day at $34.44/barrel.....The excitement started early.....Global mkts were on fire after NY FED's Dudley made very dovish comments overnight (Monday evening in NY, Tuesday morning in Asia) in China - concerning US interest rate policy and the PBoC (Peoples Bank of China) announced more stimulus - after a very disappointing manufacturing PMI report - Couple that with expectations of more ECB action as Europeans continue to struggle with what their future looks like......and we got a massive global rally.......Germany’s DAX shot up 2.3%, France’s CAC-40 added 1.2%, and the broader Eurostoxx Index added 1.7%.....Here at home - stocks came out of the gate strong and finished even stronger......The Dow closed up 2.1%, The S&P tacked on 2.4%, Nasdaq rallied 2%, the Russell 2000 +2% ......and so the story continues.....Central banks are at it again.....jawboning to pump up prices— They have spent a great deal of effort in changing the narrative for oil, for stocks, and for the economy - trying to drive up prices for stocks as we enter the final month of the 1st qtr.Now March came in 'like a lion - but will it go out like a lamb' as the saying goes?Overnight the excitement continues.....Japan rallies 4% as news that the Japanese gov't pension fund - (GPIF) - the largest fund in the world with some $1.2 trillion dollars may put some $47 bil to work in the Japanese mkt after the recent beating it took......Other mkts in the region jumped on board for the ride.....Hong Kong rallies 3%, China +4.1% and Australia + 2%. Now Moody's tried to throw cold water on the party by cutting the Chinese country's credit rating outlook to NEGATIVE from stable...but that was not successful at all.... Investors thumbed their nose at Moody's reminding them that they are always late to the party....and that their track record of protecting investors is suspect - think Great Financial Crisis of 2007-2016.....In Europe - mkts there are in rally mode - but not nearly as excited as the rest of the world at the moment...They seem to be in digesting mode after all of the excitement.....as they continue to speculate on the next move by Uncle Mario and the ECB...FTSE -0.34%, CAC 40 + 0.16%, DAX + 0.4%, EUROSTOXX +0.45%, SPAIN +0.8% and ITALY +0.83%This morning - US futures are taking a breather...currently down 4 pts....which is completely understandable...and I would not be surprised to see us back off and test support at the 50 dma....which is now 1940.....We don' t have too, but it would not be a surprise at all, before the next attempt to pierce S&P 2000. Oil is also backing off a bit and has now once again broken thru support - as it is down 0.68 cts...at $33.72/barrel....in what I think is a test to shake out the weakest links before a move higher once again.San Fran Fed's Williams is due to speak today at 10 am est.Eco data today includes ADP employemnt - exp of +190k.....Mortgage Apps came in at minus 4.8% and that makes sense after the pending home sales number on Monday......Fed's Beige Book due at 2 pm.Now with the official results still being counted - it does look like Hillary and Donald took the majority of the delegates last night so the momentum builds. The mkt will now start to pay more attention to the battle as analysts/strategists position themselves for what both a Rodham-Clinton Presidency and Trump Presidency would look like....Will Janet and the FED will fade to black as the investors ponder the political landscape? After yesterday - talk of the pace and timing of rate hikes once again grew louder....but March for all intents and purposes is off the table - June is the next opportunity for any rate hike and then December if at all...so maybe we get 50 bps in 2016, but for sure we will not get 100 bps and maybe that is part of the reason to celebrate......Take Good Care

283,PM,"When the economy is entering a recession, stocks in consumer staples, health care and telecoms ""are the best places to hide,"" said Barclays' Jonathan Glionna, who names tobacco giants Philip Morris International (PM) and Reynolds American (RAI) and drug giants Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE).Meanwhile, he includes General Electric (GE) among the stocks to buy for a recovery.He doesn't see a recession in the near term, but there are red flags such as the collapse of oil prices, the 10% retreat in the S&P 500 so far this year and slowing growth in global No. 2 economy China.In a report Monday, Glionna joined a growing number of analysts providing lists of recession-resistant stocks. But he took a slightly different tack from others, offering two lists: a Recession Playbook and a Recovery Playbook.Among other top picks on his Recession Playbook are Campbell Soup (CPB), Coca-Cola (KO), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Procter & Gamble (PG) and Hormel Foods (HRL).Philip Morris stock closed up 0.3% Tuesday, and Reynolds American, the maker of Camel cigarettes, added 1.3%. Merck gained 0.7%, and Pfizer rose 1.9%. Campbell Soup climbed 1.7%, while Johnson & Johnson and Procter & Gamble ended flat.Glionna said of his Recovery Playbook: ""The best performing sectors in previous periods of economic recovery -- using the exit of a recession as indicative of a recovery -- have been energy, materials, industrials and consumer discretionary.""Among stocks on that list: Ford Motor (F), General Electric, General Motors (GM), Harley-Davidson (HOG) and Viacom (VIA).Ford ended down 2%, and GM lost 2.8% Tuesday. GE ticked up 0.4%. Harley-Davidson fell 1.5%, and Viacom plunged more than 21% on worse-than-expected results for the December-ended quarter.Meanwhile, Cowen analysts put out their own list of recession stocks Tuesday, saying, ""We believe stocks that appeal to the low-end consumer and have minimal global exposure appear well-suited to weather an economic downturn.""Among their top picks: off-price clothing retailer Ross Stores (ROST) and Wal-Mart Stores (WMT).Ross Stores climbed 2.25%, and Wal-Mart fell 1.6%.

285,PM,"U.S. stock indexes stumbled in afternoon trading Thursday, as the major indexes sank further under their 50-day moving averages and approaching their Tuesday intraday lows.X The Dow Jones industrial average led the losers with a 2.5% dent. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 followed, scrapping off 2.4% and 2.2%, respectively.Volume in the stock market today was running lower on the NYSE but higher on the Nasdaq vs. the same time in the previous session.Most leaders were losing ground, and a few suffered chart damage.

The Street is expecting fiscal 2018 earnings to drop 34%.In the S&P 500, cigarette maker Philip Morris (PM) led with a 2% gain.In the Dow Jones industrial average, Apple (AAPL) was among the better performers with a fraction loss.

287,PM,"It was bizarre watching KABC TalkRadio in Los Angeles — my hypocritical ex-employer — hold a televised news conference. It turns out that one of the station's news anchors, Leeann Tweeden, claims Sen. Al Franken groped her. In 2006, Tweeden said, before Franken became a senator, he and she participated in a USO tour to entertain the troops in the Middle East.But, claims Tweeden: ""(Franken) repeated that actors really need to rehearse everything and that we must practice the kiss. I said 'OK' so he would stop badgering me. We did the line leading up to the kiss and then he came at me, put his hand on the back of my head, mashed his lips against mine and aggressively stuck his tongue in my mouth.""I immediately pushed him away with both of my hands against his chest and told him if he ever did that to me again I wouldn't be so nice about it the next time.""I walked away. All I could think about was getting to a bathroom as fast as possible to rinse the taste of him out of my mouth.""I felt disgusted and violated.""Why was the KABC news conference about Franken's misconduct bizarre?Only a few years earlier, the same KABC radio executive who arranged the Tweeden news conference fired me for calling out the blatant left-wing hypocrisy over allegations not just of groping but of rape. I dared insist that the allegations made against President Bill Clinton by Juanita Broaddrick — who claims that she was raped by Bill Clinton and that then, two weeks after the rape, Hillary Clinton verbally intimidated the alleged rape survivor — should have been taken seriously. ""No one cares about this issue,"" said the very same KABC exec now allegedly incensed over the groping allegation against Franken. As for Broaddrick, the executive screamed, she is ""old news,"" as, he insisted, were Bill and Hillary's treatment of multiple accusers. He burst into my radio studio, with the show in progress, and literally yelled at me for pounding an ""irrelevant"" topic. Shortly before I got fired, the executive sent this letter to my agent:""I point out that from 3:15 pm to almost 4 o'clock, Larry is AGAIN talking about Kathleen Willey, Juanita Broderrick (sic), Monica Lewinsky, Paula Jones and somehow linking Hillary Clinton and James Carville to Bill Clinton being a rapist and sexual harasser. This line of discussion is repeated and repeated, day after day. It is neither timely or relevant to today — though I assume Larry thinks it is in some way. It is my opinion that the sheer volume of instances — sometimes multiple times a day — where he brings this old, arcane topic up is very detrimental to the ratings. While there are literally scores of current, important and compelling stories, Larry is talking, again, about an issue from over 20 years ago. For the better part of an hour. Please let me know if you have some idea of how to get it to cease, short of embargoing mentions of the names above. ... It was my understanding that Larry was going to stop by and see me. He has not.""XIt isn't enough to criticize Bill and Hillary Clinton — so-called advocates for women — for their hypocrisy. What about ABC News' ""chief anchor,"" George Stephanopoulos, who helped set up the ""war room"" to respond to allegations made by women against Clinton? Stephanopoulos, then a top aide to presidential candidate Bill Clinton, even said, ""Bill Clinton has no character problem."" How does a partisan like Stephanopoulos, who consistently defended Clinton's behavior and blamed the ""Republican attack machine,"" become the ""chief news anchor"" of anything, let alone of ABC News? If, at last, much of the country is reassessing their opinion of Bill and Hillary Clinton, what about enablers like Stephanopoulos?What about media executives, like the one I once worked for, who downplayed the hypocrisy and, in his case, actively attempted to squash any discussion of it? What about these media enablers? Comedian Chelsea Handler recently tweeted: ""Imagine being molested by an older man. Then that man denies ever doing it and then goes on and gets elected to United States Senate. What kind of message does that send to young girls everywhere? And men to all the men who abuse women?""Juanita Broaddrick tweeted back: ""I can imagine. I was raped by the Arkansas AG who then becomes Governor & President and NBC held my interview explaining the rape until after his impeachment hearing. But I'm sure you don't want to go there."" Handler apologized: ""You are right and I apologize to you for not knowing your story. Democrats along with Republicans and the rest of the world's political parties all need to do better and respect the firsthand accounts of victims. I believe you.""Why did Handler not know her story? Blame media decision-makers who ignored or downplayed this issue — and even threatened the careers of those who dared call out the hypocrisy.RELATED:Hollywood Moralists Exposed As HypocritesFLASHBACK: Obama Admin Protected Sex Offender, Helping Re-electionHollywood Harassment Scandal Now Envelops Amazon And TwitterClick here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

288,PM,"Major stock indexes were slightly lower near midday Wednesday on the eve of the Thanksgiving holiday, but Apple (AAPL) continued to warm investors' hearts as it recouped more of its moderate losses seen over the prior week and a half. Shares rose nearly 1% to 174.36 in active trading.That extends Apple's gain from its latest breakout from a new cup with handle at 160.97 to 8%, so it's out of the proper buy zone for now. The 5% chase zone goes up to 169.02.XMeanwhile, banking shares continued to show good action this quarter, with a new breakout coming from New England-based Meridian Bancorp (EBSB). Shares bolted more than 2% higher to 20.42, rising past a 20.25 buy point in a long cup with handle.Meridian is a thinly traded small cap with an average daily volume of 181,000 shares over the past 50 sessions.At 1 pm ET in New York, the Nasdaq edged less than 1 point lower, keeping virtually all of Tuesday's solid 1.1% advance. At 6864, the tech-rich composite index holds a 5.7% gain since Oct. 1.The S&P 500 eased nearly 0.1%, and the Dow Jones industrial average is off 0.2%. Small caps fell by a similar amount, with the S&P SmallCap 600 down 0.1%.Volume was running sharply lower vs. the same time Tuesday on both main exchanges. The stock market will be closed Thursday and open until 1 p.m. ET on Friday.Apple has done very well for long-view-minded investors over the past year. As repeatedly noted in IBD's Stock Market Today column late last year and early in 2017, the iPhone, iPad and digital services titan broke out of a first-stage cup-with-handle base on Jan. 6-9, rising past a 118.12 buy point.Volume came in a little higher than normal in a few up days over the next three weeks, then gushed higher on Feb. 1 after Apple reported a solid turnaround in quarterly results (fiscal Q4 profit up 2% to $3.36 a share, halting a three-quarter streak of year-over-year losses, and revenue up 3%).The gain from that first-stage bottoming base has now reached 49% to a new all-time high of 176.24.Apple has certainly delivered on the fundamentals over that period. Growth has accelerated. After that 2% rise in earnings, Apple has posted EPS increases of 11%, 18% and 24% on revenue gains of 5%, 7% and 12%. Growth is expected to continue accelerating.While no sell signals have triggered for investors who bought on the January breakout or have even larger capital gains, Apple at one point will be vulnerable to a correction, just like the greater market itself. When this occurs, expect the megacap tech to test support at its long-term 200-day moving average, currently near 152.A big collapse through that 200-day line would likely mean that a significant new base-building period is in the works. See the 200-day moving average painted in black on a MarketSmith daily chart. The 200-day line tracks the average closing price for a stock over the past 200 trading sessions, or roughly equivalent to 10 months. A rising 200-day line means the overall long-term price trend is up.While institutions are clearly bullish about the current fundamentals in Apple, some are expressing concern over the company's ability to keep raising the cash payout.Alex Crooke, head of global equity and income strategies at Janus Henderson, notes that Apple likely has had to raise debt in order to pay the dividend since the company is not making any move to repatriate profits from overseas businesses. Indeed, long-term debt vs. shareholder equity has gone up to a still manageable 73% in FY 2017 (ended in September) vs. 45% in FY 2015.""The margins might stay up, but the (dividend and profit) growth rate may moderate,"" Crooke told IBD, adding that he sees some limitations in the volume sales for the latest iPhone X, which can cost more than $1,000 per handset.The Street sees strong growth in FY 2018 (ending in September), with earnings jumping 24% to $11.44 a share on a 20% leap in sales to $274.3 billion. A 24% EPS pickup would be the strongest increase since a 43% bulge to $9.22 a share in FY 2015.For FY 2019, the estimates are 5% EPS growth and 2% revenue growth, but keep in mind that Wall Street analysts tend to be very conservative with forecasts that far out into the future.Crooke manages the Bankers Investment Trust, a closed-end fund started in 1888 and currently traded on the London Stock Exchange. The fund is on track to achieve 51 years in a row of increasing dividends paid to fund holders. Apple was the second largest holding in the $1.2 billion fund, according to data as of Oct. 31. Total return over the past five years is 123.3%.Apple paid a quarterly cash dividend of 63 cents a share on Nov. 16. The stock has a 1.5% annualized yield, below the 1.9% yield for the S&P 500.On IBD Stock Checkup, the SMR Rating for Apple is currently at a top-notch A on a scale of A to E and signifies leadership in terms of sales, profit margins, and return on equity.Going back to Meridian, the handle in Meridian's base began with a decline on Oct. 27, and the 7.2% correction within the handle portion is normal for a good cup with handle pattern.The operator of savings and loans in three counties of Massachusetts boasts a top-notch 99 Earnings Per Share Rating in IBD Stock Checkup. Earnings per share have risen 64%, 69%, 29%, 100% and 39% vs. year-ago levels in the past five quarters.Other banks acting well lately include Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM), both of which recently found buyers during the latest pullback to the 50-day moving average.BofA is in the proper buy zone since clearing a 25.90 buy point in a seven-month-long flat base. That flat base may also be interpreted as a shallow saucer base.The stock is trading flat on Wednesday at 26.67, up nearly 3% from the proper entry.The 5% chase zone for BofA goes up to 27.20.The money center bank is expected to grow fourth-quarter profit by 20% to 48 cents a share. That would mark a second straight quarter of acceleration following EPS gains of 12% and 17% in the prior two quarters.Q4 revenue is seen slipping 3% to $21.96 billion.B of A's Composite Rating on Stock Checkup is a respectable 82 given that the bank is continuing a turnaround in fundamentals.JPMorgan, at 98.82, has climbed modestly since clearing a 95.32 base-on-base buy point in late September.RELATED:Also In Stock Market Today: 5 Reasons To Keep Holding AppleLooking For Top Large-Cap Firms: Inside Big Cap 20Which New Public Companies Will Emerge As The Future Cisco, Google and Microsoft?How To Find The Next Great IPOs: Check This ScreenThe Big Picture: Why The Future Of The Market Rally May Lie HereHow To Search For The Best Growth Stocks: Start Here

289,PM,"Major indexes edged higher at midday Monday, the start of a holiday-shortened week that currently see the market in a confirmed uptrend.Apple (AAPL) backtracked in light volume, and another light-volume drop could put shares back in buy range. Last month, Apple cleared a brand-new cup with handle, moving past a 160.97 entry. The 5% chase zone extends up to 169.02.XOther key megacap and big-cap techs to keep watching with less than two months to go in 2017 include Applied Materials (AMAT), Lam Research (LRCX), Adobe Systems (ADBE), Square (SQ) and Nvidia (NVDA). All five of these names rank in the latest IBD Big Cap 20.All five of these names are currently extended from a proper buy point. However, given their excellent fundamentals, superior position within their respective markets, and outstanding relative price strength, they certainly deserve a spot on a long-term watch list. New follow-on entry points or new bases will eventually emerge.At 1 pm ET, the Nasdaq composite rose less than 0.1%, while the S&P 500 rose close to 0.2%. Most Chinese ADRs flexed strength, following a third straight advance for the Hang Seng equities benchmark in Hong Kong. Volume is running sharply lower vs. the same time on Friday, which saw turnover boosted by expiring monthly and weekly stock and index options.The Dow Jones industrial average rallied nearly 0.4%, buoyed by 1-point gains or more by at least five of the 30 components, including Home Depot (HD), 3M (MMM), Caterpillar (CAT) and IBM (IBM).Investors received additional confirmation that the U.S. economy is rising. The leading indicators index showed a 1.2% gain in October, blasting the Econoday consensus view of up 0.6% and a big improvement from a 0.2% drop in September.Home Depot barreled more than 1.5% higher to 170.49, good for a new all-time high. The stock marked a follow-on entry point as it bounced off the rising 10-week moving average near 165 last week in hefty volume.Those who bought shares when the stock cleared earlier buy points may add a small amount of shares to the winning position. Adding shares to your best stocks is a great way to compound your overall return, but it should only be done when the market is in a solid uptrend, as noted in the Market Pulse table of IBD's The Big Picture.The Street sees the home improvement chain's earnings rising 12% to $1.62 a share in the fiscal fourth quarter ending in January. That would extend Home Depot's streak of double-digit profit growth to 16 quarters in a row.No wonder Home Depot's EPS Rating, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, is a very respectable 92 on scale of 1 (atrocious earnings) to 99 (exceptional profit growth, both near and long term).Back to Apple, the stock provides multiple reasons why the outlook for a continued fundamentals turnaround remains very strong.Earnings per share jumped 24% to $2.07 in the September-ended fiscal fourth quarter, and Apple crushed the consensus view by nearly 11%. But perhaps more importantly, the iPhone marketer is poised to continue growing profit at double-digit pace into the next fiscal year.The Street sees fiscal Q1 earnings (for the quarter ending in December, a big-time shopping month) rising 12% to $3.77 a share; that would also be a quarterly best.A second reason to have confidence in Apple's turnaround? Revenue growth is accelerating. In the latest quarter, revenue jumped 12% to $52.58 billion, the biggest year-over-year gain in nearly three years. Analysts on consensus see sales picking up 10%, 30%, 25% and 17% vs. year-ago levels in the next four quarters.Three, Apple's ratings in IBD Stock Checkup continue to stay solid and show dramatic improvement vs. the start of the year. While the Composite Rating dipped just a bit to 89, it's still up strong from a lowly 51 on Jan. 1. The RS Rating continues to reflect leadership among big caps at 83.Four, the daily and weekly chart action for Apple has not shed any sell signals, other than to take profits at 20% to 25% for those who wish to raise some cash and look for perhaps a better growth name. Apple has jumped nearly 50% since clearing a first-stage bottoming base pattern at 118.12 on Jan. 6-9. Meanwhile, the B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating, on a scale of A to E, indicates mutual funds, banks, hedge funds and insurers are overall net accumulators of Apple shares.IBD's TAKE: Taking many gains when your stock has risen 20% to 25% past a proper buy point is an excellent way to build a strong overall return. Not only are you locking in gains in a stock on the way up, but you are also freeing up cash to possibly put into another top market leader.

It is the end of the qtr.......lots of window dressing taking place.......Global markets are SURGING... Asian markets ended the day in positive territory - Japan + 2.7%, Hong Kong + 1.4%, China +0.4%, ASX +2.1%.....As morning turns to afternoon in Europe - we see those markets all moving up....FTSE +2.05%, CAC 40 + 2.60%, DAX +2.45%, EUROSTOXX +2.5%, SPAIN +2.3% and ITALY +2.3%....even Greece is up 2.27%...... As a new day dawns here in America - we see US futures pointing higher (taking its lead from around the world) - currently up 22 pts....hitting her head on resistance at 1900.....oh but the day is young....September has seen some $11 trillion dollars wiped off the face of the earth and the 3rd qtr of 2015 will go down in history as one of the most volatile qtrs for global financial markets since the depths of despair of the GFC (Great Financial Crisis).So - is this just a 'one off' on the road to more volatility and weakness ahead? The bears will tell you that nothing has really changed between 4 pm last night and 6 am today....and the Bulls will tell you that there is a sale going on and that the global outlook is not nearly as negative as the bear case......so you decide - which side are you on?We still have the issues - slowing China, Fed policy, coming earnings, European deflation - yes folks that is correct - I did say DEFLATION....because the Euro area's inflation rate is now negative -as reported today by the European Union Statistics office based in Luxembourg.....the 19 nation block reported that inflation fell 0.1% y/y vs. an estimate of 0% ...unemployment remains stubbornly high at 11% and so this news only adds pressure on the ECB ( European Central Bank) to RAMP UP its stimulus program.Giada Giani - Economist at Citi in London says that this read was ""broadly driven by the energy component, but there are very little inflationary pressures even aside from the oil-price shock...""So this puts Uncle Mario (Draghi) in a tough position - because the last thing he wants is DEFLATION....and so now - the smart money is betting that he will increase his current $1.2 bil stimulus plan before year end.....What does this mean for the US? What will Janet do now? Can she raise rates (even insignificantly) now that Europe is in a deflationary mode? We may find out later on today....because - unlike yesterday - we are due to get more FED speak during the day....Janet will be speaking at 3 pm in St Louis, while Bullard (St Louis) and Dudley (New York) and Fed Governor Lael Brainard also take to the airwaves during the course of the day.... Strap in for this.....we are sure to get a range of mixed messages as each one opens their mouth and mixed messages translates into volatility.....who will the market pay attn to? The Hawks or the Doves?Ok...so yesterday we started to see the discount buyers pick away.....but they did remain a bit apprehensive - taking the market right up to 1900 where it hit resistance, causing the buyers to back off a bit...........Biotech's got a bit of break in the morning, but then took it on the chin again by day's end. Many big cap names also came under pressure as the day wore on - making it seem like investors were raising cash in the names that they could vs. inflicting more damage on some of the mid to small cap names... Demand for treasuries (always a safe bet) rose....The sense is that the skittishness is alive and well and many do not want to be caught on the wrong side of these daily knee jerk reactions....today brings us the ADP employment report - exp of +190k jobs is right in line with recent reports...so this is NOT a market mover - unless of course it surprises BIG in either direction......Friday brings us the gov't NFP report - and exp for that are +200k so again - this is NOT a barn burner unless of course that number surprises as well. This is the last read on job creation before the FED makes its next decision.....'Threats' of a 25 bps rise off of a ZIRP (zero interest rate policy) continue to permeate the conversation.....but the global economy continues to be uncooperative....but at some point - we must do what we must do.....It will just be interesting to see how they 'position it' now......considering they found EVERY excuse NOT to raise rates when it made perfect sense to do so.....If the investors really want the FED to raise rates - because they think it is the right thing to do - then we should expect that the market will surge on that move....but you can also argue that even though they may want rates to normalize - the market is not prepared for that considering the state of the global economy and that will cause the market to weaken...... so in the end - we must play the hand we are dealt.....Preparation is key.....Tomorrow brings the world a read on China's Sept manf activity.......and this will surely give us more insight into the economic health of that country.....or at least that is what it is supposed to do.....Will that reading be below 50 (which we already know it is via the preliminary read last week) and if so - what's the big deal...the markets have already DISCOUNTED this negative number..... would this be a 'sell the rumor, buy the news' type of event? Or will the bears stand up and scream that China is circling the drain.....(a bit dramatic)Look - when the markets are in a fragile state, when all we hear is angst, anxiety and negativity - then no matter what - everything appears to be bad news.....and so the markets tend to be erratic.....but if you are an optimist - then here is your opportunity.....Remember the famous WB (Warren Buffett) words:""Be greedy when others are fearful and be fearful when others are greedy"".....it seems that right now - 'others are fearful'......I'm just sayin.....On a side note (speaking of negative) - this morning's WSJ announces that BofA (Bank of America/Merrill Lynch) has begun the process of LAYOFFS....""BofA Merrill Confronts Austerity"" - and so the annual Wall St dance has begun.....Yes folks - it is that time of year.....every investment bank is trying to manage yr end expectations in terms of compensation and opportunity..... Yesterday - BAC began 'the process' as they are forced to do 'more with less'... a common theme of late..... Expect to see a sea of blood on the street before Thanksgiving.....in fact - we will start to get the news as each one reports earnings in the next couple of weeks.On the other hand (speaking of positive) - Case Shiller tells us that Home Price Growth remains strong and vibrant...rising 4.7% m/m....although mort apps this morning are down 6.7%......US Futures are UP 24 pts.... and if they stay strong into the bell then watch the S&P pierce 1900 (psychological resistance) early on.....if it does look for short term resistance at 1905ish...if we pierce that - then it's 1925!Remember - it IS the end of qtr...so lots of window dressing. Tomorrow wipes the slate clean and asset managers have another 3 months to make it work......Although I still think we end the year higher from here - I no longer believe that we will end the year with a 2100 handle.....But - we shall see.....Take good care -KpKenny Polcari is Vice President and director of NYSE Floor Operations on behalf of O'Neil Securities, Inc., a sister company of Investor's Business Daily.

Way too much uncertainty surrounding the coming earnings season...with all this talk of a weaker China - we can see how analysts are slashing estimates as they try and perfect their calls ahead of the qrtly confessional. Once we really begin to see the impact of what a 'slowing China' is really having on company bottom lines and what that means for forward guidance - investors will err to the side of caution - and rightly so.....Now what can we expect?

If she clarifies her position about the economy and rates - will this serve to stabilize markets or create more chaos? Look - she is all about transparency - no? So if that is the case - she does NOT want to say ""SURPRISE!!!"". She has to lay out a course of action and then stick to it - maybe she needs a good PR firm to help negotiate the message? And no matter what - the market is now second guessing everything they do....because it has been disappointed over and over again...and then she sends out the troops to deliver different messages as she tries to calm the markets......As Bryan Carter - Former US Treasury Economist and now lead PM at Acadian Asset said -

Larry and Curly - (Lacker & Bullard) they both came out to say that 'the FED's objectives had been met and that the decision was close - but alas..... no cigar!

358,PM,"This morning we are joined by Shemp, (Dennis Lockhart) who is also now making the case for a rate rise....I guess the question is: Where were these guys last week? If they are so convicted in what policy should be - who exactly overrode their arguments?

359,PM,"This morning US futures are getting slammed - currently down 30 pts decisively piercing the 1950 level and now once again on its way to test support at 1925......

Are you kidding me! Who actually thinks this stuff up? An internal scandal (if you can even call it that) at VW is NOT causing global markets to implode.....
"
360,PM,"Consider - if you will what the clowns at the FED have done.....they tease and tease for months about how strong the economy is, they prepare us for the 'rate increase', they note that we are at FULL employment and wages are on the rise (sure they are...) and then they CHOKE...... and then - once they realize global investors are disgusted she sends out the 3 stooges and then some to try and calm the markets and this morning that is having the opposite effect.....instead of calming the markets - all of the commentary only serves to clarify the belief that the FED is loosing credibility FAST.....

361,PM,"What is interesting is that all of these men continue to strongly suggest that rates will rise sometime over the next 90 days…..90 days, that's all we got until they are jammed into Times Square counting down the seconds to welcome in the new year - 2016.
"
362,PM,"Now yesterday - these comments helped to stabilize the dollar almost assuring investors that it now comes down to October or December - note that November is not mentioned because there is no formal FOMC meeting during that month - BUT that does not mean that she can't pull a fast one and make a 'surprise' announcement if she decides that it is important enough…..So - let's go with option #1 - if that is the case - I am betting October - because I can't imagine that the FED wants to wait until the 3rd week of December to raise rates - I mean with the holidays upon us and plenty of businesses in the financial services industry operating on skeleton crews at that time - does that make much sense? (That's a rhetorical question - no answer needed).

363,PM,"Now remember - we are due to get so much more data in the coming weeks......First up would be the all important NFP report due on Friday Oct, 2, 2015 - exp of +200k jobs to be created.......then we get 3rd qtr earnings which will begin on the week of the 12th…now some will say that AA sets off the season and they are due to report on Thursday October 8th at 4:05 pm - because they were always the first to report, they are a global company (metals, miner and refiner of Alumina) that was also a member of the DOW….- but they no longer fill that role since being removed from the DOW last year….JPM has replaced AA and is now the 'Belle of the Ball' and will report the morning of October 13th at 7 am and this will be the 'official kick off of the 2015 3rd qtr earnings.

365,PM,"Now yesterday the Dow and S&P opened strong and marched higher throughout the morning - only to become skittish after Turing Pharmaceuticals announced that they were raising the price of a 60 yr old - tried and true -drug (Daraprim) used in the care of life threatening parasitic infection from $13/pill to $750/pill - that's right a $737 increase from Monday to Tuesday…..So Hillary stepped up to the plate and took advantage of the situation sending out a Tweet threatening to take on the biotech industry's tendency to 'price gouge' (for this she must be applauded) …..this sent biotech's plunging while taking the broader market into negative territory for 5 mins or so at about 1 pm.

We expected you guys to do the right thing all along and in the end you CHOKED.....so don't make public confessions to clear you conscience - DO WHAT IS RIGHT.....and if you can't, then we as investors will re-price the risk based on what we perceive to be the truth.

368,PM,"Now in the end - do not be surprised to see the market churn and even test the August lows of 1870 on the S&P over the course of the next month as investors/traders get hit with all kinds of data points as the market searches for clarity across a range of issues - including Interest rates, China, Iran, Greece, Europe, and earnings. In the end - I do think we are setting up for a yearend rally- a rally that takes us back to the 2050/2100 range which would be essentially flat on the year - but that is a lot better than down 15%.

Janet shifts into overdrive and sends out the troops - in this case - the 3 stooges - Moe, Larry & Curly - San Francisco's Fed President Williams (voting member), Richmond Fed President Lacker (voting member) and St. Louis President Bullard (non-voting member) as they try to do 'damage control'......now while Moe (Williams) was a bit cautious in his comments - he was in the end upbeat about jobs, wages, unemployment and the overall economy. Larry and Curly - (Lacker & Bullard) they both came out to say that 'the FED's objectives had been met and that the decision was close - but alas..... no cigar!This morning we are joined by Shemp, (Dennis Lockhart) who is also now making the case for a rate rise....I guess the question is: Where were these guys last week? If they are so convicted in what policy should be - who exactly overrode their arguments?This morning US futures are getting slammed - currently down 30 pts decisively piercing the 1950 level and now once again on its way to test support at 1925...... European markets plunge as these markets are all down better than 2.5%....FTSE -1.9%, CAC 40 - 2.78%, DAX - 2.44%, EUROSTOXX -2.57%, SPAIN - 2.61% and ITALY -2.6%, SWITZERLAND - 2.7% - and if you follow Twitter at all - there are so many blaming this selloff on Volkswagen's diesel emissions scandal! Are you kidding me! Who actually thinks this stuff up? An internal scandal (if you can even call it that) at VW is NOT causing global markets to implode.....Consider - if you will what the clowns at the FED have done.....they tease and tease for months about how strong the economy is, they prepare us for the 'rate increase', they note that we are at FULL employment and wages are on the rise (sure they are...) and then they CHOKE...... and then - once they realize global investors are disgusted she sends out the 3 stooges and then some to try and calm the markets and this morning that is having the opposite effect.....instead of calming the markets - all of the commentary only serves to clarify the belief that the FED is loosing credibility FAST.....What is interesting is that all of these men continue to strongly suggest that rates will rise sometime over the next 90 days…..90 days, that's all we got until they are jammed into Times Square counting down the seconds to welcome in the new year - 2016.Now yesterday - these comments helped to stabilize the dollar almost assuring investors that it now comes down to October or December - note that November is not mentioned because there is no formal FOMC meeting during that month - BUT that does not mean that she can't pull a fast one and make a 'surprise' announcement if she decides that it is important enough…..So - let's go with option #1 - if that is the case - I am betting October - because I can't imagine that the FED wants to wait until the 3rd week of December to raise rates - I mean with the holidays upon us and plenty of businesses in the financial services industry operating on skeleton crews at that time - does that make much sense?

"
372,PM,"By 1973, as striking coal miners brought the British government of Prime Minister Edward Heath to its knees, Margaret Thatcher was a young Cabinet minister filled with apprehension about her country’s future.The miners’ union, she would note later in her autobiography, seemed more intent on bringing down the government than in securing benefits for their members.And because the miners' work was vital to keeping up the nation’s electricity supply, they had the power to do it. Heath’s Conservative government, unwilling to break the strike and unable to appease the strikers, instituted a national three-day workweek just to avoid electrical blackouts.Similar scenes repeated themselves often enough that Thatcher became convinced Britain’s trade unions threatened British democracy itself.As it turned out, Thatcher (1925-2013) was stronger, rising to become Britain's first female prime minister and igniting her country's economy.The unions had not been the only culprit in weakening Britain, which the Wall Street journal in 1975 called “the sick country of Europe.”Thatcher also faulted her own Conservative Party’s lack of principle in resisting creeping socialism. Heath’s approach was heavy on central economic planning and light on conservative principles. He showed repeatedly that he lacked the nerve to ride out rough patches in public opinion and give his own policies a chance to work.After voters threw out Heath’s government in 1974, Thatcher called for a change of direction. In a daring move that would have ingloriously ended her political career had she failed, she challenged him for party leader in 1975. Despite his formidable institutional support, she upset him by winning a plurality on the first ballot. He dropped out of the race, effectively handing her the victory, but he never forgave her until he died in 2005.In the autumn of 1975, at her first Conservative Party Conference as leader, Thatcher laid out an economic platform that clashed with both parties’ obsession with central planning.“Let me give you my vision,” she said. “A man’s right to work as he will, to spend what he earns, to own property, to have the state as servant and not as master -- these are the British inheritance.”Such talk appealed strongly to the party rank and file and to Britain’s middle class in a time of double-digit inflation and high unemployment.Thatcher dutifully opposed the Labour government in Parliament until its wheels finally came off in December 1978. Again, striking trade unions dealt the fatal blow. Health service workers, government workers (including trash collectors), truckers and even gravediggers went on strike almost simultaneously.Of these unfortunate events, Thatcher wrote that “without their exposure of the true nature of socialism, it would have been far more difficult to achieve what was done in the 1980s.”It prepared the electorate for Thatcherism and steeled her resolve for reform that seemed radical at the time.“The reason she became leader of the Conservative Party in 1975, and the reason she became prime minister, was that everything was going badly,” Charles Moore, a Thatcher biographer, told IBD.Thatcher became prime minister after the election that followed in May 1979, with the Tories winning their largest parliamentary majority in two decades.Americans primarily remember Thatcher for her collaboration with President Reagan in countering the Soviet threat at the end of the Cold War era. Long before Reagan’s election of 1980, she publicly criticized the Western policy of detente with communism, calling the Soviets “hell-bent on world domination” in a famous 1976 speech. The Russian press dubbed her the ""Iron Lady"" in response, and she lived up to the nickname, occasionally upbraiding Reagan to hang tough in his dealings with the Soviets.As prime minister, Thatcher also had to face down a terror in the homeland. Early in her administration, she refused to give in to demands from imprisoned Irish Republican Army terrorists, 10 of whom starved themselves to death in a 1981 hunger strike. Thatcher, who had seen friends and political allies murdered by the terrorist group, herself became the target of a 1984 IRA assassination attempt, which killed five others at a Conservative Party conference in Brighton.“A lesser figure today would have run away,” said Nile Gardiner, a former Thatcher aide and co-author of ""Margaret Thatcher on Leadership."" “She remained on site and dedicated her speech to crushing the IRA.""The IRA would not lay down its arms until 2005, but Thatcher helped set the stage for successful peace talks and the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 when she moved to include the government of the Republic of Ireland in the process for the first time.Thatcher is most loved and most hated in Britain for her domestic policy, which restored the nation’s economic dynamism. She broke from the orthodoxy of her day by fighting inflation not with socialistic wage or price controls, but with cuts to government spending and higher interest rates. This was not popular at a time when unemployment was still high, but she stuck to her guns. By her fourth full year in office, inflation had fallen below an annual 5%.Thatcher also moved as quickly as she could to prevent unions from bringing down future governments. She repealed civil immunity for union actions and imposed the critical requirement that union members be given a binding vote on strikes. This paid dividends in the next major union confrontation of 1984, a long struggle but one that her government won decisively against the striking National Union of Miners. The defeat of the miners’ union, viewed then as the nation’s most powerful, had a ripple effect. Strikes had cost Britain 29.5 million man-days of work in 1979. In 1990, when Thatcher left office, they cost it only 1.3 million.Thatcher’s swift and successful military response to Argentina’s 1982 invasion of the Falkland Islands helped ensure her 1983 re-election over a fragmented British left. The Tories gained 38 seats to form the largest majority that any party had held at that point since World War II.Thatcher cut income tax rates while raising the U.K.’s value-added tax, reasoning that this removed disincentives for work and shifted them to consumption. She privatized dozens of major industries and companies that had been nationalized by previous socialist governments.The government sold off previously unprofitable state-owned enterprises in oil exploration, utilities, shipbuilding, automotive production (Rolls-Royce and Jaguar), telecommunications and commercial air travel (British Airways). Thatcher called privatization “one of the central means of reversing the corrosive and corrupting effects of socialism.”Thatcher’s tenure as PM came to an end in 1990, not through electoral defeat but through the fraying of alliances within her own party. The issue that occasioned her downfall was European integration. She had been cautious of giving too much power to the Continent and was skeptical of the common currency in the planning stage.“She was fundamentally right about the euro single currency,” said Moore, pointing to current problems in the countries of southern Europe. “She believed the poorer nations couldn’t cope with the rigors of a single currency.”After failing to defeat a challenge to her leadership in the first round by a sufficiently large margin to end the matter, Thatcher went out on a high note. She announced her resignation the next day, Nov. 22, 1990.Margaret Roberts was born to Beatrice and Alfred in the east England town of Grantham, where they were the odd Tory family in a left-wing environment.Thatcher wrote fondly of her pacifist pastor, “the kindest and holiest man,” who would eventually preside at her wedding. From his example, she also concluded that “personal virtue is no substitute for political hard-headedness.” This became especially apparent to the young future prime minister when England’s anti-war politicians, including those in the ruling Conservative Party, desperately tried and failed to appease Adolf Hitler and avoid a major European war.She became involved in Conservative Party politics while studying chemistry at Somerville College, part of Oxford. Debates of the Oxford University Conservative Association became a major source of her extracurricular intellectual stimulation, in part because the Oxford Union (the mainstream debate society) did not allow women as members.After graduating and finding work as a chemist, she was chosen in 1951 by the Conservative Party to be the sacrificial lamb in a hopeless run for Parliament in Dartford. She lost as expected but met Denis Thatcher, “an exceptional man,” who as she put it “knew at least as much about politics as I did and a good deal more about economics.” She and Denis were married in December 1951, and she became mother to twins Mark and Carol.Mrs. Thatcher put her name forward for Parliament again in the more promising constituency of Orpington in 1954, but failed to gain the nomination. In her view, party officials -- even women in the party -- were hesitant to select a female nominee, especially a mother.“Perhaps some of the men at selection committees entertained this prejudice,” she wrote, “but I found then and later that it was the women who came nearest to expressing it openly.”She would not win election to Parliament until 1959. As late as 1973, when she was a Cabinet minister, Thatcher said in a town hall she did not expect to see a woman become prime minister in her lifetime. Later, though, as party leader, she said she had “a woman's ability to stick to a job and get on with it when everyone else walks off and leaves it.""Prime minister of Britain from 1979 to 1990.Overcame: Sexism, party establishment groupthink, powerful special interests, foreign aggression.Lesson: A determined woman can overcome any challenge.“State intervention in the economy is not ultimately an answer to over-mighty vested interests, for it soon comes to collude with them.”

373,PM,"Altria (MO) reported slightly higher fourth-quarter profit as its flagship Marlboro brand grew retail sales for the fourth year in a row. The company also said it plans layoffs to lower costs.The No. 2 tobacco company by revenue behind Philip Morris (PM) said earnings per share rose a penny in Q4 to 67 cents, one cent less than the analyst consensus of 68 cents. It was the first time in six quarters that Altria failed to meet or beat profit estimates.Revenue rose 2.5% to $4.729 billion, lighter than the expected $4.745 billion.On its earnings call Thursday, Altria said it plans to eliminate jobs to cut up to $300 million in costs annually, according to the Wall Street Journal. Chairman and Chief Executive Marty Barrington declined to say on the call how many jobs would be cut.The results were in line with Stifel's forecast. Prior to the earnings report, Stifel analyst Christopher Growe said in a Jan. 14 report that he had a buy rating on Altria with a positive bias.Growe said he expected 2016 industry growth to be lower than 2015's, but he generally sees robust conditions, saying the recent period for tobacco makers is a ""Golden Age"" amid global expansion and the rollout of new products such as electronic cigarettes.During Q4, Altria continued to build its Nu Mark portfolio of e-vapor products to additional retail outlets.Altria forecast full-year 2016 EPS of $3 to $3.05, below the consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $3.05.The tobacco company is a major shareholder of SABMiller and is hoping the proposed merger between Miller and brewing giant AB InBev (BUD) will go through.If it does, ""we expect to capture a significant premium on our very large investment in SABMiller and continue our participation in the global beer profit pool on attractive terms,"" Barrington said in the earnings statement.Altria shares closed up 1.1% in the stock market today. Altria continues to trade near its all-time-high close of 61.53 on Oct. 29, and it sports a 93 IBD Composite Rating, meaning it's outperformed more than 93% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales and profit growth.Philip Morris added 1.1%. Among other large tobacco companies, Reynolds American (RAI) rose 19%, and British American Tobacco (BTI) climbed 2%.
"
374,PM,"Tobacco stocks have risen into the upper echelon of IBD's industry rankings as investors seek a safe haven from the market's gyrations.The eight-stock industry group has jumped 25 places over the past six weeks to No. 15 out of 197 as of Tuesday amid remarkably stable earnings growth, slow-but-steady stock price appreciation and healthy dividend increases.Reynolds American (RAI) leads the industry with a best-possible Composite Rating of 99, putting it in the top 1% of all stocks based on five fundamental criteria such as sales and profit growth and relative price strength.The IBD Leaderboard stock has pulled back to just below a 49.66 buy point of a flat base after breaking out Thursday in volume 15% above average. Still, its relative strength line is soaring and its Accumulation/Distribution Rating indicates net positive demand for the shares.Reynolds, which makes cigarettes under brands such as Camel and Pall Mall, boasts a dividend growth rate of 8%. Also, its annualized dividend of $2.26 a share yields 2.9%, which is above the S&P 500 average.Tobacco companies have offset declining cigarette sales by raising prices, cutting costs and developing new products such as electronic cigarettes.Profit at Reynolds rose 17% in the latest quarter, picking up from the prior quarter's 13% gain. Revenue jumped 41%, accelerating for the third straight quarter following the company's acquisition last year of Lorillard, whose popular Newport cigarettes helped boost Reynolds' earnings last quarter.Altria Group (MO), the maker of cigarette brands such as Marlboro,  reported Thursday that Q4 profit edged up 2% to 67 cents a share on a 1% gain in revenue to $6.32 billion. Both figures trailed Wall Street forecasts. The company reportedly said after its earnings release that it would eliminate 490 jobs in the U.S. in order to save $300 million a year by the end of 2017.Yet Altria has risen 12% in the past year even as the S&P 500 has declined. The stock sits just 1% off a record high as it works on a flat base with a 61.84 buy point. Its relative strength line is soaring, which is a bullish sign.Philip Morris International (PM), also boasts a five-year earnings stability factor of 1 on a scale of zero (most stable) to 99 (least stable).Philip Morris is just 1% below an all-time as it hovers under a 90.37 buy point of a flat base. Its long-term dividend growth rate of 11% and annualized dividend yield of just over 4% are highest among the three stocks discussed here.Philip Morris, which was spun off from Altria in 2008, will report Q4 results Feb. 4.Profit for the period is seen falling 21% to 81 cents a share on a 10% decline in revenue to $6.49 billion due in part to the strong dollar. Altria spun off Philip Morris in 2008 to reduce regulatory risk, though the two companies are working together to develop and jointly market e-cigarettes.Image provided by Shutterstock.

375,PM,"From yesterday's note:""Bottom line is that crude oil prices once again survived the $30 support level and now faces another test. That test is a challenge of the 50dma which is at $34.44.....A failure for oil to pierce this resistance level will ensure that oil and stocks will hit another road block. An advance up and thru the 50 dma will ignite another rally in stocks - taking us up and thru the 50 dma at 1946 on the S&P - which will then cause sellers to back off as the bulls will push the mkt back to 2000""Now - oil did not pierce it's 50 dma - YET (but it's coming) - but once again it did unexpectedly strengthen as the day wore on.....and this renewed strength was enough for investors to grab the BULL by his .........HORNS (come on, did you really think I would have said anything different?) and charge resistance at 1946 on the S&P......As the mins ticked by - you could feel the excitement - the BULL (investors) began to 'paw the ground' in the way that he does prior to the charge....(*Pawing the ground is the way that the BULL readies himself for the coming charge warning any potential victim (in this case the BEARS) of what is to come.)At 3:40 pm - he made his move, the BEAR - now known as The Bandillero (or matedor) dressed in his 'traje de luces' (suit of lights) teased the BULL and BANG..... the BULL charged and it was all over.....The BEAR was history......and the geeks who hide behind the algo's and computer screens fell like toy soldiers...... Where did they go? They scattered like rats......as the BULLS screamed - BUY AMERICA!Now - if crude oil joins the party and breaks thru resistance at $33.44 then it is likely that the broader mkt will easily advance to it 100 dma at 2000 - which is only 2.5% from here.....a move that could easily happen in a day....... Now do not be fooled - there will be strong resistance at the S&P 2000.....and even stronger resistance at the S&P 2025 - which is the much longer term 200 dma......But - any sustained move higher, accompanied by volume will clearly be a signal that investors are more focused on fundamentals and technical's - rather than all of the noise out of the Mid-East and DC.Remember - it is month end...and there is some window dressing going on.....so a strong advance is not out of the question at all as we move into qtr end on March 31st and the FED remains on hold.And so - it is just another day in the mkts.......but it is getting a bit more exciting now.....as both oil and stocks attempt to take back the night! Now maybe the fact that stocks moved first is in fact the beginning of the disconnect between oil and stocks that should come with stability....Is this the sign?A look at the chart of the S&P reveals a couple of things....First it has created an intermediate term double bottom in January and February of this year- an event that I made note of last week. Second - if you draw a trend line off of the closing lows of August and September and run it across to today - you can see that the support created at the 1865 & 1870 levels then became resistance levels at 1912/1925.....which we have tested a number of times during February - each time getting stuck or backing off....that was until yesterday.......when the BULLS just couldn't take it any longer......So now the question is - Can we continue? Will it hold? Will the FED do something to screw it up? Will the Saudi's back off and give oil a chance to breathe?Global mkts are screaming higher.... The G20 is meeting in Shanghai and they are trying really hard to put it all in perspective......as they try to calm the fears of a new global recession......The OECD (Org of Economic Co-operation and Development) along with the IMF are urging the members to come up with a policy response to tackle what they describe as 'stuttering growth'. Can we expect BOLD action? Is the mkt assuming some kind of additional stimulus?in Asia - Japan +0.3%, Hong Kong + 2.52%, China +1% and ASX -0.01%.....In Europe the BULL continues to slaughter the naysayers....those mkts are up well over 1% across the board on the back of the explosive rally here yesterday....FTSE + 1%, CAC 40 + 1.41%, DAX + 1.67%, EUROSTOXX +1.5%, SPAIN +0.86% and ITALY +1.04%.US futures are up 10 pts!........pushing thru 1960 on the S&P......as the BULL is not backing down......He has had it with all of the BEAR talk and 'end of the world' predictions from the likes of Nouriel Roubini et al.....Eco data today includes: Revised GDP - exp of 0.4% which is lower (but we knew that), Pers Income of +0.4%, Pers Spend of +0.3% and REAL Pers Spend of +0.3%....I always love that stat....Pers spending and REAL Pers spending.......Spending is spending...no? Can you have FAKE Pers spending?I suspect the mkt will continue to advance to the 1980/2000 range before it finds any resistance at all......I mean the sellers are not going to stand in the way of the buyers at this point.....they would do themselves a favor by backing off to take advantage of the current momentum. I think today is gonna be fun.....Have a great weekend.Take Good Care

378,PM,"Cable TV leader Comcast (CMCSA), coffee king Starbucks (SBUX),  “innovative” drug companies such as Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and a few biotechs make Morgan Stanley’s list of companies with pricing power.Amid a low-inflation environment and worries over a global recession, stocks with pricing power should get a serious look, says the Morgan Stanley report.Its list also includes American Tower (AMT), Amgen (AMGN), Biogen (BIIB), Celgene (CELG), Constellation Brands (STZ), Equinix (EQIX), L Brands (LB), Mindbody (MB), Phillip Morris (PM), Reynolds American (RAI), Sally Beauty Holdings (SBH), and Sherwin-Williams (SHW).Here’s Morgan Stanley’s take on why some of these companies have pricing power.1) American Tower. “Towers effectively offer local monopolies, and there is little alternative for wireless carriers wishing to add capacity to improve network quality.”2) Amgen. “While drug pricing has been a topic of debate since U.S. presidential candidates raised focus on the topic in the late summer of 2015, we continue to see pricing power among large cap biotech.”3) Biogen. “In 2015, management took around 11% to 12% gross price increases across its portfolio.”4) Celgene. “Management in 2015 took 7-10% gross price increases across its portfolio and we would expect a similar net price trend in 2016.”5) Comcast. “We are positive on CMCSA’s broadband growth story and see improved results in video given X1 (set-top box deployment).”6) Sherwin-Williams. “(Its) pricing power relates to its control of its own distribution, as well as its outsized leverage to professional painting contractors.7) Starbucks. “SBUX remains the category leader in the high-margin, premium coffee segment and benefits from selling an often-craved, habitual product.”

379,PM,"On Monday Oil rallied, on Tuesday oil retreated, on Monday stocks rallied and on Tuesday stocks retreat.....On Monday - the talk was all about growth and the consumer, on Tuesday the talk turned to recession and global growth concerns, on Monday - the FED appeared to be on hold, on Tuesday - well maybe not so much..........Do you see the pattern?There has been so much talk about how the stock mkt is tied to the oil mkt and stock traders will be led around by the nose on the whims of the oil traders.... Let me emphatically clear).....Mkts - whether oil, stocks, real estate, gold, copper, silver, milk, coffee etc are all driven by supply and demand and investor confidence. Confidence in gov't leadership, gov't policies, potential regulations, global outlook, technology improvements, Industry dynamics, company performance, future expectations and mkt action - now while some assets move in concert with each other in the near term, others do not and in the end assets will move to levels where natural supply meets natural demand. In times of uncertainty - those levels are not so clear....thus confusion and volatility result in action that leaves us with a stomach ache.Since January 7th - we have been in the 1850/1950 trading range as the mkt looks for stability after the beating and breakdown that began back in December when we broke thru all of the technical supports (50, 100 & 200 dma's) shaving some 14% off of the US indexes before we came to our senses.We have discussed this - global mkts took a beating on China devaluations, concern over what a slowing China would do to the global economy, what will the breakdown in oil mean for the industry, the Hi-Yield mkt, the banks (via their exposure). And then the whole NEGATIVE rate discussion raised the stakes yet again. Janet, in her testimony to congress, did not emphatically dismiss the idea at all...in fact she said 'everything was on the table' ....so you ask - Why is the mkt stuck?We need a real catalyst and up til now - it has been a re-hash of the same issues - and the re-hash has not produced any new results...it's like insanity.....when you do the same thing over and over and expect a different result... It ain't happening!
"
380,PM,"As we approached the February highs of 1945 ish....I suggested that we would stall, unable to push up and thru right now because nothing has changed - no new catalyst has emerged..........and as we moved there we see a lightening of volume as the rally meets resistance. So what does it all mean?Well - it means that investors/traders are not yet willing to bet the ranch on this latest move until they get more data and direction (read catalyst). I will say that the fact that volumes are drying up as we approach resistance leaves one to take a position and get off the fence.....It can be seen both as a negative or a positive.....Negative because the buyers are not sure that this latest move is real.....so they are not committing a lot of new dollars - arguing that the sellers will come back with a vengeance sending the mkts lower to test 1850 for a 3rd time.........yet you can argue also that it is positive because the sellers are not putting a ton of pressure either - leaving them to wonder if resistance here at the 50 dma (1949 now) will in fact prove to be significant and if not - then once we pierce it - the algo's will kick in attempting to force the mkt higher to test the next level - which is 2000. (It appears today's action is reflective of the NEGATIVE view as global mkts are under pressure.But – let's not kid ourselves.....much depends on the geopolitical situation and what OPEC and the other nations do about the oversupply of oil, it also depends on how investors read JP Morgan Chase's (JPM) latest statement -""JPM Sounds Fresh Warning on Energy-Loan Losses - the bank plans to build reserves by ANOTHER $500 million tied to oil and gas exposure""Clearly - Jamie is not taking any chances about the potential damage that defaults could wreak on the banking industry......and so - banks got hit again yesterday.....(recall that JPM already has $800 million in oil and gas reserves but as Jamie told us - he views it as 'a drop in the bucket' and re-iterates the silver lining story.....for as much as someone will get hurt, there will be someone who benefits on the other side...so which side will you be on? .)US futures are now down another 16 pts - taking us down and thru 1900 on the S&P as the oil story re-ignites the RISK OFF mentality.......looks like we are going to re-test the 1850 level again.....(3 time's a charm) before this is over......The argument again today is oil (and the pattern continues)....and this morning WTI is down 3.3% - trading at $30.77/barrel....Yesterday - The Saudi oil minister did say that the world 'should not expect production cuts...' and BOOMMMM, the bottom falls out once again......A freeze - maybe, but if the other nations do not fall in line then we can expect the Saudi's to ramp it up until they choke everyone else..... as Guillermo Hernandez Sampere (Head of Trading at MPPM EK) tells us:“The fact that Saudi Arabia would rather give out the oil for free instead of giving market share to Iran will continue to weigh on oil prices and this weighs on markets”And the song plays on.....European mkts are under real pressure on the back of the Saudi comments....In the end - No one is going to play nice in the sandbox.....they don't trust each other nor do they believe that any cuts in production will be forthcoming - not until the Saudi's see blood in the streets.We have the pleasure of 3 FED speakers today.....Jeffrey Lacker (Richmond FED) at 8 am, Richard Kaplan (Dallas FED) at 1:15 and our old favorite - St. Louis's James Bullard at 6:30 pm....(I think they should pair James up with Wendy Williams (talk show host) like they did with Kelly and Michael....Think about that for a minute....)Eco data today includes; Mortgage Apps -4.3%, much weaker than last week's +8.2%, Markit US Services PMI - exp of 53.2, new home sales of 520k or a month over month decrease of 4.4%....but remember - yesterday's existing home sales number was a bit of a surprise - so anything is possible...I mean look at The Donald - he swept Nevada - and is now clearly in the lead and the candidate to beat.....(who would have thought?) Teddy and Marco coming up the rear.....and Kasich - what happened to him? I guess so many Americans are just fed up with the BS in DC......This could almost be a sitcom......Take Good Care

382,PM,"Altria's (MO) profit growth is projected to cool to the low single-digit range when it reports fourth-quarter results early Thursday, though the tobacco industry is considered to be in a ""Golden Age.""Analyst consensus is for earnings per share to rise 3% to 68 cents, which would be its weakest quarterly growth in more than four years. Revenue is projected to rise 2.7% to $4.74 billion, which would be its smallest growth rate in four quarters.""Over the past 18 months, we have regarded the conditions of the U.S. Tobacco industry as very strong leading us to regard this recent era as 'the Golden Age,' "" said Stifel analyst Christoper Growe in a Jan. 14 report that it has a buy rating on Altria and maintains a positive bias on it.While he expects 2016 industry growth to be less robust than 2015, the general industry conditions are still robust enough to support his bullish stance.He cited light litigation and regulatory activity, modest tax hikes, commanding market share, strong pricing, and an improving consumer market.Sales volumes slowed in 2014 but rebounded in 2015, led by stronger overall economic conditions like lower gas prices and employment gains, though those tailwinds should be lapped in early 2016.Altria shares crossed above its 50-day average last Friday and pushed higher Monday. It's been above the 200-day line since early October. Its stock  was up about 1% at 58.82 in Monday afternoon trading on the stock market today. It has a strong 92 IBD Composite Rating, meaning it's outperformed 92% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales and profit growth.Philip Morris International (PMI), was up 0.8%. Reynolds American (RAI), the top-rated company in the eight-company tobacco group with a  best-possible 99 IBD Composite Rating, climbed 1.6%. British American Tobacco (BTI) rose 0.5%.

387,PM,"Stocks dropped hard at Thursday's open, as undertow from global markets, company news and mixed early earnings reports took a toll.XThe Nasdaq led the drop, down 0.6%, with the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 each falling 0.3%.A sell-off in Hong Kong left the Hang Seng index down 1.9% as a sudden rise in short-term lending costs sent property developers sharply lower. The index has gained more than 30% since the start of the year.Hong Kong's stumble rippled into Europe's markets, which came under additional pressure after Spain's government formally suspended the autonomy of Catalonia. The region's parliament had elected to secede in what the Spanish government considered an illegal vote. The federal government reportedly plans to begin taking over control of the region Saturday.Spain's leading index, the IBEX 35, traded down 0.9%. Frankfurt's DAX and the CAC-40 in Paris fell hardest among Europe's larger benchmarks, down 0.6% apiece in afternoon trade.Verizon (VZ) surged to top top of the Dow, up almost 5% as third-quarter earnings fell less, and revenue rose more, than expected by analysts. Wireless subscriber growth was the big surprise, with 603,00 new subscribers vs. estimates for an increase of 362,000.The move lifted Verizon shares past a 50.41 buy point.Travelers (TRV) dropped 0.4%, despite after reporting third-quarter revenue and earnings well above analysts' targets.

The Marlboro maker missed analysts' third-quarter targets on its earnings and revenue lines, and guided fourth-quarter expectations below consensus views.  Shares have been declining since June.IBD 50 stock Winnebago (WGO) dropped 2%, depite better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter results and a new a $70 million share buyback program.  The stock ended Wednesday up 19% from a 37.30 buy point. Investors who bought during that September breakout should consider locking in some profit once gains hit 20%.Adobe Systems (ADBE) opened 9% higher as the stock received an upgrade after the software and cloud leader released positive fourth-quarter guidance late Wednesday.

"
388,PM,"Key indexes remained near the breakeven point Thursday afternoon after the first set of top-tier banks Citigroup (C) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) reported decent third-quarter results, officially kicking off Q3 earnings season.XBoth Citi and JPMorgan fell in heavy turnover, but are not triggering any sell signals.Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, quietly retook its former buy point from a flat base at 156.75 while social media phenom Snap (SNAP) jumped sharply for a second straight session.Apple is trying to stretch its win streak to four sessions and got as high as 157.37. Investors with conviction or a big cushion of gains in the stock may purchase shares, but volume is largely absent. Another strategy would be to wait for the iPhone giant to climb back above the 50-day moving average, currently near 158, or wait even longer and see if it can form a new base.At 2:30 pm ET, The Nasdaq composite edged slightly lower after marking a new all-time high of 6613.50. The Nasdaq 100-tracking Powershares QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ), S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average were all virtually flat.Volume was running higher vs. the same time Wednesday on both main exchanges.Apple had rallied a little more than 5% after clearing its 11-week flat base on Aug. 2 following its best EPS growth in nearly a year. The pullback to below the 156.75 entry and drop below the 50-day moving average reflected a sobering of investors' minds after the company unveiled its iPhone 8 and X models.However, such drops back to a proper buy point are not unusual, even among big market winners. IBD has noted in the past that as many as four out of 10 true leaders will backtrack to or near the buy point in a proper base, shaking out weak holders, before resuming its rally.Plus, Apple did not trigger the golden rule of selling.Apple has gained more than 39% since its Jan. 6-9 breakout from a first-stage cup with handle. Investors who bought at that prime entry would be justified in taking gains, but those who wish to see if there is room to run may hold until the stock shows a devastating break of the 10-week moving average (as seen on an IBD weekly chart; the 10-week line is painted in red) in massive volume.That has yet to occur.As noted in an earlier Stock Market Today column on Wednesday, the iPhone, Apple Watch and iMac marketer is in the middle of a slow yet steady turnaround in its fundmentals. IBD research has pointed out that nearly one out of four of the best stock market winners in history were corporate turnaround situations.In such cases, the stock's recent price-and-volume action, RS Rating, relative strength line and changes in current quarterly numbers matter far more than conventional IBD measures of growth that look at longer time periods. For instance, IBD's EPS Rating looks at both annual profit performance over the past three to five years as well as those in the past few quarters.For this reason, IPOs tend to have weaker EPS Ratings, because they have a younger record of profits.Snap, however, did trigger the golden rule of investing after it tried to rally back following a fireworks-like debut on the NYSE and a spectacular 34% free-fall in two weeks' time in March. Those who tried to buy later that month broke a key IBD rule, which is to never buy a stock before its base fully forms.While the rebound from an 18.90 low on March 17 to as high as 24.40 six sessions later was impressive, Snap was still in basing mode. Those who bought on the way up were forced to cut their losses at 8% or less.Now, shares in the money-losing social media network are trying to fashion an authentic first-stage base following a 62% slide from its all-time high of 29.44.Snap has lost money every year since 2015 despite showing excellent top-line growth. Shares are rising amid bullish comments made by Credit Suisse. Morgan Stanley is Snap's chief investment banker.In the second quarter, Venice, Calif.-based Snap lost 16 cents a share even though revenue soared 153% to $181.7 million, a quarterly record. Snap showed gross margin of $29.5 million, or 16.2% of total revenue. However, Snap also marked an operating loss of $449 million as R&D costs rose 608%, sales and marketing expense jumped 270%, and general and administrative costs ran up 308%.Defense firms continue to rally amid an ongoing threat of military conflict between North Korea and the U.S. Lockheed Martin (LMT) rose 0.7% to 320.95 to mark its 10th straight gain. The F-35 fighter jet maker is up nearly 19% after rising past a 269.84 flat-base entry in mid-March.Lockheed's earnings per share have climbed 49%, 24%, 8% and 12% vs. year-ago levels over the past four quarters amid revenue increases of 15%, 19%, 7% and 10%.Are there other relatively young IPOs (going public in the past five years or later) that are making money and doing well in the market today? Sure.Square (SQ), Five Below (FIVE), Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI), eBay spin-off PayPal (PYPL), YY (YY), Jupai (JP) and others are just some examples. Most of these inhabit the IBD 50. Watch for follow-on entry points or new bases to develop.On Thursday's economic news, weekly U.S. jobless claims fell to 243,000, below the Econoday forecast of 252,000 and 17,000 claims less than the prior week.Crude oil dropped hard after U.S. inventories slumped by 2.7 million barrels, a smaller drawdown than the 6 million barrel decline in the prior week. WTI futures on the NYMEX fell 1.4% to $50.56 a barrel. Gold jumped more than 0.6% and futures hit a session high of $1,299.80 a troy ounce.IBD'S TAKE: Did you know that the flat base, which reflects an unwillingness among large fund managers to dump their shares, often serves as a launchpad for big breakouts and tremendous price gains for many growth stocks?

389,PM,"Major indexes still held near the break-even line in late-afternoon trading Thursday, a day after details on President Trump's tax cut plan failed to gather praise from congressional Democrats. Bipartisan support is likely necessary for Trump to follow through on his pledges to reinvigorate the economy.XMeanwhile, Q2 U.S. GDP growth was revised slightly up to an annualized rate of 3.1%, up from 3%. August durable goods orders jumped 1.7% on a month-to-month basis, shocking the Street. Ex-transportation equipment, orders still rose a respectable 0.2% while core capital goods orders rose 0.9%.""Healthy readings for these indicators suggest continued upbeat momentum in the industrial sector despite downside risk from the recent hurricanes,"" Lewis Alexander, North American economist at Nomura, wrote in a recent note.The Building-Residential/Commercial industry group ranks 13th out of 197 IBD industry groups for six-month relative price performance. Energy-Solar, Machine-Material Handling/Automation and Aerospace/Defense industry groups are also in the top 20.At 3:30 pm ET, the Nasdaq composite edged 0.1% lower, taking a 0.6% drop in dull trading by Apple (AAPL) shares in stride. Apple had rebounded as much as 3.4% in the past two sessions after hitting a short-term low of 149.16.At 153.10, the iPhone giant remains modestly below the 156.75 buy point in a second-stage flat base, a key chart pattern seen in many top growth stocks.The Nasdaq 100-tracking PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) ETF was off 0.2% and is finding support at its 50-day moving average. But the Dow Jones industrial average edged up less than 0.2% and the S&P 500 less than 2 points, or less than 0.1%.Volume is running lower on both main exchanges vs. the same time on Wednesday.Returning to Apple, the megacap tech is still up more than 29% since clearing a first-stage bottoming base pattern on Jan. 6-9, when it broke out of a three-month cup with handle at 118.12. In a bottoming base, a stock typically declines 50% or more from its all-time high, but then bottoms out and forms a new base that can set up a potential breakout to 52-week highs.Selling a stock once it's risen 20% to 25% past a proper buy point in a cup base, double bottom or other pattern is one of the most important offense-type sell signals for individual investors.Those who have more conviction can decide to hold longer but then must be on the lookout for signs that the tide is turning from that of heavy demand to heavy supply. That's where sell signals, such as a sharp break through the 50-day moving average and failure to rebound quickly, the biggest single-session point loss in heavy turnover, or a failed breakout from a late-stage base, come in.Among top-ranked industry groups, biotech, chip equipment and plastics firms led the upside with gains of 0.8% or more. However, former big winner Gilead Sciences (GILD) fell nearly 5% in fast turnover to 79.82, giving back a lot of the gains made over the past month.The pioneer in HIV treatments cleared a first-stage bottoming base pattern with a 76.59 buy point four weeks ago.Watch to see if the stock can stay above its rising 10-week moving average, which is drawn in red on an IBD weekly chart.The Dow Jones transports rallied 0.4%. At 9880, the index has now risen 9.7% from its Aug. 24 low.Autohome (ATHM) helped spark a sell-off in some names in the Chinese internet space. The online provider of car information and ads at one point slid more than 9% to an intraday low of 57.70 before rebounding. Volume continued to run more than triple usual pace. At one point, the stock got as low as 57.70, below its rising 50-day moving average.When a stock posts its biggest single-day point drop in heavy volume since a proper breakout, it usually means it's a great time to take at least some gains and lighten up on the position.In the case of Autohome, it is also the first time for the stock to pierce its 50-day moving average since an early-May breakout past a 36.11 entry in an eight-week cup. Autohome rose as much as 87% before its current correction. A further drop below the 50-day line, especially in heavy turnover, would warrant selling shares and locking in profits.Autohome fell on news of an abrupt resignation of both President Yan Kang and CFO Julian Wang. The company also named Jun Zou, former chief financial officer at iDreamSky, to replace Wang.The company announced that the resignations ""were not due to any disagreement with the Company regarding its business, finance, accounting and/or any other affairs.""A more serious concern for shareholders may lay in whether Autohome will be able to maintain high growth in its fundamentals.Earnings grew 39% to 71 cents a share in the second quarter, matching the highest increase over the past six quarters. The increase also was an acceleration from a 15% rise in Q1. However, Q2 sales grew 11% to $230.4 million, slowly sharply from gains of 56%, 74% and 16% in the prior three periods.In the year-ago quarter, revenue jumped 49%.Analysts see revenue growth to slow further, to 3% in Q3 to $227 million, then fall 11% to $257.6 million in Q4 vs. a year ago.Despite the slower growth in the top line the past two quarters, Autohome was able to grow earnings by 39% in Q2 to 71 cents a share on the back of improving margins. In Q2, gross margin rose to 81.4% vs. 65.9% in the year-ago quarter.Net margin rose by a surprising 750 basis points to 36.2%, the highest in eight quarters, according to research by William O'Neil + Co.Autohome went public in December 2013.IBD's TAKE: Do you want to quickly check the quality of a new stock prospect in terms of its fundamentals, technical action and level of institutional sponsorship?

394,PM,"They call it stormy December, but January was  -- worse.On the heels of December's 1.58% decline in the S&P 500 and 2.80% tumble for U.S. diversified stock mutual funds, in January the broad market lost 4.96% and U.S. diversified stock funds dove 6.25%, according to Lipper Inc.It was the sixth worst January for the big-cap bogey in the past 47 years. And in that span it was the third worst opening month to a year for U.S. diversified stock funds as a group.Click Here To See List Of Top Performing Mutual Funds Past 6 MonthsThere was no mystery about the main culprits. Investors worried about stock market news that harped on China's economic slowdown and speculated about how badly it would affect the global economy -- including that of the U.S.And investors fretted about oil's declining price. Light sweet crude, for example, fell from $37.04 a barrel to $33.62 by January's end. It closed below $30 on five trading days.""China and oil are two of the reasons for the weak market in January,"" said Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors. ""I would also throw into the mix the strong dollar, high inventories, weak manufacturing sector and the political cycle.""Still, the market trended higher in its final eight sessions. Why? Credit the Federal Reserve, Orlando says. On Jan. 27, the Fed signaled that its decisions regarding future rate hikes ""would be dovish, data dependent and cautious,"" Orlando said.That was in stark contrast to the Fed's quarter-percentage-point rate hike in December.Also, Japan's central bank went to negative interest rates on certain bank reserves -- a move that bolsters stocks by making them more attractive than cash.The Federal Reserve action preceded by two days the Bureau of Economic Analysis' release of its advance estimate of GDP growth in the fourth quarter: annualized 0.7% growth, lower than Q3's 2% gain and slightly below market expectations of 0.8% for Q4.So investors, who were already spooked by the five indicators that Orlando cites, were relieved by the BEA's move, which virtually wiped out the prospect of three or four rates hikes in 2016. ""And when the Fed does make its next rate hike, investors know that that will be a sign of the Fed's faith that the economy is strong enough to handle it,"" Orlando said.Orlando believes that the Fed won't lift its rate again until the U.S. sees a quarter with 2% annualized GDP growth. ""July is the earliest we might see sufficiently strong data,"" he said. ""Then September is the next time that they'd be likely to raise the rate.""A 9.03% gain made dedicated short-bias funds the best-performing mutual funds among all U.S. diversified stock funds in January.Click Here To See The Top-Performing Stock And Bond Mutual Fund CategoriesAmong just market capitalization and style categories within U.S. diversifieds, large-cap core funds did best by losing the least, 5.35% in the month. Equity-income funds gave up even less: -3.92%.Top large-cap growth managers included Frank Caruso, whose AB Large Cap Growth Fund (APGAX) fell 6.08% last month.Reflecting the flight to safe havens, commodities precious metals funds paced all sectors, gaining 2.53%.Also reflecting the flight to safety, U.S. Treasury bond funds leapt 3.45% as taxable-bond funds overall lost 0.34% in the month.Latin American funds led foreign-region stock funds by losing the least, -4.30%.Orlando expects the market blahs to continue until about midyear.""I don't think China is going into recession,"" he said. ""Consumers are doing well there, but it will take a couple of quarters for investors to figure that out. Consumers in China will offset weakness in manufacturing by midyear.""By midyear, investors should also see that the U.S. dollar has stopped strengthening altogether, or at least as fast as it has, he adds. ""That dollar stabilization will make it easier for U.S. megacaps to export, which will boost corporate earnings,"" he said.Corporate inventories are already falling, he says. ""So we might see a restocking-cycle kick off in the second half of the year, which would boost manufacturing,"" he said.The Chicago Purchasing Managers Index jumped to 55.6 in January from 42.9 in December, the highest pace of growth in a year. When that barometer tops 50, it's a sign of growth in the manufacturing sector. ""It was in contraction mode the last six months,"" Orlando said.As for politics, only once in the past 75 years has the party in power extended control of the White House to a third straight term. Concern about weak growth in jobs and wages should help swing control of the presidency to Republicans, Orlando says. And that should be good for business interests.With his eyes glued to midyear, Orlando expects that the technology, consumer-discretionary and industrial sectors to lead the breakout. That should benefit tech-hardware makers, chipmakers, automakers, homebuilders and airlines, he says.""Once the Fed starts to tighten again, then financials ought to work better,"" he said.In the meantime, his focus is on lower-beta, higher-dividend stocks. Names that he likes include Exxon Mobile (XOM) and Royal Dutch (RDSA).""In the first half of the year, we have overweights in Europe and Japan vs. the U.S.,"" he said. ""We're overweight in developed foreign markets but underweight in emerging markets.""Jeff Rottinghaus, manager of $1.6 billion T. Rowe Price Growth & Income (PRGIX) and of $203 million Large Cap (TRULX), also expects ""a pretty tough year."" To cope with slower earnings growth, he has beefed up what he calls quality and higher-yield stocks. He's also been looking for early cyclical stocks with sound fundamentals, whose prices have been beaten up.In railroads, he began to buy Kansas City Southern (KSU) late last year. ""In a recovery, it should do well,"" he said. The stock is 32% off its 52-week high. Earnings fell 6% last year and are expected to increase 1% this year and 13% next year.In financials, he likes Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). ""They take advantage of volatility,"" he said. Intercontinental provides a market for derivatives, which many investors use to hedge volatility.He also likes American Tower (AMT) and Crown Castle (CCI), two REITs that own wireless towers. Their long-term contracts with telecom carriers give them ""fantastic recurring revenue businesses that should do well in a more stressed economic environment,"" he said.And in consumer staples he owns CVS (CVS), PepsiCo (PEP) and Philip Morris International (PM).In fixed income, he expects bonds generally to look more appealing if the Fed is forced to pause its rate hikes. In that scenario, bond prices should stabilize rather than decline.Rottinghaus would like to find commodities stocks that have been dragged down by their sector or industry group -- more than their own fundamentals call for. ""Those companies could do well over the next couple of years,"" he said. ""But they're still not there yet.""Image provided by Shutterstock.

396,PM,"As far as most income investors are concerned, the steadier the payout the better. An added bonus: a high dividend growth rate. Here are five Dividend Leaders that offer both, as well as a yield that's well above the S&P 500's average 2.08% payout.All five score a Dividend Stability Factor of 1 on a scale from 0 (most stable) to 99 (most volatile) on a three- to five-year basis.
"
397,PM,"Philip Morris International (PM), which pays a 4.6% annual dividend, tops the list based on that measure. Its long-term dividend growth rate is 11%. The Marlboro maker on Dec. 9 boosted its quarterly payout by 20% to $1.02 a share, or $4.08 for the year.Analysts expect the tobacco firm's earnings to decline for a second straight year in 2015, before rising 5% next year. The stock is below a 90.18 flat-base buy point. It's up about 7% year to date, vs. the S&P 500's 2% loss.Pfizer (PFE), which also made the Friday column featuring high-yield drug stocks, is second, with an annualized payout of 3.7%. Like Philip Morris, its dividend growth rate is 11%. The stock is still below its 10-week and 40-week lines as it consolidates.General Mills (GIS) also has a long-term dividend growth rate of 11%. The cereal maker on Thursday announced a 33% increase in its quarterly payout to 44 cents a share. That works out to $1.76 on a full-year basis, for a 3.1% yield.The company also reported quarterly results that day that missed views on both the top and bottom lines. Shares fell 3% Thursday but found support at the 200-day moving average. The stock, up about 8% year to date, has been consolidating since early August.Coca-Cola (KO), which also pays a 3.1% annual dividend, has a long-term dividend growth rate of 9%. The beverage giant is an S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat — companies that have increased their dividends each year for the past 25 years — and a top Warren Buffett holding. Shares are slightly positive this year.

You see they 'swung to a loss due to restructuring charges'.....(Those losses totaled $500 mil or -0.39 cts/sh), Top line revenues fell 18%  - but once you ignore all of that and add back those nasty 'one time charges' - then they reported 'adjusted earnings' of +0.04 cts/sh......beating the analysts estimates of +0.02 cts/sh - Never mind that those numbers were off by 90% y/y - that is not important......what is important is that they 'beat the analysts predictions'.......  This initially sent the algo's into a frenzy and the stock rallied, fell, rallied and then fell again.....ending that session 0.06 cts lower....So AA is the first one to set the tone....they beat the estimate and they talked up their book - discussing the coming split and the positive guidance and outlook for the new companies........CEO KIaus Kleinfeld - takes to CNBC with Kelly Evans and lays it out -  ""We basically have done everything in our own control, reshaped the business and look where we are, we're still standing and still making a profit,"" — stressing that they have “changed the architecture”….In addition he has a very specific view on China and is sure that the slowdown in demand in commodities from China would not be a negative for Alcoa….saying —

399,PM,"""We are not dependent on China.

This morning AA is trading up 20 cts  or +2.5% - in pre-mkt trading......
"
400,PM,"And that 'rip you face off rally'...well - US futures are now up 15 pts as a new day dawns here in the US......this is NOT unexpected as we are well into oversold territory...........Expect more chatter out of street strategists and Fed officials about the state of the US economy - especially after Klaus made it clear that he does NOT see China as the problem that so many have made it out to be....... We bounced off of S&P 1900 again yesterday to end the day at 1923......we could easily rally to 1950 with no problem and if the algo's really go wild - then a move towards S&P 2000 will be the next stop.....remember - sellers are exhausted - so expect a 'vacuum' if the mood turns.....why would anyone stand in its way?Overnight - Asian mkts continued to struggle - most closing lower - Japan -2.7%, Hong Kong - 0.89%, ASX -0.14%, Kospi - 0.21%...the only surprise?  China - they closed +0.20% - as they defended the Yuan - buying the currency to help support it - sending it up 0.7% vs. the dollar.........Oil and commodity demand though,  (or lack of) still casting a pall over that region of the world.....Oil falling once again edging ever closer to $30/barrel in overnight trading.European mkts this morning are disconnecting from Asia - as the rout in oil and other commodities (copper, silver, gold etc) began to pare the losses seen in Asia - giving investors/traders there a reason to breathe and jump on what is looking to be that snap back rally that we have all been expecting.  FTSE +1.63%,  CAC 40 +2.34%,  DAX+ 2.55%, EUROSTOXX +2.19%, SPAIN +1.66% , and ITALY +1.55%

The S&P and Dow have just entered 'correction territory (-10% +) off their 2014 highs...which is actually surprising considering all of the issues it has been dealing with.....In fact -  the fact that 'the mkt' has not imploded and gone into bear mkt territory (decline of 20% or more)  is a testament to the broader strength of the US equity mkts.... -  in light of weaker oil, stronger dollar, slowing export growth, weaker commodities, more signs of a manufacturing recession — never mind a psychotic China, the coming currency wars,  slowing Europe and slowing emerging mkt countries coupled with major global geo-political issues - including hydrogen bombs being set off by an imbecile dictator -  does suggest that maybe just maybe - investors continue to believe that we are the prettiest girl on the street.....and that the US economy is able to better weather this storm.   Now that being said — there are individual names and sectors that have gotten slaughtered for sure, but on the whole — the mkt could be in a very different place considering the daily beating that it has taken for months now

However, be forewarned - mkts tend to over react once the herd piles on - So, it could get even rougher before this is over.The VIX — otherwise known as the fear index — tells us another story......and while it has not SPIKED higher — it has traded higher -  further suggesting an orderly re-allocation vs. a throw  ""the kitchen sink out panic""…… Yesterday's high of $27.66 feels more like a top and if so - then we may see that reversal soon....

"
409,PM,"As we now know - On Monday - China did end the day a bit lower - 1.5% - but did not IMPLODE, then on Tuesday - a late day surge pushed the Shanghai composite up 2.9% subtly suggesting a bit of 'state intervention' no matter what they say…
"
410,PM,"(Now remember - China is 12 hours ahead of NY - so Sunday night in NY at 9 pm is Monday morning in China at 9 am - Since US markets were closed on Monday - China had two days to trade (Sunday night and Monday night) BEFORE US investors/traders were back at their desks)
"
411,PM,"During Monday night trading (Tuesday morning in China) we saw that late day surge causing global markets to breathe a sigh of relief - the negative news about a fall in both imports and exports did little to damp investor demand….….European markets moved higher and US futures - which had been up all night - continued the push…..On Tuesday - the US market opened up 300 + pts - in one move - and then churned there for most of the day before the late day surge that closed the markets on its highs.
"
412,PM,"Now this is important to understand - trading today is highly automated, investors get to react to global news instantaneously, computers have replaced the human element - so unlike human-based open outcry trading - that would have seen markets open up 10 or 12 pts on the S&P and then move higher during the day, creating the excitement and energy - today when the futures signal a strong (or weak) opening - all the action happens in the early minutes of trade - stocks open up 30 pts and then don't do very much - the move that used to take the whole day - now happens in seconds and then it's over….
"
413,PM,"OK - so now you ask me - then how come two weeks ago when the market opened DOWN 1000 pts we saw that immediate push higher and the increased volatility that whole day and for the days since? Fair question -
"
414,PM,"That move was way overdone (markets were down 6% in the mins after the opening bell rang) - caused by the automation, fragmentation of the markets, volatile ETF products that in a panicked market could not be correctly priced (WARNING- RED FLAG) all resulting in massive dislocation of prices and 'broken technical support' levels that once pierced - caused much more action by traders and long term investors who now took advantage of the stupidity. Those broken technical levels -caused big internal damage to the market. This then raised the level of volatile as long term investors and traders re-evaluated risk, as they searched for opportunities in the wake of the bloodbath. Ask yourself - Who was in control that day? The Buyers or the Sellers? Clearly the buyers - as the sell algos were in panic mode.
"
415,PM,"Now yesterday's surge was not anything to write home about - the market opened up 0.75% (less than 1%) - so that dislocation was not the same. (0.75% vs. 6%). Stocks which now seem to be in the 1920/1970 range were trading smack in the middle at short term resistance of 1950 and did NOT really pierce this short term resistance until very late in the day - which is when you saw the action build.
"
416,PM,"Once the buyers realized that the sellers were being a bit pricier - they started to come after them - challenging the next technical resistance level at 1970. So ask yourself - Who was in control yesterday? The buyers or the sellers? Clearly the Sellers - as the buy algos became a bit anxious to 'scoop up' the bargains created by the panicked sellers from Friday. (It's like a circle really).

All this is all about psychology 101. Remember - the market has suffered some internal damage and needs to back and fill and find support before really moving substantially higher. Today we get the JOLTS job report (Job Openings/Labor Turnover) for any additional hints on the health of the labor market.

Remember - trading on Tuesday saw that market fall 2.4% erasing all gains for the year causing investors to wonder - what's next? In early trading - PM Abe announced that he would seek to lower the corporate tax rate by 3.3% and the rest is history - as they say. Analysts/investors and traders around the globe applauded the PM's attempts at employing FISCAL policy to complement MONETARY policy. Financials and export-oriented stocks led the way - The question now is - Is this move a head fake or does it have legs?

420,PM,"China rallied another 2.3% as speculation continues about more gov't support in the form of - guess what? FISCAL policy. Hong Kong and Australia followed in kind and ended the day up 4% and 2% respectively.

421,PM,"In Europe - the opening bell saw those markets all surge in the early mins of trade. Positive economic news out of Germany - both imports and exports suggest that the German economy is healthy and global demand for German goods is strong coupled that with the FISCAL policy initiatives out of Asia and you see investors cheering. The sense is that the broader macroeconomic environment in Europe is on solid ground and that Mario Draghi and the ECB are in control.

All this is all about psychology 101. Remember - the market has suffered some internal damage and needs to back and fill and find support before really moving substantially higher. Today we get the JOLTS job report (Job Openings/Labor Turnover) for any additional hints on the health of the labor market. Expect to continue to hear more about next week's Fed meeting and 'The Policy Decision 2015!' (I mean it's almost like the Presidential race coverage - ""Race for the White House -Election 2016"")Look for the market to run into resistance at the 1990 level but find short term support at 1970 and larger support at 1950.In Asian trading - investors/traders went wild for stocks. Japan awakens and surges 7.7% or 1300 pts as investors went on a shopping spree. Remember - trading on Tuesday saw that market fall 2.4% erasing all gains for the year causing investors to wonder - what's next? In early trading - PM Abe announced that he would seek to lower the corporate tax rate by 3.3% and the rest is history - as they say. Analysts/investors and traders around the globe applauded the PM's attempts at employing FISCAL policy to complement MONETARY policy. Financials and export-oriented stocks led the way - The question now is - Is this move a head fake or does it have legs?China rallied another 2.3% as speculation continues about more gov't support in the form of - guess what? FISCAL policy. Hong Kong and Australia followed in kind and ended the day up 4% and 2% respectively.In Europe - the opening bell saw those markets all surge in the early mins of trade. Positive economic news out of Germany - both imports and exports suggest that the German economy is healthy and global demand for German goods is strong coupled that with the FISCAL policy initiatives out of Asia and you see investors cheering. The sense is that the broader macroeconomic environment in Europe is on solid ground and that Mario Draghi and the ECB are in control. FTSE +1.8%, CAC 40 +2.4%, DAX +1.7%, EUROSTOXX+2.3%, SPAIN +2.4% and ITALY +1.8%.Take good care -KpKenny Polcari is Vice President and director of NYSE Floor Operations on behalf of O'Neil Securities, Inc., a sister company of Investor's Business Daily.

435,PM,"Best ETFs 2015 August Performance
"
436,PM,"Dividend ETFs are charging ahead in the performance stakes, and little wonder. Amid China-induced choppiness, these funds brought a measure of reassurance to frayed nerves. They're packed with well-established companies, often with a value tilt.
"
437,PM,"PowerShares S&P 500 High Dividend  (SPHD) — a top-performing ETF in the past month with a 2.6% gain — holds IBD Dividend Leaders AT&T (T), Philip Morris (PM) and Altria Group (MO) in its 50-stock portfolio.
"
438,PM,"Investors sought out value stocks amid concerns about global growth, both at home and abroad. First Trust Dorsey Wright Focus 5 (FV) shrank 2% in the past month, as decidedly mixed earnings weighed on investors. Year to date, growth-focused exchange traded funds are still the clear winners. FV, a $4.34 billion ETF with a midcap growth skew, is up 13% year to date.

440,PM,"What are money managers' ETF picks for successful investing in the year ahead? Here's the scoop:
"
441,PM," Luke Nagell, associate portfolio manager at Denver-based Weatherstone Capital Management; $750 million in assets under management:
"
442,PM,"Our outlook for the second half of 2015 remains cautious due to a slowing in global economic growth and subdued commodity prices coupled with rising bond yields.
"
443,PM,"Vanguard Health Care (VHT). The ETF provides a good broad-based exposure to the health care industry ranging from health care equipment to pharmaceuticals. The health care sector continues to exhibit strong earnings and revenue growth, and we expect this trend to continue for the rest of the year. Additionally, the pickup in M&A activity among health care companies is a positive sign, particularly within the pharmaceutical sector. VHT provides good exposure to this sector.
"
444,PM,"Market Vectors Pharmaceutical (PPH). To access the pharmaceutical sector directly, we recommend this ETF. In addition to pharmaceutical companies leading the way in M&A activity, the sector has exhibited positive signals on a longer-term momentum basis.
"
445,PM,"PowerShares Preferred (PGX). This ETF provides a good source of income during this period of volatility within the fixed-income space. It is made up of preferred securities, primarily within the financial sector. For investors searching for income and who would like to stay more defensive, this is a good way to generate a reasonable rate of return without taking on the additional risk inherent within the common stock market. The 6% yield is attractive on an absolute basis and financial firms' strong balance sheets should continue to make this a stable source of income.
"
446,PM," Masood Vojdani, founder and CEO of MV Financial in Bethesda, Md.:
"
447,PM,"We favor U.S. exposure as the current risk environment is tilted towards non-U.S. threats, particularly in developed Europe and China.
"
448,PM,"IShares Core S&P 500 (IVV). An S&P 500 exposure would be a good portfolio anchor in this environment. IVV is one of the most liquid ETFs currently traded and is allocated across all 10 GICS sectors. IVV has a 0.07% expense ratio.
"
449,PM,"IShares Core S&P SmallCap (IJR). There continues to be growth opportunities in the U.S. that small companies will partake in. A broad small-cap exposure without a particular style tilt can further diversify core U.S. equity holdings as we move through the second half of the year. IJR has a net expense ratio of 0.12%.
"
450,PM,"Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) and Financials Select Sector SPDR (XLF). We believe the health care sector will benefit from robust earnings growth and M&A activity among providers.
"
451,PM,"The sector also continues to benefit from the Affordable Care Act, which helped contribute to it being the second best sector last year with a return of 25.34%.
"
452,PM,"The financial sector is well positioned with the Federal Reserve's rate hike looming. This will work to the advantage of banks and insurance companies, which tend to benefit from rising rates.

454,PM,"History has a way of repeating itself....How many times do we need to hear this phrase? The phrase refers to the fact that we are creatures of habit and in short - events that have happened in past are bound to repeat themselves - because in the end - do we ever really learn? Think 1929, 1987, 1999, 2007-20012, and now 2015.....What do these years have in common? Stock mkt CRASHES - and if you look at each one - the common theme that runs through all of them is eerily similar.
"
455,PM,"No matter what - the stock mkt crashes were (are) the result of a variety of economic factors (domestic & international)/structural (monetary and fiscal policy) and technological imbalances coupled with raging speculation, and new and exciting ""derivative products"" that promised to save everyone....How's that working for you?
"
456,PM,"Recall the ""roaring Twenties"" (that is the 1920's) it was a time of wealth and excess.....Easy credit, high levels of debt, slowing economy and other signs of economic fissures, speculation and high margin debt all contributing factors to the crash of '29.
"
457,PM,"In 1987 - after the roaring bull mkt that began in the summer of '82 - the mkt crashed - falling 22.5% in 6 hrs.....losing over $500 bil in one day..... The move higher was fueled by falling interest rates, hostile takeovers, leveraged buyouts and a surge in junk bonds. (Junk bonds, now known as 'High Yield' are bonds that pay high interest rates due to their HIGH RISK - you see - it is the risk/reward argument)....
"
458,PM,"Portfolio Insurance (that first iteration of the coming derivative boom) that only accelerated the decline.....You see - in addition to the economic issues and structural imbalances created as a result - Portfolio Insurance was the new 'savior'. Global asset managers all bought into it - using this 'new brain child' as a way to protect against losses....(Portfolio insurance is a hedging strategy that uses stock index futures to cushion equity portfolios against broad stock market declines). As interest rates rose, many institutional money managers tried using this insurance to hedge their portfolios at the same time. As we moved through the week of Oct 14th, 1987 - the mkt got weaker and came under pressure closing on the lows on Friday Oct 16th in what was an unusually heavy volume day. On October 19th 1987, this portfolio insurance product issued a sell signal and any institution that had bought it was told to sell X% of their portfolio in order to protect it.....
"
459,PM,"The signal was issued on Sunday night - just as Asian mkts were opening...and the bloodbath began....selling beget more selling and the bottom fell out of global mkts....stock index futures mkts was flooded with billions of dollars worth of sell orders and within minutes, both the futures and stock markets began to crash and as the sun set on Asia it rose in Europe and the process continued, the bloodletting unstoppable.....and then the sun rose over the Atlantic to warm the shores of the US and the perfect storm blew the windows out......by 4 pm global mkts had suffered inconceivable losses.....as analysts/strategists and everyone else tried to put it in perspective.....The FED came to the rescue and intervened trying to prevent a repeat performance. Remarkably - the mkt recovered fairly quickly and moved higher until the fall of 1999 and the Dot Com Crash.
"
460,PM,"E-commerce and Dot Com - that was the new gold rush...any company that had either in its name helped to created another historic bubble...the Internet - was going to be the game changer. You see - the period from like 1993 - 2000 was marked by the explosion of the Internet and the founding and spectacular failures of these new companies - Investment banks hungry for product brought these companies public - selling the story of how the world was different now. Companies with zero history, revenues or any chance of ever making any revenues were brought to the mkt - investors could not get enough - IPO's and pricing boggled the mind - opening trades left you speechless and technology allowed anyone with a computer to play. Speculation and the herd mentality once again took hold. People margined their houses and their first-borns....a new type of investing was born - what came to be known as 'prefix investing' - And then it happened.....the Nasdaq peaked at 5132 on March 10, 200 only to find its low months later after losing better than 50%.
"
461,PM,"Then came the housing boom - fueled in part by failed fiscal policies initiated under Pres Clinton and Fed Chairman Greenspan.....No income verifications loans, teaser rates, interest only loans anything to get 'every American' into a home of their own....investment banks packaged these 'loans' and securitized them and sold them to global investors as the new product! Ratings agencies marked them all AAA+++ rated....never really knowing what was in them. The gov't encouraged Wall St to play nice and help make these products successful. The global economy was humming along, global investors pumping all kinds of money into these products.....then new derivative products came to the mkts.....CDS's ABS' etc....it all worked until it didn't. The problem was that no one on Wall St - ran a model that provided for a global slowdown - no one knew what would happen if the music stopped...and the music stopped in March of 2008....and the world collapsed - everyone pointed the finger at someone else - proclaiming that it was 'not our fault'...it was lack of regulation or lack of insight, or just plain greed.
"
462,PM,"The FED and every other central bank came to the rescue - artificially stimulating mkts.....many screamed about this intervention - but at the time it was the right thing to do, but then, as usual, it went on to long. Along the way - the mkts recovered, people started to feel good again....new products were designed - ETF's (exchange traded funds) gave the investor the sense that we somehow found the holy grail. You could now invest in one product and get instant access to a range of investment options....Sectors, developed countries, emerging countries, frontier countries, bonds, high yield, low yield, average yield...... different strategies, (long, short, super long and super short - leveraged products) built using 'synthetic equity'...... (a financial instrument that is artificially created) promising to offer all of the benefits of stocks (or bonds) while not being stocks (or bonds). Trade them easily...get in and get out with one product.....sounds too good to be true - right?
"
463,PM,"Well it is....because when the global economy begins to convulse you can't really trade this crap as easily as you were told. And when panic ensues - and those mkts freeze - what happens - asset managers end up selling what they can vs. what they should....and this causes stocks to crash...because - the US capital mkts are the most liquid and deepest and when push comes to shove - you can always raise money in the developed global mkts.
"
464,PM,"And today - what do we have - completely manipulated mkts - fueled by central banks around the world as elected officials shirked their responsibilities and failed to enact fiscal policy stimulus....policies that would have gone much farther in helping to solve so many issues. But that was not to happen....and today we find ourselves in another mess.....Global mkts coming unglued, monetary policies failing to make a difference after trillions of dollars and years of artificial stimulation. In fact - this global meltdown is NOT about the FED and a 25 bps hike in US rates at all. It is a realization that there has been a massive failure of leadership, a massive failure of real fiscal policy initiatives.... Couple that with unreal expectations of major global trading partners and you have a real mess.
"
465,PM,"Overnight - Asian mkts led the crash - as they did in 1987....China losing 8.5% other Asian mkts following in kind Hong Kong -5.1%, ASX -4%, Japan -4.6%.... The reason...... a complete lack of any commentary or real economic data supporting any kind of growth from Chinese authorities, which is only re-enforcing the idea they ARE NOT in control. .As the Sun rises over Europe those mkts getting drawn in - (recall 1987)....FTSE -3%, DAX -3.29%, CAC 40 - 3.4%, SPAIN -3.25%, EUROSTOXX - 3.2%.....as the blood bath continues.....
"
466,PM,"And now the sun is again washing the shores of America....US futures are showing down 47 pts...or 2.3%....as the day begins.....there is no rhyme or reason - no explanation for what will happen today....You can feel the 'panic mentality"" in the air....This just has to play out for now.....no commentary from Janet or anyone else will stop this train today.....the mood is set and the action will happen as investors try to make sense out of this mess. We have broken so many tech levels....there has been a lot of damage done to global mkts.....many will speculate on levels that should hold and support - but like a massive hurricane - we won't know the extent of the damage until global mkts can calm down. For now - strap in.

The reason...... a complete lack of any commentary or real economic data supporting any kind of growth from Chinese authorities, which is only re-enforcing the idea they ARE NOT in control. .As the Sun rises over Europe those mkts getting drawn in - (recall 1987)....FTSE -3%, DAX -3.29%, CAC 40 - 3.4%, SPAIN -3.25%, EUROSTOXX - 3.2%.....as the blood bath continues.....And now the sun is again washing the shores of America....US futures are showing down 47 pts...or 2.3%....as the day begins.....there is no rhyme or reason - no explanation for what will happen today....You can feel the 'panic mentality"" in the air....This just has to play out for now.....no commentary from Janet or anyone else will stop this train today.....the mood is set and the action will happen as investors try to make sense out of this mess. We have broken so many tech levels....there has been a lot of damage done to global mkts.....many will speculate on levels that should hold and support - but like a massive hurricane - we won't know the extent of the damage until global mkts can calm down. For now - strap in.Take good careKpKenny Polcari is Vice President and director of NYSE Floor Operations on behalf of O'Neil Securities, Inc., a sister company of Investor's Business Daily.

470,PM,"Does it hurt to accuse someone of being a Nazi or a racist who is neither of those?  How about calling someone those vile terms when he has spent his life supporting Jewish and black causes?Over the weekend, the Democratic Party's Deputy Chair, Keith Ellison, put out an email claiming: ""even with Steve Bannon gone, Donald Trump's inner circle still includes prominent white nationalists and enablers of white supremacy.""  Ellison labeled one senior advisor as ""a member of a Hungarian Nazi organization.""On Saturday, Howard Dean, the former chair of the Democratic Party, said: ""If you want to vote for a racist in the White House, then you better vote for Republicans.""  Other Democrats keep echoing those charges.The venerable Foreign Policy magazine ran an article the end of last week asserting: ""For the first time in our history, a Nazi sympathizer occupies the Oval Office.""  Foreign newspapers like The Independent or The Guardian have headlines: ""Donald Trump's Defense of neo-Nazi"" and ""The president of the United States is now a neo-Nazi sympathizer.""Sunday morning's national television talk shows, such as ""Meet the Press,"" only could find Republicans who were critical of Trump.If you believe what the media are telling you, we now supposedly have the first Nazi sympathizer as president, but who is also the first president to have an orthodox Jewish daughter and grandkids.  A president who pledges unwavering support for Israel and who has been a friend of the current Israeli PM for decades. Nazis are socialists, yet Trump supports less regulation and lower taxes.Before running for the president as a Republican, Democrats had wonderful things to say about Donald Trump regarding race.  In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Jesse Jackson frequently praised Trump for his ""lifetime"" of helping the black community.Days before Democratic Party's Deputy Chair Keith Ellison sent out his weekend email, the experts interviewed by the liberal PolitiFact had already shot down those claims. ""Are any of these four officials white nationalists? When we asked this question of several independent experts, they all agreed that none of the four were white nationalists themselves.""So why do people believe that Trump is a Nazi or white supremacist sympathizer? ABC News' coverage was all too typical: ""Trump quickly blamed both sides for the conflict, adding that there were 'very fine people' among both the protesters — which included white supremacists and white nationalists — and the counter protesters.""But Trump never came close to saying that any white supremacists or neo-Nazis were ""very fine people.""  At his press conference last Tuesday, Trump clearly made this point several times.  For example, ""And you had people, and I'm not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists, because they should be condemned totally. But you had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists.""When pressed by a reporter if Trump was saying that the press was threatening white nationalists unfairly Trump emphatically said: ""No, no."" And Trump again referred to the ""bad people — neo-Nazis, white nationalists.""People were also angry at Trump's initial statement on Saturday immediately after the news broke. But compare that to the praise for a joint statement that former presidents George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush put out last Wednesday. The Bushes wrote: ""America must always reject racial bigotry, anti-Semitism, and hatred in all forms.""But how is that different from Trump's universally denounced statement four days earlier: ""We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides. ... It has no place in America.""Is the only difference that the Bushes condemned bigotry ""in all forms,"" whereas Trump condemned it ""on many sides""?In fact, Trump was right.  The people on the left, such as Antifa and Black Lives Matter, where not only as racist and hateful, but even the liberal and left-wing media from The Nation to BuzzFeed News to the Los Angeles Times have documented that they also instigated violence in Charlottesville.As one University of Virginia student told the New York Times before the car attack: ""I was on Market Street around 11:30 a.m. when a counter-protester ripped a newspaper stand off the sidewalk and threw it at alt-right protesters. I saw another man from the white supremacist crowd being chased and beaten. People were hitting him with their signs. A much older man, also with the alt-right group, got pushed to the ground in the commotion. Someone raised a stick over his head and beat the man . . . .""The media's false statements are out of control, distorting what President Trump said, and the Democratic Party leaders have pushed these claims even further.Racism is vile and must be condemned.  But lying is also wrong, especially about such serious charges.

472,PM,"Some growth stocks with top-notch IBD ratings bucked the mild decline by major indexes Wednesday and summoned enough power to stage new breakouts.XThe Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrials all showed losses from 0.2% to 0.4% in afternoon trading. Volume is running lower on the Nasdaq vs. the same time on Tuesday.As noted in an earlier Stock Market Today column, airline stocks tanked amid concern over a potential rise in seat capacity in the U.S. market. The Dow Jones transports fell nearly 1.3%.Apple (AAPL) is trying to buck the market on a down day as shares briefly edged up around 0.4% to 160.38, extending its gain from a 156.75 entry in a solid 2-1/2-month flat base. Around 1:15 pm ET, however, shares receded to a nearly break-even level.Apple's Relative Price Strength Rating now reflects superior performance at a 91 out of a maximum 99. A 91 means that Apple has outrun 91% of all stocks in IBD's database over the past 12 months.Also seen in IBD Stock Checkup, Apple scores a much improved 94 Composite Rating, which takes into account a company's earnings, sales, profit margins, return on equity, level of institutional buying, and recent stock price action. When Apple continued its major turnaround with a breakout on Jan. 6-9, the Composite score was a paltry 51, and Apple's Telecom sector ranked a middling 14th out of 33 sectors ranked daily by IBD within its stock research tables.In the latest IBD Weekly print edition, Telecom ranked 13th and shows a year-to-date gain of 12.8%, better than the S&P 500's 9.3% advance.Some small- and midcap growth plays are thriving. MiMedx (MDXG) slipped as much as 4.5% in morning trading, but that actually offered a chance for new buyers to scoop shares closer to a 16.30 buy point. Shares then rebounded off the day's low of 16.55 to cut the loss to less than 2% at 17.04.As noted in IBD Leaderboard, the small-cap play ($1.9 billion market value) in skin grafts broke out of a seven-week base at 16.30 on Aug. 15. Notice on a daily chart how volume was powerful that session as nearly 4.5 million shares exchanged hands that day, 271% more than its 50-day average.The 5% proper buy zone from 16.30 goes up to 17.12.Earnings have shown an accelerating trend at MiMedx; in Q3 of 2016, profit came in flat at 6 cents a share, but have climbed 17%, 75% and 40% in the prior three quarters. Keep in mind that the EPS figures alone are still in the single-digit range, which mathematically makes it easier for any company to post big earnings increases. However, the Marietta, Ga., firm also shows beefy top-line growth. Sales rose 31%, 35%, 36% and 33% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters.MiMedx develops and markets regenerative biomaterial products and bioimplants that are processed from human amniotic membrane and other birth tissues, and from human skin and bone.Paycom Software (PAYC) rose for a third straight session, edging slightly up to 73.87 in heavy volume, climbing past a 73.71 flat-base buy point. The HR functions support expert rallied 44% from a prior Feb. 9 breakout at 51.07.Paycom shows an excellent 95 RS Rating, and its relative strength line is moving into new high ground, meaning the stock is outperforming the S&P 500.IBD's TAKE: See the RS line, painted in blue, in every IBD daily and weekly chart, accessible via the Research section on the home page of Investors.com. The best growth stocks tend to show an RS line jumping into new high ground as they break out of well-formed bases including the cup with handle, flat base, and double bottom.Essent Group (ESNT), a major player in the private mortgage insurance market, flew 3% higher to 39.65 despite a sour U.S. new-home sales report for July. The Bermuda-based firm and former Sector Leader member has had a rocky few weeks since surpassing a 39.60 buy point in a flat base.The flat base, which requires a decline be no more than 15% from the highest intraday price to the lowest intraday price within the base, began in April and wrapped up at the start of July.Three weeks ago, Essent posted strong Q2 results (EPS up 35% to 77 cents, revenue up 27% to a record $137.6 million). But watch for the potential for a cooling trend. Q3 profit is seen rising 22% to 79 cents a share; the average EPS gain over the past eight quarters is 42%.New-home sales came in at an annualized rate of 571,000, well below the Econoday consensus view of 610,000.RELATED:3 Reasons Why Apple Could Rally Another 20%When Did Apple Stage A Follow-On Buy Point Below 156.75?Investor's Corner: Do You Know What The C In ""CAN SLIM"" Stands For?

473,PM,"Tobacco companies such as Altria Group (MO) and British American Tobacco (BTI) plunged Friday after the Food and Drug Adminstration outlined a comprehensive regulatory plan that includes lowering nicotine in cigarettes to non-addictive levels.XThat could pose a fundamental challenge to the cigarette industry, which has survived massive settlements and steadily declining volume sales.Shares of Altria, maker of Marlboro, Virginia Slims and Parliament brands, crashed 9.5% to 66.94 after falling as low as 60.01, a 15-month low. British American Tobacco, which recently bought out the rest of Reynolds American, dived 7% to 64.93, falling intraday to 60.15, its lowest level since January.However, one cigarette maker fared reasonably well. Peer Philip Morris International (PM), which sells Marlboro and other brands outside the U.S., rose 0.3% to 118.51 on the stock market today, rebounding from session lows for 109.31. Philip Morris presumably would not be directly affected by FDA rulings on cigarette sales in the U.S.Vector Group (VGR) lost 4.7% and Universal Corp. (UVV) dipped 0.85%.""The overwhelming amount of death and disease attributable to tobacco is caused by addiction to cigarettes -- the only legal consumer product that, when used as intended, will kill half of all long-term users,"" FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a statement from the agency.""The FDA plans to begin a public dialogue about lowering nicotine levels in combustible cigarettes to non-addictive levels through achievable product standards,"" the agency said.The FDA gained regulatory powers over the tobacco industry in 2009.Altria, Philip Morris and British American Tobacco are big dividend payers, so their stocks have been favorites for income investors for decades. Phillip Morris International has a 3.5% dividend yield, with Altria at 3.3%. British American has a 3.2% dividend yield.Cigarette makers are already dealing with steadily declining volumes in the U.S., offsetting that with higher prices. But non-addictive cigarettes would be a huge blow to the industry.RELATED:Phillip Morris Misses On Earnings, Slashes GuidanceThe Income Investor

474,PM,"Major indexes held modest gains in afternoon trading Friday, following reports that the ultra-right-leaning White House advisor Steve Bannon will step down. Meanwhile, some leading growth stocks regained a bit of their luster, including Apple (AAPL), Applied Materials (AMAT) and Broadcom (AVGO), all of which rose 1% to 2% or more and are outperforming the key benchmarks.X The key averages all look poised to stage minor weekly losses. Going forward, watch to see if the Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrials find buying support near their respective 50-day moving averages.The Dow industrials' bounce off its 50-day line earlier on Friday was a bullish move. However, as noted in the latest Big Picture column, institutions have shown more willingness to sell stocks and take profits amid Year 10 of the secular bull market that began with a solid follow-through on March 2009.The S&P 500 bottomed out near 667 back then and has since rallied nearly 265% to 2432, excluding dividends.From the October 2002 bottom near 768 at the end of the dot-com crash to its October 2007 peak at 1576, the S&P 500 rallied 105% over a five-year span.Some market observers openly wondered whether President Trump's controversial reaction following the death of an anti-Neo Nazi and anti-KKK protester and injuries among others in Charlottesville, Va., last weekend would make it even harder for the White House to pass meaningful legislation that could help further boost the U.S economy.Apple, as noted in an earlier Stock Market Today column, is showing at least three factors that point to the possibility for more gains. It rose to an intraday high of 159.50, up less than 2% from a new flat-base breakout point of 156.75. Shares are up 37% since Jan. 1, and the overall action remains solid ever since the iPhone and iMac giant burst out of a first-stage cup with handle on Jan. 6-9 at 118.12.The Nasdaq composite led the rebound, up nearly 0.4% before the gains faded some as of 2:15 pm ET. The S&P 500 gained a little more than 0.1% while the Dow Jones industrials fought to stay above break-even.Volume was running sharply higher than at the same time on Thursday, due in part to the expiration of equity and index options.Apple continues to harbor improving SmartSelect ratings, as seen in its Stock Checkup.  The Composite Rating, which offers an at-a-glance view of a stock's IBD ratings plus an assessment of recent stock price action, is now a buoyant 95 out of a maximum 99. When Apple broke out in January, the Composite was well below 90. An improving Composite Rating is highly favorable.Notice, too, in the Stock Checkup that Apple has now posted four quarters in a row of accelerating earnings per share growth. Fund managers' antennae go way up when a company is seeing faster rises in earnings per share than in prior quarters or years. Apple's profit has grown 2%, 11% and 18% vs. year-ago levels in the past three quarters as revenue improved. Plus, with the likelihood that many iPhone users will likely consider upgrading to a new phone when the 10th anniversary iPhone comes out later this year, the prospects of continued double-digit EPS growth appear to be gaining traction.For FY 2018, which ends in September of 2018, Apple is expected to grow earnings by 20% to $10.78 a share. Apple hasn't seen double-digit annual earnings gains since FY 2015 ($9.22, up 43%).Applied Materials, which posted fine quarterly results late Thursday (EPS up 72%, revenue up 33%), is up more than 3% to 44.49 and is trying to reclaim its 50-day moving average. Volume is running stronger than normal, a sign that mutual funds, hedge funds, insurers, banks and the like are eager to accumulate shares.A further advance would be bullish in the fact that the semiconductor equipment titan is forming a new base that features upside resistance near 47-48.Applied's semiconductor equipment industry group has fallen a bit in recent months yet remains in the top 40 among the 197 industries tracked each day by IBD, at No. 37 through Friday afternoon. (Go to Stock Lists on the home page of Investors.com and click on Data Tables to see the entire rankings.)The Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless group is ranked 67th, down from 45th six weeks ago.Solid and increasing institutional sponsorship is a hallmark of a stock that shows a big long-term rise, and Applied is showing the right stuff. For instance, highly regarded fund Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) has been a shareholder for each of the past five quarters. A total 1,085 mutual and hedge funds owned shares in Applied as of the end of the second quarter, up from 913 funds at the end of Q3 2016.Broadcom, a big play in chips for cell phones, cars, the data center and other internet-enabled gear, has been trading in a relatively tight range between 227 and 256 for several months.Earnings in the global chip designer and manufacturer are seen rising 39% to $4.03 a share in the July-ended fiscal third quarter.In other financial markets, WTI crude oil futures ramped up more than 2.8% to $48.42 a barrel. Gold futures on the Comex backed off from session highs of $1,306 a troy ounce and were nearly flat at $1,291. Gold reached the highest level since early November, as investors sought to move some cash into safe havens amid another series of ISIS-sponsored terrorism and turmoil in the White House.The U.S. dollar gained against both the euro and the yen. The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury bond edged back up a bit to 2.20%, still well below this year's high of 2.62%.RELATED:When Will The Stock Market Really Top?

476,PM,"Stocks took a beating for the first week in 2016…. — and it does not look like it is abating anytime soon… and on Friday — despite stronger futures, a 'decent - albeit surprising' monthly jobs report and relative calm in Asia, both the European mkts and the US mkt failed to sustain any positive momentum.  Investors were unimpressed by the shenanigans in China — as Chinese authorities tried to support the mkt.   Going into the close, the mkts came under renewed selling pressure ahead of the weekend and ending just off the worst levels of the day. The Dow gave back 168 points (-1.0%), Nasdaq slid 46 points (-1%) and the S&P tumbled 21 points (-1.1%) and the small cap Russell 2000 ended the day down 1.72%.   So for the week — the Dow lost 6.2%, the S&P lost 6% and Nasdaq gave back 7.3%....

477,PM,"Oil — under more pressure ended the week lower (- 15%) taking the energy sector down 7% and as we speak — oil is trading at $32.56 - down another 1.8% ……only cts away from the key level at $32.40 - but that is deceiving - because overnight OIL broke down and thru the all important $32.40 support - putting in a new 8 yr low at $32.24/barrel..... That being said - you can see it struggling to hold in right here......another test at support and we could see it break, falling into the high $20's.   Gold on the other hand is benefitting from all of this turmoil….…..it saw its price rise by 3.5% for the week  and this morning it is up once again at $1103 on its way to challenging resistance at $1110/oz.  Now back to China......If you listen closely - you can hear Asian investors singing the Englebert Humperdink  1967 classic - ""Please Release Me""....“Please release me, let me go, For I don’t love you anymore.  To live a lie, would be a sin, release me and let me love again……I have found a new love, dear.  And I will always want her near.  Her lips are warm where yours are cold, release me darling, let me go…..”  As the Asian mkts opened last night - investors began to ""let go"" again.......…Asian mkts continued to crash all opening lower….— Japan -0.69%, Australia -2%, Kospi (Korea) -1% , Hong Kong — 2%, China, -2.14%,  as the concern over China and lower commodity prices continue to permeate the psyche.  At the end of the day - the picture was not any brighter.....Japan - 0.39%, Hong Kong - 2.7%, China -5.5%, Kospi -1.19% and ASX -1.17%.

478,PM,"Taimur Baig — Chief Asian Economist for Deutsche Bank Research made this observation: ""The key risk is China, where fears of continued economic slide are causing capital outflows, exchange rate depreciation, asset market selloff, and policy dilemmas.""And continued difficulty in the region will ultimately hurt sentiment across the Asian region — resulting in possible deflation, a credit crunch and monetary policy dilemmas.  And if that is not enough — the threat of more China Yuan devaluations is raising the pressure on the ‘Asian Tigers’ (South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore) to follow suit….. And if this come to pass — then strap in — because it will clearly dampen global economic growth causing investors to re-price risk again (can you say lower prices?) …..and recall that global growth that has ALREADY been revised lower by both the IMF (International Monetary Fund) and the World Bank.  Bottom line is that there is now a realization that global equity mkts may be a bit overpriced — after years of all that Kool Aid…..And like many have argued — the effectiveness of all of this massive liquidity has just about reached its limit and with the FED now beginning to tighten -  investors can no longer base their investment assumptions on continued liquidity- but must now base it on fundamentals….but don’t worry — the Great  Wizard of Oz tells us…… “Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain…”  It’s all good.  And if oil does not find support right here then look for a swift move into the high $20’s.  — which will surely put more pressure on stocks.  Never mind that earnings are once again at hand and that is also causing some angst resulting in a ‘shoot first, ask questions later’ mentality.   Last week also saw the all important NFP (Non Farm Payroll) report....and to everyone's' surprise - the gov't reported a surge in job creation - wink, wink... The Labor Dept said non-farm payroll employment climbed by 292,000 jobs in December compared to economist estimates for an increase of about 200,000 jobs while the unemployment rate held steady  at 5%.    But is this read on unemployment really just a false indicator?   There are a record number of individuals (100 mil)  who remain permanently unemployed, having given up trying to find a job after so many months of failure.  So - fortunately, for the gov't - these unemployed people are no longer counted in the “official” unemployment rate.  And the broader U6 - Underemployment/Unemployment rate remains stubbornly high at 9.9% - which is a better indicator of reality.   One more thing - what this monthly report does not highlight are the number of job losses that occurred during the month......the monthly job loss rate for 2015 averaged about 43k losses according to Challenger, Gray and Christmas - but why emphasize any of the negatives - it just un-American.....So if you net out the avg monthly gains of +225k and the avg monthly loss of 43k - we have an avg monthly gain of +183k....well below what we really need to achieve 'escape velocity'.   I'm just sayin......

That being said - you can see it struggling to hold in right here......another test at support and we could see it break, falling into the high $20's.   Gold on the other hand is benefitting from all of this turmoil….…..it saw its price rise by 3.5% for the week  and this morning it is up once again at $1103 on its way to challenging resistance at $1110/oz.  Now back to China......If you listen closely - you can hear Asian investors singing the Englebert Humperdink  1967 classic - ""Please Release Me""....“Please release me, let me go, For I don’t love you anymore.  To live a lie, would be a sin, release me and let me love again……I have found a new love, dear.  And I will always want her near.  Her lips are warm where yours are cold, release me darling, let me go…..”  As the Asian mkts opened last night - investors began to ""let go"" again.......…Asian mkts continued to crash all opening lower….— Japan -0.69%, Australia -2%, Kospi (Korea) -1% , Hong Kong — 2%, China, -2.14%,  as the concern over China and lower commodity prices continue to permeate the psyche.  At the end of the day - the picture was not any brighter.....Japan - 0.39%, Hong Kong - 2.7%, China -5.5%, Kospi -1.19% and ASX -1.17%.Taimur Baig — Chief Asian Economist for Deutsche Bank Research made this observation: ""The key risk is China, where fears of continued economic slide are causing capital outflows, exchange rate depreciation, asset market selloff, and policy dilemmas.""And continued difficulty in the region will ultimately hurt sentiment across the Asian region — resulting in possible deflation, a credit crunch and monetary policy dilemmas.  And if that is not enough — the threat of more China Yuan devaluations is raising the pressure on the ‘Asian Tigers’ (South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore) to follow suit….. And if this come to pass — then strap in — because it will clearly dampen global economic growth causing investors to re-price risk again (can you say lower prices?) …..and recall that global growth that has ALREADY been revised lower by both the IMF (International Monetary Fund) and the World Bank.  Bottom line is that there is now a realization that global equity mkts may be a bit overpriced — after years of all that Kool Aid…..And like many have argued — the effectiveness of all of this massive liquidity has just about reached its limit and with the FED now beginning to tighten -  investors can no longer base their investment assumptions on continued liquidity- but must now base it on fundamentals….but don’t worry — the Great  Wizard of Oz tells us…… “Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain…”  It’s all good.  And if oil does not find support right here then look for a swift move into the high $20’s.  — which will surely put more pressure on stocks.  Never mind that earnings are once again at hand and that is also causing some angst resulting in a ‘shoot first, ask questions later’ mentality.   Last week also saw the all important NFP (Non Farm Payroll) report....and to everyone's' surprise - the gov't reported a surge in job creation - wink, wink... The Labor Dept said non-farm payroll employment climbed by 292,000 jobs in December compared to economist estimates for an increase of about 200,000 jobs while the unemployment rate held steady  at 5%.    But is this read on unemployment really just a false indicator?   There are a record number of individuals (100 mil)  who remain permanently unemployed, having given up trying to find a job after so many months of failure.  So - fortunately, for the gov't - these unemployed people are no longer counted in the “official” unemployment rate.  And the broader U6 - Underemployment/Unemployment rate remains stubbornly high at 9.9% - which is a better indicator of reality.   One more thing - what this monthly report does not highlight are the number of job losses that occurred during the month......the monthly job loss rate for 2015 averaged about 43k losses according to Challenger, Gray and Christmas - but why emphasize any of the negatives - it just un-American.....So if you net out the avg monthly gains of +225k and the avg monthly loss of 43k - we have an avg monthly gain of +183k....well below what we really need to achieve 'escape velocity'.   I'm just sayin......Eco data this week is light.....until we get to Friday.....Retails sales are expected to show a decline of 0.1%, ex autos and gas then a gain of 0.3%.....Empire State Manf of -4, Industrial Production of -0.2% and Capacity Util of 76.8%.  (Capacity Util is a measure of the rate of potential output expressed as a percentage)   - so at this rate we are running at 3/4 of full capacity - which leaves plenty of room to grow before we really start seeing pressure on prices.....You need to start to worry when Capacity Util approaches the high 80's....so we've got time......Earning begin this week...and as usual - Alcoa (AA) kicks it off tonight after the bell....but all eyes are focused on Thursday - when JP Morgan  (JPM) - the first DOW stock reports.......European mkts - were all higher in early morning trade, but have since given up some of those gains as they struggle to stay green.  As noted - oil under pressure as it tries to hold onto the all important $32.40 level.  And while many think that the mkts reaction to events in China are overblown - it is what it is and until investors feel comfortable - expect the volatility to continue.  FTSE flat,  CAC 40 +0.39%,  DAX+ 0.52%, EUROSTOXX + 0.55%, SPAIN +0.25% , and ITALY +0.10%US futures have had a wild ride overnight......at 9 pm est......futures were down 20 pts testing 1895......only to swing back 33 pts to challenge 1928 on the S&P at 4 am est.  Currently they are +9 at 1921.....suggesting that the mkt and investors are trying to put it all in perspective.  Remember - China's stock mkt is not a good indicator of the overall health of their economy...it is an emerging mkt and mostly retail - it does NOT have the depth or inner strength of European & US mkts.  So a collapse in prices in China is more a reflection of  a suspect evolving mkt place that is struggling to define what it wants to be....  I continue to look for the mkt to test the August lows during this earnings season before it finds its footing.   Unless earnings completely disappoint (unlikely) I think the mkt can hold it together....Two Fed speakers today.....Lockhart (Fed Reserve Bank of Atlanta)  at 12:40 and Kaplan (Fed Reserve Bank of Dallas)  at 5:50 pm.  Take good care.

"
490,PM,"By now - we are all well aware of the disaster that had taken place in global mkts since the beginning of the new year - that is unless you have been living under a rock - but either way - we have seen some $2.4 tril wiped out the value of global mkts....some of the blame can be placed squarely on broad macro themes, a breakdown in Apple (AAPL) shares, renewed nervousness concerning Mid East and North Korean geo-political issues, the coming earnings season, health of the consumer, etc.........but for the most part the most recent cause of mkt nervousness  has been front and center - China...  Right or wrong - they have become the scapegoat.....
"
491,PM,"Now - look - there is a lot of 'stuff' going on there.....slowing Chinese economy, currency devaluation,  plunging commodity prices....blah, blah, blah......but can we really pin total mkt action on this one 'developing, emerging mkt country'?  Hardly....but it is fun, isn't' it?   I mean you always look to deflect responsibility - or better yet - look to place blame....and for now - the Chinese economy seems to suit everyone just fine.....I mean we have to blame someone and we were tired of blaming the usual suspects...... Corp earnings, The FED,  Lack of inflation,   Housing slowdown,  Oil and other commodities,  - well you get the picture......
"
492,PM,"Yesterday  - as the world waited all day for Thursday night/Friday morning trading to begin once again in Asia the US mkt continued to come under pressure.   But again — no one threw the kitchen sink out the window or jumped off any roof.  Was it ugly, yes, was it frustrating, yes.  The Dow at one point was off more than 450 pts while the S&P was off over 46 pts……Nasdaq got slammed as well taking that index down more than 3% in early trade.…  It was the classic 'herd mentality' taking hold.....fear builds and people lose their sense of the bigger picture.....and the mkt swings and usually overshoots the reality......
"
493,PM,"After the absolute crushing that China took on Thursday - global mkts were naturally on edge.......Europe sold off and here in the US - the train kept coming......Mid morning yesterday — word spread that the Chinese gov’t was abandoning their circuit breakers - circuit breakers that were supposed to ease the chaos, but which in fact had only exaggerated it....and so — they did away with it…..which left European and American investors time to think about what that could mean.  Was it a good thing?  Would we witness the first major financial crisis of 2016?  Would the Chinese stock mkt implode on Friday?  And if so — what would be the knock on effect for Europe and the US…….
"
494,PM,"Well let’s get one thing straight….You don’t really think that the Chinese would abandon the curbs without making sure that the mkt would go UP  do you?How ridiculous would that be?  How would they be able to prove to the world that they were actually in control if they allowed their mkt to go over the edge?   I mean — You can just hear it, no?  Remember - China is a COMMUNIST country that is trying to be a CAPITALIST country with all of the state controls......so the gov't  made it very clear to investors —‘No selling allowed — otherwise we kill you….. Death by Firing Squad…’ and as so many of us sat glued to our computers last night at 9 pm……we waited and waited…..Japan, Australia opened lower — setting the tone…..US futures remained cautious….ticking slightly higher….as the seconds turned to mins and the Chinese mkt opened…..BOOM!!!!   
"
495,PM,"Just like that it rocketed higher by 3% -  then sold off to -2.2%  (causing the first round of ‘deaths’)  which then served as a warning to anyone else who even considered hitting the SELL button…… Netflix should make a docu-series - ""China ! - How the State Manipulates Global Mkts""  I mean think about it…... UP, Really?  Well, yes in the short term...look that mkt is OFF 17% since Christmas.....so maybe it was a bit oversold.....
"
496,PM,"The papers detail it precisely -  ""The Shanghei Composite Index closed 2 percent higher, after falling as much as 2.2 percent earlier. Regulators removed the circuit breakers after plunges this week closed trading early on Monday and Thursday. The central bank set the currency’s reference rate little changed Friday after an eight-day stretch of weaker fixings that roiled global markets. State-controlled funds purchased Chinese stocks on Friday, focusing on financial shares and others with large weightings in benchmark indexes.    The scrapping of the circuit breaker system will help to stabilize the market, but a sense of panic will remain, particularly among retail investors, The ‘national team*’ will probably continue to buy stocks significantly to stabilize the market.""(*National Team = Gov't)
"
497,PM,"Ok..so guess what?  Yup....global mkts breathe a sigh of relief and the 'snap back relief rally' began.....European mkts WERE higher in initial trade but have since all turned lower - German industrial Production sorely disappointed - missing estimates at -0.3% vs. the +0.5% exp.... US futures are up nicely +15 pts  but off the highs of the early morning trade when we were up 25 pts.... Expect more volatility today.....as the focus now turns to our 'big event' - the NFP (Non Farm Payrolls) report...at 8:30  exp are for +200k jobs but after Wednesday's strong ADP employment report - the pressure is on for a 'better than expected' number...and my sense is that we will get it - especially after the recent drubbing global mkts took - this will allow today's FED speakers to tell us how great it all is.......(smoke and mirrors...)
"
498,PM,"The mkt is on track for its worst start to a year since recorded history!!!  (According to FactSet stats that go back to 1897).   If the first five days are any indication of what is to come.....the get ready - because here it comes... If there were any doubts about the crash in the Hi Yield bond market last year warning us about what was coming for the stock market this year, we can put that to bed....
"
499,PM,"Technically, the Russell 2000 index is leading all indexes to the downside, breaking through last year’s lows of last September on its way to challenge the October 2014 lows at 1,040.  Typical of the Russell leads both in bull markets and bear markets and this latest move does not signal a building BULL mkt just yet.....in fact it looks ugly...... The Dow Trannies also took out their 2015 lows of 7682 and are down 16% from the November  highs and down 23% from their highs of February 2015.  Looks like a big fat brown BEAR to me......
"
500,PM,"We are clearly short term oversold  - as the Dow gives back 1,100 points in five days and the S&P gives back 111 pts during the same time frame.  Expect a snap back rally but also expect that sophisticated asset managers will 'sell any rally' until there is a real shift or catalyst in thinking..... Remember - the mkt can stay IRRATIONAL longer than you can stay LIQUID.  Side Note — Friends — As so many of you know — The Headstrong Project (getheadstrong.org) is an organization that is very close to my heart.  It is a Veteran’s charitable organization that provides POST 911 combat veterans dealing with PTSD and thoughts of suicide with world class mental health care through its treatment program at Weill Cornell Medical Center.   (The Dept of Defense reports 22 suicides a day  and over 350k confirmed cases of veterans dealing with PTSD.) Take a moment to look at the latest qtrly newsletter to learn more about this amazing organization — of which I serve on the Board of Directors — and choose to support those men and women who chose to serve and protect you.  Thank you all for you past support and my hope is that you will continue to support The Headstrong Project team help heal ‘The Hidden Wounds of War’.

"
511,PM,"Emerging mkts falling to 6 yr lows as renewed concern over a weaker Yuan remind global investors of the beating that stocks took back in August when the Chinese devalued their currency.......for the most part though, Asian mkts took it in stride — they did NOT implode….and history suggests that the mkts will not become obsessed with it......But while a slowdown in China, weakening global macro data reports, coming downgrades to US corp profits, concern over FED policy, and the crisis in the mid-east continue to give investors/traders reason for caution - this new geo-political development raises the bar and adds fuel to the already burning fire….

"
518,PM,"We are now significantly below S&P 2000 - we tested 1976 in early pre-mkt a level where I have been saying the mkt needed to go to.....but there may be a bit more to go....in fact I still think a test lower (1950) is not out of the question.  ECO data today includes Mortgage Apps  DOWN by 11.6%  and the ADP Employment Change - expected to show +195k jobs.  In addition to the other eco data points due out - the FED is due to release their DEC mins at 2 pm....I do not suspect we will learn anything new at all....it's just the usual confessional  to make them all feel better.....  Expect mkts to break lower at the opening - but do not necessarily get sucked in just yet.....a break below 1950 will surely cause the mkts to test the August lows of 1870......

Security Council resolutions and again call on North Korea to abide by its international obligations and commitments,  We have consistently made clear that we will not accept it as a nuclear state. We will continue to protect and defend our allies in the region, including the Republic of Korea, and will respond appropriately to any and all North Korean provocations.""  Remind me again - Who is that guy that lives in the WH?  Mkts in Asia - which had just opened for trading and were weak to begin with -  turned lower still....……News of the test sent Japanese, South Korean, Australian and a host of other Asian nations  lower…..China - which once again is attempting to weaken its currency only added selling pressure to mkts around the world.   Emerging mkts falling to 6 yr lows as renewed concern over a weaker Yuan remind global investors of the beating that stocks took back in August when the Chinese devalued their currency.......for the most part though, Asian mkts took it in stride — they did NOT implode….and history suggests that the mkts will not become obsessed with it......But while a slowdown in China, weakening global macro data reports, coming downgrades to US corp profits, concern over FED policy, and the crisis in the mid-east continue to give investors/traders reason for caution - this new geo-political development raises the bar and adds fuel to the already burning fire….All of this news sent investors into typical 'safe haven assets'….the Japanese Yen surged higher vs. the dollar,  Yields on 10 yr treasuries down by 2.22 bps to 1.27% (prices up/yields down) — and Gold currently UP $7.60  considered by so many to be the 'safest haven asset' moved higher — piercing the down trending 50 dma — (see yesterday's comments) and now trading at $1086/oz….looking to move and test $1112/oz.  Defense stocks in Asia all moved higher, but did close off of their intraday highs — resource stocks in Australia ended the day lower on the back of the China currency moves— dragging that index down by 1.6% as broad based indiscriminate selling engulfed that mkt…..This morning European mkts are all a bit lower as the world begins to assess the damage caused by both of these latest international events.  (North Korea and China's currency weakening) .  Oil coming under renewed selling pressure as concerns about growing supply rise - closed under $36/barrel yesterday and today has fallen another 90 cts to $35.07/barrel -  taking us back to the lows of early 2009 during the height of the GFC (Great Financial Crisis) and this is really setting the tone for both Europe and the US.   European mkts are getting clobbered...as the morning becomes afternoon....and the selling intensifies....FTSE -1.5%, CAC 40 - 1.69%, DAX - 1.85%, EUROSTOXX - 1.6%, SPAIN -1.8% and ITALY - 1.8%......   US futures - took a nosedive lower on the Pyongyang news overnight and continue to succumb to weakness as the sun rises over the Atlantic......S&P futures are currently down 35 pts or 1.7% - as they sliced right thru S&P 2000 ""like a hot knife thru butta""  (as Barbara Streisand would say in her signature style Brooklyn, NY accent).  Once again the tone has been set - it is Risk Off (for today)....The choppy trading on Wall St over the last two months makes it very clear.......traders/investors are voting with their feet..... expressing  uncertainty about the future outlook:  corp profits, FED policy, presidential politics, strangling regulation, higher taxes, exploding social welfare programs and huge international geo-political risks ......After Monday's plunge  the  ""buy the dip""  crowd is not so sure that this time it makes sense to buy the dip......maybe - we should just sit back and see how this unfolds......Look - a lot of downside gaps were created on Monday's action - never mind the overall negative tone permeating the psyche  and as noted - the mkt has suffered a fair amount of technical damage........ and while the FED (like every other central bank) may be trying to stabilize the mkt to keep it from falling off of a cliff - at some point it makes no sense to 'stand in front of an oncoming train' .  The mkts will go to the level of equilibrium sooner or later - NO MATTER who tries to stand in its way. We are now significantly below S&P 2000 - we tested 1976 in early pre-mkt a level where I have been saying the mkt needed to go to.....but there may be a bit more to go....in fact I still think a test lower (1950) is not out of the question.  ECO data today includes Mortgage Apps  DOWN by 11.6%  and the ADP Employment Change - expected to show +195k jobs.  In addition to the other eco data points due out - the FED is due to release their DEC mins at 2 pm....I do not suspect we will learn anything new at all....it's just the usual confessional  to make them all feel better.....  Expect mkts to break lower at the opening - but do not necessarily get sucked in just yet.....a break below 1950 will surely cause the mkts to test the August lows of 1870......Take good care.

"
523,PM,"Good morning and Happy New Year.  Stocks did very little on Friday ending the day and the year just a touch lower….I have to say that I was a bit disappointed that they couldn’t nudge it just to the unchanged mark vs. what they did by allowing the S&P to close off fractionally for the year.   In the end — I think it was complete exhaustion — considering what the last quarter has been like.But strap yourself in this morning......so much going on......First up - as usual - Asia kicks off trading in the new year and overnight it was NOT pretty at all.....China back in the spotlight!  Chinese macro economic data kicks the year off with a bang..... Weak manufacturing and PMI (Purchasing Managers Index) reports set the tone - both suggesting a continued slowdown (now this is not really new news...but after a couple of months of near quiet - this report ignited the pent up concerns) .....add in the fact that the gov't imposed restrictions on 'selling stock' by institutions that were put in place during the summer meltdown are about to end and the sense is that there is a tidal wave of sellers just lining up.........All of this triggered a massive sell off in Chinese equities - (Shanghei lost 7%).....causing the first ' trudging halt' (otherwise known as circuit breakers)  to kick in when the mkt had fallen 5%.  Now circuit breakers are new to the Chinese mkts...so the halt in trading only caused more fear and panic among investors as no one - it seemed wanted to be the last guy turning in the room........so after a 15 min halt - the selling resumed and the index fell another 2% within mins....causing a complete trading halt at 1:34 pm.....Now since investors could not sell stocks in China any longer - then what happened - they sold what they could vs. what they should!     Yup - the selling spilled over into the other mkts - causing Japan to fall 3+%, Hong Kong fell 2.6% and ASX lost -0.48%.   Emerging mkts like Taiwan, Korea, India, Indonesia, all suffered losses of better than 2.5%..... And as the sun set on Asia - it rose in Europe and as you would expect - the panic  and indiscriminate selling followed.....Mkts in across the continent all under siege as a 'shoot first, ask questions later' mentality takes hold.....At 6 am (est) - European mkts are gasping for breath....FTSE - 1.9%, CAC 40 - 2.25%, DAX - 3.5%, EUROSTOXX -2.6%, SPAIN -2.25% and ITALY - 2.4%...... Now what is interesting is to see how the 'herd mentality' takes over.....because the latest reads on European macro eco data point to better days ahead.....PMI's across the Euro zone all show expansion:  Italy 55.6, Ireland 54.2, Germany 53.2, Spain 53, Austria 50.6, France 51.4 and even the Greeks are joining in the party at 50.2....remember - a reading ABOVE 50 suggests expansion...so Europe is looking pretty good..... Yet when the mood is decidedly negative - the herd all runs in the same direction.....which is exactly what creates the opportunity for those of us who have an iron stomach!US Futures are now pointing lower (no surprise) currently down 35 pts or 1.8%.....sitting right on S&P 2000  - levels last seen in mid December just ahead of the FED interest rate announcement.......Now what is important here is that we have broken all technical supports - the 50, 100 and 200 dma's......so the mkt could go into an August 24th style free fall with the next stop at or near 1950......Concern is building....   Will the algo's unleash the power of milli, micro second executions at the expense of real analysis?   Like I said on Thursday - do we really know or understand the  'exposure' created by all of the fancy, sophisticated derivative products that we call the ETF mkt?   Let me remind you - the exposure is unknown - no matter what they say......an air pocket in the mkts will cause them to go into free fall - then the additional pressure created by all of the varied ' leveraged synthetic products' - will only exacerbate the move...- so sit back, strap in and watch the show begin...Do not expect the buyers to be anywhere in line and do not expect this morning's moves to be logical at all.......Fear is a funny thing and it causes all kinds of unexplainable actions and reactions.....Now to add to the story we have new geo-political unrest in the Mid East......Over the weekend — the Saudi’s decided that it was time apparently to execute a dissident Shiite cleric and 46 other Sunni extremists in a show of force and a show of ‘not in our backyard’…….In 2011 this cleric was accused of being the leading voice in the then Arab spring that swept across a range of nations….this movement rocked the Arab world (think Egypt, Libya, Yemen) and threatened to cause unrest in the Saudi kingdom.   These men were all arrested then and sentenced to death -  the  execution is supposed to show the world that the Saudi’s DO NOT tolerate disobedience.  As you can imagine — this event did not go unnoticed in the Shiite world (think Iran)…..The Iranian Supreme leader — Ayatollah Khamenei -  calling for Saudi Arabia to face divine retribution for the killings…… Demonstrations in Tehran and other Mid East cities over the weekend calling for the end of the Saudi Kingdom……On Sunday — the Saudi’s cut diplomatic ties with Iran and have ordered the Iranian diplomats out of the country by Tuesday January 5th…..  Welcome 2016!Legend has it that as we move into the new year traders and investors should be aware of the January effect.  This argues that the first five days of the month and then the total months performance tends to predict what to expect for the entire year.  In other words, if  the first 5 days are good and that momentum carries thru to the end of the month then history tells us that the probabilities are high that the bull market will continue.  Conversely - a poor start and finish for the month is a bad omen for the year.    Recall the beginning of 2015 - January began the month at 2058 and ended the month at 1994 - or a loss of 3%.......and what did the mkt do last year?  The Dow lost 2.2%, the S&P lost 1% while Nasdaq rallied 5.7%......  I'm just sayin...'Eco data today includes:  US Markit Manf PMI - exp of 51.1, Const Spending of +0.7% and ISM Manufacturing - exp of 49...so it is a mixed bag of data...but no worries the tone has already been set...no matter what our data says...So - ladies and gents - get ready for a difficult day....I would look for cooler heads to prevail at some point.....I think the mkt will clearly test S&P 2000  to see where the buyers live....any sense that they are not home - will cause the sellers to test lower again......and the buyers know this - so let the game begin......Take good care —

Cigarettes, But One Tobacco Giant Is Holding UpThe Federal Reserve kept to Wall Street's preferred script on Wednesday, leaving its key interest rate unchanged and putting off an announcement that it will begin unwinding its $4.5 trillion balance sheet.The Fed's patience comes as the economy is performing pretty well, with real GDP growing at a 2.6% pace in the second quarter, but inflation and wage gains have been more muted than expected. The combination has been good for the stock market, partly because the prospect of low interest rates has weighed on the dollar, which could be a boon to the earnings of U.S. multinationals in the second half of this year.The decision by the Fed to wait until September to announce a shift in its reinvestment policy — a gradual pullback from its current stance of reinvesting all principal from its maturing mortgage and Treasury bond portfolio — also sent a signal that policymakers aren't overly concerned that financial markets are too exuberant.The next interest-rate hike is expected in December.

Concerns about mass-market gaming in Macau weighed on Wynn, whose Q2 results nonetheless beat estimates. MGM offered a weak revenue-per-available-room outlook. It also cited ""higher-than-anticipated disruption"" at the Monte Carlo, which is being revamped into Park MGM, and a ""challenging comparison"" on the Las Vegas Strip in Q3.

Starbucks (SBUX) tumbled after fiscal-Q3 same-store sales and revenue missed; EPS matched views. The coffee chain said it would close all 379 Teavana retail stores.Several industrial Dow giants rolled past Q2 estimates Tuesday thanks in part to improved global growth.

Their Dow peer 3M (MMM) was an outlier with an overall miss, and shares tanked.Proofpoint (PFPT) reported Q2 profit and revenue that topped expectations and forecast current quarter sales and earnings just above consensus estimates. Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Proofpoint specializes in email and data-loss protection for corporate networks and cloud-computing infrastructure. Proofpoint rose modestly Friday morning. Fortinet (FTNT) posted mixed Q2 results that beat on EPS and revenue, but billings growth disappointed.

TAL and New Oriental shares rose 4.8% and 0.9%, respectively,  but the latter's breakout failed Thursday.Mastercard (MA) reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings and revenue. Shares reversed modestly lower from a record high but remained in buy range.Baidu (BIDU) earnings rose 143%, well over views, while revenue climbed 14% to an in-line $3.08 billion. Shares of the Chinese search giant rose 9.45% on Friday.Electronic Arts (EA) reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings, but the video game publisher gave cautious revenue guidance.

So it’s anyone’s call on what’s next.
"
575,PM,"Investors and the mkts expect both the ECB to add more stimulus and for the FED to move on rates while remaining cautious in the months ahead, anything short of those expectations will cause the mkts to convulse meaning that if Uncle Mario Draghi does not deliver or that the mkt senses that Yellen (or other Fed members) thinks the economy is 'over heating'- thus sending the message that rates will rise faster and steeper than expected — then watch for a major revaluation of asset prices. You see — they have tried to assure the mkts that it's all good and now the mkt is ok with that.

576,PM,"I think the biggest risk is what the FED says next and how they say it. The problem is that when you have 12 people trying to say something — it is never the same message, the wording, the intonation, the body language, the slight wink or awkward smile all reveal how that person really feels. So after they move on rates in December investors/traders will want to know what the plan is going forward. When can we expect the next move?  Can we assume that 25 bps increases will be the norm?  Does the FED think that the US economy is overheating causing new speculation on the rate/pace of further tightening?  All very valid questions — and the economic macro data is telling.

"
586,PM,"Markit's flash November manufacturing reading fell 1.4 points to 52.6, coming in below estimates with its slowest rate in two years. A reading above 50 indicates growth. The strong dollar and weak global demand impacted growth in new orders as exports were hit. The Markit report followed upbeat reports from the Nov. Philly Fed and Kansas City Fed factory indexes, as well as Oct. manufacturing output, though the N.Y. Fed Empire State index remained negative.
"
587,PM,"Existing-home sales slip 3.4%
"
588,PM,"Higher prices and a lack of homes on the market continue to be big factors holding down sales in October. Existing-homes sales fell 3.4% month over month to a seasonally-adjusted 5.36 million, the National Association of Realtors said. The number missed estimates of 5.4 million homes sold. Year over year, sales rose 3.9%, the lowest reading since January. The number of homes on the market fell 4.5% to 2.14 million, an amount the NAR called ""disturbing.""

Manufacturing and services each made gains with readings of 52.8 and 54.6, respectively. Despite the strong readings, eurozone companies continued to cut prices for goods and services, while input costs barely rose. The reading is likely to further expectations that the European Central Bank will unveil more monetary stimulus at its Dec. 3 meeting.

Existing-homes sales fell 3.4% month over month to a seasonally-adjusted 5.36 million, the National Association of Realtors said. The number missed estimates of 5.4 million homes sold. Year over year, sales rose 3.9%, the lowest reading since January. The number of homes on the market fell 4.5% to 2.14 million, an amount the NAR called ""disturbing.""Chicago Fed: Another soft monthThe national activity index in October gave a -0.04 reading, the third consecutive negative reading. But it was a significant improvement from September's -0.29. October's strong employment report helped push the reading higher. The manufacturing component rose to -0.05 from September's -0.17. The sales/orders/inventories component remained at -0.01 while personal consumption and housing notched a -0.09 reading.Eurozone business activity picks upThe eurozone's economic activity gained steam in November, hitting a 54-month high on a stronger-than-expected 54.4 reading, according to a flash data estimate by Markit. Manufacturing and services each made gains with readings of 52.8 and 54.6, respectively. Despite the strong readings, eurozone companies continued to cut prices for goods and services, while input costs barely rose. The reading is likely to further expectations that the European Central Bank will unveil more monetary stimulus at its Dec. 3 meeting. Germany's economy defied concerns about a global economic slowdown and Volkswagen's (VLKAY) emissions scandal to accelerate in November. Markit's PMI index for Europe's largest economy rose to 54.9 from 54.2 in October. A reading above 50 indicates growth. Terrorism in Paris may have impacted France's PMI private-sector reading, which came in at 51.3, a three-month low. Services printed at a surprisingly soft 51.3, while French manufacturing had a stagnant 50.8 reading.Japan mulls minimum wage hikePM Shinzo Abe is considering various measures to boost growth and inflation, according to multiple reports, after the economy fell into a technical recession on modest contractions in the spring and summer. A draft document calls for a minimum wage hike — 3% according to the Nikkei newspaper — to try to boost consumer spending. Abe also is looking at ways to boost capital spending, which has been weak, as Japanese businesses are reluctant to invest at home. U.S. GDP for Q3 (second estimate), 8:30 a.m. ET (forecast: 2.1%). U.S. corporate profits for Q3, 8:30 a.m. ET (prior: 8.5%). Redbook consumer spending for week ended Nov. 21, 8:55 a.m. ET (prior: 1.2%). Case-Shiller home price index for Sept., 9 a.m. ET (forecast: 0.3% monthly). Consumer Confidence Index for Nov., 10 a.m. ET (forecast: 99.6).

"
625,PM,"Specifically, the immediate domestic Japanese agenda looks like this: Week of July 27: Upper House to start deliberations on the defense law and security bill revisions. These unpopular bills did already pass the Lower House by a two-thirds majority and will automatically become law by mid-August. However, Prime Minister Abe will have to navigate continued media coverage on this unpopular topic. August 3—5: Likely decision on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade zone. Here, Prime Minister Abe and the vast majority of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) are firmly committed to tariff cuts and agricultural deregulation. However, a small minority of old-style protectionist politicians are sure to raise their voice. The deal is done, but the media spin is poised to put some additional pressure on Abe's popularity. August 10: Possible restart of the first nuclear reactor (all reactors are currently shut down due to post-Fukushima safety concerns). Similar to the defense and security law revisions, nuclear restart remains unpopular, and the PM's office expects large-scale demonstrations, should the restart proceed as scheduled. August 15: The 70th anniversary of the end of the Pacific War. The focus here is on Prime Minister Abe's speech and the reaction from neighboring countries to the degree of the apology presented. Mid-September: LDP presidential election. The LDP presidency is a three-year term, limited to two terms. Abe became president in September 2012, winning a race against five contenders. For the upcoming election, those I spoke to consider it very unlikely that Abe will be challenged. It goes without saying that Abe's unanimous reelection by his party would be a powerful symbol for investors to extend their trust in Japan's policy stability and consistency.

"
627,PM,"After my meetings, I remain very confident that there is absolutely no lack of commitment for or focus on Abe's pro-growth policies. Specifically, all decision makers acknowledged that the recent drop in Japanese stocks2 was not just due to an external Greece and China “risk off"" but that the sell-off was caused in part by the slip in Abe's popularity. This candor is very encouraging. 
"
628,PM,"More fundamentally, Abe's policy team knows that positive wealth effects from both the stock market and the real estate market are a necessary condition for a true Japan revival. I believe the start of the 2016/17 fiscal and tax debate should reassert the pro-investment, pro-risk-asset policy.

633,PM,"The major indexes remained mixed in relatively quiet trading Friday afternoon, but Apple (AAPL) flashed a sell signal for short-term investors and traders who had capitalized on its recent two buy points: one at 118.12, and another at 141.12.Shares are cutting losses as of 2:30 pm ET, down around 0.98, or less than 0.7%, to 143.31. Intraday, Apple hit a low of 142.20. Volume is heavy but now running around less than 30% above usual levels. Apple's 50-day average turnover is 27.2 million shares. With less than 90 minutes left in Friday's quadruple-witching session, the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.2% while the S&P 500 was practically at the break-even level. The Dow Jones industrial average inched a few points higher and got as high as 21,372 in the stock market today.Volume is running higher vs. the same time Thursday on both main exchanges, due in large part to the expiring of weekly and monthly options on stocks and indexes.The sell-off in small caps worsened, however, with the S&P SmallCap 600 down more than 0.9%. At 850.16, the 600 looked headed for a weekly decline of around 1.6%.Back to Apple, the primary reason for selling the consumer technology innovator now is that, as seen on a weekly chart, the iPhone maker's slide is deep at more than 4%. Plus volume is not only above average but has accelerated vs. the prior week.Weekly volume is on track to be the largest since the week ended Feb. 3, a sign that hedge funds, mutual funds, banks, pensions and the like are anxiously taking gains and hitting the exits hard.Of course, a rebound is still very possible, but that may also depend on a resurgence of buying in tech stocks on the whole. On June 9, IBD downgraded its current outlook for the equities market to ""Uptrend under pressure"" from ""Confirmed uptrend."" As noted in IBD's The Big Picture, this means it's still OK to buy stocks, but the risk of an immediate loss is greater than normal. Apple broke out of a first-stage bottoming base in the form of a beautiful 13-week cup with handle on Jan. 6-9. That base furnished the 118.12 entry (10 cents above the handle's intraday high of 118.02). A gain of 20% to 25% past such a proper buy point warrants the move to sell shares and take some profits. Apple rallied more than that; at 156.65, it gained as much as 34%.For those who grabbed shares when Apple moved past a three-weeks-tight follow-on entry at 141.12, it's also time to sell shares to avoid a round trip of minor gains. Apple's 3-weeks-tight pattern began to form in the week ended March 3; in the next two weeks, Apple closed within 1% to 1.5% of the prior week, showing very tight action. That 3-weeks-tight pattern eventually became a 4-weeks-tight when in the week ended March 24, Apple rose just 0.5% for the week.Volume was below average in each of those weeks, suggesting that fund managers back then were happy to sit on their shares.Apple, now more than 8% below its 156.65 peak, would still have to fall roughly 12% to come face to face with its rising long-term 200-day moving average. For long-term share owners who are sitting on a large profit cushion, a potential 200-day line test would be of particular interest.Not all techs are behaving like Apple.In the semiconductor space, Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) continue to trade well. The former is holding its own after a recent downgrade by research analysts last week. Shares are down less than 0.2% at 152.16, holding above the psychologically key 150 level. The GPU king had busted past a 121.02 cup-type-base entry point after reporting huge gains in fiscal Q1 earnings (up 126% to 79 cents a share) and revenue (up 48% to $1.94 billion).Broadcom remains on the north side of its 50-day line. The stock, down 1.46 to 236.53, is back in buy range from a recent breakout from an eight-week flat base at 227.85. The 5% chase zone extends up to 239.24. But keep in mind that the diversified chipmaker is on course for a second straight weekly drop in above-average turnover.Broadcom (98 Composite Rating, 99 EPS, 89 RS) has also been a whirlwind winner for nearly four years. Its first major breakout came in the week ended Sept. 20, 2014, when the stock propelled past a 39.84 entry, or 10 cents above the high in a long base-on-base pattern. In the second base, Broadcom formed a nine-week flat base with a high of 39.74. Since then, the rally has expanded 543%. (Use a MarketSmith chart to see the historical weekly chart and use its base-counting premium feature.)IBD's TAKE: Broadcom remains a true market leader due to strong stock price action, excellent fundamentals, and vibrant institutional sponsorship. A quick and easy way to track these parameters is by using IBD Stock Checkup tool, available to all Investors.com subscribers.On the downside, management and government project consultant Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) gapped down 7.17, or 18%, to 32.16, more than giving up its decent short-term gains from a recent breakout past 36.79. Booz is reportedly facing accusations of false accounting practices.The May 22 breakout in heavy volume was clean, and the stock, on a technical basis, did not furnish any clues that such a bad drop was in the wings. How could a CAN SLIM-focused stock trader avoid such a big drop by not buying the stock on the breakout?One answer could be found in the fact that Booz's quarterly results, while improving, really do not meet the minimum increases of 25% or more for both earnings per share and revenue. One could have skipped Booz and search for a name with stronger growth. In the past four quarters, the McLean, Va., firm saw earnings changes of +5%, +18%, -7% and +10% vs. year-ago levels, as revenue rose 5%, 5%, 7% and 11%.While such numbers may be considered acceptable for a Dow 30-type large- or megacap firm, Booz is a midcap company with a market value of $4.8 billion. At its 52-week high of 39.67, the market cap was $5.9 billion.RELATED:How Do You Identify Key Stock Market Tops?

636,PM,"Futures for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 rose modestly early Friday as investors remained resilient event after after the surprising U.K. election news that the Conservatives have lost their majority in Parliament.The Conservatives remain the largest party and likely will retain control in some fashion, but PM Theresa May's fate is unclear while Brexit negotiations, set to start later this month, could face delay or more. The pound was sharply lower.XKeep an eye on financial stocks. Citigroup (C) broke out Thursday as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Bank of America (BAC) test key levels. Meanwhile, Amazon (AMZN)-Dish Network (DISH) rumors swirled again.Stock futures initially fell Thursday evening after initial exit polls predicted that Conservatives would fall short. But futures gradually firmed somewhat.Futures for the Dow industrials rose 0.2% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures climbed nearly 0.2% while Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.1% above fair value.Conservatives ended up with roughly 318 seats, down modestly from 330 before the election and less than the 326 seats needed for an outright majority. Labour should get 261 seats, a big rise, as most third parties lost ground.That would create a hung Parliament. However, Northern Ireland unionists, with 10 seats under the DUP, are set to provide enough support to give Conservatives control via a minority government.When May called the early election this spring, the Conservatives started with a huge lead, with most analysts betting that the ruling party would amass a sweeping majority and a freer hand in Brexit negotiations with the European Union.Now political uncertainty is heightened just before Brexit negotiations are supposed to get underway.

655,PM,"Stocks pulled a fast one.......they rallied on Monday despite the negative tone set from last week....the broken technicals, the fear over FED policy, the weaker macro data and yes - the attacks on Paris - that shook all of humanity.  
"
656,PM,"You see - recall the chatter last week - BEFORE the Paris attacks.........the data is getting weaker yet the clock is ticking....the FED has painted themselves into a corner so now they are trying to prepare investors/traders for 'The Move', a drama coming to a theater near you in December......
"
657,PM,"The talk of rate increases sending mkts into a tailspin - why?  Because it is confusing to think that 'now' is the right time to launch...I mean the data is NOT cooperating and the global economy is once again struggling (vs. where it was in the spring) US macro data is weaker, confidence is waning, leadership is lacking yet....we get all of the FED mouthpieces now telling us that  WE are all wrong, that WE can't see the truth, that WE must be confused - things have never been better...I mean look - we can point to ONE macro data report that surprised even the most seasoned economists - which must mean that it's all good....OK......no problem....if that is what YOU want us to believe - we can play along......all that means is that assets will get re-priced....no worries....
"
658,PM,"All this talk has caused investors/traders to re-price a range of assets to reflect the 'new risk'...the risk of what higher rates in a weaker environment will mean to the broader picture.....No worries - the mkt will dictate what those assets are worth....... This is all very normal.....if monetary policy is going to change, then analysts/strategists have to re-calculate the impact and that is what has been happening....If monetary policy remains confused then the mkt will remain confused.....and so we have seen the rotation.......Financials, Industrials, Energy, Retailers, Housing and Utilities all under the gun.....Tech, Healthcare, Consumer Staples attempting to carry the load....and all this makes sense in a struggling economy with the threat of rising rates.....
"
659,PM,"Then we had Paris......the images over the weekend causing fear and concern....speculation that Monday would be another 'blood bath' as investors fled the mkts based on technical weakness and FEAR.........But that was not the case.....in fact - I would argue that because  France took the bull by the horns and declared WAR on ISIS - they helped to create the environment for global mkts to rally.....It felt globally patriotic........and now that France is considering exercising “Article 5 of NATO”,  it creates a whole new conversation.  
"
660,PM,"Article 5 states that ""an armed attack against European and North American members, as well as Turkey, shall be considered an attack against them all.’’ As a result, NATO members would be obligated to impose military force on a NATO adversary.  (There are 28 member nations in NATO (North American Treaty Organization) - they include: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, UK, US, Greece, Turkey, Germany, Spain, Czech, Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Albania, and Croatia)
"
661,PM,"Recall that after 911 - NATO triggered Article 5 to announce military support for the US in the event the US chose to wage war against the terrorists.  However, Syria is a complicated mess - you have Shiite Syrians backed by Hezbollah, Iran and Russia fighting Sunni Syrians.  You have ISIS pushing for a caliphate - You have Al-Qaeda and the Kurds -  You've got conflicted foreign policies from a range of nations.....and now you have the biggest exodus of refugees that most of us alive today have ever seen.  in the end you have mess.... Yet, the cycle of war alwys seems to rear its ugly head when the world economy lags......History in fact DOES repeat itself. 
"
662,PM,"Technically the mkt has completed a short cycle sell off with last week’s hard correction and yesterday's action tested support - sending the mkts to once again test resistance at 2065. As expected - Oil rallied (global unrest), causing the energy sector to rally 3.6%, Defense stocks also enjoyed an up day - the  iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF  (ITA) and Spdr S&P Aerospace & Dfn  (XAR) both rallied 2+%....... The broader mkt went along for the ride - piercing resistance at 2035 ending the day at 2053......
"
663,PM,"US futures are pointing higher this morning - currently up 7 pts.....as we await today's eco data.....CPI is expected to be +0.2%, but remember - PPI was -0.4%, so it is almost impossible for CPI to surprise at all...remember - CPI is Consumer Price Index (inflation) and that is derived from the PPI which is Producer Price Index - if producer prices are falling - how can consumer prices be rising?  Capisce?   Industrial Prod at 0.1% and Cap Util at 77.5% are the other two important reads today.    Also expect traders to be focused on the release of the FED mins tomorrow at 2 pm.....

688,PM,"Stocks closed lower on Friday finishing the week on a sour note — the selling violated the second level of support leaving the mkt in limbo with only the final support level needing to be tested at S&P 2005.  The Dow lost 202 pts while the S&P lost over 1%, closing lower by 23 pts….led by a continued free fall in commodities and the glaringly weak reports on retail sales and PPI (producer price index)…For the week — the S&P lost over 3.5%, the energy sector lost 6%, retailers lost 9%, Tech lost 4.7% , Consumer Discretionary lost 5.1%. Well you get the picture.  The PPI at -0.4% was so bad it is now indicating DEFLATION….but no worries — Janet and her band of merry men and women are singing about the benefits of that still strong NFP report from two weeks ago — in fact on Friday — Cleveland Fed Pres Loretta Mester said that the time to hike rates was ‘quickly approaching’….suggesting that the time is now for rates to rise…and so what we are seeing is a re-pricing of risk assets across the spectrum — why?  Because they (the FED)  clearly missed that opportunity 2 or 3 times already and the mkt is telling us that NOW is not the time to move on rates - especially in light of the weekend's events…..what’s the rush?  I mean the DATA is really not cooperating...but she is trapped - trapped like a rat..... (Remember December is a ‘self imposed’ deadline.) 
"
689,PM,"And it was a very disappointing day for retailers on Friday — in fact the retailers rolled over and played dead…..October retail sales rose by 0.1% vs. the 0.3% expectation and if you look at retail sales EX autos, gas, building materials and food services rose by 0.2% vs. the 0.4% expectation.  Add in some weaker than expected earnings and the retailers got slaughtered…..JW Nordstrom (JWN) gave up 15% on horrific earnings, terrible revenues and a cut in full year sales and profit forecasts…. JC Penney  (JCP) also closed down 15% on terrible earnings, but the silver lining for them was that comparable store sales rose by 6.4%......The Gap, Inc. (GPS) -3%,  Kohl's (KSS) -3.2%, Macy's (M) gave up another 2% on top of the 24% in the last week alone.....Target (TGT) lost 2.5%......not a pretty picture by any stretch.....
"
690,PM,"Now Friday afternoon also brought word of a terrorist attack in Paris….and the chaos and confusion that that event created only served to put more pressure on an already weak mkt as investors/traders tried to understand the extent and impact of this horrific event.  As the day drew to a close — more information became available — and the selling pressure picked up into the bell.  Over the weekend — we learned of the very horrific events that engulfed the ‘City of Lights’ — the world mourned — allies stood together, world leaders who had gathered in Turkey for the G20 meeting denounced the actions of those pathetic souls that call themselves ‘jihadists’ — calling this an ‘attack on the civilized world’……. and then President Hollande of France declared ‘war’ on Isis…..Sunday night unleashing a barrage of French bombs — (neatly packed in French air force Rafale Fighter Jets…)  upon the nerve center in Raqqa, Syria — wiping out a command center, a weapons facility, and a training ground… and this is only the beginning…..there is now a global commitment to intensify and eradicate this terrorist organization…… and so it begins - the instability, the fear, the bombs and the continued threats of chaos will now become some of the directional drivers in the global mktplace. Asia was the first mkt center to open — and stocks moved lower as mkts react to the worst terror incident in over a decade…..investors kneejerk reaction is to hit the SELL button (fear) as they assess the impact that this event will have on the European economy and the global economy…. Weaker macro data in Japan also did not help the tone — GDP for the 3rd qtr fell by 0.8% on top of the -0.7% in the 2nd qtr.  Sending that country into RECESSION — this is the second recession since PM Shinzo Abe took office in December 2012.  This news put renewed pressure on Abe and the BoJ Governor Kuroda to do MORE! Over the weekend - the Chinese gov't raised margin requirements (bearish) but at the same time indicated possibly more accommodation as the gov't pursues pro-mkt reforms (bullish)......Japan - 1%, Hong Kong -0.89%, China + 0.48% and ASX -0.9%. In Europe this morning — mkts are mixed but marginally higher after initial selling pressure subsided.....Investors/traders now digesting news of French attacks on ISIS is sending mkts into positive territory.....As you would expect - travel, hotel, airlines and leisure stocks will take it on the chin a bit, but expect that defense stocks will benefit as the civilized world gears up to destroy those cowards.    Macro data in the Eurozone showed inflation data in October to be 0.1% up from 0%.   FTSE +0.44%, CAC 40+0.03%, DAX +0.34%, Eurostoxx +0.20%, Spain +0.01% and Italy flat.   Now US futures had a wild ride overnight......opening down 11 pts at 2007 - only to test 2000 then rally as the bombs dropped.  Currently - US futures are higher by 5 pts indicating that investors/traders will not allow ISIS to dictate capital flow and investor reaction.  CNBC puts  Billionaire Wilbur Ross on the television to tell us that these latest attempts on humanity will be 'unlikely to cause a mkt correction' and I agree...what will cause a mkt correction is the inability of the global economy to fire on all cylinders and a pre-mature move by the FED to raise rates at a time when the data is not confirming 'escape velocity'.  Now last week we broke S&P intermediate support at 2034....closing lower at 2023.....Overnight we tested support at 2000 and held.....I suspect that we are now stuck in the 2000/2034 trading range as the week begins.   The talk  will be about  broken technical's, attacks on ISIS, and more eco data this week.....
"
691,PM,"Today  we WON'T get any FED speak but we will get the Empire Manf Survey - exp of -6.3 - which would be an improvement over last month's -11......Mortgage foreclosures and delinquencies round out today....later in the week Traders/Investors will keep an eye on CPI exp of +0.2%, Industrial production of +0.1%, Cap Util of 77.5%, housing starts of 1.1 mil which would be a decline of 4%..... On Wednesday we get the FED mins and although I do not think we will learn anything new - it will be a key to the action amid concerns over what the FED will decide to do in 4 weeks.  On the earnings front, retail giants Wal-Mart  (WMT), Home Depot  (HD), Target (TGT), Staples (SPLS), and Best Buy  (BBY) are among the companies due to report their quarterly results this week.

Over the weekend - the Chinese gov't raised margin requirements (bearish) but at the same time indicated possibly more accommodation as the gov't pursues pro-mkt reforms (bullish)......Japan - 1%, Hong Kong -0.89%, China + 0.48% and ASX -0.9%. In Europe this morning — mkts are mixed but marginally higher after initial selling pressure subsided.....Investors/traders now digesting news of French attacks on ISIS is sending mkts into positive territory.....As you would expect - travel, hotel, airlines and leisure stocks will take it on the chin a bit, but expect that defense stocks will benefit as the civilized world gears up to destroy those cowards.    Macro data in the Eurozone showed inflation data in October to be 0.1% up from 0%.   FTSE +0.44%, CAC 40+0.03%, DAX +0.34%, Eurostoxx +0.20%, Spain +0.01% and Italy flat.   Now US futures had a wild ride overnight......opening down 11 pts at 2007 - only to test 2000 then rally as the bombs dropped.  Currently - US futures are higher by 5 pts indicating that investors/traders will not allow ISIS to dictate capital flow and investor reaction.  CNBC puts  Billionaire Wilbur Ross on the television to tell us that these latest attempts on humanity will be 'unlikely to cause a mkt correction' and I agree...what will cause a mkt correction is the inability of the global economy to fire on all cylinders and a pre-mature move by the FED to raise rates at a time when the data is not confirming 'escape velocity'.  Now last week we broke S&P intermediate support at 2034....closing lower at 2023.....Overnight we tested support at 2000 and held.....I suspect that we are now stuck in the 2000/2034 trading range as the week begins.   The talk  will be about  broken technical's, attacks on ISIS, and more eco data this week.....Today  we WON'T get any FED speak but we will get the Empire Manf Survey - exp of -6.3 - which would be an improvement over last month's -11......Mortgage foreclosures and delinquencies round out today....later in the week Traders/Investors will keep an eye on CPI exp of +0.2%, Industrial production of +0.1%, Cap Util of 77.5%, housing starts of 1.1 mil which would be a decline of 4%..... On Wednesday we get the FED mins and although I do not think we will learn anything new - it will be a key to the action amid concerns over what the FED will decide to do in 4 weeks.  On the earnings front, retail giants Wal-Mart  (WMT), Home Depot  (HD), Target (TGT), Staples (SPLS), and Best Buy  (BBY) are among the companies due to report their quarterly results this week.Take good care.

713,PM,"And this headline says it all - ""Brisk Job Gains Ease Fed's Path"" - Solid wage growth and robust hiring raise chances of rate hike at December meeting"" - wsj 11-7-15
"
714,PM,"Stocks should have celebrated that 'great news'.....yet - they showed a lack of direction for much of Friday as traders/investors digested the 'blow the roof off the house' monthly jobs report. The major averages spent the day bouncing back and forth across the unchanged line before closing mixed.
"
715,PM,"U.S. employers supposedly added jobs in October at a pace unimagined while boosting wages at the fastest rate since 2009, giving the FED the all clear signal  that the economy is back and is strong enough to withstand an interest-rate increase next month.
"
716,PM,"Nonfarm payrolls rose a seasonally adjusted 271,000 last month - beating the expectation by more than 100k jobs - causing the unemployment rate to fall  to 5%, a level Fed officials expected it to reach before the end of the yr.  [ Note that September was revised down to 135,000 and remember that last month August had been revised dramatically down as well.]  I would expect that October's numbers will also be 'revised' next month — or maybe in January, after the Fed has used these 'dramatically improved' numbers to justify  a rate hike in December.  I mean these numbers are just too good to be believed.  
"
717,PM,"Economists and strategists are now convinced that  the likelihood of the first rate increase is now on the table - remember - 'Fed officials have said for months they would start lifting their benchmark rate, which has been near zero since late 2008, after they saw more improvement in the labor market and felt ""reasonably confident"" annual inflation would rise toward their 2% target'...Stephen Stanley - Chief Economist at Amhearst Pierpoint Securities had this to say:  ""This is the kind of employment report that even the most diehard doves on the Fed cannot ignore,""  I would say - ""That is if you believe it"".  
"
718,PM,"What they buried deep in the report is that there are still some 8 mil people who want a job and can't find one..... and what they didn't tell you is that there are  2.2 mil LESS people in the work force vs. last year....so the drop in the unemployment rate is NOT because of some dramatic real increase in jobs as much as it is a function of less people in the workforce.  What they failed to explain is - How could the actual report be so different from Wednesday's ADP report and all the analysis by some of the street's smartest economists?   I mean not even GS had the number - I guess they didn't get the 'wink'
"
719,PM,"Look the majority of the jobs created - as the story points out -  were in the ""domestically oriented service sectors that are largely immune to overseas turbulence, including retail, food services, health care and construction""   Retail jobs - (think - part time Holiday jobs) rose by 44k...those jobs disappear in late January after the rush of returns subsides.... and then they chimed in and told us that the retail sector wage growth rose to $14.90/hr..... that equates to $30k/ yr  - IF you work 40 hrs a week and have that job for the whole year.   (Which ain't happening...) - so why even use that stat?
"
720,PM,"One thing is for sure - the FED needed a strong number and miraculously - they got it......and the overriding take away is that the hike is on!   And this is curious why?  Because all of the reasons for delay back in September including  - overseas economic weakness, a China implosion, weaker oil, stronger dollar - still exist....nothing has really changed other than this ONE report...... In fact - Oil has only gotten weaker the dollar has gotten stronger...... 
"
721,PM,"In international news - Overnight - the OECD (Organization of Economic Cooperation & Development) cut global growth forecast to 2.9%  from 3% in Sept.....and down from 3.1% in June......and this morning a Bloomberg article points out that Maersk - the largest shipping company in the world suggests that   ""Global GDP is worse now than what the official forecasts show"".
"
722,PM,"In his article - the CEO of  points out that the IMF is overly optimistic....saying that: ""We believe that global growth is slowing down, Trade is currently significantly weaker than it normally would be under the growth forecasts we see.  We conduct a string of our own macro-economic forecasts and we see less growth -- particularly in developing nations, but perhaps also in Europe -- than other people expect in 2015.""
"
723,PM,"On Friday Maersk reported that 3Q profit fell by 61%...and trade from Asia to Europe is suffering the most.....blaming the weaker euro for exporters like China to remain competitive......So we must ask - How long before we see another China devaluation?  
"
724,PM,"Overnight - Asian mkts were mixed....hopes for more Chinese stimulus helped China surge by 1.6%.  Look the Chinese macro data was mixed at best...Currency reserves rose for the first time in 5 months - that's good, but October exports fell by 6.9% vs. the exp of -3.2% and imports fell by 18.8% vs. exp of  -15.2%.  The data doesn’t really  change the conversation very much.....but it  does reinforce there’s still no real growth.  Japan +1.9%,  Hong Kong -0.6% and ASX -1.8%
"
725,PM,"In Europe - mkts there are all lower.....German export data did beat the expectation - but that did nothing to ignite investor confidence today as the focus was on weaker China data and the stronger US jobs number - suggesting a rate hike.

726,PM,"And this morning US futures are down by 7 pts......after investors and traders got a chance to digest Friday's NFP report and the likely implications of the first rate hike....because now the conversation turns to the 'pace and timing of the NEXT rate hike (assuming that Dec is now a fait accompli').   The implication is that the FED is now behind the curve  (think strong jobs number) - so many are now suggesting that the FED will need to be more aggressive in 2016 to combat the rising threat of inflation..... If that is the case - then strap in - because the mkts will swiftly re-price asset values across the spectrum.  Why?  Because Janet has made it very clear that the pace and timing of any future rates increases will be measured and thoughtful......not swift and erratic....so stocks will get hit, housing prices will fall, emerging mkts will get clobbered - but hey - it has to happen at some point....and it should have happened months ago......  
"
727,PM,"I would expect that we could see the mkt test 2063 over the next couple of days...as the mkt listens to the coming FED speeches this week.  Boston's Rosengren is the first one up at bat today at 12 pm - expect to hear him fawn over the strength of the US economy as he floats the first 'higher rate balloon' since the NFP report.  Take good care    Kp

729,PM,"Tobacco makers continue to pay smoking-hot dividends even as they keep transitioning toward smoke-free products. Philip Morris International (PM) has increased its annual dividend every year since it went public in 2008. The New York-based tobacco company currently pays $1.04 a share on a quarterly basis, or $4.16 for the full year, which works out to a 3.7% annualized yield.…
"
730,PM,"Major market indexes continued to flex strength in afternoon trading Thursday as earnings reports across a wide swath of industries seemed to reinforce investor confidence in the ongoing recovery of the U.S. economy.Steel companies rebounded sharply, as did American Express (AXP), which helped boost the all-important financial sector. The stock gapped up 5% and regained its 50-day moving average line.As of 2:30 pm ET, the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite all rallied 0.8% to 1% in the stock market today, topped only a little bit by the small-cap Russell 2000, up more than 1.1%. Volume is mixed, up sharply on the NYSE vs. the same time Wednesday and virtually even on the Nasdaq.At its intraday high of 2361, the S&P 500 retook the key 50-day moving average. In recent sessions, though, the Nasdaq composite showed superior strength on the back of a strong bounce off its 50-day line, bolstered by continued institutional demand in medical, software, chip, internet and select consumer-oriented stocks. For more color on the general market action, please read IBD's The Big Picture column on a daily basis. Steel Dynamics (STLD) rose 4.8% to 34.28, still shy of reclaiming its 50-day line. On the bright side, a recent two-week pullback stopped short of becoming a test of support at the long-term 200-day moving average.The highly efficient maker of steel, based in Ft. Wayne, Ind., reported a 215% leap in first-quarter profit to 82 cents a share as revenue jumped 36%, accelerating from gains of 1%, 8% and 20% in the prior three quarters.Steel Dynamics' RS Rating is 74 on a scale of 1 to 99, so it could use some improvement. And it's down from a much better rank of 90 seen eight weeks ago. Generally, the best growth stocks already show a Relative Price Strength Rating of 80 or higher before the complete a base and potentially break out.The stock, whose $8.4 billion market cap makes it a mid-cap play, has a superior RS Rating than American compatriot Nucor (NUE) at 52. U.S. Steel (X) has an 84 RS, fourth best in the steel producers industry group, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup.In the IBD 50, a number of small-cap firms have posted rousing returns in recent months. Holders with a large profit cushion should remain in the stock until a clear sell signal arises. Among the leaders, keep an eye on these five: Essent Group (ESNT) (in Leaderboard), a mortgage insurance leader; Nutrisystem (NTRI), which recently regained its short-term 10-day moving average; Masimo (MASI), an expert in medical diagnostic gear for hospitals; and Veeva Systems (VEEV), which is excelling in business software for Big Pharma and biotechs; and Advanced Energy Industries (AEIS).Essent, which marked new all-time highs on Wednesday, is still in buy range from a recent flat-base breakout at 38.20. The 5% chase zone goes up to 40.11. Leaderboard added the Bermuda-based seller of private mortgage insurance on April 5. As noted on an annotated Leaderboard daily chart, Essent also triggered an aggressive buy point at 36.91.The stock initially broke out of a first-stage bottoming base pattern with a 24.53 entry on Aug. 4, 2016. The rally has since expanded as much as 61%.Essent's earnings per share have increased 111%, 78%, 52%, 45%, 37%, 39%, 48% and 42% vs. year-ago levels in the past eight quarters.

731,PM,"Prime Minister Theresa May set the U.K. on course for leaving the European Union in two years time, a divorce that will redefine the country's relationship with its largest trading partner and end decades of deepening political integration on the continent.""After nine months the UK has delivered,"" EU President Donald Tusk, said in a Twitter post after receiving a signed letter by May, which invoked Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty.The ties that have bound the U.K. to the EU since 1973 started to unravel at around 1:20 p.m. in Brussels when Britain's ambassador gave Tusk the letter.""I want us to be a truly global Britain,"" May told lawmakers in London.Nine months since Britons unexpectedly voted to leave, the phony war of what Brexit might look like will turn into a real battle over the complex terms of a settlement with 27 other governments. Enough lines over money, trade and immigration have been drawn to suggest a tough process with costs to both sides.""We're moving from a U.K. monologue to a hard negotiation,"" said Gregor Irwin, chief economist at Global Counsel, a consultancy, and a former official in the U.K. Foreign Office. ""There are going to be many upsets along the way.""The pound on Wednesday initially weakened against all of its Group-of-10 peers and fell to a one-week low against the dollar, but quickly hit a daily high after the long-expected move finally took place. Pound sterling has dropped 17% since the referendum although it stabilized recently as investors awaited signs of how the talks would progress.May is aiming by March 29, 2019, to have won back control of labor flows and lawmaking, while also landing a new free trade pact with the bloc. The EU is demanding the U.K. first pay a 50 billion-pound ($62 billion) fee and there is the threat of sweeping tariffs being imposed if a deal isn't struck in time.""It is my fierce determination to get the right deal for every single person in this country,"" May will tell parliament, according to her office. ""We all want to live in a truly global Britain that gets out and builds relationships with old friends and new allies around the world.""In the background is London's future as an international financial hub and threats by banks to up sticks. There's also Britain's commercial relations with the rest of the world and even the potential breakup of the U.K. as Scottish nationalists use Brexit in their push for autonomy. The legislature in Edinburgh voted on Tuesday to pursue another independence referendum.""Today the PM will take the U.K. over a cliff with no idea of the landing place,"" Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon wrote on Twitter. ""Scotland didn't vote for it and our voice has been ignored.""The talks will test the negotiating mettle of a premier in power for just eight months and her ability to play to a domestic audience, especially the anti-EU wing of her Conservative Party that remembers she voted to stay in the bloc. Britain is divided over a ""hard Brexit,"" where May could walk away with no deal, and ""soft Brexit"" with continued tariff-free trade, which Scotland and other pro-EU factions want.May interpreted June's referendum result as a protest against some of the key tenets of globalization, a trend that also swept Donald Trump to power in the U.S. and put National Front leader Marine Le Pen ahead in some polls before French presidential elections next month.For Europe, it's a question of cohesion. Any deal struck between the U.K. and the EU potentially could decide whether Britain proves to be a trailblazer for other countries to leave, or remain the skeptical outlier it has always been. To ward against encouraging others to eye the exit door, EU officials say Britain will not be allowed to enjoy better terms outside the bloc than inside it.Both sides talk publicly of the need to avoid hostilities, with May speaking of a ""new deep and special partnership"" on the eve of the trigger. She also telephoned Tusk, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, agreeing with all of them that ""a strong EU was in everyone's interests and that the U.K. would remain a close and committed ally,"" according to her office.Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond told the BBC on Wednesday that the British still want security, defense and science relationships with the EU.Still, Juncker has in the past predicted negotiations will be ""very, very, very difficult."" David Davis, the Brexit czar, is preparing for what ""may be the most complicated negotiation of all time.""European officials will bide their time to make a considered response, knowing the British have ceded control of the clock to them. Tusk will speak to reporters on Wednesday afternoon and publish draft guidelines for EU negotiator Michel Barnier by the end of the week, but leaders won't sign off on them until an April 29 summit.""In the end, the words of the letter won't matter much,"" said Guntram Wolff, director at the Brussels-based Bruegel think tank. ""In such negotiations, it is actions that matter.""In an early blow to May, three people familiar with the matter said Tusk will limit Barnier's remit to the terms of divorce rather than widen it to include a future trade relationship. Merkel also plans to push May to cover the U.K.'s financial commitments, people familiar with her strategy said.May and Barnier agree the terms of the breakup need to be settled in about 18 months to give the British and European Parliaments time to rubber stamp them.May wants to leave the EU's single market to reduce the number of people allowed into Britain to work. She also wants to escape the oversight of the European Court of Justice and cease sending what she calls ""vast"" sums of money to Brussels.As for trade, she is requesting the ""best possible deal,"" while at the same time winning the freedom to line up trade accords with countries such as the U.S. and China.European governments have shown rare unanimity in declining to enter even informal talks before May gave official notice to leave.An early flash point will be money. Barnier says the U.K. must agree to settle financial commitments. Davis questions whether the U.K. is under any legal obligation to pay anything. An impasse might leave the EU refusing to engage on trade and potentially forcing the issue in front of the courts.""We simply do not recognize some of the very large numbers that have been bandied about in Brussels,"" Hammond said.That's why May's team wants to discuss the split and new commercial ties in tandem. The British hope the amount of goods and services the EU sends to the U.K. will allow for a compromise.In a bid to maintain bargaining power, May warns that ""no deal is better than a bad deal."" That would lead to the imposition of World Trade Organization tariffs on products from cars to strawberries.Other issues to be discussed early on include the border between the two Irelands, the rights of EU citizens residing in the U.K. as well as Britons living in the bloc and regulatory agencies such as the European Banking Authority. The two sides may also have to line up a transitional phase between leaving the bloc and any new trade rules with banks threatening to shift staff from London if they don't get time to adjust.The task at hand is daunting. Philip Wood, special global counsel at law firm Allen & Overy's intelligence unit, estimated there are at least 339 negotiating points for Brexit, embracing security, intelligence and even science.""The most unsatisfactory result would be for the parties not to agree so that the U.K. just exits unilaterally,"" said Wood. ""We believe that this might leave the U.K. and the other nations of Europe embittered and resentful for a generation.""

732,PM,"Stocks kept a bullish tone in afternoon trading Wednesday as the indexes easily recouped last week's mild declines and more.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) continued to stage positive action following its breakout past a 118.12 cup-with-handle buy point. The megacap consumer tech play rose more than 1.5% to 121.90, stretching its gains past the proper entry point to nearly 3%.Volume was running 13% above average at around 1:30 pm New York time, another sign that the iPhone giant is still enjoying robust institutional sponsorship; watch to see how it finishes. Apple's 50-day average turnover is 29.8 million shares. The 5% buy zone extends up to 124.02.Apple is not the only company to reassert itself after a long, deep decline. Other stocks that have rebounded nicely following the formation of a bottoming basing process include Eagle Materials (EXP), GrubHub (GRUB) and Seagate Technology (STX).At 2:30pm ET, the Nasdaq composite rallied more than 0.8%, as did the small-cap Russell 2000. The Dow industrials and the S&P 500 were both up nearly 0.7%. Volume is running moderately higher on both exchanges.As noted in Tuesday's IBD Big Picture column, the above-average turnover on the NYSE as the major indexes gained sharply on Tuesday added further evidence that mutual funds, hedge funds, large investment advisors, banks, pensions and college endowments are busily accumulating shares. None of the down sessions on the S&P 500 this year have featured above-average turnover on the Big Board so far.Returning to Apple, keep a close eye on the stock action as investors wait for fiscal Q1 results, covering the October to December time frame, to be released after the market close on Jan. 31.As noted often in past Stock Market Today columns, Apple is trying to halt a three-quarter slump in earnings. The current estimate has been revised slightly up as the Street now sees earnings down just 2% to $3.22 a share. The strength of service-related revenue and the issue of whether Apple can get iPhone unit sales to grow again are major points of concern.Apple initially cleared its long bottoming base by rising past a 110.33 entry in a choppy cup with handle on Sept. 14. Shares rallied nearly 8%, then pulled back to test institutional support at the 200-day moving average.Apple's revenue is on consensus seen rising 2% to $77.4 billion. That would bust the company's unenviable three-quarter streak of falling revenue (-13%, -15% and -9% in the prior three quarters).However, Q2 sales may continue an accelerating trend as the Thomson Reuters forecast expects 6.9% growth to $54 billion. For all of FY 2017, which ends in September, the Street expects sales up 6.9%.IBD reported in its Click Tech Blog today that the upcoming iPhone 8 may get special 3D sensing features to allow users to have an augmented reality experience with their smartphones.Seagate Technology, gapping up more than 15% to 43.30, rushed past a 41.55 buy point within a deep cup with handle that is part of a long bottoming process. The 5% chase zone extends up to 43.63.Seagate reported a 68% jump in fourth-quarter earnings to $1.38 a share, crushing Wall Street's view by nearly 28%, as sales fell 3%, the smallest decline in seven quarters. Q1 profit is currently seen soaring 291% to 86 cents a share.GrubHub, No. 10 in the IBD 50, has been forming a new cup base that is nestled within a much longer, deeper cup structure that spans all the way back to its 47.95 high seen in early April of 2015.In that deep cup, GrubHub plunged 63% to as low as 17.77.GrubHub rallied 3% to 41.79, getting closer to a potential buy point at 44.68, 10 cents above the current base's left-side high.Eagle Materials, moving nicely after reporting a fourth straight quarter of double-digit profit growth, has broken out past a base-on-base pattern at 103.26. The 5% buy zone extends up to 108.42.Shares are up more than 3% to 108.04 in volume running 2-1/2 times normal levels.Eagle — which also posted accelerating revenue growth as sales rose 9% to $302 million, up from a 1% jump in Q3 — built its own bottoming base pattern when it slumped from 105.69 in 2014 to a multiyear low of 45.03 a year ago.RELATED:Seagate Flies On Strong Earnings Report; Western Digital Up NextThe Bottoming Base, Part I: How It Helps Investors Make MoneyThe Bottoming Base, Part II: Why Apple Formed One In 2009How To Invest: Master The Elements Of An Excellent Cup With HandleWhere To Find The Latest Earnings News In Tech

"
747,PM,"Now the funny thing is that the FED is clearly split....some say go, while other say no.......and yesterday's statement was supposed to remove any doubt at all about the coming increase.   Remember - the FED remains 'data dependent' so we will get two more months of 'data' before the FED meets again on Dec 16th/17th.....but remember - they may have wanted to send 'that wakeup call' but in the end - yesterday's statement DID NOT commit to a December move.....(they left the door slightly ajar so that they have an exit plan....)

756,PM,"So Twitter (TWTR) both beats and misses at the same time.......posting softer user growth - 320 mil avg monthly users vs. the expectation of 324 mil users - while also offering guidance that was less than upbeat.....BUT - they did beat on the top line - Revenues were $569 mil vs. exp of $559.6 mil.... the stock traded off 13% in after hours trading...but look....they had taken the stock up 30% off the lows of Oct 2 (the same day that they announced the appointment of Jack Dorsey as CEO) at $24.34.....so now they gave back 10% on this 'miss'.......so net net...the stock is still up 18% from those lows....was this is a classic 'buy the rumor/sell the fact' reaction?

They ONLY sold 48.05 mil units! But even that still represents a 22% y/y increase in growth!.... So? What's the fuss?

759,PM,"Yesterday - for the most part traders continued to avoid making any big commitments ahead of today's FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) monetary policy announcement.....Yesterday's action was a 'repeat' of the muted action on Monday as traders and investors really just sat on the sidelines...waiting and waiting.. 
"
760,PM,"Now the broader mkt essentially traded flat, but the transportation index (otherwise known as the 'Trannies') got hammered. (The Dow Transport Index is an index of 20 US transportation stocks....Airlines, truckers, rails etc... all stocks that are directly connected to the transportation of goods) Now why would this be so? A couple of reasons that all suggest a building global slowdown...... 
"
761,PM,"1. Yesterday's eco data - Durable Goods report - was not encouraging at all - it showed a continuing decline in durable goods orders for another month. Durable goods orders slid by 1.2% in September following a revised 3.0% decline in August. If we take out transportation equipment - durable goods orders still fell by 0.4% in September after declining by 0.9% in August. (Durable Goods are those goods that are not quickly consumed or replaced often - so think of appliances, cars, computers, home or office furnishings etc...) 
"
762,PM,"2. Consumer confidence showed a sharp retreat in September 3. Continued oil weakness So taken together - these data points indicate that a slowdown and loss of confidence and means less goods will be shipped. And if companies are shipping less goods then it makes sense that the trannies get hammered. And they did...the index was off 2.6% or 218 pts. Small caps also took it on the chin...and why? Because if investors believe that a recession or slowdown is on the horizon - they would rather put their money in 'Value Stocks - defined as 'large, safer, dividend paying American Blue Chips vs. the risk of small cap 'growth stocks'. So today is FED day...as if you didn't know that.....and stocks will remain in this holding pattern until precisely 2 pm.....(or maybe 1:59:30 if you 'BUY' access to the headlines before they actually hit the tape....but that is another story for another day...). 
"
763,PM,"The FED is not expected to change a thing.....rates will remain at zero....but do expect strategists and analysts to pull apart the statement 'word by word' looking for any clue as to FUTURE policy actions.....Really? Look - global stocks have been propelled higher because the ECB (European Central Bank) and the PBoC (Peoples Bank of China) launched additional stimulus - so now the only question is - Will Janet join in the party and serve up more Kool Aid? And if so - the stocks look relatively cheap in zero interest rate environment.....and cheap means a bargain and a bargain means that buyers will come in - at least for today.... Rue the day that all this free money just stops..... But let's not go there right now.... 
"
764,PM,"Overnight in Asia - mkts were mostly lower.....volumes were light as investors await the FED action.......continued weakness in commodities - oil, copper etc keeping the lid on...... Japan was the standout - rising by 0.68% as many await the BoJ (Bank of Japan) policy announcement next week. The expectation is that they will announce MORE KOOL AID for everyone! In Europe - mkts are all a bit higher....because they believe that the FED will do nothing and if so - then stocks will rally..... couple that with some good earnings and it's off to the races! FTSE +0.39%, CAC 40 +0.34%, DAX +0.64%, EUROSTOXX + 0.61%, SPAIN +0.32% and ITALY +0.88%. US futures are up 4 pts in early trading.... finding support yesterday at 2060 which is also the , now flattening out, 200 dma.......If we hold here then a surge up to 2100 is not out of the question at all.....if the mkt becomes disappointed with what they hear out of the FED then the a move back to the 2035 level would not be a surprise at all..... 
"
765,PM,"The focus is not about today...but about the future moves that the FED will make and that will depend upon how they position today's policy statement.... In the end though, I do not expect rates to rise in 2015 at all. They have successfully kicked that can into the 1Q of 2016..... Earnings today include: Hershey (HSY), General Dynamics (GD), International Paper (IP), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Valero Energy (VLO) , and the owner of the NYSE - Intercontinental Exchange (ICE).

I mean it seems that Twitter always misses on user growth, so what's the big deal? Now Apple  (AAPL) on the other hand - BEAT, BEAT, and slightly missed.... Beat on earnings, beat on revenue, but missed on IPhones sales targets - ..expectation was that they would sell 48.5 million units and they ONLY sold 48.05 mil units - Can you believe that? They ONLY sold 48.05 mil units! But even that still represents a 22% y/y increase in growth!.... So? What's the fuss? Now analysts pay very close attn to the 'units sold' to see if Apple can continue to grow this number - but the concern is - Will Apple become a victim of its own success?

767,PM,"So there were a number of surprises last week......First the ECB leaves rates alone but hints at more stimulus coming in December. Then overnight on Thurs/Friday - China announces further loosening in monetary policy in another bid to boost a slowing economy. And then after the bell on Thursday the 3 big tech stalwarts surprised the markets with much better…
"
768,PM,"Sophia Loren, Michelangelo, Benvenuto Cellini, Leonardo da Vinci, Guglielmo Marconi, Fibonacci (Leonardo Bonacci), Federico Fellini, Luciano Pavarotti - There is just a handful of famous Italians that have contributed immensely to Italian and world history ......and today - one of the most famous (and sexually charged) Italians comes to the NYSE......Today - we welcome Ferrari - ticker symbol RACE to the NYSE family of companies.
"
769,PM,"Ferrari - is an Italian luxury sports car manufacturer - founded by Enzo Ferrari in 1929....originally to build race cars...in 1947 - Ferrari moved into the production of 'street legal' luxury cars. In 1969 FIAT acquired 50% of the company and in 1988 took control of 40% more taking their total stake to 90%.
"
770,PM,"In 2014 Fiat Chrysler announced that it would sell 10% of the company to the public and today is the day.....expect the 'street' to be awash in testosterone as the excitement builds....
"
771,PM,"Broad Street - now known as 'experience square' has a dozen Ferrari's on display - 'only to look at - no touching allowed' ...which will only serve to drive the men into a frenzy..... The IPO was priced last night at $52/share - at the high end of the range - and was 'way oversubscribed' .....so instead of raising the IPO price to cool demand - they decided to remain within the range to create the 'desire' in the aftermarket......You can feel the excitement building, the tingle in your spine, the rapid breathing, the toe curling excitement and the rush of blood as the heart beats faster and faster exploding with fury as the opening bell rings.....( What a great way to start the day - I 'm exhausted already...)
"
772,PM,"Stocks chopped yesterday - as healthcare stocks got whacked over more political wrangling and investors/traders grew concerned about IBM (IBM) earnings and mounting concerns over Marissa Meyers options at Yahoo (YHOO) .......... The choppy trading on Wall Street suggests that traders are uncertain about the near-term direction of equities following the recent volatility and continuing disappointments in earnings reports and forward guidance.
"
773,PM,"IBM shares dropped 5.75% (or $8.50) after the company reported lower quarterly revenue for the 14th straight quarter - they also lowered guidance for the fiscal year.
"
774,PM,"So - investors and traders reacted to how far off the mark IBM's stock price was from fundamentals. The stronger dollar in this case - did hurt. The stock has been in a downtrend since July as investors began to re-price the company based on $ concerns..........breaking every support level it had only to find support at the $140 level in late August....churning and building a new base...............It was only in the last month that investors/traders thought that maybe the market had adjusted for it and punished it enough causing some to go on a bargain hunting spree. Well - that didn't work out too well...yesterday's news sent the stock right back down to those lows.....the question now is: Will it find support in here at $140/share?
"
775,PM,"YHOO - also disappointed - and warned about what the future holds - putting Mayer's turnaround plan in jeopardy.....causing her to announce a new plan - a resetting of sorts after two top executive 'flew the coop'.....saying that the changes are 'the result of careful planning' - one should ask - who's planning was it?
"
776,PM,"More broadly - 70% of companies so far have beat on the bottom line while only 40% of companies have beat on the top revenue line...this is becoming more of a problem, causing a disconnect between fundamentals and stock prices.....despite all of the rhetoric from Washington that the economy is doing just fine......
"
777,PM,"When the recession of 2008 hit and continued to hammer earnings, stock prices eventually fell hard. Are we gearing up for another fall? Technically, we are still struggling, bulls and bears are locked in a battle.....All of the major indexes are still in a downtrend....their 50 dma's are trending below their 200 dma's and all have found resistance as they have recently approached this longer-term technical indicator. So we remain locked in a tight range.
"
778,PM,"Next up - Oil and energy stocks.....what will they say about the current state of the economy? My sense is that stocks will stay in a sideways channel (1985/2050) as long as oil prices remain in the $43 to $50 range. If oil breaks $43 then look for stocks to come under renewed pressure breaking below 1985...and if for some reason - oil pierces $50 (unlikely in the short term) then we will see renewed excitement for stocks....taking us to the longer-term resistance at 2060. Now overnight oil fell 2% and is now trading at $45.75/barrel.....which will only cause some to remain laser-focused on today's EIA report. (Energy Information Admin).

779,PM,"Look for reports from BA, KO, ABT, BHI, BIOGEN, NT, GM, EMC, STJ and ITW today - as well as one FED Governor - Jerome Powell who will be speaking at 1:30 pm. - Will he give us a clue about what rates will do in October? My money says - no rate hike..... .

787,PM,"This should have been the opening remark from Janet Yellen yesterday during her Congressional Humphrey Hawkins testimony....The song is right - it has been a bit confusing of late - BUT Yellen - as you might expect remains upbeat about the U.S. economy, citing an increase in consumer spending (forget the fact that retail sales declined by 0.3% in Tuesday's report) along with the improving employment picture (where exactly that is - is another question) as she prepares investors for the coming increase in rates.......

If nothing else - the deal does provide some respite and will allow that country to return to some sense of normalcy. For the markets - yesterday's vote did represent a major hurdle and now that it is over investors can move forward and look ahead - this morning it is clear that the 'Risk On' mentality is alive and well as Global markets are all in relief rally mode.

For the markets - yesterday's vote did represent a major hurdle and now that it is over investors can move forward and look ahead - this morning it is clear that the 'Risk On' mentality is alive and well as Global markets are all in relief rally mode.Now do not discount the good earnings that we have seen so far......the Banks here in the U.S. have not disappointed (good) add in Netflix (NFLX), Intel (INTC) and UnitedHealth (UNH) and the tone of earnings feels decidedly positive.....Yes - I understand that we are only 4 days into it - but considering what analysts had prepared the street for - it is a welcomed relief that initial reports are 'better than expected'.Economic data at home today includes Initial Jobless claims of 285k, Continuing Claims of 2.3 mil - both would be an improvement over last week, Philly Fed Survey - expectation is 12.0. In Europe - we are awaiting the ECB rate decision - expectation is for NO change - rates to remain low.....but the real focus will be if the ECB ups the ante for Greek assistance.Since Yellen's second day of testimony is to yield no surprises - the only thing we will be waiting for is the Q&A from the Senators - let's hope that we do not see the stupidity displayed by congressman Sean Duffy (R-Wis.) yesterday - as he attacked Ms. Yellen during her testimony over documents related to a possible Fed leak in October of 2012 - when Uncle Benny was in charge...European markets are all up - FTSE +0.43% , CAC 40 + 1.39%, DAX + 1.50%, EUROSTOXX +1.38%, SPAIN +1.32% and ITALY +1.28%.... and here, too, the focus will now turn to earnings - which are also coming in better than expected - Banks and retailers showing early strength.......Greece will now be returned to the back burner until the next crisis......Technically - we are above all of the moving averages....and they all now represent support...... U.S. futures are up 8 points in early trade looking to test the recent highs at 2125ish.....earnings today include Charles Schwab (SCHW), Ebay (EBAY), PPG (beat), Philip Morris (PM) (beat) , Goldman Sachs (GS), and Citigroup (C) to name just a few.....The tone is decidedly bullish - a complete change from last week as investors celebrate the good news.Take good care -KpKenny Polcari is Vice President and director of NYSE Floor Operations on behalf of O'Neil Securities, Inc., a sister company of Investor's Business Daily.

Alexis Tsipras was elected on the platform of ""Screw the European Union"" - Remember - he was the one that claimed that he would not accept one more ounce of austerity, or cuts, or tax increases (not that anyone in Greece pays taxes - so what difference does that make?)
"
838,PM,"Following months of ranting and raving against Germany and the Troika (IMF, ECB and EU) - He rejected plan after plan then forced a referendum vote in his country, campaigned for his citizens to vote 'NO' - and when they 'overwhelmingly agreed' that last week's deal was a bad one - he then sold them down the river! He made such a dramatic reversal that it's almost laughable.....and to make it more ridiculous - the latest 'final offer' is far worse than ones he had turned down!

China - which has been the focus of late - reported trade figures showing that exports rose 2.8%, substantially beating the expectation of +0.2%.....on a side note - Gov't officials tried to temper the mood saying that 'exports are likely to face relatively big pressure in the coming months'.

Who would have thought of using real names? Over the weekend - Xinhua - the state owned news outlet - reported that some brokerage houses were 'suspected of manipulating futures prices and other malicious practices.

Shoji Hirakawa, Chief equity strategist at Oksan Securities, did say that the fund looks like they still have another 4 or 5 trillion Yen left to put to work in the Japanese stock market - Ah…Hello??? 5 Trillion more Yen going into stocks....Anyone want to stand in front of that train?

Good for today - but if Tsipras can't deliver - then expect it to all fall apart mid-week. Even if he does deliver - and that is a big ""IF"" - will he be able to hold onto his position as PM? Relief- sure.....Greece now has 72 hours to vote in the reforms. There is already trouble brewing in Parliament - you can imagine the rage among those that supported Tsipras in his efforts and now feel like he turned his back on them.

""Japan's investment will help promote infrastructure projects in Asia, expanding business opportunities for Japanese companies.""Japan will have JBIC provide more funds to infrastructure projects in Asia via public-private partnerships in a bid to introduce more efficient management methods, according to the finance ministry. Japan will also promote private sector investment in infrastructure projects through yen-dominated loans to governments that plan public-private partnerships.Annual funding by Japan and the ADB for high-quality infrastructure projects currently totals about $17 billion, according to the finance ministry. The increase over the next five years will be by about 25%.

"
980,PM,"Frustration is running high among creditors who have bargained with PM Alexis Tsipras and his left-wing political party Syriza to little effect. Their recent offer to extend the current bailout program to March has gotten little traction.
"
981,PM,"Meanwhile, many analysts say the Tsipras government may soon fall, creating further political and economic turmoil.
"

"
983,PM,"Even if Greece accepts a deal with a bailout extension, the past months can't be undone, said Jacob Kirkegaard of the Peterson Institute for International Economics: ""Because Syriza is so incompetent, they have dragged out this agreement for so long that by now the economic damage to Greece is much larger than it needed to have been, and this is a deal that Tsipras probably could have gotten all the way back in February.""
"
984,PM,"Self-Inflicted Wound
"
985,PM,"Greece tumbled back into a recession in Q1, as economic activity contracted and capital fled the country. It's likely the country now has a primary deficit, Kirkegaard said. That means even if Syriza achieves one of its key objectives, a lower deficit target that would ease measures it deems austere, it will be harder to meet. ""He's politically painted himself completely into a corner,"" he said.
"
986,PM,"It's not even clear that the extension idea will be accepted.
"
987,PM,"After creditors met without Greek representatives last week, Tsipras addressed a restive parliament, denouncing what he called ""illogical"" proposals from creditors.

996,PM,"Both scenarios would be ""tricky,"" Kirkegaard said, because while a referendum would likely pass, it could split Syriza and ""lead to a collapse of the government.""
"
997,PM,"It's also not clear who could challenge Syriza, he added.
"
998,PM,"In either scenario, there could be several chaotic weeks in which the government would have to implement capital controls. Whatever the eventual political solution, the blow to Greece's economy could equal as much as a 5% contraction, Kirkegaard asserted: ""It's a very bad scenario.

1100,PM,"The US Trade Deficit - So you ask - what is that? And why is that measure now being credited with putting pressure on the mkt?
"
1101,PM,"The Trade Deficit is 'an economic measure of a negative balance of trade in which a country's imports exceeds its exports. The Trade Deficit represents an outflow of domestic currency to foreign markets' - Investopedia
"
1102,PM,"And why is this a problem? The theory goes that as the deficit widens - that means that more US dollars are being held by foreign nations - who at some point 'may' decide to sell them - which would put pressure on the value of the US dollar.....hmmmm pressure on the dollar would drive the dollar lower - something that the FED worked very hard to achieve over the past 7 yrs - causing a 200%+ run in the mkt......... so why now is a 'weaker dollar' causing tremors in the mkt?
"
1103,PM,"Now - Since August 2014 - we have seen the dollar rise 23% and have had to listen to all the analysts tell us how 'negative' the stronger dollar was going to be for the US economy.....Yet - the mkt continued to advance and companies did NOT get broadly slammed as we were told they would............Look - a strong dollar is indicative of a strong economy - thus when the dollar is strong - the 'perception' is that the economy is strong......so herein lies the conundrum.....Is our dollar strong because the economy IS strong or because other major currencies are weak due to those ""QE"" programs abroad? And IF that is the reason for our strong dollar - then maybe it's not all a bed of roses......and in fact maybe the economy is not so robust - causing a near term re-pricing of risk.
"
1104,PM,"Well - at least in the 1Q of 2015 - we have learned that the economy is not so strong...in fact with yesterday's trade deficit read - we can now expect 1Q GDP to be revised lower - taking it clearly into negative territory when we get this month's revision. And so - the reality of the 'state of the union' hits home as strategists play with the numbers in their excel spreadsheets to come up with new valuations - causing the algo's to light up as risk is re-priced.
"
1105,PM,"The mkt began weak but then turned uglier as the day wore on as the analysis of the underlying economics kept getting uglier. The move lower more than offset the gains seen over the past 2 days and once we started breaking support levels - the algo's then ramped it up and selling begets selling.....

This caught many analysts/strategists by surprise....and when they are surprised you can imagine what happens to the algo's.......

And why is that measure now being credited with putting pressure on the mkt?The Trade Deficit is 'an economic measure of a negative balance of trade in which a country's imports exceeds its exports. The Trade Deficit represents an outflow of domestic currency to foreign markets' - InvestopediaAnd why is this a problem? The theory goes that as the deficit widens - that means that more US dollars are being held by foreign nations - who at some point 'may' decide to sell them - which would put pressure on the value of the US dollar.....hmmmm pressure on the dollar would drive the dollar lower - something that the FED worked very hard to achieve over the past 7 yrs - causing a 200%+ run in the mkt......... so why now is a 'weaker dollar' causing tremors in the mkt?Now - Since August 2014 - we have seen the dollar rise 23% and have had to listen to all the analysts tell us how 'negative' the stronger dollar was going to be for the US economy.....Yet - the mkt continued to advance and companies did NOT get broadly slammed as we were told they would............Look - a strong dollar is indicative of a strong economy - thus when the dollar is strong - the 'perception' is that the economy is strong......so herein lies the conundrum.....Is our dollar strong because the economy IS strong or because other major currencies are weak due to those ""QE"" programs abroad? And IF that is the reason for our strong dollar - then maybe it's not all a bed of roses......and in fact maybe the economy is not so robust - causing a near term re-pricing of risk.Well - at least in the 1Q of 2015 - we have learned that the economy is not so strong...in fact with yesterday's trade deficit read - we can now expect 1Q GDP to be revised lower - taking it clearly into negative territory when we get this month's revision. And so - the reality of the 'state of the union' hits home as strategists play with the numbers in their excel spreadsheets to come up with new valuations - causing the algo's to light up as risk is re-priced.The mkt began weak but then turned uglier as the day wore on as the analysis of the underlying economics kept getting uglier. The move lower more than offset the gains seen over the past 2 days and once we started breaking support levels - the algo's then ramped it up and selling begets selling.....Rising volatility and continued concerns over Greece, China, the FED, The ECB, Oil, Bonds - both US and European, the dollar, earnings and collapsing revenues all contributed to the building negative mood yesterday... The major indexes all ended the day firmly in negative territory breaking below the short term 50 dma support line........

The ISM reported that manufacturing activity continues to hold steady ... as they reported a read of 51.5 — unchanged from March — but a bit below what analysts had expected. Remember, anything above 50 is a sign of expansion; so if you believe the numbeR, then we are seeing continued growth in the manufacturing sector.

Mkts will be listening to Chicago Fed Pres Evans at 12:25 pm and San Fran's Fed Pres Williams at 3:10 pm - both of these men are considered ""doves"" so look for the slow and steady approach to any rate rise....I would look for the mkt to remain range bound, as it teases with resistance at 2115-ish early on..... With no negative data out — the path of least resistance is up. But will there be enough strength to push us up and thru to new highs right now? Not so much.On a side note — I will be attending the Best Buddies New York Fundraiser on Wednesday May 20th at NY's Carnegie Hall. Tickets are now on sale and can be had by clicking on this link: www.bestbuddiesnewyork.org(Best Buddies is a global volunteer movement to create opportunities for one to one friendships, integrated employment and leadership development for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.)Take good care —KpKenny Polcari is Vice President and director of NYSE Floor Operations on behalf of O’Neil Securities, Inc., a sister company of Investor's Business Daily.

1183,PM,"Stocks on Monday failed to hold onto the early gains — as worries over the macro data, dollar strength and earnings once again weighed on traders' minds. All of the averages pulled back to end the day in negative territory. In my opinion — the action was more about profit taking after the move higher late last week and yesterday morning - all ahead of what could be more volatility and weakness in the days ahead. Will reports play on the strong dollar as a reason for the weakened earnings? Will they blame the consumer? Will it be global economic weakness? I mean estimates have already been slashed for all of these reasons — so will it just be more of the same?
"
1184,PM,"Today brings us JPMorgan Chase (JPM) & Wells Fargo (WFC) — later in the week they will be joined by Bank of America (BAC) and Goldman Sachs (GS) …. in what will the 1st qtr look like for the financials. Rising legal and regulatory expenses, slowing mortgage lending, a decrease in trading revenues, a collapsing energy space all will play into the mix… YTD - though, financials have underperformed the broader mkt.....down about 2% for the group....followed only by energy and utilities.......
"
1185,PM,"But like we said — earnings represent history — what is important is what the future looks like….and recently the Credit Managers Index (CMI) has reported an increase in rejected credit applications — this spike coming only in the last month — too late for any real impact on 1st qtr earnings but a clear indicator of what may be in store. With credit tight once again — will it bring the country to a grinding halt? Look — lending can be a risky business and with the global economy still struggling, along with the exposure created by the collapsing oil mkt, coupled with the threat of rising US interest rates — the future is anything but clear. But remember — investment bankers are keen to play with the numbers - they are well known for redefining common accounting practices...but hey.....it works for them and the regulators don't seem to mind.....……so what rabbit will they pull out of the hat? I do not expect them to 'miss the numbers' JPM announces early - and earnings are expected to +8% at $1.39/sh on revenues of $24.4 bil or a 2% increase yoy, WFC on the other hand is due to report a bit weaker numbers... 98 cents/sh - a 7% decline on revenues of $21.2 bil.

"
1187,PM,"Last night after the bell - we heard from Norfolk Southern (NSC) - in pre-release commentary - they prepared investors for a disappointment - not because of the dollar ..Oh No....it was because of 'lower fuel SURCHARGE revenue'.....(and lower coal shipments).....but isn't this just a kick in the pants? Oil declines in price bringing untold benefits to transportation companies along with a host of others and now Norfolk Southern tells us that earnings could be down 15% because they CAN'T charge higher fuel surcharges?
"
1188,PM,"(A surcharge is an ADD'L charge or payment on top of a regular cost.....so if investors are buying Norfolk - because they are able to increase revenues by increasing surcharges - then someone should think about a new portfolio manager......Surcharges do not represent organic growth, or an improved outlook - they only represent the ability of companies to fleece their clients with add'l fees etc......

1227,PM,"657 days of Obama's reign. And it creates a potentially historic opportunity for Republicans.Not to mention its potential impact on political fundraising as a presidential election nears. Jews have long been major supporters and donors to Democrats. And Hillary Clinton, the presumptive 2016 Democrat nominee, presided over Obama's lackluster foreign policy throughout his first term.Obama's inexplicable antipathy toward and impatience with Israel have long been known. During his first term Obama was caught on a live mic complaining to the French president about having to talk with and listen to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu all the time.When the Israeli leader came to Washington last month to address Congress at the invitation of GOP House Speaker John Boehner, dozens of Democrats on Capitol Hill boycotted the stirring address, and others such as Nancy Pelosi criticized Netanyahu strongly, saying he insulted American intelligence. Here's a list of those Democrats who announced their boycott.Netanyahu's Churchillian address undermined Obama's attempt to sell the developing pact as a bar to Iran developing nuclear weapons. The pact as being drafted would actually pave the way for such weapons development, Netanyahu charged.Really brave but unidentified Obama aides used derogatory terms to describe Netanyahu to complicit Washington reporters.Obama

The Obama team even redacted revealing parts about other nations, but not Israel.Obama was too busy to see the leader of the Mideast's only functioning democracy last month. And Vice President Joe Biden found an urgent need to visit Latin America on the same day.But now for the first time a Rasmussen Reports poll has found the antipathy toward America's long-time ally has spread into Democrat party membership. The new poll, released Thursday, found that only a minority of Democrats (45%) still consider Israel an ally. While somehow a larger percentage (55%) see Mexico as an ally.This compares with the overwhelming 76% of Republicans who still see Israel as a strong U.S. ally.The Israel results came as part of a broader Rasmussen poll on which countries 800 American adults consider allies. As usual, Canada came out on top with 86%, while Great Britain came in a close second at 84%. Canada is seen as an enemy by two percent of adult Americans, apparent veterans of the War of 1812.On Thursday while enroute to a Louisville photo-op, Obama called to brief Netanyahu on the agreement to continue negotiations with Iran. According to a White House description of the U.S. side of the conversation, Obama said:""While nothing is agreed until everything is, the framework represents significant progress towards a lasting, comprehensive solution that cuts off all of Iran’s pathways to a bomb and verifiably ensures the peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear program going forward.""(Obama) underscored that progress on the nuclear issue in no way diminishes our concerns with respect to Iran’s sponsorship of terrorism and threats towards Israel and emphasized that the United States remains steadfast in our commitment to the security of Israel.""Obama's pitch and promises apparently did not gain much traction with the reelected Israeli leader.Shortly after the call, Netanyahu's personal spokesman, Mark Regev, tweeted: ""PM Netanyahu to Pres Obama: A deal based on this framework would threaten the survival of Israel.""RELATED:New 🙁 poll news for HillaryNetanyahu's ominous warning on Iran to AmericansWhat is Obama's problem calling radical Islam radical Islam?

1281,PM,"Global reaction to the come-from-behind, convincing reelection of Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was quick, thanks to Twitter, and almost universally delighted Wednesday. Save for one disturbing and unexplained mystery.Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron chimed in even before all votes were counted. (See image above.)Canada's steadfast Prime Minister Stephen Harper: ""I congratulate PM Netanyahu on his election results. We look fwd to working w/ the gov't once formed. Israel has no greater friend than Cda.""India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi: ""Congratulations my friend Bibi @netanyahu! Recall our New York meeting last September warmly.""First to launch effusive congratulations in the United States was Jeb Bush: ""Congratulations to Prime Minister @netanyahu on his re-election. He’s a true leader who will continue to keep Israel strong and secure.""Gov. Mitt Romney: “Congratulations once again to my friend, PM @netanyahu May our nations' friendship also long endure.”Gov. Scott Walker, who knows a little something about hard-fought election victories: ""Congratulations to @Netanyahu on a hard-earned victory. Now the U.S. and Israel must stand together and stand up to Iran.""Gov. Sarah Palin: ""Congratulations, Prime Minister Netanyahu. Thank you to the good people of Israel for supporting a leader who will stand up and fight for all the free world while other leaders sit down. The Heartland of America will sleep better knowing Bibi remains the voice of reason and strength in the beautiful nation of Israel; for when Israel is safe, we are safe.""House Speaker John Boehner: ""Let me congratulate my friend as the new prime minister of Israel. Looking forward to our continued strong relationship between Israel and the United States to the benefit of our countries.""Gov. Mike Huckabee: ""Netanyahu risked his political life for the life of his country.""Sen. Rand Paul: ""Congrats to Prime Minister @netanyahu on his historic re-election to a 4th term as Israel's leader. Israel is a strong ally & friend!""Gov. Bobby Jindal: ""Everyone knows that the Obama Administration was rooting for the Prime Minister to lose, but it’s time for the President to change course.""Sen. Ted Cruz: ""Prime Minister Netanyahu has been an extraordinary leader for Israel, and I congratulate him.... His electoral success is all the more impressive given the powerful forces that tried to undermine him, including, sadly, the full weight of the Obama political team. American officials should not be undermining the elected leaders of our closest allies, especially when Prime Minister Netanyahu’s heroic — even Churchillian — opposition to a nuclear Iran has done such tremendous service to U.S. national security.""Sen. Mark Kirk: ""Good news tonight from #Israel, our greatest ally in the Middle East. Congrats @Netanyahu""Gov. Rick Perry: ""I am very happy for my good friend, Bibi Netanyahu. But regardless of one’s thoughts of yesterday’s outcome, the United States should be unequivocally committed to our ally Israel and to promoting policies that protect our shared interests....""Perhaps you've noticed the American pattern here. Republicans are the most effusive in praise for the Israeli ally. Democrats, who've benefited the most from millions of Jewish votes and dollars for generations since Democrat Pres. Harry Truman recognized Israel in 1948, were strangely reticent.And their silence augurs a worrisome worsening of relations between the two countries at a precarious time in that region.Here's Rep. Nancy Pelosi: ""The people of Israel have spoken. I respect the results that they have produced.”President Obama as commander-in-chief and president has been most active in offering congratulations to leaders all over the world throughout his terms.In 2012, Obama called personally to congratulate Vladimir Putin on his return to the Russian presidency despite credible allegations of widespread voting fraud, including charges by Obama's own State Department.That same year Obama called to congratulate Xi JinPing on his ""election"" as China's president by the Communist Party. The American also called to congratulate Egypt's new president, Mohammed Morsi, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. Last year Obama phoned to congratulate Egypt's even newer president, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the army general who ousted Morsi and was elected president.Obama even called the king of Saudi Arabia not about any election; that would be ludicrous in a country still practicing beheadings where women can't drive. Obama wanted to personally congratulate the king merely on naming an heir.And you might recall that in 2013 Obama made a very unusual phone call to Hassan Rouhani, the newly-elected president of Iran, the regime that crushed democracy demonstrators in 2009 and remains world's top exporter of terrorism. Obama wanted to wish Rouhani all the best on taking office.Obama was in Cleveland Wednesday recycling his economy speech for a disappointing lame-duck audience of only 465.But here's the complete text of what the president of the United States had to say about the successful Israeli election in America's closest Middle Eastern ally: ""                                       .                                                                                                               ""RELATED:Hillary Clinton must turn over her email serverInside the polls: A new list of GOP front-runnersHow Netanyahu's speech to Congress undermines Obama's deceit

1416,PM,"Near the end of 2014, we discussed the potential benefits of actively managed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in helping investors navigate the credit cycle. In early 2012, WisdomTree selected Western Asset Management Company (Western) to serve as sub-advisor for certain fixed income strategies, including the WisdomTree Strategic Corporate Bond Fund (CRDT).1 Looking ahead, we anticipate that many other well-respected managers will begin to enter the actively managed ETF space. A key question from many investors will be how these managers plan to transfer the success they've had in mutual funds or separately managed accounts to the ETF structure. Looking back over the past two years, we seek to highlight some of the attributes that contributed to CRDT beating 90% of all other open-ended mutual funds and ETFs in the Morningstar ""World Bond"" category since its inception (CRDT ranked 37th out of 367 funds for the period 1/31/12 to 12/31/14, based on total return). 2 WisdomTree Strategic Corporate Bond Fund (CRDT) vs. Barclays Global Credit Index (Hedged) & Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index (1/31/13- 1/31/15)

1418,PM,"#1: Team-Based Approach That Identifies Value Western's key investment philosophy hinges on long-term, fundamental value and diversification. What this means is that it tries to combine the fundamental view of a security with the security's pricing in the marketplace. Identifying dislocations between fundamentals and prices is its definition of value. As a result, since Western has done its homework on the way in, it's easier to have conviction to stay invested. If current market pricing drops, and the fundamental value view has not changed, then Western would potentially add to the position or strategy. A perfect example of this process in practice is investments in the debt of certain banks in the U.S. In the last few years, many banks have spun off noncore businesses and reduced debt. While earnings may have recently disappointed equity markets,3 continued deleveragingand back-to-basics banking are clear positives for investing in their debt. 
"
1419,PM,"#2: Combination of Top-Down & Bottom-up Analysis Top-down analysis often refers to the macroeconomic view: Which countries and sectors look attractively priced? Bottom-up analysis looks at the underlying fundamentals of a specific issuer compared to its competitors. You can see the integration of the top-down and bottom-up processes when you look at the structure of Western's trading floor. Analysts, traders and portfolio managers (PMs) all sit next to one another on the floor to exchange ideas. On the desk, the analyst role is not considered a junior position or a necessary rotation on the path to becoming a PM. In fact, this role is generally considered a career-track position. Analysts are able to take ownership of a specific trade idea from the very early stages all the way through implementation and monitoring.

1425,PM,"Near the end of 2014, we discussed the potential benefits of actively managed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in helping investors navigate the credit cycle. In early 2012, WisdomTree selected Western Asset Management Company (Western) to serve as sub-advisor for certain fixed income strategies, including the WisdomTree Strategic Corporate Bond Fund (CRDT).1 Looking ahead, we anticipate that many other well-respected managers will begin to enter the actively managed ETF space. A key question from many investors will be how these managers plan to transfer the success they've had in mutual funds or separately managed accounts to the ETF structure. Looking back over the past two years, we seek to highlight some of the attributes that contributed to CRDT beating 90% of all other open-ended mutual funds and ETFs in the Morningstar ""World Bond"" category since its inception (CRDT ranked 37th out of 367 funds for the period 1/31/12 to 12/31/14, based on total return). 2 WisdomTree Strategic Corporate Bond Fund (CRDT) vs. Barclays Global Credit Index (Hedged) & Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index (1/31/13- 1/31/15) For current performance of CRDT, click here. #1: Team-Based Approach That Identifies Value Western's key investment philosophy hinges on long-term, fundamental value and diversification. What this means is that it tries to combine the fundamental view of a security with the security's pricing in the marketplace. Identifying dislocations between fundamentals and prices is its definition of value. As a result, since Western has done its homework on the way in, it's easier to have conviction to stay invested. If current market pricing drops, and the fundamental value view has not changed, then Western would potentially add to the position or strategy. A perfect example of this process in practice is investments in the debt of certain banks in the U.S. In the last few years, many banks have spun off noncore businesses and reduced debt. While earnings may have recently disappointed equity markets,3 continued deleveragingand back-to-basics banking are clear positives for investing in their debt. #2: Combination of Top-Down & Bottom-up Analysis Top-down analysis often refers to the macroeconomic view: Which countries and sectors look attractively priced? Bottom-up analysis looks at the underlying fundamentals of a specific issuer compared to its competitors. You can see the integration of the top-down and bottom-up processes when you look at the structure of Western's trading floor. Analysts, traders and portfolio managers (PMs) all sit next to one another on the floor to exchange ideas. On the desk, the analyst role is not considered a junior position or a necessary rotation on the path to becoming a PM. In fact, this role is generally considered a career-track position. Analysts are able to take ownership of a specific trade idea from the very early stages all the way through implementation and monitoring.

"
1427,PM,"There are risks associated with investing, including possible loss of principal. Foreign investing involves special risks, such as risk of loss from currency fluctuation or political or economic uncertainty. Investments in emerging, offshore or frontier markets are generally less liquid and less efficient than investments in developed markets and are subject to additional risks, such as risks of adverse governmental regulation and intervention or political developments. Derivative investments can be volatile, and these investments may be less liquid than other securities, and more sensitive to the effects of varied economic conditions.

1428,PM,"Fixed income investments are subject to interest rate risk; their value will normally decline as interest rates rise. In addition, when interest rates fall, income may decline. Fixed income investments are also subject to credit risk, the risk that the issuer of a bond will fail to pay interest and principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer's ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. Unlike typical exchange-traded funds, there is no index that the Fund attempts to track or replicate.

1459,PM,"Security: In a country with strict gun control and without a Second Amendment, an armed citizen stopped a terrorist attack as our neighbor to the north becomes a jihadi target.When Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, aka Michael Hall, was shot dead by Kevin Vickers, the House of Commons sergeant-at-arms, the jihadist wannabe and Muslim convert had already murdered Corporal Nathan Cirillo, a guard at Canada's National War Memorial, and was inside Canada's Parliament building, very near a room where Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper was meeting with members of his Conservative Party.""PM (Harper) was addressing caucus, then a huge boom, followed by rat-a-tat shots. We all scattered. It was clearly right outside our caucus door,"" Treasury Board Minister Tony Clement told Reuters.If not for Vickers and his firearm, there's no telling of how big this tragedy could have been.This was the second of two jihadi-wannabe attacks in Canada in two days, and it's not a stretch to view them as a response to the Islamic State (IS) call for disenchanted Westerners to join the fight with ""lone wolf"" attacks on soldiers, police and institutions.The Canadian Parliament had just voted to join coalition airstrikes against IS targets in Iraq.Both attacks occurred in what might be called the world's largest gun-free zone — Canada. The Firearms Act and Regulations spell out who is allowed to have and carry a handgun.Under Canada's Criminal Code, handguns are either classified as restricted or prohibited, and require an ""authorization to carry"" that must be obtained from the chief firearms officer for their province or territory.There is no Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms in Canada. Persons authorized by a government bureaucrat to own and carry a gun in Canada usually fall into one of two categories — those who require one because of their occupation, such as armored car or bank guards, and those who need one for ""the protection of life."" The latter are rare and include only individuals who face verifiable threats and whom the police feel they cannot adequately protect.Speaking with MSNBC's Tamron Hall, Canadian Press correspondent Lee-Anne Goodman observed that occurrences such as the Parliament shooting aren't supposed to happen in Ottawa, where there are ""pretty tight gun-control laws."" As a result of the shooting, the nature and scope of Canada's gun-control laws are ""going to become a debate,"" she added.Thankfully, Kevin Vickers was authorized to carry a firearm. Most Canadians are not, and if the Parliament shooter had chosen a softer target, such as a school or movie theater, Canada might have had its own Columbine or Aurora, Colo., massacre on its hands. Both were gun-free zones.Just such a gun-free zone policy is why the Aurora shooter carefully chose the theater he did.And unlike the mall in Clackamass, Ore., where a concealed-carry holder prevented a huge massacre, there was no one in Aurora to shoot back.The Islamic State has issued a global call to lone wolves. One could be standing behind you on the bus, walking next to you at the mall or sitting in the next cubicle. In the age of the Islamic State and solo terrorism, gun-free zones are simply an invitation for terrorism.In Moore, Okla., where another good guy with a gun stopped a lone-wolf jihadi who had beheaded an office worker, the life-saving value of the Second Amendment was proved once again. Private ownership of firearms may be our secret weapon in the ongoing war against terrorism, and it could be Canada's as well.

1460,PM,"Middle East: The Obama administration obviously thinks it has nothing to learn from anyone. Witness the way the State Department continues to deride the words of wisdom and warnings from Israel's eloquent leader.'We would not agree with that characterization,"" was how State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki pushed aside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's stirring United Nations speech on Monday arguing that all the varied strains of militant Islam — the Islamic State, Hamas, al-Qaida, Iran, and all the rest — belong to a sole, poisonous ideology.""They all seek to create ever-expanding enclaves of militant Islam where there is no freedom and no tolerance,"" Netanyahu pointed out, ""where women are treated as chattel, Christians are decimated and minorities are subjugated, sometimes given the stark choice: convert or die. For them, anyone can be an infidel, including fellow Muslims.""Facts, and the most recent of statements that are on the public record, do not lie, and Netanyahu was fully armed with such evidence.""ISIS and Hamas are branches of the same poisonous tree,"" Netanyahu said, comparing the new, bloodthirsty Islamic State to the Palestinian terrorist group voted into power in Gaza, which this year alone shot thousands of rockets into Israel, many supplied by Iran.The Jewish state's PM quoted IS caliph Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's declaration from two months ago: ""A day will soon come when the Muslim will walk everywhere as a master. The Muslims will cause the world to hear and understand the meaning of terrorism and destroy the idol of democracy.""Then Netanyahu quoted Hamas leader Khaled Mashal's markedly ""similar vision of the future,"" in which Mashal made this pronouncement: ""We say this to the West — by Allah you will be defeated. Tomorrow our nation will sit on the throne of the world.""Hamas even condemns America ""for killing Osama bin Laden, whom they praised as a holy warrior,"" Netanyahu noted.Jerusalem-based moderate Muslim journalist Khaled Abu Toameh, recently awarded the 2014 Daniel Pearl Prize for courage and integrity in journalism by the Los Angeles Press Club, and who has been reporting on Palestinian affairs for over three decades, agrees with Netanyahu's comparison of IS and Hamas.On Tuesday he told the Gatestone Institute in New York City that IS wins popular sympathy by convincing Muslims that it is ""being attacked because we present the real Islam. And similarly with Hamas: Each time Israel strikes Hamas, Hamas becomes more popular according to all public opinion polls.""The reason why John Kerry's State Department doesn't want to accept the obvious truth about the different branches of armed pan-Islamism is that State, and President Obama, have fantasies of grand peace accords, not just between Israelis and Palestinians but also with Iran. Even to the extent of believing that an Iran nuclear deal can help eradicate the IS monster.There are plenty of others on the long list of jihadists around the world, and Netanyahu named names, including Lebanon's Hezbollah, Iraq's Mahdi army and various Al-Qaida branches still alive and kicking.But he brought one country into the sharpest focus: Islamofascist Iran.Tehran's current ""manipulative charm offensive,"" Netanyahu warned, is designed ""for one purpose only: to lift the sanctions and remove the obstacles to Iran's path to the bomb,"" after which ""the world's most dangerous regime, in the world's most dangerous region, would obtain the world's most dangerous weapons.""According to the prime minister, ""to defeat ISIS and leave Iran as a threshold nuclear power is to win the battle and lose the war.""Sadly, we have a president and secretary of state who believe that one battle in the global war on terror can be won at a negotiating table with Iranian Islamists, who will leave that table retaining the ability to go nuclear. Unlike Obama and Kerry, Netanyahu isn't so foolish.

"
1516,PM,"Elections: After nine years with conservative Stephen Harper in charge, Canada has veered left, electing liberal Justin Trudeau as prime minister. We wish him well, but fear his policies will drag the economy down.If Trudeau's name sounds familiar, it should. He's the son of Pierre Trudeau, Canada's much-respected and charismatic former PM who spent 13 years in office in the '70s and '80s.The younger Trudeau, 43, is personable and movie-star handsome. With just a whiff of Barack Obama, he speaks of a Canada that will be ""open and confident and hopeful."" Those appear to be his qualifications.Yet, after a 78-day campaign that Canadians complained dragged on far too long, Trudeau in the end beat Harper not because he had a superior plan for the country but because, as the Vancouver Sun aptly put it, people ""had had enough of Stephen Harper.""Fair enough, nine years is a long time. And there was a sense in Canada that Harper had been heavy-handed in pushing conservative issues on Canadians who are mostly center-left in their politics, as IBD's Andrew Malcolm has noted.A scandal over conservative senators' perks didn't help (Harper was elected in 2006 promising to clean up the then-scandal-ridden government). Concerns over a flood of Muslim refugees also polarized voters.But say what you will about Harper, he succeeded in steering Canada away from left-wing economic foolishness onto a path of responsibility. A trained economist, Harper cut taxes, backed free trade, cut spending, created a budget surplus, reduced national debt, revived economic growth, avoided a U.S.-style housing crisis and deftly sidestepped much of the global warming nonsense that now hobbles the U.S. economy.And during his years in office, Canada's middle class became the wealthiest in the world, surpassing the U.S.Yet right now, Canada's economy is struggling. Plunging oil and commodity prices caused the economy to contract briefly earlier in the year, and the energy-dependent economy is expected to grow just over 1% this year and less than 2% in 2016.With Trudeau's big win — his party unexpectedly seized 54% of the 338 seats in Parliament — he has a mandate. But what will he do? It's hard to say, since he mostly ran as the ""I'm Not Stephen Harper"" candidate.But from recent speeches, it seems that Trudeau plans a kind of Obamanomics-lite. Specifically, while the budget now is balanced, Trudeau plans on a Keynesian ""stimulus"" of roughly $10 billion a year. Sorry, but government deficits don't create growth.On climate change, Trudeau's party has favored a national carbon tax. That would be an economic disaster.Americans should be concerned. Of our $2.3 trillion in global exports, more than 20% go to Canada. If its economy suffers, so will ours.As we said, we wish Trudeau the best of luck. From what we see of his policy plans, he'll need it.

It also lost a battle to stay above its 50-day moving average.These difficulties probably say more about the general market than they do about Philip Morris.Asia was Philip Morris' strongest region in Q2. Net revenue, excluding currency and acquisitions, jumped about 28% in Asia.The company's market share in Japan soared from 24.3% to 42% in the quarter. The March earthquake disrupted operations for Japan Tobacco, also known as JT, and Philip Morris moved in aggressively.While that could be a one-quarter benefit, Philip Morris is likely to retain some of the new customers.The current annual dividend yield is 3.9%. Philip Morris, which was spun off from Altria Group (MO) in March 2008, has raised the dividend payout three times since then.Each time, the increase came in September.In Tuesday's IBD, Philip Morris made the Big Cap 20, which had only 10 stocks.

1563,PM,"What to make of all the polls on the government shutdown? You know, the ones that say that, to varying degrees, congressional Republicans are being blamed more than Democrats and Barack Obama.
"
1564,PM,"Let me give a roundabout answer, based on a theory that people sometimes try to send messages through their responses to poll questions. I developed this theory after watching British political polls since the 1960s.
"
1565,PM,"For the large majority of that time — the major exception was the first eight years of Tony Blair's prime ministership — voters have given negative job ratings to the governments of the day. Yet during that time, incumbent parties have won most general elections.
"
1566,PM,"This is not necessarily a contradiction. Britons, with their two-and-a-half party system (the Liberal Democrats are the half), are adept tactical voters. If they live in a district where Lib Dems are stronger than Labor, then Laborites will vote Lib Dem to keep the Conservatives out.
"
1567,PM,"In responding to polls, British voters who fear the government may go too far will express disapproval as a way of checking the prime minister's theoretically dictatorial, but in fact limited, power. Backbenchers will pressure the PM not to go too far if his or her job approval is low.
"
1568,PM,"In our two-party system, Americans seldom vote tactically. But I think they sometimes respond to polls tactically.
"
1569,PM,"That helps explain why Bill Clinton's job approval went up 20 points when the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke and Republicans threatened impeachment. That looks like a plea to Republicans to drop impeachment.
"
1570,PM,"Spoiled Child
"
1571,PM,"Americans believe in the 22nd Amendment, limiting the president to two terms. Clinton had been elected to a second term and was competently performing his day work. Let him serve that term out, voters seemed to be saying.
"
1572,PM,"So it may be helpful to look at government shutdown polls in a similar light.
"
1573,PM,"Many polls ask which side will be or is more to blame for the shutdown. Pluralities blame Barack Obama over Republicans (there's some difference in question wording) — 39-36 and 38-30 (Pew), 44-35 (CBS), 42-32 (Fox News). When asked whether Republicans or the Obama administration is more to blame, it's Republicans, 39-36 (National Journal).
"
1574,PM,"A general rule in polling is that individuals are more popular than groups of people — especially groups of politicians. That Obama has only a small lead, and the Obama administration a statistically insignificant deficit, does not signal great presidential strength.
"
1575,PM,"Note too that one-fifth to one-quarter are not sure. And when given the option of ""both equally,"" 58% choose that (Quinnipiac).
"
1576,PM,"Acting like a responsible adult or a spoiled child? Spoiled child for Republicans in Congress, 69-25 (CNN/ORC). Responsible adult for Obama — but only by a 49-47 result.

"
1578,PM,"No Negotiations
"
1579,PM,"One can argue that the same voters who re-elected a Democratic president and returned a Republican House are not entitled to complain when each refuses to give in. Each side is acting out of principled conviction.
"
1580,PM,"But one can also argue that each side has made blunders. House Republicans started by refusing to fund the government without defunding ObamaCare — a result Democrats surely would never permit and which large majorities in polls oppose.
"
1581,PM,"In response, Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid have flatly refused to negotiate. The administration has tried to block World War II veterans from visiting their open-air memorial.
"
1582,PM,"Democrats believe that a shutdown would be politically disastrous for Republicans. But the 1995-96 shutdown wasn't, and back then Bill Clinton made a great show of negotiating. Obama's refusal to negotiate is less attractive. It is stunning that 47% of Americans say that a twice-elected president is behaving like a spoiled child rather than a responsible adult.
"
1583,PM,"Elections are zero-sum games: One side must win. Knock down the other guys sufficiently and you will. Partisan struggles like this are not: Both sides can lose ground, as happened after grand bargain negotiations collapsed in August 2011.

1608,PM,"The multi-million Zacks Tobacco industry has been treading on shaky ground, thanks to stringent FDA regulations to curb cigarette consumption. Well, authorities can’t be blamed for brandishing the whip on tobacco players as smoking has become one of the primary causes of heart diseases and cancer. However, in an attempt to navigate rough waters, a few tobacco players have resorted to reduced-risk tobacco products (RRPs), a less fatal alternative to cigarettes.Headwinds Plaguing Tobacco MajorsCigarette sales have been deteriorating, due to several marketing regulations imposed by the FDA. Apart from seeking authorization for any new tobacco product, companies are also required to mandatorily use precautionary labels on cigarette packets. Additionally, these companies have been directed to put self-critical advertisements on television and newspapers, particularly emphasizing the addictive nature of cigarettes.To add to the woes, the FDA is now bent on drastically reducing nicotine in cigarettes to minimally addictive levels. The initiative was proposed in 2017 but was delayed, thanks to ongoing research and opposition from several interest groups. If acted upon, lowering nicotine levels will undoubtedly be disastrous for cigarette manufacturing companies. Moreover, increasing regulatory moves have raised awareness amongst consumers regarding the detrimental effects of smoking.The impacts of such initiatives are clearly visible on receding cigarette sales volumes of tobacco industry majors such as Altria (MO  -  Free Report), Philip Morris (PM  -  Free Report), British American Tobacco (BTI  -  Free Report) and Vector Group (VGR  -  Free Report). Also, owing to these hurdles, the tobacco industry (ranked among the bottom 12% out of more than 250 Zacks industries) has dropped 6.3% in the past six months, as against the S&P 500 that gained 3.2%.On the flip side, tobacco companies have been exploring opportunities provided by RRPs. Incidentally, Philip Morris, one of the companies leading this revolutionary shift to RRPs along with Altria, has been investing to strengthen their smoke-free products portfolio.Let’s take a closer look at the performance of these companies and how they are placed amid the ongoing chaos as well as the efforts they have been undertaking to survive.A Look Into Major Tobacco Players PerformancePhilip Morris International Inc.’s cigarette shipment volumes declined 2.1% during the fourth quarter of 2017. This marked the company’s fourth-consecutive period of earnings and sales miss. Moreover, the company’s shares declined 9.1% over the past six months, wider than the industry’s fall.In an effort to boost performance, Philip Morris has been radically expanding its RRPs portfolio. The company seems to stand firm on its ambitions to develop a smoke free future, evident from its recent move to completely transform one of its cigarette production facilities in Greece for the manufacture of HEETS — a unit used with iQOS. In fact, with investments close to $4.5 billion since 2008 for undertaking research and product development in the RRPs category, the company is pioneering the radical shift from harmful tobacco products to scientific and low-risk product alternatives.Buoyed by such efforts, management expects earnings for 2018 in the range of $5.20-$5.35, depicting a growth of 34-38% over the prior-year figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earning for 2018 also falls within management’s guidance and is pegged at $5.27. Moreover, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company carries a VGM Score of B and has a long-term growth rate of 10.1%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Altria Group, Inc. saw its domestic cigarette volumes decline almost 8.9% year over year during the fourth-quarter 2017. Moreover, due to consistent declines in the cigarette category, Altria’s top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in eight out of the last 10 quarters. The company carries a VGM Score of D.Additionally, dismal cigarette sales performance led to Altria’s shares to decline 0.7% in the past six months, which compares favorably with the industry’s fall. Well, this Zacks Rank #3 company has been managing to stay afloat on the back of its Smokeless product category. In fact, revenues in this category advanced 11.1% in the fourth quarter. Moreover, in e-vapor, Altria’s subsidiary Nu Mark LLC continues to boost MarkTen volume, which expanded 60% in 2017. Altria’s marketing and technology agreement with Philip Morris is also expected to boost the businesses of the companies. Per the agreement, Phillip Morris will market Altria’s MarkTen e-cigarettes internationally. Also, Altria will distribute two of Phillip Morris’ heated tobacco products in the United States.Buoyed by the prospects in the smokeless category, management expects 2018 earnings to surge 5-19% year over year to $3.90-$4.03. The Zacks Consensus for 2018 earnings trended upward over the past 30 days and is pegged at $4.01. The company also has a long-term growth rate of 8.6%.Another tobacco industry major, British American Tobacco plc, saw its shares decline almost 8.2% over the past six months. Moreover, the company’s preliminary results for 2017 depict a decline of 2.6% in organic cigarette volumes. The company carries a VGM Score of D.Nevertheless, this Zacks Rank # 3 company has been gaining significantly from the acquisition of Reynolds American Inc. British American has also been striving to expand in the RRPs realm with its Next Generation Products lineup.Vector Group Ltd., a Florida-based tobacco company, witnessed a decline 2.8% in tobacco unit sales volumes during the fourth quarter of 2017. The company, which has seen its shares dip 1% in the past six months, carries a VGM score of F. Although Vector Group has not ventured out into RRPs, the company relies upon the real estate segment to offset tobacco sales related hurdles.Wrapping UpWhile RRPs seem to be one of the most viable options for tobacco players to offset declining cigarette volumes, there are other factors that need to be taken care of. Advancements in the reduced risk category are yet to completely offset cigarette sales decline for most of the aforementioned companies. That said, let’s wait and watch what lies ahead for companies operating in the tobacco space and what additional efforts they can undertake to sustain in the industry.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it. Companies are already generating substantial revenue, and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline.Cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in sight, and so are big potential profits for early investors.

1609,PM,"Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report) seems to stand firm on its ambitions of developing a smoke free future, evident from its recent move to completely transform one of its cigarette production facilities in Greece for the manufacture of HEETS —  a unit used with iQOS. At a time when Philip Morris, like other major tobacco players, is witnessing receding cigarette sales, the company has been tactfully keeping its ducks in a row with reduced risk products (RRPs).Expanding in the Smoke-Free ZoneFor the transformation of Papastratos factory in Greece for the production of HEETS, the company plans an investment outlay of approximately EUR 300 million. This includes construction of new buildings and replacement of cigarette manufacturing lines with advanced facilities that can produce almost 10,000 smoke-free units per minute. The transformation work is expected to be completed by the end of 2018 and is likely to create 400 new employment opportunities. Along with Papastratos, Philip Morris has a plant near Bologna in Italy, which is fully engaged in the manufacturing of smoke-free products. Further, the company plans to undertake either partial or complete transformation of its cigarette producing facilities in Russia, Korea and Romania.  Philip Morris’ endeavors in the RRPs category are praiseworthy. With investments close to $4.5 billion since 2008 for undertaking research and product development in this category, the company is leading the revolutionary move from harmful tobacco products to scientific and low risk product alternatives. While the company has been stringently working toward motivating smokers to switch to RRPs, government regulations across the globe have also been playing a major role to substantiate the change. Additionally, the marketing and technology sharing agreement between Philip Morris and Altria Group (MO  -  Free Report) for selling iQOS heated tobacco products in the United States is expected to aid volume and sales growth. The agreement is currently submitted for review to the FDA.The company’s strategic efforts in the RRPs space have also been favorably impacting its overall performance. Evidently, during fourth-quarter 2017, the company generated revenues of $1,643 million from RRPs, significantly higher than $343 million in 2017. Notably, RRP revenues in 2017 represented 12.7% of the company’s overall net revenues, with major contributions from iQOS and accessories. The company expects continued growth in this category in the forthcoming periods, which encourages it to undertake constant investments to support RRP expansion. In fact, management expects strength in RRPs to drive the company’s currency-neutral revenue growth of more than 8% in 2018.   Challenges to OvercomeOn the flip side, Philip Morris has been witnessing deteriorating shipment volumes mainly due to receding demand for cigarettes. Moreover, due to such headwinds, Philip Morris’ shares have lost 13.7% in the past six months, wider than the industry’s decline of 10.5%. In fact, rising consumer awareness regarding the harmful impacts of cigarette and stern government regulations have been hampering the growth of a number of firms in the multi-billion tobacco industry such as British American Tobacco (BTI  -  Free Report) and Vector Group (VGR  -  Free Report).Nevertheless, as a trendsetter in the low risk tobacco products arena and its effective strategies to augment the category, Philip Morris is expected to continue as one of prominent names in the industry. Such dedicated efforts not only aid in countering stringent regulations and headwinds plaguing the cigarette space, but also seem to be in the favor of society’s health and well being. Marching with such radical objectives, we expect this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) to continue growing and also gain a place in investors’ good books.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Can Hackers Put Money into Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

1610,PM,"Cigarette consumption rates have been charring down, which in turn has been choking the performance of major tobacco players like Altria Group, Inc. (MO  -  Free Report). Evidently, these hurdles have caused shares of this Virginia-based company to plunge close to 15% in the past year, wider than the industry’s decline of 10.5%. Nevertheless, Altria is trying all means to find a breather in reduced risk tobacco products (RRPs) – which have been gaining traction.Receding Cigarette Volumes Raise ConcernsAltria and other tobacco industry majors received quite a jolt last year when the FDA came up with the proposal to drastically lower nicotine content in cigarettes. This along with the FDA’s norms to display self-critical advertisements on television and newspapers to dissuade customers from smoking and using precautionary labels on cigarette packets, have been weighing on the tobacco segment. Moreover, in the process of adhering to previous regulatory policies, tobacco manufacturers are required to seek marketing authorization for the introduction of any tobacco product. Additionally, the European Union and the FDA have proposed a ban on menthol in accordance with the Tobacco Control Act. Per the Act, menthol cigarettes have an adverse impact on public health. That said, Altria and other companies in the multi-billion tobacco industry such as British American Tobacco (BTI  -  Free Report) and Vector Group (VGR  -  Free Report) have quite a lot to worry about when it comes to cigarette products.Thanks to the aforementioned challenges, Altria’s top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in eight out of the last 10 quarters. In fact, Altria’s domestic cigarette shipment volume fell 8.9% year over year during the fourth quarter of 2017, due to lower cigarette industry volumes, unfavorable trade inventory movements and decline in retail share. Total cigarette retail share declined to 50.3% during the period, representing a 0.8 percentage point slip. Moreover, declines of 6.2%, 2.7% and 2.6% in Altria’s cigarette shipment volumes were incurred during the third, second and first quarters of 2017, respectively.With little or no hopes of attaining growth in cigarettes, Altria is focusing on its smokeless or reduced risk products. Let’s take a look at the efforts undertaken in this segment and other factors that have been aiding this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Reduced Risk Products: The New Growth MantraThe future for tobacco companies seems to be smoke-free, given the growing popularity of RRPs. Altria has been promptly responding to this changing market scenario. To this end, it has offered several reduced risk tobacco products which helped it maintain market share. In e-vapor, Altria’s subsidiary Nu Mark LLC continues to boost MarkTen volume, which expanded 60% in 2017, courtesy of greater distribution and category growth. MarkTen’s full-year 2017 national retail market share was approximately 12.5% in mainstream retail channels. Further, it forms nearly 70% of e-vapor volumes in those channels. Notably, Altria’s flagship MarkTen and Green Smoke e-vapor products are performing strongly in the smokeless category. In fact, MarkTen is now a leading e-vapor brand in the United States.Backed by efforts to strengthen RRP portfolio, revenues (net of excise taxes) from the Smokeless product category advanced 11.1% to $542 million in the fourth quarter. This was mainly buoyed by better pricing and improved Copenhagen volumes. We expect such trends to continue fueling Altria in the forthcoming periods. Also, Altria’s marketing and technology agreement with Philip Morris (PM  -  Free Report) to market MarkTen e-cigarettes internationally and the distribution of heated tobacco products in the United States is expected to boost the businesses of the companies.Positive on the Journey AheadDespite the headwinds plaguing the cigarette category, Altria has managed to stay afloat in this segment on the back of strong pricing. It has been witnessed that smokers tend to absorb price increases owing to the addictive quality of cigarettes. We expect the company to continue reaping benefits from such effective pricing strategies in the forthcoming periods.  Additionally, the recent tax reforms favorably impacted Altria’s 2017 earnings, and are expected to benefit the company going ahead. Evidently, management expects lower corporate tax rate and lower taxes on AB InBev dividends to augment the company’s bottom line in 2018.Apart from this, management is focused on making investments in core growth areas like undertaking innovations, coming up with launches like iQOS, improving retail fixtures and enhancing brands like Marlboro to boost market share. Moreover, on the back of these efforts and expected gains from tax reforms, management provided a positive earnings outlook for 2018. That said, we hope such well-chalked endeavors to aid the company to offset the hurdles and continue as one of the prominent names in the tobacco industry.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

1611,PM,"In a recent fundraising round, e-cigarette maker Juul Labs Inc. raised $650 million, which values the rapidly-growing, yet still-controversial startup around $15 billion. Formerly part of PAX Labs, Juul became its own independent company in 2017 and has exploded in popularity recently.Success of Juul Although the concept and product were launched in 2015, the Juul has only recently become popular amongst the younger crowd. The main idea behind this product was to provide an alternative to an actual cigarette.According to Market Watch, Juul has become the sixth-most valuable U.S. startup and sits alongside companies like Uber and Airbnb. Currently, one of the top firms financing Juul is called Tiger Global Management, which has made over 200 investments in 30 countries.The price per share in Juul’s current fundraising round is 56% higher than the price in 2015, and the company has grown to take over at least 70% of the U.S. e-cigarette market.Hemant Taneja a top investor at General Catalyst told Recode that the company has done exceptionally well and has become a consumer phenomenon. However, investors and companies are worried whether or not Juul is helping people decrease their smoking addiction or just creating a new one for them.The Controversy The Juul was created with an older demographic in mind, being targeted at those adults trying to quit smoking. However, it's become too popular with the wrong age group. Since the launch of this product, it has been easily available to a very young crowd. Although it is meant to be an alternative 'vape' product as opposed to smoking, it still contains 60% nicotine, which many young users don't know about.That brings us to the question as to why investors are hesitant to invest in a startup which is worth around $15 billion and growing rapidly.In April 2018, the FDA demanded that Juul had to hand over any documents regarding the company’s marketing strategy, including who they market to and any research they had on the product. Certain concerns arise when dealing with an issue like this. For example, since this startup essentially thrives on vice, companies could be concerned as to how it will return money to its investors or what company would even want to invest in the first place.But there still is a large market for sin stocks and people wanting to be a part of that industry. However, investing in Juul seems to be more of an ethical issue, seeing as this product can be bought by a younger demographic, even though their website says you have to be 21.Tobacco Industry vs. Juul Big Tobacco, aka “The Big Five,” are known to be the largest tobacco industry companies, including Phillip Morris International (PM  -  Free Report) and British American Tobacco (BTI  -  Free Report). Larger companies like these are also trying to make their mark in the e-cig market.For example, PM came out with its own version of a vape called IQOS. It has been selling these products in Japan and Korea as well as other countries since 2014. If the company gets the FDA’s approval to start selling in the United States, it is just a matter of time before PM and Juul’s products become rivals. Bottom Line Juul is a startup which is doing extremely well. However, it needs to find a way to lure in the right customers—ones that the company initially had in mind when creating the product. Juul’s funding has certainly increased since its product first launched, and we can only look to see what the company decides next in terms of marketing and selling to the right demographic. In return, this could potentially land confidence amongst investors who are hesitant about Juul right now.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1612,PM,"Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report) has inked a deal with Parallax, in an attempt to move ahead with its strategy of expanding in the smoke-free products space. Canada-based Parallax, owned by leading pioneers in pulmonary research and medicine, provides low risk alternatives of tobacco.Both the companies will work towards reduction of harmful tobacco products by developing an effective nicotine-delivery system including e- cigarettes, pipe tobacco, cigars and hookah that leverages the most advanced technologies in pulmonary medicine. Prior to this, the company has invested more than $4.5 million since 2008 to develop, substantiate and build manufacturing capacity for a wide range of smoke-free products.Phillip Morris has long been focused on strengthening its reduced risk products (RRPs) category owing to consumers’ rising health consciousness, along with government’s strict regulations on tobacco products.Markedly, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets to encourage customers quit smoking. Also, the FDA is bent on drastically reducing nicotine in cigarettes to minimally addictive levels. Apart from these, the FDA had earlier announced that tobacco makers must seek  marketing authorization for any tobacco product introduced after Feb 15, 2007. In fact, these hurdles also remain threats to other tobacco players like Altria Group (MO  -  Free Report), Vector Group (VGR  -  Free Report) and British American Tobacco (BTI  -  Free Report) ,Serious health hazards due to cigarette smoking have pushed consumers toward low-risk, RRP’s. In this regard, Phillip Morris has been undertaking plant conversions and transforming them from cigarette to RRPs manufacturing facilities. This was witnessed in the company’s Papastratos factory in Greece, for the production of HEETS, a unit used with IQOS. IQOS, a smokeless cigarette, is counted as one of the leading RRPs in the industry.Also, Phillip Morris’ revenues from RRPs doubled (on a constant-currency basis) to $1,127 million, largely driven by increased sales of IQOS devices in the first quarter of 2018. Notably, RRP revenues during the first quarter represented 16.3% of the company’s overall net revenues.We believe these upsides can help this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company counter the challenges it is facing in the tobacco space and revive the stock that has plunged 30.5% as compared to the industry’s decline of 27.9%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1613,PM,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 8.1% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is PM due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Philip Morris Q4 Earnings & Sales Miss, Guides 2018Philip Morris International posted fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results. Adjusted earnings of $1.31 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.36. However, adjusted earnings in the reported quarter jumped 19.1% from the year-ago period.Net revenue, excluding excise taxes, was $8,294 million, which increased 19% (up 18.8% excluding favorable currency of $14 million) in the fourth quarter. However, net revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8,372 million. Favorable pricing and volume/mix in the quarter drove revenues. While, revenues increased in the European Union (EU), Asia, Latin America & Canada, the same declined in Eastern Europe, the Middle East & Africa (EEMA).During the quarter, revenues from combustible products inched up 0.3% (down 0.8% excluding negative currency) to $6,651 million. Moreover, Reduced Risk Products (RRPs) reported a whopping increase from last-year quarter, driven by shift of customer preference away from tobacco products. The company generated revenues of $1,643 million from RRPs, significantly higher than $343 million reported last year.Total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume rose 3.8% to 212.1 billion units. The figures were unfavorable in the EEMA and in Latin America & Canada mainly due to low cigarette shipment volumes. These were offset by increased volumes in Asia and EU, as well as higher heated tobacco unit shipment volume across all regions. While cigarette shipment volume declined 2.1% in the quarter, heated tobacco unit shipment volume of 15.7 billion units, increased significantly from 3.7 billion units recorded in fourth-quarter 2016.Adjusted operating companies income was up 25.5% year over year to $ $3,381 million owing to favorable pricing and growth across all regions along with favorable volume/mix in the EU and Asia. Excluding currency impact of $196 million, adjusted operating income increased 18.2%. However, adjusted operating margin was down 220 basis points to 40.8%.GuidanceThe company provided fiscal 2018 guidance. The company expects earnings per share in the range of $5.20-$5.35, which depicts growth of 34-38% over the earnings of $3.88 in 2017. Excluding a favorable currency impact, the company anticipates adjusted earnings growth of nearly 7-10%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been four revisions lower for the current quarter. In the past month, the consensus estimate has shifted by -24.5% due to these changes.Philip Morris International Inc Price and Consensus  Philip Morris International Inc Price and Consensus | Philip Morris International Inc QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, PM has a strong Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with an F.

1614,PM,"Church & Dwight Co., Inc. (CHD  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 5. We expect Church & Dwight to continue gaining from its stable portfolio of value and premium products, focus on innovations, benefits from buyouts and aggressive productivity programs. These factors have been driving Church & Dwight for a while now, with the Consumer International segment in particular.Consumer International to Remain a Major Driver Church & Dwight’s Consumer International business has been doing exceptionally well. Evidently, consistent strength at this segment has been driving the company’s overall organic sales growth for more than a year now. In the third quarter, organic sales in the consumer international segment jumped 6.2%, thanks to higher volumes. Also, overall consumer international sales surged 21.7% on the back of extensive sales of household and personal care items. Incidentally, sales at this segment received considerable impetus from FEMFRESH, OXICLEAN and STERIMAR in the export business, STERIMAR and ARM & HAMMER baking soda in Mexico, FEMFRESH in Australia as well as ARM & HAMMER cat litter and BATISTE in Canada. Further, the company is opening new offices to support increase in export business, and it continues to invest in the consumer international business to sustain its strong sales growth.Clearly, this segment holds immense potential and is likely to sustain its splendid trend this time around as well. Markedly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales at this segment is pegged at $154 million, reflecting a solid 20.3% upside from the year-ago reported figure.Growth Initiatives to Continue Driving Performance Further, Church & Dwight’s regular innovation helps in improving brand positions and market share in the consumer categories. Thus, management remains committed toward innovations in particular, as it believes that remains the biggest driver for its top and bottom-line growth in future. As for acquisitions, Church & Dwight has acquired a number of superior brands with high margin over time. These businesses boosted the company’s revenues from $1.5 billion in 2004 to $3.5 billion in 2016. Progressing on these lines, Church & Dwight concluded the buyout of Waterpik in third-quarter 2017 and is on track with its integration.Church & Dwight Company, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Church & Dwight Company, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Church & Dwight Company, Inc. Quote Together, such strategic endeavors drove Church & Dwight’s results in the third quarter. Despite bearing the brunt of hurricanes, both top and bottom lines grew year over year and topped estimates. While this marked the consumer products giant’s fourth consecutive quarter of positive earnings surprise, sales have outpaced the consensus mark in 12 of the last 14 quarters. In fact, Church & Dwight’s strong record has helped it jump 10.58% in the past three months, crushing the industry’s 2% growth. Delving deeper into the results, we note that improved volumes drove organic sales by 3.2% — thereby retaining its long year-over-year growth trend. Apart from continued strength at consumer international, organic sales were also backed by growth in domestic sales and solid Specialty Products business improvement. In fact, broad-based growth across segments also helped the company to offset high promotional costs and generate bottom-line growth. A look at the consensus marks for sales for Church & Dwight’s other segment reveals that, Consumer Domestic segment is likely to deliver sales of $776 million (up from $695 million posted in the year-ago period), while consensus estimate for sales at the Specialty Products unit stands at $77 million (up 4.1% from the year-ago reported figure).Q4 & 2017 Expectations as a WholeAll, said we expect this New Jersey-based company’s broad-based strength to continue helping it overcome increased promotional and other expenditures this time around.

1615,PM,"Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report) continues to be whipped by regulatory hurdles surrounding the tobacco industry, which along with rising health consciousness have been denting Phillip Morris’ cigarette volumes. This has caused a 19.3% decline in the company’s shares in the past three months, wider than the industry’s decline of 13%. Nevertheless, the company’s reduced risk products (RRPs) category has been gaining traction, which should help it cushion the stock.What’s Plaguing Phillip Morris Stock?The tobacco space faces challenges as governments around the world are imposing restrictions on tobacco companies, which, in turn, are lowering cigarette consumption. Incidentally, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets to dissuade customers from smoking. In fact, per court orders, Reynolds American along with Altria Group (MO  -  Free Report) and other cigarette makers have been directed to put up self-critical advertisements on television and newspapers to dissuade customers from smoking.Apart from this, the court wants tobacco companies to admit that cigarettes have been made addictive through the issuance of corrective ads. To add to the woes, the FDA is bent on drastically reducing nicotine in cigarettes to minimally addictive levels. Apart from these, FDA had earlier announced that tobacco makers must seek marketing authorization for any tobacco product introduced after Feb 15, 2007. The law was extended by the FDA to include e-cigarettes, pipe tobacco, cigars and hookah, in May 2016. Also, the European Union and the FDA have proposed a ban on menthol in accordance with the Tobacco Control Act.These hurdles, which remain threats to companies like Altria, Vector Group (VGR  -  Free Report) and British American Tobacco (BTI  -  Free Report), caused total cigarette shipment volumes to decline by 5.3% in the first quarter of 2018.Any Scope for Respite?To counter these hurdles, Phillip Morris is pioneering the radical shift from harmful tobacco products to scientific and low-risk alternatives, with investments in research and development in the RRPs category.  In fact, the company’s iQOS, a smokeless cigarette, is counted as one of the leading RRPs in the industry.  During first-quarter 2018, revenues from RRPs doubled (on a constant-currency basis) to $1,127 million, largely driven by increased sales of iQOS devices. Notably, RRP revenues during the first quarter represented 16.3% of the company’s overall net revenues.Further, to cater to the rising demand for products in the RRPs category, Phillip Morris has been undertaking plant conversions, transforming them from cigarette to RRPs manufacturing facilities. This was witnessed in the company’s Papastratos factory in Greece, for the production of HEETS, a unit used with iQOS. Moreover, the marketing and technology sharing agreement between Philip Morris and its peer Altria Group, which is currently under FDA review, is also expected to boost the business of both the companies.Apart from this, strong pricing should also help Phillip Morris fight the hurdles related to soft volumes. The company makes solid attempts to remain afloat and generate revenues with higher cigarette pricing even in the face of unfavorable tax environment and declining cigarette volumes. Though higher pricing might lead to possible decline in cigarette consumption, it is seen that smokers tend to absorb price increases, owing to the addictive nature of cigarettes. Evidently, higher pricing at the combustible tobacco portfolio drove year-over-year net revenue growth during first-quarter 2018. The company continues to expect pricing as the key growth driver in the near term.That said, let’s see if strong pricing and gains from RRPs can actually help the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock witness a turnaround.

1616,PM,"Sysco Corp. (SYY  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 5. The food products giant delivered positive earnings surprise in seven out of the past eight quarters, while sales topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate for three consecutive quarters. Sysco’s strong record has also helped it to jump 22.8% in a year against the industry that dipped 0.2%.So, let’s see if this Texas-based company can keep its spectacular surprise streak alive this time too.Factors at PlayWe expect Sysco to continue gaining from its cost-saving and revenue-management efforts, which have been driving its performance for a while now. Incidentally, the company has been impressively managing expenses for the past few years, and is making progress in both SG&A and supply chain areas. In the supply chain area, the company is witnessing positive momentum from its productivity initiatives and ongoing process improvements.Driven by these endeavors, the company remains on track to achieve the high end of the three-year adjusted operating income growth target of approximately $600-$650 million through the end of FY18. This growth is expected to come from lower administrative costs and improving gross margin, which gives out positive signals for the quarter under review.Further, the company’s focus on acquisitions, new product developments, value-added services and improved e-commerce capabilities remains a growth driver. In this regard, the company’s recent acquisition of HFM Foodservice is likely to augment its top line, by boosting revenues of the U.S. Foodservice segment. Notably, Sysco expects to achieve 0.5-1% sales growth through acquisitions in the long term. Other than aiding sales growth, these acquisitions also enhance Sysco’s presence in international markets.Backed by these factors, Sysco has been witnessing year-over-year growth in top and bottom lines for quite some time now, and we expect this trend to continue in the quarter to be reported.How Are Sysco’s Segments Placed?Taking a segment-wise look, we remain optimistic about the company’s U.S. Foodservice Operations, which delivered a strong performance in the last reported quarter despite bearing the brunt of hurricanes. Notably, sales in this segment advanced 4% to $9,849.9 million, with local case volume within U.S. Broadline operations up 2.8%. Also, gross profit increased 3.8%, backed by the company’s focus on product management, efficient pricing and revenue management initiatives.Going forward, management expects its domestic business to be buoyed by increased consumer demand and traffic. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales at this segment is pegged at $9,561 million, which reflects 5.2% growth from the year-ago period.Moving to the International Foodservice Operations, this unit delivered improved sales too in the last reported quarter. However, results were partly hurt by softness in Europe, which is battling slow traffic. Moreover, weak UK currency resulted in food cost inflation, thereby leading to pricing pressure. These headwinds are likely to persist throughout the fiscal, though management remains focused on reducing the impact of such obstacles. Additionally, the company remains encouraged about the growth prospects in Latin America. Markedly, the consensus mark for International sales stands at $2,784 million compared with $2,626 million in the same year-ago period.The company also remains hopeful of growth in its SYGMA segment, for which the consensus estimate for sales is $1,613 million, up 6.1% from the year-ago reported sales figure.Q2 Expectations as a WholeSysco Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Sysco Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Sysco Corporation QuoteGiven these factors and Sysco’s focus on its recently announced strategies for 2020, we believe that the company will continue with its top and bottom-line growth in the second quarter.Encouragingly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings is pegged at 65 cents, which represents more than 12% growth from the year-ago period. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $14,186 million, up 5.4% from the year-ago reported figure.What the Zacks Model Unveils?To top it, our proven model shows that Sysco is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter. For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).

1617,PM,"Altria Group Inc. (MO  -  Free Report) came out with fourth-quarter 2017 results, wherein it continued its robust trend of year-over-year bottom-line growth. Further, the company issued a favorable earnings outlook for 2018.If we look into Altria’s stock performance in the past three months, we note that this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has rallied 11.1%, in comparison with the industry’s growth of 7.8%.Quarter in detailAdjusted earnings of 91 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 80 cents. Also, earnings surged 33.8% year over year, on the back of greater equity earnings from the company’s beer investments related to AB InBev (BUD  -  Free Report), higher adjusted operating companies income (“OCI”) in the smokeable and smokeless segments, lower outstanding shares and reduced adjusted tax rate.Altria Group Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Altria Group Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Altria Group Quote However, net revenues fell more than 2% to $6,083 million in the quarter, owing to soft net revenues in the smokeable products segments. Revenues net of excise taxes remained almost flat at $4,696 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was $4,793 million.Management stated that Altria remains focused on enhancing its non-combustible product portfolio for authorization by the FDA.In e-vapor, Altria’s subsidiary Nu Mark LLC continues to boost MarkTen volume, which expanded 60% in full-year 2017, courtesy of greater distribution and category growth. MarkTen’s full-year 2017 national retail market share was approximately 12.5% in mainstream retail channels. Further, it forms nearly 70% of e-vapor volumes in those channels.The company also made considerable progress in smokeless and other oral nicotine-containing products. Also, in heated tobacco, Phillip Morris (PM  -  Free Report) remains committed toward making plans to commercialize IQOS, which it will exclusively sell in the U.S. upon FDA’s approval.Segment DetailsSmokeable Products Segment: Revenues net of excise taxes dipped 1% year over year to $3,935 million, due to soft volumes that was somewhat compensated by better pricing and lower promotions. Domestic cigarette shipment volumes fell 8.9% year over year, stemming from lower cigarette industry volumes, unfavorable trade inventory movements and decline in retail share. On the other hand, shipment volumes for cigars rose 7.9% in the quarter.Total cigarette retail share declined to 50.3%, representing a 0.8 percentage point slip. This was largely due to a 0.7 share point drop in Marlboro’s retail share stemming from intense competition and increase in cigarette excise tax in California.Adjusted OCI increased 5.7% to $1,964 million, while margins jumped 3.2 percentage points to 49.9%. This could be attributable to lower SG&A, better pricing and reduced promotions.Smokeless Products: Revenues net of excise taxes advanced 11.1% to $542 million in the quarter. This was driven by better pricing and reduced promotions, partly countered by soft volumes. Domestic shipment volumes dipped 0.6% to 211.9 million units, mainly accountable to a decline in Skoal volumes, partly compensated by improved Copenhagen volumes. Total smokeless products retail share contracted 1.1 percentage points to 53.6% in the quarter, due to lower share of Skoal.Adjusted OCI surged 27.2% to $369 million and margins expanded 8.7 percentage points to 68.1%. This was backed by the same factors that drove OCI at the smokeable unit.Wine: The segment’s revenues, net of excise taxes, tumbled 8.8% year over year at $219 million. Results were impacted by trade inventory reductions, heightened competition and sluggish growth of premium wine. Wine shipment volume also decreased 9.75 to 2.8 million cases.Ste. Michelle’s adjusted OCI improved 1.6% to $65 million, mainly accountable to better pricing, reduced expenses and favorable mix partly countered by lower volumes. Adjusted OCI margin expanded 3 percentage point to 29.7%.A Glimpse of 2017Altria’s adjusted earnings for full-year 2017 came in at $3.39 per share, which advanced 11.9% year over year and also surpassed the consensus mark of $3.28. Notably, Altria’s reported and adjusted tax rate for the full year 2017 was impacted by the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform Act).2017 revenues slipped 0.7% to $25.6 billion, while revenues (net of excise taxes) climbed 0.8% to $19.5 billion, almost meeting the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $19.57 billion.Financial UpdatesIn December 2017, Altria declared a quarterly cash dividend of 66 cents per share. During the fourth quarter and 2017, Altria paid dividends worth $1.3 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively. Further, management remains on track to maintain a payout ratio of 80% of its bottom line. Further, the company repurchased 8.4 million shares for approximately $558 million during the fourth quarter. As of Dec 31, 2017, Altria had approximately $18 million remaining under its share repurchase program of $4 billion, which was, however, concluded in January 2018.Consequently, management announced a new buyback authorization of about $1 billion, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2018.Consolidation of Manufacturing Facilities & Management ChangeIn October 2016, Altria announced the consolidation of several of its manufacturing facilities to streamline operations and achieve greater efficiencies. The consolidation, scheduled to be completed by first-quarter 2018 is expected to deliver approximately $50 million in cost savings.Concurrently, Altria announced the retirement of Chairman and CEO — Marty Barrington, which is expected to take place later this year. Management also announced Howard Willard as the new Chairman and CEO, who will assume the role on May 17, 2018.OutlookManagement expects adjusted earnings for 2018 in a range of $3.90-$4.03, up 15% to 19% year over year. This excludes an expected charge of about 9 cents related to tax adjustments.Altria expects full-year 2018 adjusted effective tax rate to range 23-24%.Further, capital expenditures in 2018 are estimated in a band of $200 million to $250 million, while depreciation and amortization costs are anticipated to be roughly $210 million.Don’t Miss These Consumer Staples StocksBoston Beer Company (SAM) with a splendid earnings surprise history sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1618,PM,"Altria Group, Inc. (MO  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 1. The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this major tobacco company will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. We expect the company to gain from its efficient pricing and focus on cost-containment, though softness in its smokeable and wine segments raise concerns.While Altria’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last quarter, it has a mixed record of earnings surprises over the trailing four quarters. Let’s delve deeper into all the factors and see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Altria Group Price and EPS Surprise  Altria Group Price and EPS Surprise | Altria Group QuoteFactors at Play Focus on expansion in the smokeless products space has been favoring Altria for some time now, helping its shares gain 13% in the past three months faring better than the industry’s 8.2% upside. Owing to a greater acceptability of such products, Altria has introduced several reduced risk tobacco products. Its flagship MarkTen and Green Smoke e-vapor products have been performing well in this category. Incidentally, MarkTen is now a leading e-vapor brand in the United States, with a retail market share of approximately 13.5% in mainstream retail channels, as highlighted in the company’s third-quarter 2017 results. Encouragingly, during the second and third quarters, revenues (net of excise taxes) from the smokeless tobacco category advanced 8.6% and 4.5%, respectively. Also, total smokeless products retail share grew 1.1 percentage points to 53.8% during the third quarter. Given Altria’s impressive strides in this regard, we expect such trends to continue and favor its smokeless segment’s performance in the upcoming announcement. The consensus mark for net revenues at this unit is currently pegged at $555 million, up 6.5% from the year-ago period.Additionally, Altria has been gaining from its strong pricing power, which have helped it deliver year-over-year bottom-line growth for over a year now. Incidentally, in the last quarter, adjusted operating companies income (OCI) increased 7.7%, while adjusted OCI margins jumped 4.5 percentage points to 52.2% in the smokeable segment — courtesy of higher pricing and lower SG&A and resolution costs. Also, reduced costs and higher pricing fueled adjusted OCI growth of 15.7% and OCI margin expansion of 6.8 percentage points to 70.3% in the smokeless category.Industry Wide Hurdles Likely to Hurt Smokeable Unit However, continued decline in cigarette volumes has been a hindrance for Altria’s smokeable segment for a while now. This in turn can be largely accountable to regulatory hurdles in the form of limitations on marketing, anti-smoking campaigns and higher excise duties. Apart from this, rising health consciousness among consumers has also resulted in lower cigarette consumption globally. Together, these factors have been weighing on cigarette industry volumes. As a result, shipment volumes in the smokeable segment declined 6.2%, 2.7%, 2.6% and 4.7%, respectively in the preceding four quarters. In fact, Marlboro, one of Altria’s prominent cigarette brands, suffered a 6% decline in volumes in third-quarter 2017.These headwinds, which also remain a dampener for other tobacco players like Philip Morris (PM  -  Free Report), British American Tobacco (BTI  -  Free Report) and Vector Group (VGR  -  Free Report) have been denting Altria’s cigarette retail market share. Evidently, total cigarette retail share declined by 0.6 percentage points to 50.5% in the third quarter, wherein revenues from the smokeable category slipped 1.5% year over year to $4,410 million. Also, Altria’s wine segment is not a great performer. Revenues here remained nearly flat year over year at $175 million in the third quarter. Results here were impacted by trade inventory reductions, heightened competition and sluggish growth of premium wine. Wine shipment volume was also almost flat at 2.2 million units.Taking a look at estimates for fourth-quarter 2017, net revenues from the smokeable and wine (net of excise taxes) segments are anticipated to be roughly $5,440 million and $239 million, reflecting year-over-year declines of 0.2% and 0.4%, respectively.Wrapping UpNevertheless, we believe that Altria’s favorable pricing and cost-reduction efforts should help it overcome soft volumes at its smokeable and wine categories and fuel bottom-line growth. Moreover, the smokeless unit is expected to continue performing well, which should also aid the fourth-quarter results. Aptly, the current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 81 cents, which represents a 19.1% growth from the year-ago period. This estimate has remained stable over the last 30 days. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $4,793 million, up more than 20% from the year-ago quarter.What the Zacks Model UnveilsTo top it, our proven model shows that Altira is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter. For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).

1620,PM,"Consumer staple companies came under pressure on Jun 5, after Mexico announced retaliatory tariffs on goods imported from the United States. The heat was primarily felt by packaged foods companies, as fears of a trade war fail to subside. Consumer staples have been suffering for a long time now with changing tastes and preferences of consumers and increased competition from online retail giants like Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report).In fact, the consumer staples sector fell for the fourth consecutive month in May, registering its worst performance since 1990. Trade war fears have added to the sector’s woes, as consumer staples continue to take a beating with retaliatory tariffs being imposed by the United States’ trade allies. That said, it needs to be seen how consumer staple companies fight back in the days to come.Mexico Tariffs Hit Consumer Staple Stocks The United States’ decision to impose 25% and 10% tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum followed by tariffs of another $60 billion saw China come up with retaliatory tariffs on a wide range of U.S. products that primarily hit the consumer staples sector.Moreover, the United States last week imposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminum from the European Union (EU), Mexico and Canada. On Jun 5, Mexico announced that it will impose retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products including pork, bourbon and some types of cheeses.This saw consumer staples stocks, in particular packaged food companies, taking a hit. Shares of Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) and General Mills, Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) slid 2% and 1.8%, respectively. Also, shares of Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.  declined 0.1% each.Understandably, packaged food companies have reasons to worry with Mexico, one of United States’ biggest trade allies, now imposing retaliatory tariffs.Consumer Staples Suffer Longest DeclineConsumer staples stocks have been suffering for quite some time now, with the sector entering the longest monthly losing streak since November 2016. The S&P 500 Consumer Staples index declined 1.7% in May, registering its straight monthly fall. On a year-to-date basis, the S&P 500 Consumer Staples index has declined 13.3%.Moreover, of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors, the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (XLP) was the second-worst performer in first-quarter 2018. The consumer staples sector didn’t have a good start to 2018, after having registered gains of more than 130% over a period of nine years. The sector has been under pressure owing to rising competition from online retailers and at the same time has been affected by rising commodity prices and transportation costs, and declining brand value.Packaged Food, Beverage, Tobacco Companies SufferChanging customer preference and inclination toward healthier options have seen a number of beverage, packaged foods and tobacco companies suffer. Year to date, shares of PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) and The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) have declined 15.1% and 5.3%, respectively. Similarly, shares of B&G Foods, Inc. (BGS  -  Free Report) and The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) have declined 20.3% and 18.4%, respectively, over the same time period.Tobacco companies too have been suffering with slower-than-expected adoption of alternate tobacco products in some markets and at the same time health-conscious people looking for healthier options. Shares of tobacco giants like Turning Point Brands, Inc. (TPB  -  Free Report) and Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report) have declined 0.6% and 25.8%, respectively. Turning Point Brands carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Bottom LineConsumer staples stocks have been considered a defensive bet, mainly because of its predictable growth rate and high dividends. However, a number of factors including changing consumer preference, declining brand value and stiff competition from online retailers are acting as tailwinds. Moreover, trade war fears have added to the woes, with countries like Mexico and China imposing tariffs on imported goods from the United States.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1621,PM,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 5.4% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is PM due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Philip Morris Q1 Earnings Beat, Sales MissPhilip Morris delivered a beat in first-quarter 2018 after missing earnings estimates five straight times. Moreover, the top and the bottom lines grew year over year. Also, management raised its bottom-line view for 2018, encouraged by tax reforms. However, these factors were not enough to placate investors, who were let down by the fifth consecutive sales miss and drop in constant currency (cc) earnings. This could be largely accountable to soft volumes.Quarter in DetailAdjusted earnings of $1.00 per share rose 2% year over year and it came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 88 cents. Excluding the positive impact from currency fluctuations, the bottom line dipped 1% from 98 cents reported in the year-ago period.Net revenues were $6,896 million, which increased 13.7% (up 8.3% on a constant currency basis) in the quarter. However, net revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7,024 million. Favorable pricing of combustible products and greater volumes of heated tobacco units and IQOS devices drove currency-neutral revenues.During the quarter, revenues from combustible products inched up 2.5% (down 2.5% at cc) to $5,769 million. Revenues from RRPs doubled (also on a cc basis) to $1,127 million, largely driven by increased sales of IQOS devices.Total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume fell 2.3% to 173.8 billion units, due to declines across most regions other than S&SA and EA&A. While cigarette shipment volume declined 5.3% to 164.3 billion units in the quarter, heated tobacco unit shipment volume of 9.6 billion units, increased 5.1 billion units year over year.Adjusted operating income inched higher by 0.4% year over year to $2,426 million, while it slipped 2.7% (on a cc basis) due to adverse volume/mix (especially in GCC) and escalated marketing, research and administration expenses. These hurdles couldn’t be fully compensated by favorable pricing. Adjusted operating margin (on a cc basis) fell 4.0 points to 35.8%.Also, during the quarter, Phillip Morris announced a quarterly dividend of $1.07.Region-Wise PerformanceNet revenues in EU climbed 0.2% (on a cc basis) to $1,988 million, courtesy of favorable pricing, somewhat offset by adverse volume/mix. Total shipment volume fell 5% to 40,599 million units.In EE, net revenues jumped 4.3% to $567 million, courtesy of the same factors that drove EU revenues. Total shipment volumes tumbled 8.3% to 22,603 million units.Net revenues slipped 1.5% to $961 million in ME&A region as adverse volume/mix more than offset gains from pricing. Total shipment volumes dropped 6.5% to 29,957 million units.Moving to S&SA, a 5.6% rise in revenues to $1,081 million was witnessed, which was backed by improved pricing, though it was also somewhat countered by unfavorable volume/mix. Shipment volumes grew 6.1% to 40,218 million units.EA&Asaw its revenues surge 27.5% to $1,591 million, owing to solid pricing. Total shipment volumes climbed 0.2% to 21,433 million units.Finally, revenues at LA&C advanced 17% to $708 million, on the back of favorable pricing. However, total shipment volumes were down 1.4% at 19,036 million units.GuidanceManagement is confident about delivering solid results in 2018, along with being committed toward making shareholder-friendly moves. The company is optimistic about strength its IQOS devices and favorable pricing of combustible products. While soft volumes in GCC, difficult pricing in Russia and sluggish sales in Japan pose hurdles, the company is on track to double its worldwide in-market heated tobacco unit sales from 2017.That said, management projects revenues in 2018 to grow about 8% (on a cc basis). Also, it expects the recent tax reforms to boost bottom-line growth. Incidentally, management now expects effective tax rate for 2018 to be roughly 26%, down from 28% projected in February.Consequently, earnings are envisioned in the range of $5.25-$5.40 compared with the previous forecast of $5.20-$5.35. The updated guidance reflects year-over-year growth of 35-39%, up from the previous projection of 34-38%. Excluding a favorable currency impact, the company anticipates adjusted earnings growth of nearly 8-11%, up from the previous forecast of 7-10%.Additionally, management expects capital expenditures of roughly $1.7 billion in 2018, while operating cash flow is envisioned to be more than $9 billion.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.

1622,PM,"As consumers look beyond traditional cigarettes, thanks to rising health concerns, Altria Group, Inc. (MO  -  Free Report) witnesses declining cigarette volumes amid a changing industry landscape. Moreover, FDA has been brandishing a whip on tobacco players through strict marketing and manufacturing regulations. Well, authorities can’t be blamed for undertaking rigorous measures, as smoking has become one of the primary causes of heart diseases and cancer.Such deterrents have caused shares of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company to fall 22% in the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 26.8%.Nevertheless, reduced-risk tobacco products (RRPs) are a ray of hope, as consumers are gradually switching to less-fatal alternatives. In fact, this has been a fundamental factor helping Altria to combat industry hurdles. We hope that these factors combined with the company’s frequent shareholder friendly moves will raise investors’ optimism in the stock.  On that note, let’s delve into few of the aspects that Altria has kept its eyes on.Cigarette Volumes Continue to PlungeApart from consumers’ avoidance of harmful tobacco products, strict FDA regulations have been a major deterrent in marring cigarette sales. Per such regulations, it is mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on packets. Also, companies are being directed to put self-critical advertisements to dissuade customers from smoking and acknowledge that cigarettes are addictive in nature. To make matters worse, FDA is bent on drastically reducing nicotine in cigarettes to minimally addictive levels.Needless to say, such factors have dampened Altria’s cigarette business for a while. Evidently, in first-quarter 2018, domestic cigarette shipment volumes fell 4.2% year over year, stemming from lower cigarette industry volumes and decline in retail share. As a result, net shipment volumes in the smokeable category fell 4.1%. Also, total cigarette retail share declined to 50.3%, representing a 0.7 percentage point slip from the year-ago quarter’s figures.Apart from Altria, the impacts of tobacco industry headwinds have also been denting the performance of companies like Philip Morris (PM  -  Free Report), British American Tobacco (BTI  -  Free Report) and Vector Group (VGR  -  Free Report).  Going Smokeless is the Latest MantraIn an attempt to navigate through troubled waters, Altria has been expanding its presence in the RRPs category. Notably, Altria’s flagship MarkTen and Green Smoke e-vapor products are performing strongly in the smokeless category. In fact, MarkTen is now a leading e-vapor brand in the United States. Backed by its efforts to strengthen RRPs portfolio, revenues from the Smokeless product category advanced 12.7% year over year to $525 million in the first quarter of 2018. This was further buoyed by better pricing and voluntary recalls made in 2017.Additionally, the marketing and technology sharing agreement between Altria and Philip Morris, which is currently under FDA review, is also expected to boost the business of the companies. Further, Altria has been working on receiving FDA approval for the marketing of smokeless products with lower risk claims. In this respect, the company recently submitted a modified risk tobacco product application to FDA for Copenhagen Snuff.Shareholders ValueDespite the hurdles, Altria has not turned away from raising shareholders’ value. To this end, management recently announced an expansion to the existing $1-billion share repurchase program by an additional sum of $1 billion. The company expects the revised $2- billion share repurchase program to be concluded by the end of the second quarter of 2019. Apart from this, during March 2018, Altria’s board hiked quarterly dividend rate by 6.1% to 70 cents per share. As a result, the company’s annualized dividend rate is currently at $2.80. Also, management is on track to maintain a payout ratio of 80% of its bottom line.That said, let’s wait and watch what is ahead for the company and if such efforts can help it stay afloat in the industry.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

1623,PM,"Even though the picture appears rosy for the U.S. economy, this favorable economic landscape can divert investors’ focus from the defensive consumer staples zone to other seemingly attractive spaces.This is likely one of the explanations for the sector’s recent underperformance, a trend that can remain in place for quite some time. Stocks in the Zacks Consumer Staples sector are down -4% over the last 12 months, lagging the S&P 500 index’s +14.2% gain over the same time period.Continued Fed tightening and higher interest rates also remain an issue for these stocks. This is so for two reasons. First, Consumer Staples stocks, like Utility stocks, are typically dividend payers which tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. Second, Consumer Staples companies have global operations and remain vulnerable to strength in the exchange value of the U.S. dollar. The dollar has started gaining ground lately on account of the Fed and interest rate backdrop.Also, possibility of a trade war with China continues to raise fears for companies whose business operations are likely to be hit by tariffs.Other than this, the consumer staples space is grappling with rising input costs as well as intense competition, with the latter stemming from consumers’ changing preferences and Amazon’s AMZN ever-growing dominance. This, in turn has created significant pricing pressure, alongside compelling companies to undertake aggressive promotional activities. These factors pose major threats to margins, which have been plateaued for quite some time now.That said, we believe that investors must take stock of the possible obstacles in the consumer staples sector before making any investment decision within it.Input Cost Volatility, Escalated Freight CostsInput costs play a major role in determining the performance of a company. An increase in input cost directly hits the company’s margins and profits. Moreover, any price increase to offset the same may drive consumers away. We note that many Consumer Staples companies are bearing the brunt of high input costs, which remains a concern for the future. Also, the food industry in general is battling a tough transportation landscape due to lower driver availability.This, in turn, has raised freight costs for many players like Smucker’s (SJM  -  Free Report), Pinnacle Foods (PF  -  Free Report), United Natural UNPI and Sysco SYS, among others. In fact, most of these companies expect higher freight costs to remain a threat to their margins.Moving to higher commodity costs, consumer goods behemoth Colgate has been bearing the brunt of increased commodity and packaging costs, which have been hurting its gross margin. Input cost inflation also remains a cause of concern for players like Campbell Soup CPB, Dean Foods DF, Molson Coors (TAP  -  Free Report), Pinnacle Foods, Church & Dwight CHD and Kimberly-Clark KMB. In fact, Kimberly expects commodity costs to shoot up mainly due to higher prices for several raw materials, including pulp. As for Church & Dwight, it expects both higher commodity and transportation expenses to weigh on gross margin in 2018. Sysco and Pinnacle Foods are other examples that remain troubled by both these headwinds.Intense CompetitionConsumer staples companies face stiff competition with respect to innovation, pricing, brand strength, promotions and responsiveness to evolving consumer trends. This results in lower pricing power and a decline in market share, which in turn compresses margins and earnings. For example, Kimberly-Clark’s diaper segment faces significant competitive activity, which puts the company’s market share at risk.Dean Foods also battles stiff competition, not only with various dairy processors for shelf space, but also with various beverages and nutritional products. Further, the beauty and beauty-related products industry is highly competitive, which remains a challenge for players like Avon Products AVP and Coty COTY. Results of alcohol giants like Constellation Brands (STZ  -  Free Report) and Brown-Forman BF.B may also be somewhat stifled in a cut-throat competitive environment.Strained Margins Many companies in the consumer staples sector have been plagued by strained margins, stemming from various factors. These include tough grocery market conditions, rising input costs, costs associated with meeting consumers’ changing demands and stiff competition that leads to aggressive promotions and price wars. From grocery chains like SUPERVALU (SVU  -  Free Report), food companies like Campbell Soup, cosmetic biggies like Estee Lauder to consumer products companies like Church & Dwight, Colgate CL, Newell Brands (NWL  -  Free Report) and Kimberly-Clark, all remain troubled by squeezed margins.The grocery industry has been grappling with challenges like stiff competition and aggressive promotions, which became more pronounced after Amazon’s takeover of Whole Foods Market. Traditional grocery companies are facing competition from rivals, which are strengthening their franchises and offering alternative outlets for food and other staples. Also, customers are more inclined toward private label products, which are low-cost alternatives to national brands. This, in turn, is hurting food companies.Higher Operating Expenses to Limit ProfitsAs demand for staples is usually consistent, companies strive to increase sales and market share through innovations, promotions and efficient marketing and advertising. Thus, consumer staple companies tend to spend heavily on marketing and advertising. Though advertising strengthens brand appeal and helps to counter competition, it severely hits the profit margins of these companies. Also, efforts to keep up with consumers’ changing needs entail significant costs. In this regard, costs related to e-commerce development and marketing are likely to impact profitability.Companies like Kimberly-Clark, PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) and Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report) have significantly stepped up their investments in marketing, innovation, R&D, supply chain and capacity additions, which may hinder profits. Pinnacle Foods has also been witnessing escalated marketing costs, and expects these barriers to linger.Emerging Market VolatilityThe majority of the global population is clustered in emerging economies. Thus, food/beverage companies are increasingly investing in developing and emerging markets like India, China and Brazil which boast significant growth potential due to relatively low per-capita consumption. Another reason is the burgeoning middle-class population with rising income levels, which in turn is increasing the demand for convenience food and beverages. Though emerging markets offer strong growth prospects, they are generally volatile due to fluctuating currencies and other structural and political issues. Moreover, any unprecedented event that may impact economic conditions in countries like China, Brazil and Russia remains a threat.Soft VolumesMany consumer staples companies are struggling with declining volumes or soft volume growth, which is hurting their top line. Mondelez’s (MDLZ  -  Free Report) volumes have been weak since 2014 due to volume erosion from higher pricing and category weakness because of lower demand. Another company that has long been battling soft volumes is dairy products player, Dean Foods.Apart from this, growing health and wellness consciousness has resulted in volume declines of carbonated drinks of Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) and Dr. Pepper DPS, while it has also been hurting cigarette volumes of bigwigs like Altria (MO  -  Free Report) and Phillip Morris (PM  -  Free Report). Molson Coors has also been posting soft beer volumes in the United States for quite some time now, on account of difficult industry conditions.Government RestrictionsTobacco companies like Altria Group, Philip Morris and British American Tobacco are facing constant government regulations to make consumers aware of the health hazards associated with tobacco products. Well, government authorities have been brandishing the whip on tobacco players as smoking has become one of the primary causes of heart diseases and cancer. Apart from seeking authorization for any new tobacco product, the FDA has made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets.Additionally, these companies have been directed to put self-critical advertisements on television and newspapers, particularly emphasizing the addictive nature of cigarettes. To add to the woes, the FDA is bent on drastically reducing nicotine in cigarettes to minimally addictive levels. The initiative was proposed in 2017 but was delayed due to ongoing research. If enacted, low nicotine levels will prove to be disastrous for cigarette manufacturing companies.Moreover, increasing regulatory moves have raised awareness amongst consumers regarding the detrimental effects of tobacco consumption, motivating them to quit smoking. These restrictions have lowered cigarette consumption and significantly dented volumes.While this was for tobacco companies, alcohol stocks also remain vulnerable to government regulations. Distilled spirits are subject to excise tax in various countries. Thus, rising fiscal pressure in the United States, European and emerging markets may lead to increasing risk of a potential excise tax on spirits by governments of the respective countries.Bottom LineThough the consumer staples industry is faced with a number of problems, does the sector have anything to offer to short-term investors?Check out our latest Consumer Staples Outlook for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective and the trend in this important sector of the economy.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1624,PM,"Demand for everyday-use products created by operators in the Consumer Staples space doesn’t tend to fluctuate a lot, but it is nevertheless exposed to macroeconomic forces at the margins. As such, the outlook for this space perks up as the outlook for the U.S. and global economy improves.The outlook for the U.S. economy has been favorable for the last several years, with the recent tax legislation expected to add to the longevity of the current U.S. expansion cycle. In addition to the indirect benefits to Consumer Staples companies from the tax cuts, these companies also stand to benefit directly from the legislation, as reflected in the improving earnings outlook for many companies. That said, Consumer Staples operators tend to be global in their operations and as such don’t benefit to the same extent from U.S. tax law changes as the more domestic companies. With growth hard to come by for companies in this mature space, Consumer Staples players have to remain focused on squeezing more out of their operations and coming out with revenue-boosting initiatives, which mainly include efforts to keep pace with the changing consumer patterns.On that note, let’s delve deeper in some of the major growth-driving strategies of the space.Strengthening Product Portfolio via Strategic Alliances, Buyouts Consumer staples companies are regularly undertaking both domestic and international acquisitions to expand their product lines and gain access to new markets. Some of these are also forming partnerships, mostly with larger and better-known companies, to strengthen their distribution networks, diversify portfolios, expand their reach and enhance market positioning. Notably, leveraging each other’s efficiencies creates significant synergies for companies that go for M&A activities.Mergers of Tyson Foods (TSN  -  Free Report) with packaged meat producer The Hillshire Brands (in August 2014); tobacco giants Reynolds American and Lorillard (in June 2015); food giants Kraft Foods Group, Inc. KHC and H.J. Heinz Company (in July 2015) and consumer goods companies Newell Brands (NWL  -  Free Report) and Jarden (in 2016) were the most talked about deals. Belgium-based brewer Anheuser Busch InBev’s BUD buyout of SABMiller in October 2016 also created a buzz in the beverage industry. Apart from this, Molson Coors (TAP  -  Free Report) acquired SABMiller plc’s 58% stake in MillerCoors, which made the former the third-largest brewer in the world, after Anheuser-Busch InBev and Heineken.Cost Cutting and Restructuring InitiativesMost consumer staples companies are implementing cost-reduction initiatives to boost profits. In the latter half of 2017, Tyson Foods announced a Financial Fitness Program, with the objectives of enhancing operating efficiency, reducing overheads and fuelling bottom-line performance. Colgate CL has also been benefiting from its Global Growth and Efficiency Program, which focuses on reducing structural costs in order to improve gross and operating profit, standardizing processes to improve the decision-making procedure and enhance its market share worldwide.Additionally, Sysco’s (SYY  -  Free Report) core strategies for 2020 include plans to optimize business and achieving operational efficacy. We also commend Kimberly Clark’s KMB 2018 Global Restructuring & Focus on Reducing Costs Everywhere (FORCE) programs, which are expected to generate cost savings of more than $2 billion over the next four years. Companies like McCormick MKC, Coca-Cola KO, Molson Coors, Mondelez International MDLZ, Smucker (SJM  -  Free Report), Kellogg K and many others have also been benefiting from significant cost savings and restructuring initiatives to boost earnings.Focus on InnovationInnovation remains the guiding principle of consumer staples companies as it enables them to enhance brand appeal through product differentiation and capture market share across all regions and categories. Thus, companies put a lot of thrust on innovation to upgrade their brands and create differentiated value propositions. Notably, constant innovations supported by efficient marketing are essential for consumer staples companies to stay ahead of competition.As evidence, novelty has been a driving force for consumer product giants like The Procter & Gamble Co. (PG  -  Free Report) and Colgate-Palmolive, and cosmetic majors like Estee Lauder EL. These companies constantly come up with new products that suit changing consumer trends, to tap demand and boost revenues. Also, major food companies like Smucker and Campbell Soup CPB, alcohol stocks like Brown-Forman BF.B and Constellation Brands (STZ  -  Free Report), and even tobacco players like Altria (MO  -  Free Report) and Phillip Morris (PM  -  Free Report) have been adding new products to gain competitive edge and augment market share.Exiting Underperforming Units to Enhance OperationsApart from growing their businesses through buyouts, companies also remain focused on improving their product portfolios through divestitures. Offloading underperforming operations enables the companies to concentrate on the core and profitable areas.For example, as part of its strategic business review following its merger with Jarden, Newell Brands announced plans to sell nearly 10% of its current portfolio, including a major chunk of its Tools segment. This highlights the company’s focus on simplifying its operating structure, alongside highlighting its commitment toward making prudent investments in areas with higher growth potential. Similarly, Unilever (UL  -  Free Report) announced plans to sell its shrinking Spreads business to KKR (in December 2017) to shift concentration on fast-growing products.Adopting E-Commerce Mantra: The Need of the HourWith technology having advanced by leaps and bounds, online shopping has become the order of the day. Thanks to various mobile apps and dot.com business lines, shopping for anything is literally on consumers’ finger-tips. Consumers’ rapid shift to e-marketplace has compelled companies to adopt the e-commerce mantra. Companies like United Naturals (UNFI  -  Free Report), SUPERVALU (SVU  -  Free Report), Campbell Soup and Estee Lauder among others, are striving to enhance e-commerce space, through investments in technology and infrastructure.Driven by these efforts, United Natural Foods’ e-commerce sales jumped almost 28.9% in the second quarter. As for SUPERVALU, the company’s contract with Instacart, along with endeavors to upgrade website and mobile applications underscore its knack to enhance consumer shopping experiences.Transition to Health and Wellness ProductsAs consumer preference is the life blood of Consumer Staples, companies have to adapt to evolving trends to stay strong in the industry. A key trend over the last few years has been the desire for natural and organic products, prompting many players in the space to come out with health and wellness offerings. This is the case with almost all industries in the sector.Apart from this, tobacco companies like Altria and Reynolds American are also adapting to the evolving needs of consumers and have resorted to less harmful alternatives like electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). To cater to changing consumer preference, Philip Morris launched the much talked about IQOS, a smokeless cigarette in November 2014, aiming to lead the tobacco industry’s push into reduced-risk products. IQOS is anticipated to boost market share and offset declining volumes in traditional cigarette business over the long term.Additionally, rising consumer awareness regarding the harmful impact of toxic chemicals has been driving the market share for organic personal care products too. Consequently, players like Unilever are making solid progress in the natural and organic products category. This is evident from its deal to buy Schmidt’s Naturals that specializes in personal care products such as deodorants, toothpaste and bar soaps. Clearly, these robust efforts are expected to boost the companies’ top line in the future.Clearly, the consumer staples space offers plenty of reasons to be optimistic about it over the long term. So how about investing in the space right now?Check out our latest Consumer Staples Outlook here for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective, and how the trend is looking for this important sector of the economy now.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1625,PM,"Markets finished lower on Friday, as technology stocks took a hit owing to concerns of weak demand for iPhones. Also, the broader consumer staples sector took a hit led by Pepsi and Procter& Gamble. Moreover, a rise in bond yields, reflecting fears of rising inflation, kept investors worried. The 10-year Treasury note touched a four-year high leading to huge selloffs. Following these events, all the major indexes closing lower on Friday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) declined 0.8%, to close at 24,462.94. The S&P 500 fell 0.9% to close at 2,670.14. The Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7146.13, shedding 1.3%. A total of 6.45 billion shares were traded on Friday, lower than the last 20-session average of 6.92 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 2.40-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.74-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.How did the Benchmark Perform?The Dow declined 201.95 points as shares of Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) tumbled on concerns of weak demand for iPhones, leading to a decline in all tech stocks. Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) declined 1.1%, while Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) fell 1.9% and 1%, respectively. Apple has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

The Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) and Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (XLP) declined 1.5% and 1.7%, respectively. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq shed 7146.13 points.Tech Stocks, Consumer Staples Take a HitTech stocks declined on Friday, with Apple at the helm of the carnage, as concerns over weak demand of iPhones saw the company’s shares plummeting. Shares of Apple declined 4.1% after Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) predicted that sales of iPhone in the June quarter will be low.This saw other tech stocks taking a hit for the fourth consecutive day ahead of the earnings week for the sector. Tech stocks have been reeling under pressure for quite some time now and the low sales projection of iPhones is a further blow to the sector.Moreover, consumer staples stocks declined led by PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report), which fell 2.9%. Also, shares of Procter & Gamble and Phillip Morris International (PM  -  Free Report) declined 2.9% and 1.6%, respectively. Procter and Gamble’s shares declined after the company said on Thursday that higher costs and shrinking retailer inventories were weighing on its margins. Shares of Philip Morris declined after the company reported weak shipment volumes in its quarterly results.10-Year Treasury Note Hits 4-Year HighFriday’s decline in stocks were also driven by investors’ fears over concerns of expectations of rising inflation., The 10-year Treasury yield reached 2.96%, its highest level since January 2014. This saw huge selloffs in bonds. Investors panicked as they felt that the government’s protectionist policy will boost inflation higher. However, banks stocks gained on the back of higher rates. This saw the Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) gain 0.1%.Weekly RoundupIt was a mixed week for all the three major indexes as the earnings season got into full swing. U.S. stock markets surged on the first two day of the week driven by robust first-quarter 2018 earnings results, strong economic data and easing geopolitical tensions. The middle of the week was a mixed bag for the markets with the Dow declining marginally.However, the last two days of the week saw all major indexes ending in red. This was primarily because of concerns over rising inflation, which saw the 10-year Treasury yield touching a four year high. Moreover, consumer staples stocks too suffered, as earnings failed to produce any blowout results that the market was looking for. The tech sector was once again hit after Morgan Stanley said that iPhones would witness sales in the June quarter.However, despite this, both Dow and S&P 500 rose 0.4% each over the week, while Nasdaq gained 1.3%.Stocks That Made HeadlinesKansas City Southern Q1 Earnings Miss, Improve Y/YKansas City Southern’s (KSU  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

Among the top ETFs, investors saw (SPY  -  Free Report) lose 0.8%, (DIA  -  Free Report) shed 0.8%, and (QQQ  -  Free Report) move lower by 1.6% on the day.Two more specialized ETFs are worth noting as both saw trading volume that was far outside of normal. In fact, both these funds experienced volume levels that were more than double their average for the most recent trading session. This could make these ETFs the ones to watch out for in the days ahead to see if this trend of extra-interest continues:(SIL  -  Free Report): Volume 3.69 times averageThis silver ETF was in the spotlight on Friday as about 492,000 shares moved hands compared with an average of 134,000 shares a day. We also saw some price movement as SIL shed 1.1% last session.The movement can largely be blamed on rising bond yields that have dampened the appeal for the white metal. SIL was down 12.45% in a month’s time.(RHS  -  Free Report): Volume 2.39 times averageThis consumer staples ETF was under the microscope on Friday as nearly 73,000 shares moved hands. This compares with an average trading day of roughly 31,000 shares and came as RHS lost about 1.9% in the trading session.The big move was largely the result of a weak earnings report from Philip Morris (PM  -  Free Report) that can have a huge impact on the consumer staple stocks like what we find in this ETF portfolio.

1627,PM,"Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report) reported disappointing quarterly results in the first quarter of 2018. It registered a 13.7% year-over-year increase in quarterly revenues to $6.896 billion in the quarter from $6.064 billion a year ago.It failed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales but surpassed earnings estimates. Moreover, the share price took a massive hit owing to the poor performance of its cigarettes segment. The stock lost 15.6% at market close on Apr 19. Increased regulation and poor demand, owing to health concerns, weighed on the company’s performance.Q1 Results in FocusPhilip Morris reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.00, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 88 cents. However, the company’s revenues of $6.896 billion (excluding excise taxes) fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.024 billion. Excluding favorable currency impact, annual revenues grew 8.3% in the year.The tobacco company reported operating income of $2.426 billion, down 2.7% year over year (excluding a favorable currency impact of $76 million).Shipment VolumeThe company’s total shipment volume came in at 173.846 billion units, down 5.3% from the first-quarter 2017 figure of 177.987 billion units. Although higher shipment volume of cigarettes in South and Southeast Asia was a positive, overall shipment volume of cigarettes declined 5.3% to 164.280 billion units in the quarter. However, some respite came in the form of an increase in shipment volume in heated tobacco units, which increased to 9.566 billion units from 4.435 billion units in the prior-year quarter.OutlookPhilip Morris expects full-year 2018 diluted earnings per share in the range of $5.25-$5.40. This reflects a 35-39% increase from the 2017 EPS figure of $3.88.

1628,PM,"One of the most famous names in the consumer products world – Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report) – came up with a beat on both line in results for the third quarter of fiscal 2018. The consumer behemoth also announced a big-ticket acquisition of Merck's Consumer-Health Unit as well as the terminated a joint venture with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries.Such a volley of good news should boost the stock of P&G, but in reality, shares fell about 4.2% due to about loss of market share in its core business, per CNBC. Margin pressure was pronounced in the earnings report.Let’s delve a little deeper into the results and assess what could be done with P&G shares in the coming days (read: 3 Staples ETFs & Stocks to Buy on Retail Sales & Geopolitics).Procter & Gamble's 3Q18 Earnings in FocusP&G’s fiscal third-quarter core earnings of $1.00 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 98 cents by 2%. The bottom line increased 4% from the prior-year quarter. Currency-neutral core earnings per share (EPS) also improved 1%. The upside was primarily driven by increased net sales and a lower core effective tax rate.Reported net sales of $16.3 billion topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.2 billion and grew 4% from the year-ago level, thanks to strong sales from its beauty, and fabric and homecare business lines. Foreign exchange had a 4% positive impact on sales.On the flip side, organically (excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange), revenues grew 1% (versus 2% growth seen in the preceding quarter). Pricing had a 2% negative impact on sales. P&G’s Gillette shaving business continues to face pricing pressure from U.S. retailers. The brand has been facing steep competition from the likes of Dollar Shave Club and Harry’s have due to the latter’s less expensive products.Core gross margin dropped 110 basis points (bps) to 49.4%, as productivity savings and higher sales were more than offset by headwinds like higher commodity costs and unfavorable pricing impacts.Outlook The company has lifted its core EPS growth projection to 6-8% (versus 5-8% expected earlier).But it maintained its projection for the year and expects organic sales growth in the range of 2-3% for fiscal 2018.Acquisition Details P&G announced to buy the consumer-health business of Germany-based Merck KGaA for approximately 3.4 billion euro ($4 billion). Per the terms, P&G will also acquire a 51.8% stake in India-listed Merck Ltd. The deal is expected to close during the 2018/19 fiscal. The acquisition will help P&G to solidify its consumer healthcare business.Consumer ETF ImpactThe loss in PG and Philip Morris (PM  -  Free Report) shares is reflected in the ETF world, with consumer staples funds being hurt. Many of the key funds in this segment have a double-digit allocation to the consumer product giant P&G, suggesting that the performance of the fund is highly dependent on the company’s performance. Let’s take a look at the following three ETFs with a solid allocation to Procter & Gamble (read: Consumer Staples ETF Investing 101):Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLP  -  Free Report)The most popular consumer ETF on the market, XLP, follows the S&P Consumer Staples Select Sector Index. The fund invests about $7.56 billion of assets in 34 holdings. Of these firms, the in-focus P&G takes the first spot, making up roughly 1.4% of the assets. The fund lost 2.9% on Apr 19 (see all consumer staples ETFs here).Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF (VDC  -  Free Report)This fund manages a $3.79 billion asset base and provides exposure to a basket of 99 consumer stocks. The product charges a low fee of 10 bps per year from investors. Here too, P&G is the top firm with 10.4% allocation. VDC retreated about 2.7% on Apr 19.iShares U.S. Consumer Goods ETF (IYK  -  Free Report)The fund holds about 107 stocks in its basket with AUM of $468.4 million. Like the other two, the stock under consideration occupies the top position in the basket with 9.12% of assets. The fund shed about 2.9% on Apr 19.Bottom LineEven though acquisition announcement should bode well over the long term, the near-term prospect of P&G doesn’t appear to be smooth. Plus, the Zacks Industry Rank of Procter & Gamble is in the bottom 8%. The VGM Score of the stock is D. Investors should also keep in mind that the wind is not in favor of the broader sector. The Zacks Sector Rank is in the bottom 44%. So, it is better to stay away from the consumer space at this moment.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week. Get it free >>

The index recorded 22 new 52-week highs and 16 new 52-week lows.The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite also lost 0.8%.  Weak financial outlook given by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (TSM  -  Free Report) had a domino effect on the entire technology sector, especially on the semiconductor stocks. The index recorded 87 new 52-week highs and 52 new 52-week lows.Taiwan Semiconductor Pulls Down Technology Stocks Taiwan Semiconductor, the largest contract chipmaker worldwide, stated that its second-quarter 2018 revenues will likely fall in the range of $7.8 billion to $7.9 billion, lagging the consensus estimate of $8.5 billion. Consequently, the stock price declined 5.6%.The company reported mixed results in the first quarter of 2018.

The 30-year bond yield also advanced 5.8 basis points to 3.106%, its highest level since March 21.This augmented investor’s fear that inflationary pressure will be more than market expectation which will force the Fed to raise interest rate. Last time the benchmark yield crossed 2.9% mark was in February resulting in market corrections.  President Trump Exempts of Mueller’s InvestigationDuring the final hour of trading session, Bloomberg News reported that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein told President Donald Trump last week he is not the target of an investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller.

1630,PM,"Philip Morris International Inc.’s (PM  -  Free Report) not-so-impressive first-quarter 2018 results gave investors cold feet, yesterday.  Well, Philip Morris’ results were mainly dampened by declining shipment volumes across some of the key market regions, thanks to lower cigarette sales.The hurdles and their persistence were evident from investors’ bearish stance on the stock that fell 15.6% yesterday, slipping to a 52-week low of $83.50 and closing at $85.64. Per sources, this single day plunge counts amongst its biggest in almost 10 years. Apart from giving a jolt to Phillip Morris’ investors, softness in the cigarettes category also sent ripples of fear in the industry, dragging shares of other major players as well.We note that the Zacks Tobacco industry has been sailing on rough seas, due to regulatory hurdles in the form of limitations on marketing, anti-smoking campaigns and higher excise duties. These factors have taken a serious toll on cigarette sales volumes, globally. Apart from this, rising health consciousness among consumers around the world lowered cigarette consumption. Indeed, such limitations have hindered the growth of the Tobacco industry that lost close to 17% in the past six months, versus the S&P 500 Index’s gain of 5.3%. Coming back to yesterday’s debacle, let’s delve into the factors that led to such a nightmare for the company.What Hit Philip Morris?Disappointingly, during the first quarter of 2018, Philip Morris’ total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume fell 2.3% to 173.8 billion units, caused by declines across most regions other than South & Southeast Asia Region (S&SA) and the East Asia & Australia Region. In fact, all regions other than S&SA witnessed substantial decline in cigarette shipment volumes. So much so that even doubled-up increase in heated tobacco unit wasn’t enough to pare the declines witnessed in cigarettes, on an overall basis.Further, the company’s operating income slipped 2.7% on a constant-currency (cc) basis, due to adverse volume/mix, especially in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), as well as escalated marketing, research and administration expenses incurred in respect of reduced risk products (RRPs). These hurdles couldn’t be fully offset by favorable pricing. Also, adjusted operating margin, at cc, fell 4.0 points to 35.8%. Further, the company’s currency-neutral bottom line dipped 1% in the first quarter, from 98 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.Meanwhile, Philip Morris’ net revenues surged year on year. Expected gains from tax reforms also encouraged management to raise bottom-line view for 2018. However, these factors were not enough to placate investors who were gravely concerned with poor shipment volumes that led to the company’s fifth consecutive top-line miss.Apart from this, management’s comments regarding the ongoing performance of certain regions  are likely to make them jittery. Incidentally, management continues to stay apprehensive regarding soft volumes in GCC, difficult pricing in Russia and sluggish sales in Japan.Will Other Tobacco Players Follow Suit?Altria Group, Inc. (MO  -  Free Report), slated to release first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, could not escape the domino effect of Philip Morris’s weak volumes. Evidently, Altria’s shares tumbled close to 6.1% yesterday. Like Philip Morris, Altria too has been grappling with receding shipment volumes in the smokeable segment. Notably, volumes in the segment declined 2.6%, 2.7%, 6.1% and 8.7%, respectively, in the preceding four quarters. Moreover, due to persistent declines in the cigarette category, Altria’s top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in eight out of the last 10 quarters. The company carries a VGM Score of F.Moreover, British American Tobacco plc. (BTI  -  Free Report) and Vector Group Ltd. (VGR  -  Free Report) saw their shares decline 4.7% and 1.1%, respectively, during yesterday’s trading session. British American Tobacco’s organic cigarette volumes declined 2.6%, which was reflected in its preliminary results in February 2018. Vector Group, carrying a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) also witnessed a decline of 2.8% in tobacco unit sales volumes in the fourth quarter of 2017 results. The company carries a VGM Score of D. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Any Hopes of a Revival Ahead?Philip Morris, Altria and British American Tobacco, all carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), have been sternly focusing on the growth of RRPs. In fact, RRPs are rapidly gaining traction, considering their less detrimental impacts on health. With prolonged focus in this category, Philip Morris is pioneering the radical shift from harmful tobacco products to scientific and low-risk product alternatives. The company carries a VGM Score of B and has a long-term growth rate of 10.1%.Altria has been radically expanding its RRPs portfolio. Furthermore, Altria’s marketing and technology agreement with Philip Morris is expected to boost the businesses of the companies. British American Tobacco has also been striving to expand in the RRPs realm with its Next Generation Products lineup. Although Vector Group has not ventured out into RRPs, the company relies upon the real estate segment to offset tobacco sales related hurdles.Wrapping it up, RRPs seem to be one of the most viable options for companies to stay afloat in the tobacco industry (ranked among the top 38% out of more than 256 Zacks industries). However, such advancements are yet to completely offset cigarette sales declines, as the smokeable category accounts for a considerable chunk of revenues for most of these players. That said, let’s wait and watch what lies ahead for the players in the tobacco space and whether their efforts will revive the lost sheen in the stock market.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1631,PM,"Considering how many game-changing headlines we’ve seen so far in 2018 — from inflation/interest rate fears to geopolitical hornets nests to Washington DC soap operas — this has been a welcome week for the stock markets. Just think if we’d have had some seasonably appropriate weather — we’d be on Cloud 9 right now! And this relative calm in a sea of turbulence continues ahead of the opening bell this morning, with Initial Jobless Claims and new Q1 earnings results hitting the tape.Initial Jobless Claims remained steady at 232K last week, 1000 claims fewer than the previous week and remaining solidly within the long-term range of 225K-250K which is illustrative of a very strong (and continually tightening) labor market. Aside from dips below even these very robust figures a month or so ago, and spikes into higher jobless claims territory for a short time following last summer’s massive hurricanes, we have enjoyed an historically strong and steady U.S. employment situation for several years now. Continuing claims reached 1.863 million in the week, another very healthy sign.Q1 earnings results continue strong and steady, as well. While we’re not seeing any of the biggest companies on Wall Street reporting today, such as the FANG stocks (most of which start next week; Netflix posted positive surprises Monday), we do have a number of companies that have registered new figures, and almost all better than expected:Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated W.W. Grainger (GWW  -  Free Report) posted a heft earnings beat, reporting $4.18 per share vs. $3.41 expected. Revenues also surpassed expectations, $2.77 billion vs. $2.71 billion in the Zacks consensus. The company also raised sales guidance for full-year 2018 from 3-7% previously to 5-8% today, to $14.30-15.30 per share. Shares, as a result, are trading up 7% in today’s pre-market. For more on GWW’s earnings, click here.Two Wall Street banks have also brought forth Q1 results: BB&T (BBT  -  Free Report) and Bank of New York-Mellon (BK  -  Free Report). Both Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)-rated firms beat on both top and bottom lines, with BK posting the wider positive margins: $1.10 per share on $4.18 billion, ahead of the 97 cents and $4.05 billion anticipated, up 33% and 9% year over year, respectively. BBT beat by 5 cents on the bottom line to 97 cents per share on revenues that eked out expectations of $2.83 billion.For more on BBT’s earnings, click here.For more on BK’s earnings, click here.Among still others, tobacco major Philip Morris (PM  -  Free Report) topped earnings estimates by posting an even $1.00 per share in the quarter, above the 88 cents expected and representing growth of 2% year over year. Yet revenues of $6,896 million fell beneath the Zacks consensus of $7,024 million, although year over year was still up 13.7%. Guidance is for full-year growth of 8-11%, higher.
"
1632,PM,"With anti-smoking campaigns and strict government regulations striving to curb tobacco consumption, industry giants like Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report) have been witnessing receding cigarette sales volumes. Amid such adverse industry conditions, Philip Morris has diverted its attention to reduced risk products (RRPs) to propel growth and stay afloat in the industry.Philip Morris Travels on the Smoke-Free WayRising health consciousness and adverse impacts of tobacco consumption have pushed consumers toward RRPs such as e-cigarettes, HeatSticks and iQOS products. To meet consumer’s changing preference, Philip Morris launched the iQOS (in 2014), a smokeless cigarette, in approximately 31 markets globally and catered to more than 3.7 million consumers globally, excluding the United States. In fact, courtesy of growing popularity of such products, Philip Morris generated revenues worth $947 million from RRPs during the third quarter of 2017, up from $212 million reported last year.Further, the marketing and technology sharing agreement between Philip Morris and Altria Group (MO  -  Free Report) for selling the former’s iQOS heated tobacco products in the United States, is also expected to aid volume and sales growth for the companies. The agreement is currently submitted for review to the FDA.Per sources, the FDA is currently carrying out extensive research on whether prolonged usage of iQOS products carries any detrimental impacts on health. If authorities provide a green signal to this product, it may prove to be an important milestone in the path of popularizing less harmful tobacco products in the country.   Stringent Regulations Dent Cigarette SalesApart from price hikes and precautionary labels, the FDA has directed tobacco makers to lower nicotine levels in cigarettes to make it less addictive. Such efforts to check tobacco consumption lowered cigarette sales volumes globally. This weighed on the performance of major companies such as British American Tobacco (BTI  -  Free Report) and Vector Group (VGR  -  Free Report).Incidentally, Philip Morris’ net revenues during third-quarter 2017 were hurt by a 3.6% decline in combustible products. Total shipment volumes in this category also declined 4.1%. As a result, total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume fell 0.5%.To make matters worse, the court recently issued an order which guides cigarette companies to put up self-critical advertisements circulated through television, newspapers, social media and store displays. Such headwinds plaguing the tobacco industry are likely to drag Philip Morris’ combustible products category performance in the forthcoming periods as well. Driven by such headwinds, shares of Philip Morris fell 8.4% in the past six months, compared with the industry’s decline of 2.9%.Final ThoughtsNevertheless, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s efforts to popularize iQOS products and expand sales in the reduced risk products category are laudable. Even amid adverse industry conditions, Philip Morris is likely to continue benefiting from consumers shift to cigarette alternatives in the forthcoming periods, which will help it lift investors’ optimism.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1633,PM,"Altria Group, Inc. (MO  -  Free Report) appears well-placed on the back of its impressive brand portfolio and strong pricing power. Though the company has been experiencing the jolts of declining demand for tobacco products and stringent government regulations to curb the consumption, management has been aggressively working toward producing smokeless products.Impressively, the company’s shares have rallied 9.9% in the past three months, ahead of the industry’s gain of 6% and the broader Consumer Staples sector’s growth of 2%. Also, a Momentum Score of B and a long-term earnings growth rate of 7.4% highlight the stock’s inherent potential.  What’s Working Well for the Stock?Altria has been gaining from its progress in the smokeless products category, which is also contributing significantly to the company’s performance. Its flagship MarkTen and Green Smoke e-vapor products are performing well in this category. In third-quarter 2017, MarkTen became a leading e-vapor brand in the United States with a retail market share of approximately 13.5% in mainstream retail channels. Management expects the smokeless product category, including e-vapor products, to continue performing well going forward.Incidentally, Altria’s marketing and technology sharing agreement with Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report), which is currently under the FDA’s review, can also prove to be beneficial for both companies for tapping greater opportunities in the e-cigarette realm.Meanwhile, this leading tobacco company remains on track with its cost-reduction initiatives and consolidation of its manufacturing facilities to streamline operations. Also, the company has been riding on its robust brand strength and higher cigarette pricing in the face of unfavorable tax environment and declining cigarette volumes. Apart from cigarettes, better pricing trend favored the smokeless products category too, as evident from the company’s third-quarter 2017 results.What’s Troubling the Stock?Regulatory bodies are imposing restrictions on tobacco companies, which in turn, are lowering cigarette consumption. Moreover, the FDA directed companies to lower nicotine in cigarettes to non-addictive or minimally-addictive levels. Per the November 2017 court order, companies manufacturing cigarettes must make consumers aware of the health implications of smoking through advertisements via television channels, newspapers, websites, store displays and cigarette packs.These industry concerns have been largely weighing upon the company’s top line, which lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in seven out of the trailing nine quarters. Also, the company’s net revenues fell 2.5% in the last reported quarter due to soft net revenues in the smokeable products segments. Further, revenues net of excise taxes slipped 1.3% year over year.The afore-mentioned industry headwinds have not only marred Altria’s performance, but have also affected some other leading players in the industry like Philip Morris, Vector Group Ltd. (VGR  -  Free Report) and British American Tobacco p.l.c. (BTI  -  Free Report).Nevertheless, Altria’s focus on expanding in the smokeless products space may provide cushion and help fuel growth. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1634,PM,"Altria Group Inc. (MO  -  Free Report), which has a solid base in the tobacco industry, has been bearing the brunt of receding consumer enthusiasm toward tobacco products as well as stern regulations by government bodies.Nevertheless, Altria is not all out of hopes and has been leaning on reduced risk tobacco products to remain afloat in the market. We expect this category to be a major growth driver in 2018.Well, let’s delve deep into the troubles looming over this tobacco giant, and see if its strategic endeavors can help it witness a turnaround in 2018.Major Deterrents in Altria’s Growth StoryPersistent declines in cigarette volumes have been dragging down Altria’s smokeable category’s performance. This has led to a fall in the company’s retail market share. In the preceding four quarters, shipment volumes in the smokeable segment declined 6.1%, 2.7%, 2.6% and 4.7%, respectively. In fact, Marlboro, one of Altria’s prominent cigarette brands, registered a 6% decline in volumes in third-quarter 2017.Regulatory hurdles in the form of limitations on marketing, anti-smoking campaigns and higher excise duties are the primary reasons for the unit’s drab performance. Battered by these factors, Altria’s top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in seven out of the last nine quarters.Government Initiatives to Control SmokingSince smoking isn’t a proud practice, regulatory bodies have been chalking out plans to lower this habit. Per the November 2017 court order, companies manufacturing cigarettes must make consumers aware of the health implications of smoking through advertisements via television channels, newspapers, websites, store displays and cigarette packs. The directive was issued after the federal authorities came to a conclusion that companies need to be proactive in informing consumers about the hazards of tobacco consumption. Moreover, in July 2017, the FDA directed companies to lower nicotine in cigarettes to non-addictive or minimally-addictive levels.Further, the FDA declared that companies manufacturing tobacco products must seek marketing authorization for any tobacco products introduced after Feb 15, 2007. In May 2016, the FDA amended this restriction to include e-cigarettes, pipe tobacco, cigars and hookah alongside traditional tobacco products. Moreover, the European Union and the FDA have proposed a ban on menthol in accordance with the Tobacco Control Act which essentially states that menthol cigarettes have an adverse impact on public health.Such actions have been a curse for a number of firms in the multi-billion tobacco industry such as Altria, Philip Morris (PM  -  Free Report), British American Tobacco (BTI  -  Free Report) and Vector Group (VGR  -  Free Report). The aforementioned moves along with rising health consciousness among consumers have resulted in lower cigarette consumption globally. Notably, shares of the company have lost 4.3% in the past six months, faring somewhat better than the industry’s decline of 7.8%. (Looking for the Best Stocks for 2018? Be among the first to see our Top Ten Stocks for 2018 portfolio here.)Can Smokeless Unit Offer Respite in 2018?FDA’s strict regulations have compelled Altria to resort to smokeless tobacco products to remain afloat in the industry. Smokeless tobacco products are considered less harmful than traditional cigarettes. Owing to greater acceptability for such products, Altria has introduced several reduced risk tobacco products. Its flagship MarkTen and Green Smoke e-vapor products have been performing well in this category. Incidentally, MarkTen is now a leading e-vapor brand in the United States, with a retail market share of approximately 13.5% in mainstream retail channels, as highlighted in the company’s third-quarter 2017 results.Encouragingly, during the second and third quarters, revenues (net of excise taxes) from the Smokeless tobacco category advanced 8.6% and 4.5%, respectively. Also, total smokeless products retail share grew 1.1 percentage points to 53.8% during the third quarter.Further, Altria’s marketing and technology sharing agreement with Philip Morris, which is currently under the FDA’s review, can prove to be beneficial for both companies for tapping greater opportunities in the e-cigarette realm. Upon FDA clearance, Altria will gain exclusive rights to distribute two of Philip Morris’ heated tobacco products or iQOS in the United States. We note that iQOS products have been a great hit in foreign markets, especially in Japan. This underscores the potential held by reduced risk products, which is expected to improve Altria’s market share going ahead.Wrapping UpWhile it’s not quite apparent how Altria’s cigarette line up will perform post the new marketing and nicotine regulations, the company’s advancements in the reduced risks products category appears quite noteworthy. However, it remains to be seen if the strength in the smokeless category can help this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to make a comeback in 2018.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes """"All In"""" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

1635,PM,"Philip Morris International Inc’s (PM  -  Free Report) performance has been eclipsed by stringent regulations surrounding the tobacco industry. As governments across the globe strive to improve consumer health by restricting tobacco consumption, companies have been witnessing declines in cigarette sales volumes. These factors have been hurting the performance of Philip Morris’ cigarette category, which weighed on investors’ sentiment.Evidently, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock has lost 10% in the past six months compared with the industry’s decline of 8.3%.What’s Hurting the Cigarette Category?Thanks to anti-tobacco initiatives by the government and growing consumer awareness regarding tobacco consumption, Philip Morris has been witnessing declining cigarette shipment volumes. During third-quarter 2017, Philip Morris’s net revenues were hurt by a 3.6% decline in combustible products. Total shipment volumes in this category also declined 4.1%. As a result, total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume fell 0.5% during the period. Notably, this marked Philip Morris’ third consecutive quarter of top- and bottom-line miss.Let’s now take a deeper look into some of the restrictions that have been hurting the company’s combustible category’s performance.Restrictions in DetailThe adverse impacts of tobacco consumption have led the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to issue several restrictions surrounding the manufacturing, marketing and distribution of tobacco products. The FDA has made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets to dissuade customers from smoking.  In July 2017, the FDA directed tobacco makers to lower nicotine levels in cigarettes to make it less addictive. Also, the European Union and the FDA have proposed a ban on menthol in accordance with the Tobacco Control Act which essentially states that menthol cigarettes have an adverse impact on public health.To further worsen matters, the court recently issued an order which guides cigarette companies to put up self-critical advertisements circulated through television, newspapers, social media and store displays. Through such corrective ads, tobacco companies will be forced to acknowledge the perils of smoking and also admit to the fact that cigarettes are addictive. Further, the court has directed Altria Group (MO  -  Free Report) and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. to bear the expenses of the campaign. Apart from Philip Morris, tobacco industry headwinds have also posed challenges for other major players such as British American Tobacco (BTI  -  Free Report) and Vector Group (VGR  -  Free Report).Moving back to Philip Morris, the company has been striving hard to adapt with the industry condition by venturing into the reduced risk tobacco industry. However, such initiatives are yet to revive the company’s overall performance. This was reconfirmed by management’s dismal outlook. Incidentally, the industry-wide challenges compelled management to lower 2017 earnings view during third-quarter earnings release. Earnings are now expected in the range of $4.75-$4.80, lower than the previous range of $4.78 to $4.93.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

1636,PM,"Altria Group Inc’s (MO  -  Free Report) shares have lost 11.5% in the past six months, faring slightly better than the industry’s decline of 12.5%. Persistent weakness in the smokeable segment has been denting investors’ optimism on the stock.Altria, which has a solid hold in the tobacco industry, has been undertaking initiatives to expand smokeless products segment that has been gaining traction of late.Lets delve into these factors and see if such efforts can provide some respite to the leading tobacco player.Struggling Smokeable Unit In the preceding four quarters, shipment volumes in the smokeable segment have declined 6.1%, 2.7%, 2.6% and 4.7%, respectively. While cigar volumes increased steadily, persistent decline in cigarette volumes have been dragging the smokeable category’s performance. As a result, cigarette retail market share of Altria has been falling. Anti-smoking campaigns and government regulations have played a fundamental role in dissuading consumers from tobacco consumption. This is a major headwind for the industry. Such efforts have created mass awareness regarding adverse impacts of tobacco consumption on health. Per the recent court orders, companies will be forced to acknowledge the perils of smoking through corrective advertisements circulated via television channels, newspapers, websites, store displays and cigarette packs. The move was imposed by federal authorities considering that companies have not been informing consumers about the addictive nature of smoking.Further, government authorities have been undertaking measures to counter cigarette consumption. In July 2017, the FDA directed companies to lower nicotine in cigarettes to non-addictive or minimally-addictive levels. Additionally, cigarette consumption rates have declined globally due to precautionary labels and higher tax rates. Apart from denting Altria’s performance, such actions have affected the business of several other tobacco industry majors such as Vector Group (VGR  -  Free Report), British American Tobacco (BTI  -  Free Report) and Philip Morris (PM  -  Free Report).Can Smokeless Products Offer Respite? While cigarette consumption continues to be a concern for the industry, consumers have depicted rising preference for e-cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products, courtesy of less health risks.Altria has been promptly responding to the changing market scenario and offers several reduced-risk tobacco products. Its flagship brands — MarkTen and Green Smoke e-vapor — have been performing strongly in this category. Notably, MarkTen is currently a leading e-vapor brand in the United States and reported a market share of approximately 13.5% in mainstream retail channels during third-quarter 2017. In the said quarter, revenues from the Smokeless tobacco category improved 4.5% to $515 million.Additionally, Altria is likely to benefit from marketing and technology sharing agreement with Philip Morris, which is currently under FDA’s review. We hope that such efforts will help this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to stay afloat amid tough industry conditions. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

1637,PM,"Philip Morris International Inc (PM  -  Free Report) has been struggling with lower cigarette volumes, due to reduced consumption rates.  To worsen matters, the court recently issued an order which guides cigarette companies to endorse anti-smoking campaigns. Nevertheless, Philip Morris has been diverting its attention toward Reduced Risk Products (RRPs) to stay afloat in the tobacco industry.Thanks to the challenges stemming from lower cigarette volumes, Philip Morris’ top- and bottom-lines missed the Zacks Consensus Estimates in the third quarter of 2017. Notably, this marked the company’s third consecutive period of earnings and sales miss.Consequently, the company’s shares have dipped approximately 8% since it posted third-quarter results on Oct 19. Philip Morris’s shares have lost 9.8% in the past three months compared with the industry’s decline of 0.6%. Let’s delve into the factors which have been impacting Philip Morris’s performance lately and the efforts undertaken to uplift the company’s performance.Anti-Smoking Advertisements Reduce Smoking RatesDespite a formidable decline in cigarette consumption in the past decade, smoking is still considered as one of the leading causes of death in the United States. Further, federal authorities claim that tobacco companies have not informed consumers about the dangers and addictive nature associated with smoking. As per the new court order, companies will be forced to acknowledge the perils of smoking through corrective advertisements circulated through television channels, newspapers, websites, store displays and cigarette packs. Further, the court directed Altria Group (MO  -  Free Report) and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. to bear the expenses of the campaign.Stringent regulations imposed by government authorities surrounding tobacco consumption have always posed challenges for major players such as British American Tobacco (BTI  -  Free Report), Altria and Vector Group (VGR  -  Free Report). Cigarette consumption rates have declined globally due to precautionary labels and higher tax rates. The recent order to roll out anti-smoking advertisements is a major step to restrict tobacco consumption. This is expected to lower revenue prospects for almost all the companies operating in the industry.Industry Hurdles Hurt Q3 Results & View: Estimates DeclineDuring third-quarter 2017, Philip Morris’s net revenues were hurt by a 3.6% decline in combustible products. Total shipment volumes in this category also declined 4.1%. The downside stemmed from lower volumes in the EU, EEMA regions and in Latin America & Canada. As a result, total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume declined by 0.5% in the quarter.Management lowered earnings guidance for 2017, due to the headwinds surrounding the industry. Earnings are now expected in the range of $4.75-$4.80, lower than the previous range of $4.78 to $4.93. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 revised two cents downward in the past 30 days to $4.75.  Reduced Risk Products Expected to Uplift Performance  Nonetheless, Philip Morris’s RRPs performance has been impressive lately. Consumers have been showing increased preference for such products, which have a lower negative impact on health. During the third quarter, the company generated revenues of $947 million from RRPs, significantly higher than $212 million reported in the prior-year quarter. This has driven the company’s overall top-line results. Additionally, heated tobacco unit shipment volume of 9.7 billion units, reflected a radical improvement from 2.1 billion units recorded in third-quarter 2016.Considering such upsides associated with RRPs, Philip Morris has been making aggressive investments to expand heated tobacco units or IQOS devices along with e-vapor products. Additionally, the marketing and technology sharing agreement between Philip Morris and Altria Group, which is currently under FDA’s review, is expected to boost the companies’ business in the forthcoming periods.Philip Morris has been striving to adapt with the changing industry conditions to meet consumer needs as evident from the smokeless cigarette category’s performance. We hope that such efforts will help this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to stay afloat amid tough industry conditions.

1638,PM,"After missing earnings estimates five straight times, Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report) delivered a beat in first-quarter 2017. Moreover, top and bottom lines grew year over year and management also raised its bottom-line view for 2018, courtesy of the tax reforms. However, these factors were not enough to placate investors, who were let down by the fifth consecutive sales miss and drop in constant currency (cc) earnings. This could be largely accountable to soft volumes.Evidently, shares of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company are down about 5% in the pre-market trading session. In fact, Philip Morris’ shares have gone down 6.2% in the past six months, wider than the industry’s decline of 4.8%. This can primarily be attributable to the company’s dismal past record.  Coming back to the earnings announcement, management stated that from Jan 1, 2018, it started operating through the following six reporting segments: the European Union Region (EU); the Eastern Europe Region (EE); the Middle East & Africa Region (ME&A); the South & Southeast Asia Region (S&SA); the East Asia & Australia Region (EA&A); and the Latin America & Canada Region (LA&C). Notably, the ME&A region also include PMI Duty Free.Quarter in DetailAdjusted earnings of $1.00 per share rose 2% year over year and itcame ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 88 cents. Excluding the positive impact from currency fluctuations, the bottom line dipped 1% from 98 cents reported in the year-ago period.Net revenues were $6,896 million, which increased 13.7% (up 8.3% on a constant currency basis) in the quarter. However, net revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7,024 million. Favorable pricing of combustible products and greater volumes of heated tobacco units and IQOS devices drove currency-neutral revenues.During the quarter, revenues from combustible products inched up 2.5% (down 2.5% in cc) to $5,769 million. Revenues from Reduced Risk Products (RRPs) doubled (also on a cc basis) to $1,127 million, largely driven by increased sales of IQOS devices.Total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume fell2.3% to 173.8 billion units, owing to declines across most regions other than S&SA and EA&A. While cigarette shipment volume declined 5.3% to 164.3 billion units in the quarter, heated tobacco unit shipment volume of 9.6 billion units, increased 5.1 billion units year over year.Adjusted operating income inched higher by 0.4% year over year to $2,426 million, while it slipped 2.7% (on a cc basis)due to adverse volume/mix (especially in GCC) and escalated marketing, research and administration expenses. These hurdles couldn’t be fully compensated by favorable pricing. Adjusted operating margin (on a cc basis) fell 4.0 points to 35.8%.Also, during the quarter, Phillip Morris announced a quarterly dividend of $1.07.Region-Wise PerformanceNet revenues in EU climbed 0.2% (on a cc basis) to $1,988 million, courtesy of favorable pricing, somewhat offset by adverse volume/mix. Total shipment volume fell 5% to 40,599 million units.In EE, net revenues jumped 4.3% to $567 million, stemming from the same factors that drove EU revenues. Total shipment volumes tumbled 8.3% to 22,603 million units.Net revenues slipped 1.5% to $961 million in ME&A region as adverse volume/mix more than offset gains from pricing. Total shipment volumes dropped 6.5% to 29,957 million units.Moving to S&SA, a 5.6% rise in revenues to $1,081 millionwas witnessed, which was backed by improved pricing, though it was also somewhat countered by unfavorable volume/mix. Shipment volumes grew 6.1% to 40,218 million units.EA&A saw its revenues surge 27.5% to $1,591 million, owing to solid pricing. Total shipment volumes climbed 0.2% to 21,433 million units.Finally, revenues at LA&C advanced 17% to $708 million, on the back of favorable pricing. However, total shipment volumes were down 1.4% at 19,036 million units.GuidanceManagement remains confident about delivering solid results in 2018, alongside remaining committed toward making shareholder-friendly moves. The company remains encouraged about strength of its IQOS devices and favorable pricing of combustible products. While soft volumes in GCC, difficult pricing in Russia and sluggish sales in Japan pose hurdles, the company remains well placed to double its worldwide in-market heated tobacco unit sales from 2017.That said, management projects revenues in 2018 to grow about 8% (on a cc basis). Also, it expects the recent tax reforms to boost bottom-line growth. Incidentally, management now expects effective tax rate for 2018 to be roughly 26%, down from 28% projected in February.Consequently, earnings are envisioned in the range of $5.25-$5.40, in comparison to $5.20-$5.35 forecasted earlier. The updated guidance reflects year-over-year growth of 35-39%, up from 34-38% expected earlier. Excluding a favorable currency impact, the company anticipates adjusted earnings growth of nearly 8-11%, better than the previous forecast of 7-10%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 is currently pegged at $5.28.Additionally, management expects capital expenditures of roughly $1.7 billion in 2018, while operating cash flow is envisioned to be more than $9 billion.Looking for Consumer Staple Stocks?

1639,PM,"Thursday, April 19, 2018Considering how many game-changing headlines we’ve seen so far in 2018 — from inflation/interest rate fears to geopolitical hornets nests to Washington DC soap operas — this has been a welcome week for the stock markets. Just think if we’d have had some seasonably appropriate weather — we’d be on Cloud 9 right now! And this relative calm in a sea of turbulence continues ahead of the opening bell this morning, with Initial Jobless Claims and new Q1 earnings results hitting the tape.Initial Jobless Claims remained steady at 232K last week, 1000 claims fewer than the previous week and remaining solidly within the long-term range of 225K-250K which is illustrative of a very strong (and continually tightening) labor market. Aside from dips below even these very robust figures a month or so ago, and spikes into higher jobless claims territory for a short time following last summer’s massive hurricanes, we have enjoyed an historically strong and steady U.S. employment situation for several years now. Continuing claims reached 1.863 million in the week, another very healthy sign.Q1 earnings results continue strong and steady, as well. While we’re not seeing any of the biggest companies on Wall Street reporting today, such as the FANG stocks (most of which start next week; Netflix posted positive surprises Monday), we do have a number of companies that have registered new figures, and almost all better than expected:Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated W.W. Grainger (GWW  -  Free Report) posted a heft earnings beat, reporting $4.18 per share vs. $3.41 expected. Revenues also surpassed expectations, $2.77 billion vs. $2.71 billion in the Zacks consensus. The company also raised sales guidance for full-year 2018 from 3-7% previously to 5-8% today, to $14.30-15.30 per share. Shares, as a result, are trading up 7% in today’s pre-market. For more on GWW’s earnings, click here.Two Wall Street banks have also brought forth Q1 results: BB&T (BBT  -  Free Report) and Bank of New York-Mellon (BK  -  Free Report). Both Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)-rated firms beat on both top and bottom lines, with BK posting the wider positive margins: $1.10 per share on $4.18 billion, ahead of the 97 cents and $4.05 billion anticipated, up 33% and 9% year over year, respectively. BBT beat by 5 cents on the bottom line to 97 cents per share on revenues that eked out expectations of $2.83 billion.For more on BBT’s earnings, click here.For more on BK’s earnings, click here.Among still others, tobacco major Philip Morris (PM  -  Free Report) topped earnings estimates by posting an even $1.00 per share in the quarter, above the 88 cents expected and representing growth of 2% year over year. Yet revenues of $6,896 million fell beneath the Zacks consensus of $7,024 million, although year over year was still up 13.7%. Guidance is for full-year growth of 8-11%, higher than previously expected. For more on PM’s earnings, click here.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

1640,PM,"Altria Group, Inc. (MO  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, before the opening bell. While Altria’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last quarter, it has a mixed record of earnings surprises over the trailing four quarters.We expect the company to gain from sturdy advancements in the smokeless products category, which will be reflected in the upcoming quarterly results. However, softness in its smokable unit has long been a challenge to the company’s top line. That said, let’s see how things are shaping up for this tobacco giant, prior to the quarterly release.Smokeless SegmentSmokeless products, also popularly known as reduced risk tobacco products (RRPs), are rapidly gaining traction, considering their less detrimental impacts on health. Altria has been promptly responding to this trend and offers several RRPs which helped it maintain market share. The company’s flagship MarkTen and Green Smoke e-vapor products are some of the products performing strongly in the smokeless category. In fact, MarkTen is now a leading e-vapor brand in the United States. Also, Altria’s marketing and technology agreement with Philip Morris (PM  -  Free Report) to market MarkTen e-cigarettes internationally and the distribution of heated tobacco products in the United States is expected to boost businesses of the companies.Buoyed by efforts to strengthen RRPs, revenues (net of excise taxes) from the Smokeless product category advanced 11.1% to $542 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Given Altria’s impressive strides in this regard, we expect such trends to continue. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect net revenues (net of excise taxes) of approximately $471 million from this unit during the first quarter, indicating an improvement of 8% from the year-ago quarter’s figure.Pricing Also a Growth DriverAltria’s strong pricing has helped it stay afloat in the industry amid declining cigarette volumes. Though higher pricing might lead to possible decline in cigarette consumption, it is seen that smokers tend to absorb price increases owing to the addictive quality of cigarettes. In fourth-quarter 2017, higher pricing led to a rise in adjusted operating company’s income (OCI) and margins in its segments. The company continues to expect pricing as a key growth driver in the near term.Industry Headwinds Mar Cigarette VolumesAlthough Altria has been strongly progressing with its smokeless products, things look gloomy when it comes to the company’s cigarettes category and smokeable products as a whole. Well, unfortunately, persistent decline in cigarette volumes has been a hindrance for Altria’s smokeable segment for a while. This in turn, can be attributed to regulatory hurdles in the form of limitations on marketing, anti-smoking campaigns and higher excise duties. Apart from this, rising health consciousness among consumers has lowered cigarette consumption globally. Together, these factors have been weighing on cigarette sales volumes. As a result, shipment volumes in the smokeable segment declined 2.6%, 2.7%, 6.1% and 8.7% respectively in the preceding four quarters. In fact, during fourth-quarter 2017, total cigarette retail share declined to 50.3%, representing a 0.8 percentage point slip. This was largely due to a 0.7 share point drop in Marlboro’s retail share, which stemmed from intense competition and increase in cigarette excise tax in California. On account of such headwinds, the consensus estimate for smokeable segment revenues is currently pegged at $5,349 million for the first quarter — reflecting a drop of nearly 2% from reported smokeable revenues in the year-ago period.Apart from Altria, declining cigarette sales volumes have been hurting other tobacco players like Philip Morris, British American Tobacco (BTI  -  Free Report) and Vector Group (VGR  -  Free Report). Nevertheless, we believe that favorable pricing and rising demand for smokeless products will help Altria overcome the aforementioned hurdles. Additionally, the company’s consistent focus on making investments in core growth areas, improving retail fixtures and making enhancements to brands like Marlboro will lift its market share and aid the firm to maintain its leading position in the tobacco space.All, said lets now take a look at the picture unveiled by the consensus marks for earnings and sales as well as the Zacks Model for the upcoming quarterly announcement. Altria Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Altria Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Altria Group, Inc. Quote Estimates Bode wellThe current Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the first quarter of 2018 is pegged at 93 cents, which represents a 27.3% growth from the year-ago quarter. This estimate has declined by a cent over the last 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $4,619 million for the impeding quarter, reflecting a rise of almost 0.7% from the year-ago quarter.Zacks ModelOur proven model does not conclusively show that Altria will beat earnings estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

1641,PM,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Philip Morris International Inc (PM  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 5.1% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Philip Morris Misses Q3 Earnings & Sales, Lowers ViewAfter reporting weaker-than-expected results in the first half of 2017, Philip Morris continued with its dismal performance in the third quarter. Both earnings and revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in third-quarter 2017 results. Moreover, the company also lowered its earnings guidance for 2017.Quarter in DetailAdjusted earnings of $1.27 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.39. While the company benefited from strong pricing and growth in Reduced Risk Products, lower cigarette volumes hurt its performance. Nevertheless, adjusted earnings in the reported quarter inched up 1.6% from the year-ago period.Net revenue, excluding excise taxes, was $7,473 million, which increased 7% (up 9% excluding unfavorable currency of $136 million) in the third quarter. Favorable pricing and volume/mix in the quarter drove revenues. While, revenue increased across Asia, Latin America & Canada and the European Union (EU), the same had declined in Eastern Europe, the Middle East & Africa (EEMA).During the quarter, revenues from combustible products declined 3.6% (down 4.6% excluding negative currency) to $6.5 billion. On the contrary, Reduced Risk Products (RRPs) reported a whopping increase from last-year quarter, stemming from the shift of customer preference away from tobacco products. The company generated revenues of $947 million from RRPs, significantly higher than $212 million reported last year.However, net revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7,616 million.Total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume fell 0.5% to 208.2 billion units. The figures were unfavorable in the EU, EEMA region and in Latin America & Canada mainly owing to low cigarette shipment volumes. These were offset by increased volumes in Asia, as well as higher heated tobacco unit shipment volume across all regions. While cigarette shipment volume declined 4.1% in the quarter, heated tobacco unit shipment volume of 9.7 billion units, increased significantly from 2.1 billion units recorded in third-quarter 2016.Adjusted operating companies income was up 2.2% year over year to $3.1 billion due to favorable pricing and growth witnessed in Asia. Excluding currency impact of $140 million, adjusted operating income increased 6.8%. However adjusted operating margin was down 190 basis points to 42%.Segment DetailsEuropean Union: Net revenue in the European Union region increased 0.2% year over year to $2.2 billion.

Adjusted operating companies income margin, excluding favorable currency, decreased by 2.8 points to 48.1%.Eastern Europe, the Middle East & Africa (EEMA): Net revenue in EEMA region decreased 7.9% year over year to $1.8 billion. Excluding the impact of currency, net revenue declined 2.4%, principally driven by unfavorable volume/mix which reflects lower markets and market share in Russia and Saudi Arabia. These were partially offset by favorable pricing variance.Adjusted operating companies income, excluding unfavorable currency, decreased 11.7%. Adjusted operating companies income margin, excluding unfavorable currency, decreased by 4.8 points to 44.9%.                                                  Asia: The company recorded net revenue growth of 27.8% to $2.7 billion in Asia. Excluding currency impact, revenue was up 31% from the prior-year quarter, owing higher shipment volumes and increased revenues from RRP’s, despite a decline in cigarette revenues.Adjusted operating companies income, excluding unfavorable currency, increased 47.2%.Latin America and Canada: In Latin America and Canada, revenues increased 6.5% (up 8.5% excluding currency) to $756 million, primarily driven by growth in cigarette and RRP’s revenues, despite decline in shipment volumes.Adjusted operating companies income, excluding unfavorable currency, increased 21.4%.Financial UpdateDuring the quarter, Philip Morris increased the regular quarterly dividend by approximately 2.9% to reach an annualized rate of $4.28 per share.GuidancePhilip Morris lowered its earnings guidance for 2017 and now expects the same in range of $4.75 to $4.80, lower than the previous range of $4.78 to $4.93.

1642,PM,"Altria Group, Inc (MO  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26. The company’s results for the quarter are expected to gain from increased volumes in the smokeless or low-risk tobacco products category. However, challenges in the smokeable category remain concerns.Revenues to Gain From Smokeless Category GrowthThe smokeless category has long been favoring Altria’s overall performance, enabling it to respond to consumer shift towards low-risk, smokeless tobacco products. Altria commands a number of strong brands in this category such as MarkTen e-cigarette and Copenhagen amongst others.Owing to such trends, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for smokeless products net revenue is currently pegged at $562 million, which marks 6.4% increase from the prior-year quarter’s figure. Also, the consensus estimate in shipment volumes for the smokeless category is expected to grow 0.03% in the third quarter. We note that the Smokeless category’s shipment volumes increased 5.6% in the prior-year quarter, and increased 1.4% during second-quarter 2017.Underlying Weakness in the Smokeable Category Rising health consciousness and stringent government regulations surrounding the marketing and pricing of cigarette have been denting the businesses of major tobacco companies such as Phillip Morris International Inc (PM  -  Free Report), British American Tobacco plc (BTI  -  Free Report) and Vector Group Ltd (VGR  -  Free Report).  Moreover, the recent FDA regulation regarding lowering Nicotine content in cigarettes to non-addictive or minimally addictive levels has further declined traditional cigarettes sales.These headwinds are expected to impact Altria’s total shipment volumes in the smokeable segment during the third quarter. Analysts polled by Zacks expect volumes for this segment to decline approximately 0.05%. We note that shipment volumes in the smokeable category decreased 0.9% in the prior-year quarter, while it slipped 2.7% during second-quarter 2017. Declining demand and volume for tobacco products have also been pulling down Altria’s shares. Consequently, the company’s shares have lost 11.4% over the past six months, while the industry declined 7.5%.Nevertheless, the smokeable category is expected to benefit from the rising price trend that has been aiding Altria to keep the cigarette category afloat. We expect this to provide some cushion from the negative impacts of volume declines. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for smokeable products net revenue is currently pegged at $6,067 million, which represents a 1.3% dip from the prior-year reported figure..Nonetheless, benefits from the smokeless category should help boost Altria’s total revenues for the quarter. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues to be roughly 5.2 billion, which falls almost in line with the year-ago period figure. .Earnings ExpectationsAltria’s performance reveals that it has missed bottom-line estimates in the past two quarters. Nevertheless, earnings have been growing year over year for quite some time. Also, earnings for the third quarter are expected to gain from higher smokeless products volumes and revenues as well as strong pricing. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is currently pegged at 87 cents, depicting year-on-year growth of over 6%.Altria Group Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Altria Group Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Altria Group QuoteWhat Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Altria is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

Excluding excise taxes, it registered a 7% increase in quarterly revenues, as it increased to $7.473 billion in the third quarter of 2017 compared with $6.982 billion a year earlier.It failed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both earnings and sales in the third quarter of 2017.

Moreover, the company’s third quarter revenues of $7.473 billion fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.616 billion.

The decline was due to a sharp fall in shipment volume of cigarettes, which declined 4.1% to 198.465 billion compared with 207.051 billion units in the third quarter 2016. However, some respite came in the form of an increase in shipment volume in heated tobacco units, which increased to 9.725 billion units compared with 2.089 billion units in the prior-year quarter.OutlookPhilip Morris expects its full-year 2017 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.75-$4.80 compared with its July forecast of $4.78-$4.93.

1646,PM,"Philip Morris International (PM  -  Free Report) shares are in free-fall this morning after announcing Q1 earnings that were actually slightly higher than analyst estimates.  Revenues were lower than expected however, and the future of the industry looks grim. The stock is currently trading down over 17% on the day at $84.49 after closing yesterday at $101.20.The international producer of Marlboro cigarettes and other tobacco-based products - which was spun-off from U.S. producer Altria almost exactly ten years ago - reported earnings of $1.00/share in Q1 versus a Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.88.  Revenues came in lower than estimates with the company posting $6.89B in sales, while analysts were expecting $7.02B.  Most of the increase in earnings was due to currency fluctuations and favorable tax rates rather than improved operations.  Sales in regions Eastern-Europe, Africa and the Middle East, East-Asia and Australia, and Latin America and Canada all saw a decrease in sales by unit volume.  Only Southeast Asia saw mild sales growth.Guidance for 2018 remained basically the same, though the range was adjusted slightly from $5.25 - $5.35/share to $5.25 - $5.40/share.Industry-wide carnageOther industry players are falling today as well on the news as investors ruminate on an uncertain future for tobacco. U.S. Marlboro producer Altria (MO  -  Free Report) is down over 7% and British American Tobacco (BTI  -  Free Report) – owner of R.J Reynolds – is down almost 6%.Philip Morris has missed the Zacks Composite Earnings estimate in each of the last 4 quarters due to regulation, increased taxation and an overall decline in demand for tobacco products.The 2008 spinoff of Philip Morris from Altria was intended to take advantage of international demand for tobacco products outside the purview of onerous U.S. regulation and it worked…for a while.  Now however, facing the same pressures worldwide as they once did in the U.S., Philip Morris is scrambling to replace traditional cigarette sales with alternative tobacco products.“Reduced Risk”, Really?In the face of declining market, tobacco companies have embraced “Reduced Risk Products” (RRPs) to attract customers.  They are betting on heated tobacco products like vaporizers and smokeless tobacco as less-unhealthy choices for those who choose to continue to use tobacco.Unfortunately for Philip Morris, sales of its iQOS vaporizer device were disappointing in Asia (the device’s primary market), as were sales of the “Heatstick” cartridges used in the iQOS.Heated tobacco devices were seen as a potential savior for Phllip Morris and the industry as a whole, but demand seems to have leveled of globally faster than expected.Investing in an industry whose potential savior is a group of products that still have the word “risk” in their name seems potentially unwise.Income PlayThe real “savior” of Phllip Morris and the whole industry – at least from investors’ point of view - has been a healthy dividend.  Philip Morris and Altria both pay a dividend of just over 4% and British American pays 3.7%.With interest rates on the rise, however, dividend paying stocks look relatively less attractive, and with the future of tobacco so significantly uncertain, the ability of these companies to continue paying juicy dividends long-term is in doubt.Philip Morris does have over $8B on the balance sheet, so the dividend looks safe for the time being.With so many true growth stocks available to investors in truly innovative industries that are making our daily existence better, it’s difficult to justify investing in a dying sector like tobacco.

1647,PM,"SUPERVALU INC. (SVU  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Apr 24, before the market opens. This grocery dealer delivered bottom-line surprises in three of the trailing four quarters. While the company has been struggling with its retail business, its performance in the wholesale arena is laudable. Considering these, let’s delve into how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement.Wholesale Business Looks SturdySUPERVALU’s wholesale business has been an aspect of joy for the company for a while. The company derives a major portion of its revenues from this segment. Notably, sales from this segment grew 52% year over year to $2,888 million in third-quarter fiscal 2018, representing roughly 73% of the company’s total revenues. Further, the company has been undertaking endeavors to fortify foothold in the wholesale arena, primarily through acquisitions. In this regard, the company concluded the buyout of Associated Grocers of Florida in the beginning of the fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, while it bought Unified Grocers in June 2017. Notably, Unified Grocers contributed sales worth about $860 million to SUPERVALU’s Wholesale business during the third quarter. The company is on track to generate targeted synergies from this buyout.Apart from this, the company has supply agreements with retailers like America’s Food Basket, which is expected to fuel sales in the segment. Also, management is committed toward enhancing operating efficiency, reducing costs as well as optimizing distribution channels, information technology and logistics to support the growth of the wholesale business. SUPERVALU INC. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  SUPERVALU INC. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | SUPERVALU INC. Quote Adapting to Consumer PreferencesSUPERVALU’s efforts to augment business operations incorporates focusing on prospective business areas stemming from evolving consumer trends. Notably, the company has been evaluating prospects in the organic foods arena, given their rising popularity amid consumers’ increasing health consciousness. The company has partnered with its wholesale merchants to explore opportunities in this category.Apart from this, SUPERVALU also strives toward improving its omni-channel capabilities to adapt consumers preference for digital transactions. In this respect, the company is on track with upgrading its website and mobile applications. Additionally, the company agreed on a multiyear contract with Instacart to provide integrated store coupons and loyalty rewards at its e-commerce sites.Retail Business Continues to AilSUPERVALU’s retail stores have been bearing the brunt of brick-and-mortar sale disruption, which is accountable to consumers’ ever-growing enthusiasm for online transactions. Due to such headwinds, SUPERVALU has been resorting to store closures. Consequently, the company’s identical store sales in the retail segment have declined over the past 11 quarters. During fiscal 2016, the company sold nearly 1,350 Save-A-Lot stores.In recent developments, the company announced plans to sell 21 of its Farm Fresh Food & Pharmacy stores. In this regard, the company has entered into definite agreements with companies like Harris Teeter, Food Lion and the Mid-Atlantic Division of Kroger. SUPERVALU is expected to undertake more Farm Fresh store closures in the near future, which is likely to drag the retail segment’s performance. Thanks to such concerns, the stock has tumbled 42.7% over the past year, while the industry declined 14.9%.  Considering the fact that the retail segment has been falling in shambles, the company’s move to strengthen its wholesale business seems quite rational and is expected to uplift its performance in the forthcoming periods. In fact, if rumors are to be believed, SUPERVALU is exploring possible options to divest its business. However, management has not issued any official statement on this matter.All said, let’s now take a look at the picture unveiled by the consensus marks for earnings and sales as well as the Zacks Model for the upcoming quarterly announcement.  Estimates for the QuarterThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter and 2018 has been stable in the last 30 days and is currently pegged at 77 cents and $2.43, respectively. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3,984 million for the impending quarter, while revenues of $15.6 billion are forecasted for fiscal 2018.A Look at the Zacks ModelOur proven model does not show that SUPERVALU is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Although SUPERVALU’s Zacks Rank #1 increases the predictive power of ESP, its Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes us less confident about an earnings surprise.Stocks Poised to Beat EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Philip Morris (PM  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.87% and a Zacks Rank of 3.

1648,PM,"Kimberly-Clark Corporation (KMB  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 23. This consumer goods company has reported an average earnings surprise of nearly 2% over the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are placed ahead of the upcoming results. Kimberly-Clark Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Kimberly-Clark Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Kimberly-Clark Corporation Quote FORCE & Global Restructuring Plans to Drive Bottom LineKimberly-Clark is likely to continue gaining from its ongoing Focus on Reducing Costs Everywhere (FORCE) program, while it should also receive some benefits from its recently unveiled 2018 Global Restructuring plan. Notably, the latter marks the company’s biggest restructuring in a long time now. This plan is likely to enhance the company’s underlying profitability, help it compete better and provide greater flexibility to undertake growth-oriented investments. Delving deeper, we note that the program is expected to simplify Kimberly-Clark’s overhead organization and manufacturing supply chain structures. Well, the program will benefit all segments of the company as well as all the major geographical region.Markedly, management expects cost savings of $50-$70 million from this program in 2018, which also bodes well for the quarter under review. Moving to the FORCE Program, Kimberly-Clark has long been gaining from this cost-cutting plan. In fact, the FORCE program has generated higher cost savings each year with record savings of $450 million in 2017, following $435 million in 2016 and lesser each year prior to that. The company anticipates cost savings of $400 million in 2018. On a combined basis, Kimberly-Clark expects cost savings of more than $2 billion from the FORCE program and 2018 Global Restructuring Program (discussed below), over the next four years.These dedicated efforts are likely to help Kimberly-Clark offset hurdles related to input cost inflation. Incidentally, Kimberly-Clark has been witnessing rising input costs of late. Increased input costs on account of greater costs of pulp and other raw materials caused adjusted operating profit to fall 2.7% to $836 million in the fourth quarter.  Further, in 2018, management expects input cost inflation of about $300-$400 million, primarily in international markets. However, the robust aforementioned strategies should help the company combat these hurdles and fuel bottom-line growth.Earnings Expectations in NumbersIn fact, FORCE program was a driver for the company in the fourth quarter as well, wherein both top and bottom lines improved year over year and the latter also exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second consecutive quarter. The year-over-year growth in earnings was driven by cost savings from FORCE program as well as reduced effective tax rate stemming from the latest tax reforms and associated activities. Also, management expects the tax reforms to favorably impact its bottom line and cash flows, which again remains a driver for Kimberly Clark in the quarter to be reported. Well, the current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at $1.70, which shows an increase of nearly 9% from $1.57 recorded in the year-ago period. The estimate has remained unchanged in the past 30 days.Will Sales Grow Amid North American Challenges?Moving to top line, the year-over-year growth in the last reported quarter was aided by greater Personal Product and K-C Professional (KCP) sales. However, on a region-wise basis, softness in North American consumer products and higher competitive activity have been major concerns for quite some time. Evidently, net sales in North America declined year over year across most segments, owing to lower selling prices. This in turn stemmed from intense promotional activities undertaken amid the mounting competition. Also, organic sales at consumer products decreased 3% in North America. In fact, the company’s overall organic sales also dipped 1%, due to lower net selling prices across most categories.Nonetheless, management stated that it remains committed toward making further brand investments and implementing strategic growth initiatives. For the quarter under review, the consensus marks for Personal Product and KCP sales are pegged at $2,304 million and $795 million, in comparison with $2,250 million and $768 million, respectively. Also, analysts polled by Zacks expects Consumer Tissue sales to grow 2.35 to $1,488 million. Finally, the consensus estimate for Kimberly-Clark’s total revenues stands at $4,595 million, marking a 2.5% rise from the year-ago reported figure.What the Zacks Model UnveilsHowever, our proven model doesn’t show that Kimberly-Clark is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter. For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).

1649,PM,"Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 19, before the opening bell. The company’s earnings have lagged estimates in each of the past four quarters, with an average miss of 6.1%. Lately, Philip Morris has been treading on shaky grounds, thanks to the jolts from receding cigarette consumption stemming from strict government regulations and rising consumer awareness regarding the harmful impacts of tobacco. However, the company has been combating such challenges with strength in Reduced Risk Products (RRPs). That said, let’s see what this earnings season has in store for this tobacco giant.Cigarette Segment to Stay a WorryGovernment authorities have been brandishing the whip on tobacco players as smoking has become one of the primary causes of heart diseases and cancer. Apart from seeking authorization for any new tobacco product, the FDA has made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets. Additionally, these companies have been directed to put self-critical advertisements on television and newspapers, particularly emphasizing on the addictive nature of cigarettes. To add to the woes, the FDA is bent on drastically reducing nicotine in cigarettes to minimally addictive levels. The initiative was proposed in 2017 but was delayed due to ongoing research. If enacted, low nicotine levels will prove to be disastrous for cigarette manufacturing companies. Moreover, increasing regulatory moves have raised awareness amongst consumers regarding the detrimental effects of tobacco consumption, motivating them to quit smoking.The impacts of such initiatives are clearly visible on Philip Morris’s receding cigarette shipment volumes. Shipment volume in this category declined 2.1%, 4,1%, 7.5% and 11.5% during the fourth, third, second and the first quarters of 2017, respectively. The decline is expected to continue in the forthcoming quarters as well. Analysts polled by Zacks anticipate total cigarette shipment volumes to dip 0.16% in first-quarter 2018.Further, the effect of such headwinds is visible on Philip Morris’s shares that have declined 10.3% in the past six months, compared with the industry’s fall of 7%. Well, apart from Philip Morris, performances of other industry majors such as Altria Group (MO  -  Free Report), British American Tobacco (BTI  -  Free Report) and Vector Group (VGR  -  Free Report) have been negatively impacted by such factors as well.  Hopes on Reduced Risk ProductsKeeping the headwinds aside, Philip Morris has been exploring opportunities through RRPs to stay afloat. The company stands firm on its ambitions to develop a smoke free future, evident from its recent move to completely transform one of its cigarette production facilities in Greece for the manufacture of HEETS — a unit used with iQOS. In fact, with investments close to $4.5 billion since 2008 for undertaking research and development in the RRPs category, the company is pioneering the radical shift from harmful tobacco products to scientific and low-risk alternatives.Buoyed by such efforts, the company generated revenues of $1,643 million from RRPs during fourth-quarter 2017, significantly higher than $343 million in the year-ago quarter. Notably, RRP revenues for 2017 represented 12.7% of the company’s overall net revenues, with major contributions from iQOS and accessories.The company expects consistent growth in this category in the forthcoming periods, which encourages it to undertake constant investments. In fact, management expects strength in RRPs (especially iQOS) to drive the company’s currency-neutral revenue growth of more than 8% in 2018.Cigarette Pricing to Aid RevenuesApart from RRPs, higher cigarette pricing has also been an upside in Philip Morris’s performance for a while. Though higher pricing might lead to possible decline in cigarette consumption, it has been noted that smokers tend to absorb price increases owing to the addictive quality of cigarettes. Evidently, favorable pricing in the combustible tobacco portfolio drove year-over-year net revenue growth in 2017. Moreover, the price hikes enable the company to maintain margins at targeted levels. The company continues to expect pricing as a key growth driver in the near term.All, said lets now take a look at the picture unveiled by the consensus marks for earnings and sales as well as the Zacks Model for the upcoming quarterly announcement. Philip Morris International Inc.

1650,PM,"After reporting weaker-than-expected results in the first half of 2017, Philip Morris International Inc (PM  -  Free Report) continued with its dismal performance in the third quarter. Both earnings and revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in third-quarter 2017 results. Moreover, the company lowered its earnings guidance for 2017 due to higher impact of unfavorable currency.Quarter in Detail Adjusted earnings of $1.27 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.39.

Nevertheless, adjusted earnings in the reported quarter inched up 1.6% from the year-ago periodNet revenue, excluding excise taxes, was $7,473 million, which increased 7% (up 9% excluding unfavorable currency of $136 million) in the third quarter. Favorable pricing and volume/mix in the quarter drove revenues. While, revenue increased across Asia, Latin America & Canada and the European Union (EU), the same had declined in Eastern Europe, the Middle East & Africa (EEMA).During the quarter, revenues from combustible products declined 3.6% (down 4.6% excluding negative currency) to $6.5 billion. On the contrary, Reduced Risk Products (RRPs) reported a whopping increase from last-year quarter, stemming from the shift of customer preference away from tobacco products. The company generated revenues of $947 million from RRPs, significantly higher than $212 million reported last year.However, net revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7,616 million.Total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume fell 0.5% to 208.2 billion units. The figures were unfavorable in the EU, EEMA region and in Latin America & Canada mainly owing to low cigarette shipment volumes. These were offset by increased volumes in Asia, as well as higher heated tobacco unit shipment volume across all regions. While cigarette shipment volume declined 4.1% in the quarter, heated tobacco unit shipment volume of 9.7 billion units, increased significantly from 2.1 billion units recorded in third-quarter 2016.Adjusted operating companies income was up 2.2% year over year to $3.1 billion due to favorable pricing and growth witnessed in Asia. Excluding currency impact of $140 million, adjusted operating income increased 6.8%. However adjusted operating margin was down 190 basis points to 42%.Philip Morris International Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Philip Morris International Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Philip Morris International Inc QuoteFinancial UpdateDuring the quarter, Philip Morris increased the regular quarterly dividend by approximately 2.9% to reach an annualized rate of $4.28 per share.GuidancePhilip Morris lowered its earnings guidance for 2017 and now expects the same in range of $4.75 to $4.80, lower than the previous range of $4.78 to $4.93.

This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for PM, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.90% heading into earnings season.Philip Morris International Inc Price and EPS Surprise Philip Morris International Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Philip Morris International Inc QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

1652,PM,"Philip Morris International Inc (PM  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 19, before the opening bell. The company’s earnings have lagged estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average miss of 2.9%.Strict regulations surrounding the promotion and marketing of tobacco products and initiatives undertaken by the government to curb cigarette consumption remain as concerns for the company. However, increased focus on reduced risk tobacco products and hiked prices are expected to keep the company afloat.Let’s delve into some of the factors that are likely to impact third-quarter results of this renowned tobacco company.Government Regulations Pulling Down Cigarette Volumes Cancer and heart diseases have become rampant due to cigarette smoking. As a result, consumers have become health conscious, which has negatively impacted cigarette consumption volumes. Stringent government regulations surrounding tobacco products have also been denting the businesses of major tobacco companies such as Altria Group Inc (MO  -  Free Report) British American Tobacco p.l.c. (BTI  -  Free Report) and Vector Group Ltd (VGR  -  Free Report).Recently, Reynolds American, which is being acquired by British American, along with Altria and other cigarette makers announced the introduction of self-critical advertisements to dissuade customers from smoking per court orders. In July, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) urged tobacco makers to lower nicotine levels in cigarettes, as tar and other substances inhaled through smoking is detrimental to health. Additionally, the FDA has made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets to dissuade customers from smoking.Such industry-wide headwinds have been plaguing Philip Morris’s cigarette volumes. The decline is expected to continue in the forthcoming quarters. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, total cigarette sales volumes for the third quarter are expected to decline 1.4%. According to estimates, total cigarette shipment volumes are expected to decline 0.02% in the third quarter, depicting an improvement from the decline of 7.5% in the preceding quarter and a decline of 2.7% in the prior-year period.Low Risk Tobacco Products Expected to Grow The company expects to gain from increased volumes in reduced risk tobacco products, such as e-cigarettes, HeatSticks and iQOS products. The company expects these products to continue to witness growth for the remaining two quarters of 2017. Philip Morris has also been making several investments to expand the capacity of its heated tobacco products.Further, the marketing and technology sharing agreement between Philip Morris and Altria Group for selling the former’s iQOS heated tobacco products, is also expected to aid volume and sales growth for both companies. The agreement is currently submitted for review to the FDA. Also, Philip Morris is expected to continue gaining from increasing cigarette pricing trend.Driven by adequate growth and strong performance of Philip Morris’s low risk tobacco products, shares of the company have surged 19.3% over the past 12 months, compared with the industry’s rise of 10.3%.Philip Morris International Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Philip Morris International Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Philip Morris International Inc QuoteWhich Way are Estimates Trending A look into estimate revisions give us an idea of what analysts are thinking about the company right before the earnings release. The Consensus Estimate for the third quarter as well as for 2017 has increased by a cent, over the last seven days. Estimated earnings of $1.39 depict a year-over year growth of 10.8%. Estimated earnings of $4.86 also depict a year-over-year rise of 8.6%. Adjusted operating income is expected to surge 8.9% year over year to 3.3 billion, owing to lower cigarette volumes.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $7.7 billion for the third quarter, depicting a growth of 10.3% from the prior-year period. The same for 2017 are expected to be 28.9 billion, up 8.2% from the previous year. Revenues are anticipated to rise on the back of higher pricing as well as increased volumes of heated tobacco products.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model shows that Philip Morris is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Most Accurate estimate is at $1.41 and the Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.39.

1653,PM,"The Tobacco industry has evolved dramatically over the last two decades. It is closely regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as rising cases of cancer and heart diseases due to cigarette smoking is a serious concern. Smoking causes more than 480,000 deaths annually in the United States.Amid this scenario, governments around the world have been imposing stringent restrictions on tobacco companies to lower cigarette consumption. Such restrictions have severely dented businesses of tobacco majors including Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report), Altria Group Inc. (MO  -  Free Report), British American Tobacco p.l.c. (BTI  -  Free Report) and Vector Group Ltd. (VGR  -  Free Report).In a recent move, Winston-Salem-based Reynolds American, which is being acquired by British American, along with Richmond, Va-based Altria and other cigarette makers is set to put up self-critical advertisements on television and newspapers to dissuade customers from smoking per court orders.Apart from this, the court wants tobacco companies to admit that cigarettes have been intentionally made addictive through the issuance of corrective ads starting Nov 26. Per the Wall Street Journal, the move comes in the wake of settling a 1999 lawsuit which accused the industry for several health hazards.Notably since 2009, the FDA has been imposing restrictions on cigarette companies over selling and packaging. In July, the FDA urged tobacco makers to lower nicotine levels in cigarettes, as tar and other substances inhaled through smoking is detrimental to health.Not only this, the FDA has made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets to dissuade customers from smoking. The European Union and the FDA have proposed a ban on menthol in accordance with the Tobacco Control Act. Per the act, menthol has an adverse effect on health and thus should not be used in any product.Recently, the state government in India's capital directed Philip Morris and other tobacco companies to remove all advertisements in the city, warning them of legal action if they do not comply.Switch to Cigarette AlternativesAmid increasing government restrictions and declining smoking rates, tobacco giants have introduced e-cigarettes and switched to less harmful ‘Reduced Risk Products’ to boost their business and mitigate loss. However, the FDA has imposed several restrictions on e-cigarettes as well.The FDA made it mandatory for all tobacco makers to seek marketing authorization for any tobacco product introduced after Feb 15, 2007. The law was extended to include e-cigarettes, pipe tobacco, cigars and hookah. The FDA has currently deferred its reviews for products like cigars and hookah tobacco until 2021 and e-cigarettes until 2022.Share Price Performance: Industry Versus S&P 500Given the aforementioned turmoil, it is not at all surprising that the Zacks Tobacco industry is currently placed at the bottom 28% out of the 265 Zacks Classified Industries. The industry has slumped 7.5% in the last six months, against the S&P 500 market’s 8.4% growth.Bottom LineStricter regulations have adversely impacted tobacco makers’ revenues. However, the FDA’s role to lower cigarette consumption is worth praising, keeping in view the rising deaths due to smoking. The latest initiative to provide statements against smoking is a significant step and is expected to have a great impact on consumers. Companies’ reduced focus on cigarettes and shift toward e-cigarettes is expected to reduce the rate of cigarette consumption in the long run.5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.See these buy recommendations now >>

1654,PM,"We expect food/beverage giant PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Oct 4, before market open. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 7.91%. The company also surpassed expectations in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 5.18%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Pepsico, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Pepsico, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Pepsico, Inc. QuoteWhy a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that PepsiCo is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key components. Zacks ESP: PepsiCo has an Earnings ESP of +0.27%. The Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.43 per share for PEP compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.42 per share. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our  Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks Rank: PepsiCo currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates. Conversely, stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.The combination of PepsiCo’s favorable Zacks Rank and a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat. What is Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?PepsiCo has delivered revenue growth in the past three quarters banking on significant innovation, continued momentum in Frito-Lay business, revenue management strategies, along with better market execution. Moreover, it has been witnessing higher volumes and profits in the North American segments due to an improving economy, better industry pricing dynamics and a consistency in positive innovation.Health awareness has been prime concern for consumers in recent times and capitalizing on this trend can prove to be beneficial for any beverage company in 2017. Keeping this in mind, PepsiCo is gradually reshuffling its portfolio toward healthier Everyday Nutrition Products and the company believes that such products will play an important role in the long-term growth.That said, consumer tastes are rapidly shifting from carbonated soft drinks (CSDs) to non-carbonated beverages. Hence, sluggish CSD volumes are pressing concerns for this beverage giant as well as for other nonalcoholic beverage companies.Again, adverse currency movements continued to negatively impact the company’s revenues. In fiscal second quarter, foreign currency headwinds had a 1.5% impact on the company’s revenue growth. PepsiCo expects currency headwinds to adversely impact revenues by approximately 2%. The company expects the 53rd week in fiscal 2016 to negatively impact reported net revenues in fiscal 2017 by 1%.Coming to the company’s margins, PepsiCo had indicated that as the commodity inflation is expected to continue in 2017, the company’s gross margin might face some pressure in the to-be-reported quarter.Notwithstanding the above-mentioned concerns, the company beat expectation in the last six quarters. PepsiCo delivered revenue growth in the last three quarters after successive declines in revenues in the previous nine quarters. We expect this trend to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well.For the fiscal third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at $1.42, reflecting a 1.5% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $16.42 billion, implying a 2.4% growth. Stocks to ConsiderHere are some consumer staples stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.68% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is scheduled to report quarterly numbers on Oct 25.The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.44% and a Zacks Rank #2.

1655,PM,"General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Sep 20, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.82%.This branded consumer foods’ company delivered a positive earnings surprise in three of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 0.86%.The chart below depicts the surprise history.General Mills, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  General Mills, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | General Mills, Inc. QuoteFactors to ConsiderAlthough General Mills is making efforts to drive revenue growth through consumer-focused innovations and marketing initiatives in its key businesses, the company is expected to witness muted sales growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. This is due to continued volume declines in North America.Sales and profits at the North America Retail segment, which accounted for about 65.3% of the company’s total sales in fiscal 2017, have been soft due to lower demand amid weak food industry trends and changing consumer preferences. Further, organically, year-over-year sales growth is anticipated to decline 1-2% in fiscal 2018.However, much like the other food companies, General Mills, too is focusing on cost-cutting initiatives to boost margin amid soft sales. During the last-reported quarter, despite soft sales, the company’s adjusted gross margin increased 70 basis points (bps) year over year to 35.1%, helped by cost-saving measures. Even its adjusted operating margin grew 220 bps to 16.8%, owing to higher adjusted gross margins, benefits from cost-savings initiatives, and a 17% decline in advertising and media expense.The company has plans of delivering approximately $390 million in supply chain productivity savings in fiscal 2018 through its ongoing Holistic Margin Management (HMM) efforts. General Mills also expects to deliver about $160 million in incremental savings from other restructuring and cost-reduction initiatives, which equates to approximately $700 million in aggregate cost savings by fiscal 2018.That said, an expected decline in volumes, primarily in North America, higher promotional expenses, as planned for the second half of fiscal 2018, and rising input costs are likely to remain a drag in the to-be-reported quarter.For the fiscal first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 77 cents, reflecting a decline of 1.7% year over year. Meanwhile, our estimate for revenues is pegged at $3.79 billion, implying a 3% decline.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that General Mills is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: General Mills’ Earnings ESP is 0.00% as the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 77 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: General Mills’ Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few companies in the consumer staples sector that can be considered as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases.Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.08% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is expected to report its quarterly results on Oct 19.Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.36% and a Zacks Rank #3.

1657,PM,"Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report) maintains its commitment to boost shareholders’ value through dividend payouts. Recently, management has approved a quarterly dividend hike of 2.9% to $1.07 per share from the previous payout of $1.04. The new dividend will be paid on Oct 12, to shareholders of record as on Sep 27, 2017, after the adjustment of ex-dividend date on Sep 26. This brings the company’s annualized dividend to $4.28 per share, representing an increase from the previous annualized rate of $4.16.Notably, this was the 10th straight year of dividend hike by Philip Morris since it officially became a public company in 2008, reflecting a total growth of 132.6% or a compound annual growth rate of 9.8%. The last dividend hike of 2% to $1.04 per share was announced in September 2016.Dividend hike is frequent among companies with a stable cash position and healthy cash flows. Therefore, we believe that such hikes not only enhance shareholders’ return but raise the market value of the stock as well. Basically, through these dividend increases companies persuade investors to either buy or hold the scrip instead of selling it.Apart from Philip Morris, other consumer staple companies like Altria Group, Inc. (MO  -  Free Report), Pinnacle Foods Inc. (PF  -  Free Report) and The J. M. Smucker Company (SJM  -  Free Report) have also raised their dividends. Altria raised its quarterly dividend by 8.2% to 66 cents per share payable on Oct 10. Pinnacle Foods has approved a quarterly dividend hike of 14% to 32.50 cents per share that is payable on Oct 9. J. M. Smucker hiked its quarterly dividend by 4% to 78 cents per share, which was paid on Sep 1.A Look at Philip Morris’ PerformanceThis tobacco leader has been witnessing declining shipment volumes mainly owing to declining demand for cigarettes because of ongoing anti-tobacco campaigns, and price rise to offset the effect of rising taxes. Moreover, consumers opting for e-cigarettes or reduced risk substitutes are denting cigarette volumes.Despite declining cigarette volumes, Philip Morris continues to benefit from its strong portfolio of tobacco brands and pricing power. Further, the company is churning its portfolio and taking steps to develop smoke-free products called reduced risk products as customers are shifting away from tobacco products. In fact, Philip Morris remains focused on the growing e-cigarette category and less harmful alternative tobacco products such as HeatSticks and iQOS products and expects these products to drive growth in 2017.Also, the company’s consistent returns to shareholders in the form of dividends remain noteworthy.Shares of Philip Morris have gained 27.7% year to date, comfortably outperforming the industry’s growth of 9.7%. Currently, the company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1658,PM,"The Consumer Staples sector seems to be in good shape. A rebound in oil prices from all-time lows, an improving labor market and a resurgent housing market are raising buyers’ confidence. Also, encouraging manufacturing index readings issued by the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) also hints at a pickup in GDP, indicating that economy is on a recovery mode.Headwinds Plaguing Tobacco Industry However, tobacco industry, which is part of the consumer staples sector, is failing to draw investors’ attention due to industry-wide headwinds. We note that governments around the world have been imposing stringent restrictions on tobacco companies to lower cigarette consumption, which is severely impacting businesses of tobacco giants including Altria Group Inc. (MO  -  Free Report), British American Tobacco p.l.c. (BTI  -  Free Report) and Vector Group Ltd. (VGR  -  Free Report).In July, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) proposed to lower nicotine levels in cigarettes, as tar and other substances inhaled through smoking is detrimental to health. Not only this, the FDA has made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets to dissuade customers from smoking. The European Union and the FDA have proposed a ban on menthol in accordance with the Tobacco Control Act. Per the act, menthol has an adverse effect on health and thus should not be used in any product.Amid increasing government restrictions and declining smoking rates, the tobacco giants have introduced e-cigarettes and Reduced Risk Products to mitigate losses. However, the FDA also imposed several restrictions on e-cigarettes. The FDA made it mandatory for all tobacco makers to seek marketing authorization for any tobacco product introduced after Feb 15, 2007. The law was extended to include e-cigarettes, pipe tobacco, cigars and hookah. The FDA has currently deferred its reviews for products like cigars and hookah tobacco until 2021 and e-cigarettes until 2022.Amid such a scenario, let us take look at Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report) and see if it can be a good choice for investors. The company’s sales have declined in six out of the last seven straight quarters due to lowering cigarette shipment volumes. Also, its earnings have posted negative surprise in five out of the last seven quarters.Why Philip Morris is a Viable Investment Choice?Shares Gaining Momentum: Despite declining cigarette volumes, Philip Morris continues to benefit from its strong portfolio of tobacco brands and pricing power. Further, the company is churning its portfolio and taking steps to develop smoke-free products called reduced risk products. In fact, Philip Morris remains focused on the growing e-cigarette category and less harmful alternative tobacco products such as HeatSticks and iQOS and expects the same to deliver growth in 2017. The strong fundamentals of the company are reflected in its share price movement. Philip Morris has outperformed the Zacks Tobacco industry and the broader Consumer Staple sector on a year-to-date basis. The stock has moved up 28.9% in the said time frame, higher than the industry’s growth of 10.7% and the sector’s increase of 11.2%.Favorable VGM Score: Philip Morris, with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) flaunts a VGM Score of B, which makes it a favorable investing option. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. We note that the VGM Score is a comprehensive tool that will allow investors to filter through the standard scoring system and choose better winning stocks. In order to screen out potential winning stocks, we consider only those that have a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of A or B.Valuation Multiples: If we look into the company’s EV/EBITDA and P/S multiples, we note that the company generally trades below its industry average.Philip Morris has a EV/EBITDA multiple of 18.4. This level actually compares pretty favorably with the industry at large, as the EV/EBITDA multiple for the industry is pegged at 32.6. This indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.Right now, Philip Morris has a P/S ratio of 2.4. This is significantly lower than the industry average of 2.8 and S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.1.Valuation MultiplePhilip MorrisIndustryP/S ratio2.42.8EV/EBITDA18.432.6 Adapting to Evolving Consumer Demand; Focusing on Reduced Risk Products: As smoking rates have started to decline in developed countries, the competition to develop alternative products is putting pressure on the tobacco industry. Serious health hazards due to smoking have pushed consumers toward low-risk, reduced risk products. After launching the much talked about iQOS, a smokeless cigarette in November 2014, Philip Morris has witnessed a steady increase in the number of iQOS purchasers. iQOS smokeless cigarette looks a lot like a second generation vaporizer that uses actual tobacco in the shape of small Marlboro cigarettes called HeatSticks that are heated at high temperatures, but not burned. The company launched iQOS in key cities in 27 markets globally during second-quarter 2017, and remains on track to expand nationally in 30 to 35 markets by the end of 2017. Also, Philip Morris further anticipates producing about 100 billion HeatSticks by 2018. The company expects both higher heated tobacco unit and iQOS device sales to drive growth in 2017.Marketing and Technology Sharing Agreement With Altria Group: The marketing and technology sharing agreement between Philip Morris and its peer Altria Group is boosting the business of both companies. Per the agreement, Philip Morris will market Altria’s MarkTen e-cigarettes internationally and Altria will distribute two of Philip Morris’ heated tobacco products in the United States. The companies have also extended their technology sharing agreement in July 2015 to work on a joint research, development and technology-sharing framework for developing unconventional cigarettes. On Mar 31, Philip Morris applied for pre-market approval of its iQOS heated tobacco product with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which will be sold by Altria in U.S. If the FDA grants Philip Morris’ request it will help the companies maintain market share amid declining volume and growing awareness against tobacco products.Strong Pricing as the Growth Driver: Philip Morris has always managed to remain afloat and generate revenues with higher cigarette pricing in the face of an unfavorable tax environment and declining cigarette volumes. Since December 2013, Philip Morris has been increasing its cigarette prices and maintained its market share. This shows its strong business model and strength of its key brands. During first-quarter 2017, Philip Morris and the other tobacco companies raised their cigarette prices in a number of markets. Though higher pricing should lead to possible decline in cigarette consumption, it is seen that smokers generally remain unaffected by price increases owing to the addictive nature of cigarettes. However, price hikes help Philip Morris maintain margins at the desired level. The company continues to expect pricing as the key growth driver in the near term.Philip Morris International Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Philip Morris International Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Philip Morris International Inc QuoteMore Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1659,PM,"Amid declining tobacco sales volumes and rising government restrictions, Altria Group, Inc.’s (MO  -  Free Report) shift to low risk smokeless tobacco products has been aiding the company to maintain market share and generate profit.Let’s now delve deeper into the aspects which have been helping Altria to remain in investor’s good books.Low Risk Tobacco Products Aid Maintaining Market Share Consumers have been shifting to low risk, smokeless tobacco products, considering the health hazards of smoking. Altria has been quite proactive to respond to this change and has been offering several reduced risk tobacco products to maintain market share. MarkTen e-cigarette and Green Smoke e-vapor are few examples of products belonging to this category. In fact, MarkTen is now the number two e-vapor brand nationally and had a national retail market share of approximately 13% during the second quarter of 2017.In respect to developing its low risk cigarette category, Altria’s agreement with Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report) is quite noteworthy. The company has a marketing and technology agreement with Philip Morris under which the latter markets Altria’s MarkTen e-cigarettes internationally and Altria distributes two of Philip Morris’ heated tobacco products in the United States. Moreover, Altria is expected to sell Philip Morris’s iQOS heated tobacco product in the domestic market, once the product gains approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).Cost Reduction Altria started a productivity initiative in January 2016 which is expected to deliver approximately $300 million in annual productivity savings by the end of 2017. The company plans to save through reduced spending on certain selling, general and administrative infrastructure and thereby develop a leaner organization. Further, in October 2016, Altria announced plans to consolidate certain sections of its manufacturing facilities to streamline operations and achieve greater efficiency. The consolidation, scheduled to be completed by first-quarter 2018 is expected to deliver approximately $50 million in cost savings by the end of 2018. Such initiatives are anticipated to aid the company gain higher profits over the long term.Industry Headwinds Weighs on Stock PricesAltria has been witnessing volume declines for cigarettes due to the ongoing anti-tobacco campaigns and price hikes. Price hikes for cigarettes were observed in New York during August and in California during April this year. In July 2017, the FDA had proposed to lower nicotine in cigarettes to non-addictive or minimally addictive levels. This has further raised concerns of accelerated sales decline for Altria and other tobacco companies including Philip Morris, British American Tobacco plc (BTI  -  Free Report) and Vector Group Ltd. (VGR  -  Free Report), which are already plagued by ongoing government restrictions related to selling and packaging. Owing to such headwinds, shares of Altria have declined 17.7% wider than the industry’s fall of 4.4%. Bottom Line Altria has been striving hard to adapt with the changing industry conditions to better suit consumer needs, as evidenced by its progress in the smokeless cigarette category. Backed by such efforts, the company recently reaffirmed its earnings guidance for full-year 2017 and expects adjusted earnings in the range of $3.26-$3.32, up 7.5% to 9.5% compared with adjusted earnings of $3.03 in 2016. Moreover, the company expects higher adjusted earnings growth in the second half of the year in contrast with the first half. Such moves are expected to improve the company’s share price performance in the forthcoming periods. Altria currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1660,PM,"Tobacco is known to cause cancer and heart diseases. Per media sources, it causes more than 480,000 deaths annually in the United States. Governments around the world have been imposing stringent restrictions on tobacco companies to lower cigarette consumption. In July 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) proposed to lower nicotine levels in cigarettes, as tar and other substances inhaled through smoking is detrimental to health.Not only this, the FDA has made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets to dissuade customers from smoking. The European Union and the FDA have proposed a ban on menthol in accordance with the Tobacco Control Act. Per the act, menthol has an adverse effect on health and thus should not be used in any product.Amid increasing government restrictions and declining smoking rates, the tobacco giants have introduced e-cigarettes and Reduced Risk Products to mitigate losses.

1661,PM,"It seems that the leaders of New York City have been striving hard to make the city smoke-free. In fact, the Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York has reportedly issued a series of laws in April to reduce the number of smokers in the city over the next three years.Per the Aug 28 bill, the minimum price for a pack of cigarettes will now be $13 in New York. Notably, a packet of cigarettes currently costs $10.50. The latest price hike has made New York the most expensive city in the U.S. for cigarettes, as declared by some officials in the Health Department stated in sources. In the past too, the mayor has resorted to price hike as a tool to restrict smokers. Smoking rate in the city has declined from 21.5% in 2002 to about 14.3% in 2015. The rate is expected to decline to 12% by 2020 due to this price hike, as anticipated by some city health officials.The law was introduced in anticipation of making almost 900,000 smokers quit smoking as well as to reduce the number of retailers licensed to sell tobacco products in the city. Currently, about 8,300 retailers have a license to sell cigarettes.The mayor is also seeking to ban the sale of all tobacco products in pharmacies, as a result of which pharmacy chains like Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.’s (WBA  -  Free Report) Duane Reade and CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report) will have to take cigarettes off their shelves. The new legislation also requires licensing of e-cigarette retailers and will force all residential buildings to have smoking policies, including banning cigarettes in common areas like hallways.We note that these measures will severely dent businesses of tobacco majors including Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report), Altria Group Inc. (MO  -  Free Report), British American Tobacco p.l.c. (BTI  -  Free Report) and Vector Group Ltd. (VGR  -  Free Report), which are already plagued by ongoing government restrictions related to selling and packaging.If we look into the share price performance of these tobacco stocks in comparison with the industry, we note that except Philip Morris, all the other stocks have underperformed the industry that declined 5.6% in the past six months. While Philip Morris gained 5.5% and British American declined 4.3%, Vector Group and Altria declined 7.8% and 15.4%, respectively, in the same time frame.Recently, the state government in India's capital directed Philip Morris and other tobacco companies to remove all advertisements in the city, warning them of legal action if they do not comply. Last month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) proposed to lower nicotine levels in cigarettes, as it is responsible for a number of health issues.Governments around the world are imposing restrictions on tobacco companies which, in turn, are lowering cigarette consumption. The FDA has made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets to dissuade customers from smoking. The European Union and the FDA have proposed a ban on menthol in accordance with the Tobacco Control Act. Per the act, menthol has an adverse effect on health and thus should not be used in any product.Amid increasing government restrictions and declining smoking rates, the tobacco giants have introduced e-cigarettes and Reduced Risk Products to mitigate losses. Altria is expanding presence in the e-cigarette market steadily with its MarkTen and Green Smoke brands.On the other hand, Philip Morris has been gaining from its iQOS smokeless cigarettes since its launch in November 2014. The marketing and technology sharing agreement between Philip Morris and its peer Altria Group is also boosting the business of both the companies amid declining tobacco volumes.However, the FDA also imposed several restrictions on e-cigarettes. The FDA made it mandatory for all tobacco makers to seek marketing authorization for any tobacco product introduced after Feb 15, 2007. The law was extended to include e-cigarettes, pipe tobacco, cigars and hookah. The FDA has currently deferred its reviews for products like cigars and hookah tobacco until 2021 and e-cigarettes until 2022.Bottom LineWhile price hike and lower availability of cigarettes do help smokers to quit smoking, as seen in the past, the ban also creates a serious black market for these products, which can be detrimental to all tobacco companies.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye On Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

1662,PM,"Altria Group, Inc. (MO  -  Free Report) recently announced that its board of directors has approved an increase of 8.2% in its quarterly dividend, amounting 66 cents per share as compared with the previous rate of 61 cents. The newly hiked dividend is payable on Oct 10, 2017, to shareholders of record  on Sep 15.The company’s current annualized rate of dividend is $2.64 per common share, compared with $2.44 previously. Since Philip Morris International's (PM  -  Free Report) spin off in 2009, Altria has increased its dividend every year by 8% in 2016 and 8.7% in 2015. Notably, the company has raised its dividend 51 times in the last 48 years. It maintains a dividend payout ratio target of around 80% of its adjusted earnings per share, which is among the highest in its peer group.Altria has been consistently returning value to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. In the second quarter of 2017, the company paid almost $1.2 billion in dividends and nearly $2.4 billion in the first half of 2017. During the second quarter, Altria also repurchased 14.4 million shares under its existing share repurchase program for approximately $1.05 billion. As of Jun 30, Altria had approximately $335 million remaining in the share repurchase program. In July, Altria’s board authorized a $1 billion expansion to the program. Altria expects to complete the expanded $4-billion share repurchase program by the end of the second quarter of 2018.Further, the takeover of SABMiller by Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD  -  Free Report) in October 2016 helped Altria, SABMiller’s biggest investor. Altria received a 9.6% ownership of AB InBev, and approximately $5.3 billion in pre-tax cash per the terms of the acquisition, which the company used to reinvest in its core businesses or/and return value to shareholders.Industry Headwinds Effecting Stock Price Performance Notably, the tobacco maker has been returning value to its shareholders despite industry-wide headwinds. The tobacco stocks have been primarily hurt by the declining use of tobacco since past many quarters. Strict anti-smoking regulations by governments, globally, in the form of restrictions on packaging and high excise duties are also affecting the stock. Additionally, consumers’ preference for e-cigarettes or substitutes for cigarettes are largely affecting the cigarette volume. The recent FDA proposal to lower nicotine in cigarettes to non-addictive or minimally addictive levels has also added to the company’s woes.Most recently on Jul 28, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has proposed to lower nicotine in cigarettes to non-addictive or minimally addictive levels.A look into Altria’s price performance over the past six months, projects that the company’s shares have decreased 14.7%, wider than the industry’s decline of 5.2%. The broader Consumer Staples sector depicted a growth of 3.6% in the said time frame.Proactive Measures to Remain Afloat Despite unfavorable tax environment and declining cigarette volumes, Altria has been able to remain afloat and generate revenues with higher cigarette pricing. Though higher pricing might lead to possible decline in cigarette consumption, it is seen that smokers tend to absorb price increases owing to the addictive quality of cigarettes.Additionally, Altria has promptly responded to the general shift among consumers toward low-risk, smokeless tobacco products due to serious health hazards of smoking cigarettes. Altria offers several reduced risk tobacco products that helped it to maintain its market share. Altria collaborated with Okono A/S and developed innovative, non-combustible nicotine-containing products for adult smokers. Further, Altria’s marketing and technology agreement with Philip Morris, under which the latter markets its MarkTen e-cigarettes internationally, is boosting the company’s business prospects. Altria also distributes two of Philip Morris’ heated tobacco products in the United States, which is also positive factor in terms of business growth.Such dedicated efforts are expected to improve the company’s stock performance, going ahead. Altria currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and has a long-term growth rate of 7.1%.Do Consumer Staples Stocks Interest You?

1663,PM,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Philip Morris International Inc (PM  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 3.3% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Philip Morris Earnings & Sales Miss Estimates in Q2Philip Morris reported weaker-than-expected second-quarter 2017 results, wherein both earnings and revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Moreover, the company lowered its earnings guidance for 2017 due to higher impact of unfavorable currency.Quarter in DetailAdjusted earnings per share of $1.14 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.23 by 7.3% in the second quarter. It also dipped 0.9% from the year-ago quarter. While the company benefited from strong pricing, lower cigarette volumes led to the decline.Net revenue, excluding excise taxes, was $6.917 billion, which were way behind the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.058 billion by 2.0%. Revenue was up 4.0% year-over-year (up 7.0% excluding unfavorable currency of $195 million) in the second quarter driven by higher heated tobacco unit and iQOS device sales, notably in Japan, as well as favorable pricing. Favorable pricing and volume/mix in the quarter drove revenues. Revenue increased across Eastern Europe, the Middle East & Africa (EEMA), Latin America & Canada and Asia regions but were partly offset by regions of European Union (EU).Revenues from combustible products declined 3.4% (down 0.5% excluding negative currency) to $6.3 billion. On the contrary, Reduced Risk Products (RRPs) reported a whooping increase from last-year quarter, stemming from the shift of customer preference away from tobacco products. Notably, a portion of RRP net revenues are from iQOS devices, which gained popularity despite yielding a negative margin due to introductory discounts offered in the initial phase to accelerate adult smoker switching. Underpinned by the strong growth outlook for RRPs, the company now anticipates total currency-neutral net revenue growth above 7% in 2017.Total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume fell 5.0% to 199.9 billion units. The volumes were unfavorable in Asia, due to a challenging consumer spending environment in Indonesia as well as ongoing declines of low-margin cigarette volumes in Pakistan and in Philippines. In EEMA regions, volume declines were due to impact of excise tax-driven price increases in Russia and an increase in illicit trade in Turkey. The decline was also due to lower volume in Saudi Arabia related to the introduction in June of an excise tax that resulted in a doubling of retail selling prices.Despite a 5% decline in total volume in the second quarter, the decline was narrower sequentially from 7.8% decline in first quarter. For 2017, the company continues to anticipate a total shipment volume decline of 3% to 4%, broadly in line with last year. This reflects the further expected sequential improvement in the third and the fourth quarters, notably driven by the Asia region, with higher RRP volume and improved cigarette volume in markets such as Indonesia, Pakistan and the Philippines.While cigarette shipment volume declined 7.5% in the quarter, heated tobacco unit shipment volume of 6.4 billion units increased significantly from 1.2 billion units recorded in second-quarter 2016.Adjusted operating companies income was down 1.1% year over year to $2.8 billion due to lower revenues from combustible products and unfavorable currency. Excluding currency impact of $199 million, adjusted operating income increased 5.9%. Adjusted operating margin was also down 210 basis points to 40.6%.Segment DetailsEuropean Union: Net revenue in the European Union region declined 2.1% year over year to $2.1 billion. Excluding the impact of currency, net revenue increased 2.2%, driven by favorable pricing in Germany and the United Kingdom, partly offset by unfavorable pricing in France and Italy. Favorable volume/mix in Italy, reflecting the performance of reduced-risk products, also led to revenue growth.Adjusted operating companies income, excluding unfavorable currency, decreased by 3.7%. Adjusted operating companies income margin, excluding unfavorable currency, decreased by 2.9 points to 46.8%.Eastern Europe, the Middle East & Africa (EEMA): Net revenue in EEMA region increased just 0.7% year over year to $1.7 billion. Excluding the impact of currency, net revenue grew 4.4%, principally driven by favorable pricing, mainly by North Africa, notably Egypt, Turkey and Ukraine. The favorable pricing variance was partly offset by unfavorable volume/mix, mainly due to lower total markets in Russia, Saudi Arabia, mainly resulting from the implementation of a new excise tax, and Turkey, partly offset by North Africa.Adjusted operating companies income, excluding unfavorable currency, increased 3.3%. Adjusted operating companies income margin, excluding unfavorable currency, decreased by 0.5 points to 47.2%.Asia: The company recorded net revenue growth of 11.8% to $2.4 billion in Asia. Excluding currency impact, revenue was up 12.8% from the prior-year quarter, despite a decline in cigarette revenues and shipment volumes.Adjusted operating companies income, excluding unfavorable currency, increased 15.0%.Latin America and Canada: In Latin America and Canada, revenues increased 7.3% (up 10.2% excluding currency) to $748 million, primarily driven by growth in cigarette revenues and tobacco shipment volumes.Adjusted operating companies income, excluding unfavorable currency, increased 31.3%. Financial UpdateDuring the quarter, Philip Morris announced a regular quarterly dividend of $1.04 per share.GuidancePhilip Morris lowered its earnings guidance for 2017, including currency. The company now expects its 2017 diluted earnings per share in the band of $4.78–$4.93 as compared with $4.84–$4.99, expected earlier. Excluding adverse effect of currency of $0.14 ($0.08 per share expected earlier) in 2017 and favorable tax item of $0.04 reported in the first quarter, this guidance reflects growth of nearly 9–12% over the adjusted earnings of $4.48 delivered in 2016. Further, the company expects higher currency-neutral growth in the second half of 2017, mainly reflecting increased heated tobacco unit shipment volume, partly offset by continued investments behind the commercialization of iQOS.For 2017, the company continues to anticipate a total shipment volume decline of 3% to 4%, broadly in line with last year. This reflects the further expected sequential improvement in the third and the fourth quarters, notably driven by the Asia region, with higher RRP volume and improved cigarette volume in markets such as Indonesia, Pakistan and the Philippines.Further, the company expects revenues growth, excluding excise taxes, of over 7% excluding currency impact and acquisitions.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Analysts were quiet during the last one month period as none of them issued any earnings estimate revisions.Philip Morris International Inc Price and Consensus  Philip Morris International Inc Price and Consensus | Philip Morris International Inc QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, the stock has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with an F.

1664,PM,"On July 28, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) proposed to reduce nicotine levels in cigarettes to non-addictive or minimally addictive levels, due to its perilous effects on health. Since, FDA’s regulation is aimed at the addictive nature of cigarettes, the latest restriction could lower cigarette consumption and the profitability of tobacco companies.In any case, governments around the world have been proactive in applying restrictive enforcements on tobacco companies. For example, the FDA made it compulsory for all tobacco makers to seek marketing approval for any tobacco product introduced after February 15, 2007. Moreover, the European Union and the FDA have proposed a ban on menthol in accordance with the Tobacco Control Act.Following the proposal in late July, stocks of cigarette makers including Altria Group MO , British American Tobacco Plc (BTI  -  Free Report), Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report) and Vector Group Ltd. (VGR  -  Free Report) fell. However, Philip Morris shares were less hurt in the lot. Most of the stocks were in the red in the last five days (as of August 3, 2017) with MO, BTI, PM and VGR sliding about 11.4%, 6.7%, 3.1% and 6.8%, respectively.Tobacco’s ETF ExposureTwo tobacco companies – Altria and Philip Morris – has huge exposure to consumer staples ETFs. Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLP  -  Free Report), Fidelity MSCI Consumer Staples Index ETF (FSTA  -  Free Report) and Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF (VDC  -  Free Report) invest about 8-10% of their holdings in Philip Morris (read: ETFs in Focus After Phillip Morris's Downbeat Q2 Results).In fact, the three ETFs have about 17-20% of their exposure targeted at the tobacco industry. On the other hand, Altria has considerable exposure to FSTA, iShares Edge MSCI USA Quality Factor ETF (QUAL  -  Free Report),XLP, VDC and iShares U.S. Consumer Goods ETF (IYK  -  Free Report). These funds put about 5-6.5% of their assets in Altria (read: Time to Cash in on Cola Earnings with These ETFs?).Vector Group has an exposure of about 1.5-3.5% to PowerShares High Yield Equity Dividend Achievers Portfolio ETF (PEY  -  Free Report) and WisdomTree SmallCap Dividend Fund (DES  -  Free Report).BTI is invested about 3.5% to 4.3% in ETFs like BLDRS Europe Select ADR Index Fund (ADRU  -  Free Report) and BLDRS Developed Markets 100 ADR Index Fund (ADRD  -  Free Report).Are Staples ETFs Really in Trouble Over the Long Run?Most of the above-mentioned ETFs lost in the last five days (as of August 4, 2017). Normally, staple ETFs are known for safety due to their non-cyclical business pattern. However, if tobacco companies continue to get hurt like this, consumer staples’ ETFs may see some troubles (read: Tough Time Ahead for Grocery Stocks and ETFs?).Investors should note that these tobacco stocks offer decent levels of dividend too with Altria and Phillip Morris offering 3.72% and 3.63% yields (as of August 3, 2017). So, investors’ quest for dividend will also likely get burnt in tobacco woes.But there is a bright side as well. Research house Cowen “does not expect regulatory changes to put tobacco company earnings at risk until at least 2019” as the FDA process is likely to be slow. The FDA is likely to be “considering a delay in implementing new rules for reduced-risk products like e-cigarettes.”As per Cowen, companies like Philip Morris and Turning Point Brands will actually benefit from the FDA’s move as these are well positioned to boost their e-cigarette businesses. However, not all players are shielded, so, over the long term, the impact is likely to be mixed. Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?

"
1665,PM,"On Jul 28, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) proposed to lower nicotine levels in cigarettes, as it is responsible for a number of health issues. Following the proposal, stocks of cigarette makers including Altria Group Inc. (MO  -  Free Report), British American Tobacco p.l.c. (BTI  -  Free Report) and Vector Group Ltd. (VGR  -  Free Report) plunged 9.5%, 7.0% and 4.7%, respectively. Shares of Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report) declined initially but then rebounded to eventually close 0.27% higher.If we look into the share price performance of these tobacco stocks in comparison with the industry, we note that except Philip Morris, all the other stocks have underperformed the industry that gained 8.9% in the past six months. While Philip Morris gained 22.2% and British American increased 1.5%, Vector Group and Altria declined 9.5% and 8.4%, respectively, in the same time frame.Tobacco causes cancer and heart disease and is responsible for more than 480,000 deaths annually in U.S. Tar and other substances inhaled through smoking make cigarettes deadly, but the nicotine in tobacco is what makes them addictive.Also, governments around the world are imposing restrictions on tobacco companies which, in turn, are lowering cigarette consumption. FDA has made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets to dissuade customers from smoking.In May 2016, the FDA also imposed several restrictions on e-cigarettes. The FDA made it mandatory for all tobacco makers to seek marketing authorization for any tobacco product introduced after Feb 15, 2007. The law was extended to include e-cigarettes, pipe tobacco, cigars and hookahs.Recently, the state government in India's capital directed Philip Morris and other tobacco companies to remove all advertisements in the city, warning them of legal action if they do not comply.Moreover, the European Union and the FDA have proposed a ban on menthol in accordance with the Tobacco Control Act. Per the act, menthol have an adverse effect on health and thus should not be used in any product. Moreover, this ban will create a serious black market for these products, which would be detrimental to all tobacco companies.While the news of cutting nicotine to non-addictive or minimally addictive levels have raised concerns of rapid declines in sales for traditional cigarettes, it has also proved a boon for e-cigarettes, which turn liquid nicotine into an inhalable vapor. Though the regulatory authorities have imposed marketing and product regulations on e-cigarettes as well, but there is still not much scientific evidence to back their ability to help smokers quit or reduce the habit of smoking. We also note that FDA has pushed back its reviews for products like cigars and hookah tobacco until 2021 and e-cigarettes until 2022.Focus on Tobacco AlternativesAmid declining smoking rates, the tobacco giants have resorted to innovation in the form of e-cigarettes and Reduced Risk Products to mitigate losses from an increasing number of quitters. This is particularly encouraging as according to Euromonitor International, the global e-cigarette market is expected to grow to $51 billion, or hold 4% share of the worldwide tobacco market, by 2030.Altria is steadily expanding presence in the e-cigarette market with its MarkTen and Green Smoke brands. Moreover, in an attempt to boost unconventional tobacco products, Altria acquired privately-held Sherman Group Holdings, LLC and its subsidiaries (Nat Sherman). The move is likely to expand its premium smokeable category. The takeover benefits Altria’s smokeable segment and complements Altria’s Marlboro brand which also falls under the premium category.Similarly, to cater to the new consumer preferences, Philip Morris launched the much talked about iQOS, a smokeless cigarette in Nov 2014 leading the tobacco industry’s push into reduced-risk products that may eventually replace traditional smokes. Philip Morris’ iQOS smokeless cigarette looks like a second generation vaporizer that uses actual tobacco in the shape of small Marlboro cigarettes called HeatSticks that are heated at high temperatures, but not burned.Since its launch, there has been a steady increase in the number of iQOS purchasers. iQOS are anticipated to boost market share and offset declining volumes in traditional cigarette business in 2017. The company has launched iQOS in key cities in 27 markets globally during second-quarter 2017 and remains on track to expand nationally in 30 to 35 markets by the end of the year.The marketing and technology sharing agreement between Philip Morris and its peer Altria Group is also boosting the business of both the companies. Per the agreement, Philip Morris will market Altria’s MarkTen e-cigarettes internationally and Altria will distribute two of Philip Morris’ heated tobacco products in the U.S. The companies have also extended their technology-sharing agreement in Jul 2015 to work on a joint research, development and technology-sharing framework for developing unconventional cigarettes.On Mar 31, Philip Morris has applied for pre-market approval of its iQOS heated tobacco product with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which will be sold by Altria in the U.S., provided the FDA grants Philip Morris’ request. Such a collaboration is encouraging as it will help the participating companies maintain market share amid declining volumes and growing awareness against tobacco products.The recent merger of Reynolds American, Inc. with British American Tobacco has brought strengthen its global portfolio including next generation products and strong cigar brands including Newport, Kent from British American Tobacco and Camel and Pall Mall from Reynolds. Moreover, the combined company will benefit from Reynolds’ strong position in the alternative tobacco and next-generation product development, and R&D capabilities.More Stock News: 8 Companies Verge on Apple-Like RunDid you miss Apple's 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007?

1666,PM,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced a plan on Friday to reduce tobacco-related disease and death by increasing regulations on tobacco and nicotine products. The FDA is seeking to lower nicotine levels in cigarettes to non-addictive levels.In reaction to this news, Tobacco stocks plunged in morning trading. Shares of Altria Group (MO  -  Free Report), which makes Marlboro and Parliament brand cigarettes, fell 11% after the announcement. Shares of Gillia  tumbled 7% while British American Tobacco (BTI  -  Free Report) stock plunged 9%. Meanwhile, Vector Group (VGR  -  Free Report) shares fell 5% and Philip Morris (PM  -  Free Report) stock was down 1% in the same time frame. The FDA’s regulation targets the addictive nature of cigarettes, which could hurt the profitability of tobacco companies. However, the FDA views these regulations as a way to encourage development of innovative tobacco products that may be less dangerous than cigarettes.“The overwhelming amount of death and disease attributable to tobacco is caused by addiction to cigarettes—the only legal consumer product that, when used as intended, will kill half of all long-term users,” FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a statement.“Envisioning a world where cigarettes would no longer create or sustain addiction, and where adults who still need or want nicotine could get it from alternative and less harmful sources, needs to be the cornerstone of our efforts—and we believe it’s vital that we pursue this common ground.”The agency also announced plans to delay a policy that requires makers of e-cigarettes, or electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), to get agency approval for their products. To help spur industry innovation, products that were on the market as of August 8th, 2016, do not need to submit applications until 2022.The agency said it will issue guidance to describe a new enforcement policy “shortly” as it begins a public discussion around lowering nicotine levels. The FDA has not said what level of nicotine it is aiming for.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

1667,PM,"The second-quarter reporting cycle seems to have started off on a solid note, with a slew of positive surprises coming in on both the earnings and revenue fronts. Also, earnings and revenue growth have bettered expectations.As of Jul 25, 128 companies on the S&P 500 index reported their quarterly numbers, per the Earnings Outlook. Of these, 77.3% delivered positive earnings surprises, while 70.3% surpassed the top-line expectations. In fact, total earnings for these companies were up 7% from the year-ago quarter, while revenues increased 4.2%.Total second-quarter earnings for the S&P 500 companies are projected to rise 7.2% from the year-ago period, with total revenue increase of 4.5%, according to the Earnings Trends of Jul 19. While this looks encouraging, we note that the earnings and revenue growth pace is still tracking below the first quarter 2017 level. Thus, with this initial growth picture we cannot conclude that the second-quarter earnings cycle is going to be outstanding.The performance of the index is not restricted to a single sector, and of the 16 Zacks sectors, six are expected to witness an earnings decline in the second quarter. Of these, Autos and Conglomerates are likely to be the major drags.Tobacco Stocks form part of the Consumer Staples sector. The second-quarter earnings’ numbers for the sector looks decent, with year-over-year earnings growth of 3.9% and revenues increase of 1.5%. In fact, the sector is currently placed at top 13% of the Zacks Classified sectors (2 out of 16).Conversely, we observed that the Consumer Staples sector has lagged the broader market in the last one year. While the sector gained 2.4%, the S&P 500 index advanced 14.3%.Let’s see what awaits the following Tobacco stocks that are queued up for second-quarter earnings releases on Jul 27.Leading tobacco maker, Altria Group, Inc. (MO  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report before the market opens. We note that the company’s earnings have lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.4% in the first quarter, but delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 0.7% in the trailing four quarters.Our proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Altria this quarter. This is because a company needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Altria Group Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Altria Group Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Altria Group QuoteAltria has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 86 cents. Moreover, the company carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which further makes surprise prediction difficult.In fact, Altria has been witnessing declining demand for cigarettes due to the ongoing anti-tobacco campaigns, government restrictions and higher cigarette prices in response to rising taxes on it. Additionally, consumers’ preference for e-cigarettes or substitutes for cigarettes are largely affecting the cigarette volume. (Read more: Will Declining Volumes Hurt Altria's Earnings in Q2?)Another company, which is expected to report tomorrow, is Vector Group Ltd. (VGR  -  Free Report) that manufactures and sells cigarettes. The company’s earnings have missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters. However, it has pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 2.2% in the trailing four quarters.Vector Group Ltd. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Vector Group Ltd. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Vector Group Ltd. QuoteThe company is unlikely to beat earnings estimates this quarter, as it has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 18 cents. Although the company’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, we need a positive Earnings ESP in order to be confident about an earnings surprise. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.We note that Vector Group’s earnings estimates have been largely stable ahead of the earnings release.Tobacco Industry’s HeadwindsThe tobacco industry has been facing many challenges, which have been weighing upon the companies’ performance. Furthermore, the restrictions imposed on tobacco companies are lowering cigarette consumption. Also, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets to dissuade customers from smoking. These regulations adversely impact the company’s top line and, in turn, its overall profitability.Recently, tobacco giant, Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report), reported another dismal quarter with its second-quarter 2017 results, wherein both its top line and bottom line lagged expectations. Moreover, the company lowered its earnings guidance for 2017 due to higher impact of unfavorable currency. (Read more: Philip Morris Earnings & Sales Miss Estimates in Q2) So, let’s wait and see whether the afore-mentioned companies are able to outweigh these headwinds and put up a good show this quarter.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

1668,PM,"Shares of Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report) declined 1.45% at market close on Thursday, July 20, 2017. The company reported a year-over-year growth of 1.5% in total quarterly revenues, as it increased to $19.319 billion from $19.041 billion. Excluding excise taxes, it reported a $6.917 billion revenue figure in the second quarter of 2017 compared with $6.064 billion in the first quarter of 2017 and $6.641 billion a year ago.The company’s shares failed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both earnings and sales in the second quarter of 2017. Increased regulation and poor demand weighed on the company’s performance.Q2 Results in FocusPhilip Morris reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.14, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.23. Moreover, Philip Morris’ second-quarter revenue of $6.917 billion fell short of the Zacks Consensus estimate of $7.088 billion. The tobacco company reported operating income of $2.7 billion, down 1.2% year over year.Shipment VolumeThe company’s total shipment volume came in at 199.89 billion units, declining 5% from second-quarter 2016 figure of 210.45 billion units. The decline was due to a sharp fall in shipment volume of cigarettes, which decreased 7.5% to 193.54 billion compared with 209.29 billion units in the prior-year quarter. Some respite was provided due to an increase in shipment volume of heated tobacco units. Shipment volume of heated tobacco units increased to 6.35 billion units from 1.15 billion units in the year-ago quarter.OutlookPhilip Morris expects its full year 2017 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.78—$4.93 compared with $4.48 in 2016. This forecast band represents 9—12% growth over the 2016 figure, excluding impact of adverse currency movement of $0.14 for the full year and a tax item in the first quarter of $0.04.In the current scenario, we believe it is prudent to discuss the following ETFs that have a relatively high exposure to Philip Morris.Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLP  -  Free Report)This fund offers exposure to the Consumer Staples sector of the U.S. It has AUM of $9.46 billion and charges a fee of 14 basis points a year.

1670,PM,"Reynolds American Inc.  has finally got the shareholders’ approval for its acquisition by British American Tobacco p.l.c. (BTI  -  Free Report). The transaction, which is expected to complete on or about July 25, comprise $29.44 cash and a number of BAT American Depositary Shares representing 0.5260 of British American Tobacco’s ordinary share. British American is expected take over the remaining 57.8% of Reynolds American for $49 billion.Notably, Reynolds American shareholders’ have approved three proposals, which are the Agreement and Plan of Merger, the compensation payments on a non-binding basis and the adjournment of the special meeting, if it is required.Post-acquisition, the merged company will become the world’s largest publicly traded tobacco entity. It will own a global portfolio including next generation products and strong cigar brands including Newport, Kent from BAT, and Camel and Pall Mall from Reynolds.Furthermore, British American is likely to generate a minimum of $400 million of savings via cost-cutting efforts, higher purchasing power as well as other efficiencies. Also, it plans to add roughly $38 billion of debt with the acquisition in addition to approximately $22 billion debt at the end of the previous year.Earlier in Oct 2016, British American Tobacco offered to buy the remaining part of Reynolds American in order to expand in the U.S. In fact, Reynolds American’s board of directors formed a transaction committee to negotiate with BAT, given the latter’s existing ownership stake and representation on the board of directors.In 2004, U.S.'s RJ Reynolds Tobacco Holdings and British American Tobacco’s Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. merged to create Reynolds American Inc., in which the latter held 42% share.Notably, Reynolds American has been going through a rough phase as evident from its dismal earnings and sales surprise history, along with increasing competition in the vapor category, higher excise tax, declining tobacco volumes and strict anti-smoking regulations.In addition, the company might face margin pressure owing to the pricing power of other major tobacco players in the industry such as Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report) and Altria Group, Inc. (MO  -  Free Report).In fact, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock has gained 3.3% in the last three months, compared with the Zacks categorized Tobacco industry’s advance of 6.2%. Currently, the industry is placed at bottom 32% of the Zacks Classified industries (175 out of 256).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Coming back to the Reynolds American-BAT merger, we believe the combined entity is likely to further strengthen the tobacco industry. It will also benefit from Reynolds American’s strong position in the alternative tobacco and next-generation product development as well as R&D capabilities. Additionally, the new merged entity can develop an innovative pipeline of vapor and tobacco-heating products, going forward.3 Top Picks to Ride the Hottest Tech Trend Zacks just released a Special Report to guide you through a space that has already begun to transform our entire economy...Last year, it was generating $8 billion in global revenues.

1673,PM,"Philip Morris International Inc.(PM  -  Free Report) is the world’s leading tobacco company. However, the company has been witnessing declining demand for cigarettes due to the ongoing anti-tobacco campaigns and government restrictions. In fact, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets to dissuade customers from smoking, which has further pressurized tobacco companies. While the company continues to benefit from its strong portfolio of tobacco brands and have always managed to remain afloat and generate revenues with higher cigarette pricing, Philip Morris is also aggressively investing in creating smoke-free products such as IQOS (Heatsticks that heat tobacco instead of burning it) in order to boost its business and market share. We expect the company’s continued focus on accelerating IQOS volume growth and pricing actions will help it deliver upbeat results in the upcoming quarter as well as in 2017.Earnings Estimate Revision: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 and 2018 have increased by 0.2% and 0.5% in the last thirty days.

1675,PM,"Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 20, before the opening bell.The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this tobacco leader will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. Its earnings have lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average miss of 2.3%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Philip Morris this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen.Philip Morris International Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Philip Morris International Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Philip Morris International Inc QuotePhilip Morris has an Earnings ESP of -1.63% as the Most Accurate estimate is $1.21, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at $1.23. Although the company’s Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP, we need a positive Earnings ESP in order to be confident about an earnings surprise. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Which Way Are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.23 for the second quarter has been stable in the last seven days and reflects growth from $1.15 posted in the prior-year period. However, the same has moved up by a penny to $4.90 for 2017 and also shows growth from $4.48 delivered in 2016.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $7.06 billion and $28.63 billion for the impending quarter and 2017, which are also 6.2% and 7.3% higher than the respective year-ago periods.Factors Influencing the QuarterWe note that Philip Morris has been witnessing declining demand for cigarettes due to the ongoing anti-tobacco campaigns, government restrictions and rising taxes on it. In fact, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets to dissuade customers from smoking. These regulations adversely impact the company’s performance and, in turn, its overall profitability. Moreover, consumers are currently opting for e-cigarettes or substitutes for cigarettes, thereby affecting cigarette volume. Evidently, the company’s top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in five of the trailing six quarters, including the last reported quarter.As smoking rates are declining in developed countries, the race to replace traditional cigarettes is putting pressure on the tobacco industry. Particularly, serious health hazards due to cigarette smoking have pushed consumers toward low-risk, reduced risk products. Therefore, Philip Morris is aggressively investing in creating smoke-free products such as IQOS (Heatsticks that heat tobacco instead of burning it) in order to boost its business and market share. Meanwhile, it continues to benefit from its strong portfolio of tobacco brands and always managed to remain afloat and generate revenues with higher cigarette pricing.We expect the company’s continued focus on accelerating IQOS volume growth and pricing actions will help it deliver upbeat results in the upcoming quarter as well as in 2017.Driven by these factors, shares of Philip Morris have rallied 30.1% year to date, comfortably outperforming the Zacks categorized Tobacco industry’s advance of 18.5%. Meanwhile, the broader Consumer Staples sector gained 9.2%.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.67% and a Zacks Rank #2.

1676,PM,"Consumer confidence – a key determinant of the economy’s health – improved strongly in June, after a dismal show in May. Strong recovery in the housing market and an improving labor market played a crucial role in boosting buyers’ confidence. Encouraging manufacturing index readings issued by the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) also hints at a pickup in GDP, indicating that economy is in good shape currently.The recent hike of its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point by Federal Reserve reiterates the fact that the economy is looking up. Further, the Fed indicated that it anticipates the next hike in December, along with three more in the coming year, which signals rising consumer confidence as well as the economy’s growth.The Consumer Staples sector, which is at the top 31% of the Zacks Sector Rank (5 out of 16), indicates optimism. We note that in the last six months, the sector has registered an increase of 8.04%, higher than the S&P 500 that is up 6.86%.Surging consumer confidence and indications of a stronger economy in the second half of the year make the consumer staples sector attractive. Investing in consumer staples stocks is safer because of their defensive nature. However, risk-averse investors still remain skeptical. Therefore, targeting safer bets for now rather than going for stocks with only high earnings growth potential can prove to be a prudent move.The Winning Strategy: Investment in Dividend Stocks With the U.S. economy looking bright, investors should opt for dividend stocks. Not only do these stocks offer higher income in the current low-rate environment but also provide a cushion against equity market risks. Dividend stocks are historically less volatile and are a safe bet as dividends generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty.Dividend yield assesses the amount of income received in proportion to the share price. Amid the current volatility, it could be a smart strategy to buy stocks that yield good dividends, thus ensuring a steady income.Thus, based on a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy), and dividend yields of more than 3%, we have zeroed in on four stocks that have the potential to ride out the impending volatility.Key PicksPhilip Morris International, Inc. (PM  -  Free Report)Philip Morris, the leading international tobacco company, has been increasing its dividend every year since it began paying dividends in 2008.With a dividend yield of 3.55% and a beta value of 0.94, this Zacks Rank #2 stock is an attractive pick.
