Privacy Policy & Terms of UseEarlier Wednesday, OPEC said it sees global oil demand surpassing 100 million barrels per day for the first time next year, but the group warned that trade tensions could weigh on demand.In its monthly report, OPEC said it expects demand to grow by 1.45 million bpd next year, if current trade disputes are solved quickly.But if trade issues — like those between the U.S. and Canada and the U.S. and China — escalate, they could hit demand.""Hence, if trade tensions rise further, and given other uncertainties, it could weigh on business and consumer sentiment,"" OPEC said. ""This may then start to negatively impact investment, capital flows and consumer spending, with a subsequent negative effect on the global oil market.""The cartel sees production from outside the OPEC rising by 2.1 million bpd next year, led by U.S. shale. But OPEC expects U.S. growth to slow down next year due to take-away constraints in the Permian Basin.Also in the report, Saudi Arabia said its output nearly hit 10.5 million bpd in June up from 10 million bpd in May. But independent sources in the report said the kingdom only produced just over 10.4 million bpd, but that's the highest level since late 2016.Iraq raised its production by 71,500 bpd to about 4.5 million bpd.The increase come after the cartel agreed at its biannual meeting last month to boost output. But not all members were happy with the agreement.Total OPEC production was up by 173,000 bpd last month to 32.3 million bpd.

6,O,"EOG Resources (EOG) weathered a massive oil price drop a few years ago thanks to smart investments across multiple basins, first-mover advantage and loads of data.Now, the shale exploration and production company is one of the top performers in its sector as oil prices rebound.Ninety percent of EOG's production comes from its U.S. shale operations. But EOG has spread its resources throughout the Bakken Shale basin in the north-central U.S. and southern Canada, as well as the Eagle Ford and Permian basins in the Texas and New Mexico area. That diversity has been one key to EOG's success.""They have attractive portions across multiple basins,"" said Brian Youngberg, analyst at Edward Jones. ""Some of the other premier players, like Pioneer Natural (PXD), are more focused geographically. But EOG has a handful of positions they got into early, at a low cost.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseEOG produced the equivalent of 609,000 barrels of oil a day last year on average for a total of 222 million barrels. It has an estimated 2.527 billion barrels of oil equivalent in proved reserves. EOG grew in both categories during 2017 after a downturn the previous two years.The company is part of IBD's Oil & Gas-U. S. Exploration and Production group, which also features top names like Diamondback Energy (FANG) and Parsley Energy (PE). The company has a 95 Composite Rating from IBD. That means it is outperforming 95% of all stocks in key fundamental and technical criteria.A recent IBD Stock of the Day, EOG is building a base on base with a 128.13 buy point.Managing data is key for tech companies in Silicon Valley to take advantage of trends. EOG brought the power of data to the shale fields, earning it the nickname the ""Apple of Oil"" by analysts.Dave Meats, a senior analyst at Morningstar, says EOG's larger size gives it access to more data than smaller players in the space. EOG has access to its own data on previously drilled wells. It also has data on wells drilled by other companies where it has a small stake.EOG used analytical data from thousands of wells. They find everything from the optimal length to drill during each fracking stage, to which rock type is more productive.""The company does have a technical edge,"" Meats said. ""Not so much (in that) it can do things other companies can't, but that it can lead the way in achieving technical benefits before some of its peers.""Last year, EOG said it had developed 20 mobile apps of its own over two years that allow workers to stay connected day and night. It also has collected data from 5,000 horizontal wells in almost every major unconventional play in the U.S.Further, proprietary data is helping the company cut costs. Meats said the company isn't reliant on expensive analytics packages from Schlumberger (SLB) and other service providers.On top of that, data helped EOG take advantage of being one of the first movers into newer, fringe areas in a potential shale play. It analyzed the success and failure of other wells in the area.""They were kind of early on the Eagle Ford and Bakken,"" Youngberg said. ""They just saw things years ago under the leadership they had and were able to build big positions.""With acreage in some of the most prolific basins in the U.S., the company's broad geographic offerings give it the ability to be more flexible with spending if issues arise.""Some companies are very nimble like EOG. They will move capital here or there a little bit if it makes sense to,"" Youngberg said.Companies that shifted their assets to exclusively focus on the Permian now see production backing up, bottlenecked by limited pipeline capacity that likely will remain constrained through 2019. But both Youngberg and Meats don't expect the Permian bottleneck to affect EOG.When times are tough, company management isn't afraid to make the tough call to put the brakes on spending, analysts say.""They pulled back spending more than others did at a time when oil prices fell back,"" Youngberg said. ""They are willing to go defense when they have to, when oil falls, then switch back into offense pretty quickly.""Unlike its peers, EOG reduced production during the downturn three years ago, when other companies tried to keep production flat or grow slightly.Over the past year, Wall Street's appetite for increases in production at all costs has slowed. Now investors are looking for companies to focus on returning cash to shareholders rather than drilling to keep production up.In its first-quarter report, the company reiterated its 2018 oil production growth target of 16%-20%. It also backed its forecast for a full-year exploration-and-development budget of $5.4 billion-$5.8 billion, after raising it by $1 billion the previous quarter.The company plans to increase its dividend growth rate. And it has small overseas operations in Canada, China, the U.K., Trinidad and Tobago. But EOG is unlikely to commit a lot of capital to any mergers or acquisitions. Instead, management is focused on boosting organic operations.EOG's second-quarter earnings are seen soaring 1,400% to $1.20 per share, up from eight cents per share in the year-ago quarter. Revenue is seen rising 45.8% to $3.79 billion.The company isn't immune to all headwinds, however. Meats says he's bearish on long-term oil prices despite current supply constraints out of Libya, Venezuela and Iran currently boosting crude futures.He only expects a supply crunch in the short term and believes oil prices will stay around $55 per barrel in the long term.""EOG is a high-quality company with good asset quality,"" Meats said. ""But I think like every other shale company, the potential for lower oil prices weighs on validation.""Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Energy Stocks And Industry NewsWhy The Next Oil Bonanza Could Be Deep Under Water

9,O,"A barrage of energy-industry news drove oil stocks to the head of the market over the past week, sending oil prices to their best week since April, and their best monthly advance since April 2016.U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate was up more than 8% for the week, trading above $74 a barrel for the first time since November, 2016. Brent crude gained 5%, holding just below the $80 mark.The result sent oil-related industry groups to five of the market's 10 largest gains for the week.

Among domestic producers, EOG Resources (EOG), Concho Resources (CXO) and RSP Permian (RSPP) were among the biggest winners.The June 22 meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries set the stage for the week's price gains.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseMany oil industry analysts had feared the group, along with partner countries led by Russia, would boost production quotas by a million barrels per day or more — a move that could have risked an oil price crash. Instead, OPEC agreed to a nominal 600,000 bpd increase. That wasn't the 500,000 or less that oil traders had hoped for, but it was bullish enough.Oil prices began surging Tuesday, after a U.S. State Department official told reporters that global oil buyers would be required to cut imports from Iran to zero by November. Buyers who failed to respect the rule would face harsh U.S. sanctions. Iran exports more than 2 billion barrels per day to countries including China, India and Turkey.Also on Tuesday, uncertainty increased regarding oil exports out of Libya. New reports said a Libyan militia leader had handed control of some of the country's largest export terminals to a Benghazi-based rival of the state-owned oil company.Oil prices received a data squeeze on Tuesday and Wednesday, as both the American Petroleum Institute and the Energy Information Administration reported draws of more than 9 million barrels on U.S. oil inventories in the week ended June 22. That was nearly double the industry's expectations.The broader energy market received another heads up on Tuesday, as the annual gas report from the Paris-based International Energy Agency said China was poised to become the world's largest importer of natural gas by next year. The report forecast the country's imports of liquefied natural gas would rise 82% by 2023. Global LNG imports over that same period were forecast to increase 29%.Bloomberg followed up with a report that Qatar Petroleum planned to invest $20 billion in U.S. oil and gas projects over the next five years. In addition, Chief Executive Officer Saad Sherida al-Kaabi said the company — the world's largest seller of LNG — planned to invest an additional $5 billion in other related U.S. projects, such as chemicals.On the domestic front, pipeline heavyweight Kinder Morgan (KMI) said its Texas Pipeline subsidiary would partner with Apache (APA) and a unit of Blackstone Energy Partners to develop a $2 billion Permian Highway Pipeline Project. The natural gas pipeline targets the transport of 2 billion cubic feet per day from the Permian Basin to the Texas Gulf Coast.The expanded gas line will boost the production potential for oil producers in the Permian Basin. A build up of natural gas, which is a byproduct of the basin's oil production, can slow oil output if gas storage facilities and take-away capacity reach their limits.The news from the IEA and from Kinder Morgan was mixed for IBD Leaderboard watch list stock Cheniere Energy (LNG).

14,O,"Five of the 17 exchange traded funds in IBD's ETF Leaders screen are oil funds, and the good news for ETF traders is that all five are forming bases.This class of ETF tends to track the price of crude oil, and that commodity has been shaping a good chart as well. Crude futures rose to the highest level since November 2014, closing at $72.76 a barrel on Wednesday. That came after oil production was flat while inventories fell.Energy has become a leading sector, now No. 8 out of 33 sectors, after starting the year at No. 25. Exploration and production industry groups in particular have performed well, and that's the focus.With any commodity ETF, these funds' fortunes depend much on the course of crude prices. Commodity bull and bear markets historically run longer than the cycles in the stock market, but opportunities do emerge in the shorter term.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWhile oil made new highs during the week, the five energy ETFs have not. That gives investors time to study each ETF before it reaches a proper entry point. For all five, the correct buy point is the same: The previous high made in May plus 10 cents.Here's a summary of the five ETFs:SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production (XOP) owns more than 70 stocks in exploration & production (nearly 81% of the portfolio), refining & marketing companies (13%) and integrated operations (5%).The fund is equal weighted, meaning that all holdings have the same allocation each time the portfolio is rebalanced.Vanguard Energy (VDE) holds 143 stocks in the energy spectrum, from exploration to gas stations. But the $5.1 billion fund is heavily concentrated on the largest 10 holdings, which account for 63% of the fund's weighting.Some 38% of the portfolio is in integrated oil companies, a group that includes industry giants such as Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX).Fidelity MSCI Energy (FENY) is similar to the Vanguard fund in that it is heavily weighted on its largest holdings. The top 10 account for 63% of the total weighting. That leaves only a small influence in the rest of the 135 holdings in the ETF.Nearly 83% of the $649.5 million fund is invested in big-cap companies.The iShares U.S. Oil & Gas Exploration & Production (IEO) ETF has more of a focus on the search and extraction part of the oil business. With 67 holdings, the ETF has put 73% of funds in exploration and production companies. More than 23% of the portfolio is in refinery and marketing.The $514.7 million ETF is the only one among the five that does not own heavyweights Exxon Mobil and Chevron.First Trust Energy AlphaDEX (FXN), an ETF that was discussed in last week's column, holds a portfolio of nearly 50 stocks in oilfield services, refinery, production, drilling and related companies.The other four ETFs are predominantly big-cap funds. But a median market cap of $11.9 million gives the First Trust Energy portfolio a smaller average size. The $396 million fund uses a selection methodology that grades stocks on three-, six- and 12-month price performance, one-year sales growth, certain valuation factors, and other items.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:This Sector ETF Tries To Drill Into Oil ReboundActive Asset Allocation Made Easy With IBD ETF Leaders Index

18,O,"BofI Holding (BOFI) won't stop evolving — simply because it can't afford to stand still.XAs online banking booms, BofI's roster of rivals now spans everything from credit unions to other banks. The roster includes stalwarts such as Ally Financial (ALLY) and CIT Group (CIT), as well as the upstart Marcus brand from venerable Wall Street brokerage Goldman Sachs (GS).Analyst Gary Tenner at D.A. Davidson commends BofI's asset strategy. It has grown from ""rate shoppers"" to encompass a diverse mix of spread-income and fee-income businesses.""BofI is always evolving, always eliminating bottlenecks from a process and cost perspective,"" Tenner said. ""This is a company that has very effectively navigated the last several years of growth.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAs an example, San Diego-based BofI decided six years ago to expand from mortgage lending to commercial lending. Other banks had made similar moves after the housing crisis, but BofI quickly shifted. It moved from cash-flow-based loans, which offer little downside credit protection. And it went to real-estate-backed and asset-backed lending, which provide 40% to 50% downside protection.BofI then expanded into equipment financing for construction companies and bridge lending for real estate developers. Commercial and industrial loans jumped from $46 million as of June 2012 to roughly $1.4 billion as of March. That's 17% of BofI's total $8.2 billion loan portfolio. Single-family and multifamily mortgage lending account for a combined 72% of that fast-growing portfolio.""The growth of our (commercial and industrial) lending has enhanced our asset generation capabilities without compromising our pristine credit profile, and has provided another bridge to a more diversified loan portfolio in the years ahead,"" BofI's 2017 annual report said. The company did not respond to an interview request.Tenner highlights BofI's ability to ""pivot"" as one of its strengths. He noted it is in the midst of a rebranding exercise, for which few details are known.BofI Holding roots reach back to Bank of Internet, a pioneer of online consumer banking. It was one of the first banks to ditch brick-and-mortar stores entirely, greatly reducing costs. It's now a full-service financial institution, serving both consumers and businesses. Its BofI Federal Bank holding finances single and multifamily homes. It also targets small to medium businesses.BofI stock sits 4% below a record high of 45.18, pegged on June 11. Shares were off 1.4% to 42.93 in afternoon trades Friday, just below buy range with a 43.60 flat-base entry. They found support at the 50-day moving average last week after longtime partner H&R Block's (HRB) flat-to-lower revenue guidance for 2019 sparked a sell-off.Year to date, the small-cap BofI stock has surged 46% and earns a stellar IBD Composite Rating of 95. By comparison, S&P 500 financials are down 2% so far in 2018, including an 11% loss for Goldman Sachs.In a June 13 note to clients, Tenner described the recent BofI stock sell-off as likely overdone. While BofI offers refund advance loans to H&R Block customers, he does not see ""outsized risk to BofI's tax season revenue"" from the growing trend of do-it-yourself tax preparation. Borrowers repay the interest-free loans — a new product and growth driver for BofI — using their tax refunds.BofI has grown from under $950 million in assets in 2007 to just shy of $10 billion. It's done so by adding distribution channels and making acquisitions such as H&R Block Bank in 2015. It's also launched new businesses and products.Asset quality remains strong, with total nonperforming loans and leases at 0.39% of total assets as of March. But the company significantly jacked up its loan loss provision in the March quarter. The bank says that was due almost entirely to reserves for refund advance loans.In its April quarterly report, BofI posted a 27% jump in earnings to 80 cents a share on strong consumer and commercial loan production. Assets swelled to $9.9 billion as of March, up 15% from a year ago. Net income hit $51.3 million, up 25%, and deposits reached $7.9 billion, up 17%.Analysts on average expect earnings of $2.51 a share for fiscal 2018, ending in June. It's seen ramping up 29% to $3.23 in fiscal 2019, according to Zacks Investment Research. Revenue should grow 13% to $505 million over the same period.Tenner forecasts earnings of $3.20 a share in fiscal 2019, with BofI's growth outpacing like-sized banks. This underpins his buy rating and $50 price target over the next 12 to 18 months.So, too, does the macro outlook for financial companies.""We are in a banking environment that is certainly much more friendly than it has been in the better part of a decade,"" Tenner said in a phone interview with Investor's Business Daily on June 13. On that day, a hawkish Fed raised interest rates and signaled two more hikes this year, citing inflation. For banks such as BofI, rising rates accompanied by economic growth are good news. As interest rates rise, so does the spread between long-term and short-term rates. That boosts profits on both cash holdings and loans to customers.In fact, BofI's net interest margin expanded to 4.77% in the March 2018 quarter vs. 4.24% a year ago, on the back of refund advance loan growth.Still, the road ahead could be bumpy for BofI stock.""Deposit gathering is probably their biggest challenge,"" said Scott Valentin, managing director at Compass Point. Valentin noted the number of online rivals has ""dramatically"" increased.As it fends off intense competition, the company continues to invest heavily in product development, hiring talent and branding, analysts say.While Ally Bank and CIT Bank pose a threat, Goldman Sachs' Marcus is undergoing rapid growth that mimics BofI. Marcus an online banking platform racked up more than $3 billion in loans and $22 billion in deposits since its October 2016 launch. But it's consumer-focused, for now.Meanwhile, websites such as Bankrate.com have made rate comparison shopping easier than ever. With interest rates ticking up, Valentin is watching how BofI will offset the rising cost of deposits.""BofI will continue to be an asset growth story, I'm confident about that,"" he told IBD. ""The bigger question is the margin story, the cost-of-funds side in a rising-rate environment."" For now, based on soaring BofI stock, investors may be focused on the loan growth story. BofI is growing loans in the ""low-to-mid-teens"" rate, while the industry average is in the low single digits, according to Valentin.BofI stock posted only one down week as the market corrected in February. More recently, it has continued to hold up, while JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and the nation's biggest banks struggled amid rate-hike uncertainties.However, D.A. Davidson's Tenner ties some of BofI's rally to short covering, saying negative blog coverage made it a ""heavily shorted"" stock. Short-sellers try to profit from a decline in a company's shares.BofI faces a number of whistleblower and shareholder lawsuits, contending Bank of Internet engaged in wrongdoing as it grew at breakneck pace. In a 2015 interview with the New York Times, Chief Executive Gregory Garrabrants called the allegations groundless.The shareholder lawsuit suffered a setback in May. The company heads back to court a year from now in the original whistleblower case, according to a recent update from the law firm Proskauer Rose.Meanwhile, Valentin downgraded BofI stock to neutral in May.He called that primarily a valuation call, saying the discount at which BofI trades vs. high-growth peers had narrowed.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:PayPal Buddies Up To Visa, Mastercard — And New Accounts Roll InBest HSA Providers By Fees, Features And Investment OptionsHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For Beginners

20,O,"HOUSTON — ConocoPhillips (COP) CEO Ryan Lance said the company took a measured approach in the Eagle Ford shale formation and will keep the same mindset with its Permian Basin assets.X The prolific Permian Basin has seen a swell of rigs in the past two years, jumping from 156 to 434, according to Baker Hughes (BHGE) data.But with technology constantly improving, Conoco is moving more deliberately with its Permian assets, just as it did in the Eagle Ford play.""We took a different path with the Eagle Ford: We didn't drill out brains out like some of our competitors did,"" Lance said at the CERAWeek 2018 energy conference Tuesday.Instead, Conoco waited for technology and infrastructure to catch up in the Eagle Ford to make its holdings more productive and profitable. Lance said the company is doing the same in the Permian Basin.""In two years, we'll figure out a better way to drill the Permian than we are drilling now,"" he said.Lance also sees future oilfield improvements coming mostly from the completion side, as opposed to the drilling side, as companies figure out how to improve finishing techniques with longer lateral wells.Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

Two of the three major indexes cleared key levels of resistance, and the Nasdaq shook off a distribution day. Monday's action will provide a test of how durable those gains — and the market's upgraded status — might be.Merck advanced 1.2% to lead the Dow in opening trade. The New Jersey-based drugmaker last week announced it would invest up to $5.8 billion to jointly develop, with Japan's Eisai, the Lenvima-Ketruda combination cancer treatment which, in January, earned the Food and Drug Administration's 'breakthrough' designation as a kidney cancer treatment.Intel posted one of the Dow's few early losses, down 2.6% after reports on Friday that the company was considering a takeover bid for Broadcom, as a means to upend Broadcom's effort to merge with Qualcomm.  Broadcom opened more than 3% higher.

23,O,"Energy ministers from around the world and executives from Schlumberger (SLB), BP (BP), Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and others will be attending CERAWeek by IHS Markit in Houston March 5 to 9.X The industry's top players face a changing landscape, with the U.S. poised to become the world's top oil producer, perhaps as soon as this year, electric vehicle technology threatening demand, and OPEC looking to wind down its effort to prop up crude prices.Here are five things to watch:Last year, OPEC and non-OPEC members like Russia agreed to extend their production deal to remove 1.8 million barrels per day from the global markets until the end of 2018.Compliance with the deal is at record highs, but Russia has been pushing for an exit strategy from the agreement likely to be decided at the next OPEC meeting this summer.Still, analysts believe that a longer-term deal could be in the works for the two to keep a hold of a majority of the oil market in the face of rising U.S. production.While U.S. shale producers and OPEC are largely seen as rivals on global energy markets, OPEC is looking at forging relationships in the U.S., with OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo scheduled to speak Monday at a dinner Monday night with top shale executives, as he did last year.The role of the shale sector on the world stage is also in question. While Saudi Arabia has stepped back from its traditional role as swing producer, it's not clear that shale can step in to take over.U.S. producers face their own limitations, said Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group, such as an inability to work collectively, steep output decline rates of shale wells, and labor shortages.Some U.S. firms recently have taken a measured tone on future drilling activity. EOG Resources (EOG) said that it will take drilling slowly, and Diamondback Energy (FANG) said it wasn't a ""drill, baby, drill"" company, while Parsley Energy (PE) said it was expecting a ""steady activity pace.""The industry is divided about future oil supplies and demand. BP projected a drop in oil demand by 2040, but its U.S. rival Exxon Mobil (XOM) and OPEC don't agree, Flynn said.""It's going to be interesting to see all these energy minds and find out where they come in on which side of the equation. This is the biggest question facing the oil in some time.""Flynn said BP is making assumptions that there will be some breakthroughs in electric car battery technology, infrastructure and other improvements.

The third trend is determining which of the 10 industry groups in the oil space are doing best.So, what is the current situation on those three scores?Item 1: The price of oil hit a short-term closing low Feb. 13. Since then, light sweet crude is up 16%.Item 2: For the past couple of weeks, the oil stock sector held gains of 4% to 5% year to date, easily topping the S&P 500's roughly 2% decline.Item 3: Since the Feb. 13 low, the best performers in the oil space are international explorers, up 14%; field services, up 14%; drillers, up 14%; and U.S. explorers, up 13%. (The worst performer is the pipeline group, down 9%.)Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe third item is especially important. An investor can be right about the oil sector but if wrong about the oil groups, losses are likely.Three oil stocks appeared recently in the Big Cap 20, and they are from the strong groups. EOG Resources (EOG) and Continental Resources (CLR) are U.S. explorers. ConocoPhillips (COP) is an international explorer.EOG is a turnaround story. The company lost $1.61 per share in 2016 but delivered a profit of $1.12 per share in 2017. The Street estimates earnings will grow 309% to $4.58 per share this year.Houston-based EOG's relative strength line is rising and near a 52-week high. The RS line measures a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500. A rising line points to outperformance.EOG's stock chart is interesting. The stock spent most of 2017 constructing a cup-with-handle base. The base was 44 weeks long.The breakout came in late October, when the stock crossed above a 98.47 buy point. The stock rose almost 10%.Then a second consolidation formed. The decline wiped out all gains from the entry, which triggered a round-trip sell signal. A breakout Dec. 26 led to another 10% gain.EOG is now approaching a 119.10 buy point in somewhat odd cup pattern. The left side of the pattern was built in two weeks — weekly losses of 4% and 11%.What was the two-week drop about? Apparently oil prices, which fell 11% in the same period. The general market was going through a contraction as well. The latest base is more choppy than earlier patterns, so it's as well constructed.Continental Resources (CLR) cleared a 58.99 buy point in April and is now too extended to buy.ConocoPhillips (COP) also broke out in April. The stock is extended from a 61.41 buy point.RELATED:The Secret To Investing? It's Just Hard WorkCrude Stocks That Beat ViewsSix Stocks That Broke Out Recently

28,O,"EOG Resources (EOG) said Wednesday that it will take drilling slowly, even as the shale producer plans to boost capital spending by $1 billion this year with oil prices on the rebound.X During its fourth-quarter conference call, Chief Operating Officer Billy Helms said the company wouldn't go into ""manufacturing mode"" and have its drilling activity outpace its technical learning curve.""You could be setting yourself up into drilling a large amount of wells in the wrong way,"" he cautioned.The measured tone also comes despite EOG seeing lower costs for oilfield services as well as continued efficiencies being squeezed out of wells. EOG is nicknamed the ""Apple (AAPL) of oil"" by analysts for its technical innovation in drilling and completion techniques.Earlier this month, Diamondback Energy (FANG) said it wasn't a ""drill, baby, drill"" company and wanted to ""maintain flexibility and accelerate activity as commodity prices and service costs allow."" And Parsley Energy (PE) said it was expecting a ""steady activity pace.""EOG shares sank 5.2% to 101.42 on the stock market today. Diamondback fell 1.2%, and Parsley lost 2.6%.Ezra Yacob, VP of exploration and production, said there is a balancing act to make drilling pad areas large enough to ""take advance of operating efficiencies and cost savings"" but not too large that EOG ""can't incorporate our learnings into the next well we drill.""He added that EOG is still in the early stages of testing spaces and staggering wells in the Permian Basin as the right technique is dependent on the area and oil target.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersLate Tuesday, EOG blew away fourth-quarter estimates and raised its dividend. It also sees 2018 capital expenditures of $5.4 billion to $5.8 billion, up from $4.61 billion in 2017.The company said it expects to grow total crude oil volumes by 18% in 2018 and cover capital investment and dividend payments within discretionary cash flow, even with oil prices below $50 a barrel. At $60 oil, it expects to generate ""significant free cash flow.""During the call Wednesday, CEO William Thomas said EOG has ""robust exploration underway"" this year with ""more capital allocated to this process than in recent years.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Energy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, Coal

30,O,"Oil stock plays sank along with crude futures in the stock market today as energy ministers from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Russia discuss options to boost production.OPEC and its partners began curbing production by 1.8 million barrels per day in 2016 to help ease a global supply glut. Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies reportedly wish to increase output by 300,000 bpd, while Russia is eyeing a hike of 800,000 bpd.West Texas intermediate crude plunged nearly 4% to $68.06 a barrel, after hitting $70 earlier this month for the first time since November.

33,O,"General Electric (GE) called its restructuring complete and said planned moves will ""likely"" lower the dividend, with analysts estimating that the payout could be cut sharply again.XCEO John Flannery on Tuesday announced the results of a yearlong strategic review, saying it will spin off its core health business within 12-18 months, fully separate Baker Hughes (BHGE), and narrow its focus to aviation, power and renewable energy, among the most salient portfolio changes.Flannery had said earlier that separating the aviation and power businesses were possibilities too. But management on Tuesday described aviation, power and renewable energy as ""three highly complementary businesses"" poised for future growth.On an issue that matters greatly to income-oriented retail investors, the industrial giant said it will maintain its dividend until the health care unit is established as an independent entity.At that time, GE Healthcare's dividend policy will be decided by its new board of directors and is expected to be in line with health care peers, while GE's board will adjust the GE dividend and expects it to be in line with industrial peers.Later Tuesday morning, on the company's investor call, Flannery clarified: ""Given the typically lower payout ratios in the health care industry, this will likely lead to a reduction in the aggregate GE dividend at that time.""Flannery added that the restructuring was ""finished,"" bringing to an end the complex process he oversaw after being named chief executive just over a year ago.CFRA analysts noted the health care and Baker Hughes separations, together with previously announced divestitures, would bring GE to its goal of $20 billion in asset sales.""The asset sales and greater industrial focus will help GE achieve a net debt-to-EBITDA target of less than 2.5X and to reduce debt by $25 billion by 2020,"" CFRA added.Shares sprang up 7.8% to 13.74 Tuesday in their first day as a nonmember of the Dow Jones industrial average. Baker Hughes rose 2.1% to 33.13. On Wednesday, GE shares rose again and climbed above the 50-day moving average.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut JPMorgan analyst Steve Tusa noted that separating the health care and oil-and-gas businesses is likely to send earnings and free cash flow much lower, meaning they won't be enough to support the current dividend payout of 48 cents.He warned of a significant cut.""We point out that the standing dividend payout for GE is 75% on Industrial FCF (100+% including outflows for ""other investing activities""), which compares to ~50% for Philips Healthcare and Siemens (SIEGY) Healthineers and a ~40% median for Industrial peers, implying a future payout ratio in the 40%-50% range — translation, the dividend will likely be cut materially,"" Tusa wrote.Last November, the company sliced its dividend in half. That sparked a sharp plunge in the stock, contributing to its ouster from the Dow Jones industrial average after Monday's close.Other analysts also said the restructuring plan was what they expected, while noting that it will be dilutive to earnings per share and free cash flow.""Further, the proposed separation of Healthcare would remove one of the most stable earnings streams of GE's portfolio, although this would be somewhat offset by the separation of O&G (oil-and-gas) levered BHGE,"" Goldman Sachs' Joe Ritchie wrote in a Tuesday note.UBS' Steven Winoker saw as a positive GE's efforts at ""getting to a forward vision."" He deemed negative an additional $3 billion capital contribution to GE Capital.""No doubt this is all dilutive when said and done,"" Winoker concluded.And Melius Research's Scott Davis called GE's strategic plan logical, although it fell short of the full breakup he had argued for.Health care, he noted, was a solid asset and ""one with the least amount of synergies with the rest of GE."" Meanwhile, the aviation and power businesses ""share engine technology synergies,"" with the former boasting growth while the latter has a path to recovery.Edward Jones' Jeff Windau called the restructuring efforts warranted but argued there is now uncertainty about direction with the spinoffs.""It is unclear what would happen to the Capital business and how liabilities, such as pensions, would be distributed,"" he wrote. ""Overall, we believe this could result in fluctuations in GE's stock price as the market waits for clarity.""On Tuesday, S&P Global Ratings revised the outlook for GE's credit rating to negative, matching outlooks from Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings.GE's target net leverage is still high and well below where its peers are currently, Tusa said.Commentary from Moody's is ""leaning cautious, highlighting that they do not view (the health care IPO) as a silver bullet when it comes to fixing the liability side of the house,"" he added.GE expects to generate cash from disposing of its 20% interest in the health business and to distribute the remaining 80% to shareholders through a tax-free distribution.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:GE Uses Last Day On Dow Jones Industrial Average To Shrink FurtherIf General Electric Breaks Up, Should You Break Up With GE's Stock?The Big Picture: Trump Bull Gets Bloody Nose; Eye This Sell Signal

Top retail stock Best Buy (BBY) is approaching a potential buy point in the stock market today.Earnings season remains in full swing, so investors should be vigilant about potential earnings results. Earnings releases usually result in volatile price changes, so ensure you have a decent profit cushion — at least 5% to 10% or more — to withstand any downside moves. Meanwhile, better-than-expected results can lead to breakaway gaps.Best Buy saw double-digit top-line growth in the most recent quarter — at 14% — for the first time in years. Meanwhile, year-over-year quarterly earnings growth is averaging 25% over the last three quarters. The next earnings report isn't due until late May, allowing investors time to build a position ahead of the volatile announcement — should the stock break out.Shares are less than 1% away from the conventional 78.69 buy point.

49,O,"""Back To The Future"" foresaw an era of video phone calls and personal drones. Now another prediction from the movie series could soon become part of daily life: smart clothing that can self-adjust to its wearer's needs.While an auto-drying jacket like Marty McFly's is some way off, smart clothes are already here. They can heat up, cool down, change color or even size themselves. In fact, the U.S. team at the Winter Olympics in South Korea wore self-heating jackets made by Ralph Lauren (RL).Companies ranging from Nike (NKE) and Under Armour (UAA) to Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) are developing smart clothing technology. As apparel makers hunt for tech know-how and tech nerds look for some fashion sense, the clothing trend is stitching together unlikely partners — and could reshape the apparel industry.A partnership between Alphabet's Google and Levi Strauss could be a sign of things to come. They have brought to market the $350 Commuter X, a denim jacket that lets the user control a phone through the use of gestures alone.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe coming years will see a variety of ""really wacky partnerships"" between fashion companies and tech specialists, said International Data Corp. analyst Ramon Llamas.""The first time you saw Google and Levi's you probably said to yourself, 'How did this happen?' "" he said in an interview. ""But over time it came to make sense and was a natural fit.""In addition to self-adjusting clothes, smart clothing includes internet-connected clothing. Juniper Research estimated last month that connected clothing is the fastest-growing segment of the wearable technology sector.For now, smartwatches like the Apple (AAPL) watch and activity trackers like the Fitbit (FIT) dominate the overall wearables market. Juniper sees shipments of those devices hitting 137 million this year, with compound annual growth over the next two years projected at 31% for smartwatches and 6% for activity trackers.Meanwhile, Juniper sees 102% compound annual growth in connected clothing, estimating it will be a $1 billion industry in 2020 with 7 million shipments. Just two years later, they will more than quadruple to 30 million shipments.Smart clothes also differ from today's wearables in that they will have longer ranges and more accuracy. They also won't be limited to a small touch point at the wrist.Developers are trying to keep smart clothes practical too. Google and Levi's Commuter X jacket is machine washable and can go in a tumble dryer. But a ""snap tag"" that contains tiny electronics and a battery must first come off.Google is developing a system that weaves technology into the very fabric of clothing as part of its Project Jacquard. Project leader Ivan Poupyrev says Google isn't planning to make its own apparel and instead aims to ""empower existing apparel makers.""Loup Ventures managing partner Doug Clinton believes successful synergies between tech and apparel companies will be a key to success. That will help the smart clothes market be worth several billion dollars in the next few years, he estimates.""I think we are going to see a lot of partnerships like that, and that's what is going to push the market forward,"" he said. ""This combination of design and technology is a really important part of the story.""Perhaps the most famous example of self-adjusting smart clothing on the market is Nike's HyperAdapt shoes, which boast ""Back To The Future""-inspired self-tying laces. Stars such as tennis champion Serena Williams and soccer icon Cristiano Ronaldo promoted the first edition. Initially priced at $720, the highly coveted shoes are being sold on the secondhand market for more than $2,000 per pair.A second version is in the works that will offer upgraded technology at more accessible prices. Nike's vice president for design and special projects, Tinker Hatfield, says the HyperAdapt 2.0 will be a performance basketball sneaker.""We don't really know when it's going to hit the market or be in the NBA, but it will be there for sure,"" he said last September.Microsoft has also explored the technological applications. Researchers previously unveiled a prototype smart scarf that users can heat up using a smartphone app.South Korean electronics giant Samsung has a myriad of offerings, including a golf shirt that can warn wearers of the weather conditions and a solar-powered bag that can charge cellphones.Meanwhile, Under Armour has brought to market shoes that track a runner's data through GPS. Shoes from the Under Armour Hovr line start at $110 and go as high as $140. The company also sells ""athletic recovery sleepwear,"" pajamas that beam infrared radiation onto the wearer's body to boost recovery.And Ralph Lauren looks to use the Winter Olympics publicity as a springboard to launch new smart clothes with smaller battery packs and controls linked to a mobile app. They could arrive on the market as early as this winter.If Ralph Lauren's self-heating jacket is any indication, the new offerings will feature crisscrossing partnerships. The Olympic jacket's conductive ink came from DowDuPont (DWDP). Precision printing company Butler Technologies applied the ink. Apparel maker 99Degrees attached the heating system to the lining. Design and engineering firm Key Tech made the battery pack. Principled Design's ConnexI/O e-textile connector interface linked the battery to the jacket. And Better Team USA made the jackets.That approach can be seen in New York-based Loomia, which started four years ago and makes flexible circuitry that can emit heat and/or light, as well as sense and track data.It has worked with companies such as Google, Singapore-based circuit maker Flex (FLEX), British retailer TopShop and apparel maker VF Corp. A key part of Loomia's business plan is that it is not manufacturing individual pieces of clothing. Instead, it is providing products to commercial partners, such as apparel makers, on a mass scale.Designer Julianna Bass collaborated with Loomia to develop a color-changing textile used in two dresses for her Spring/Summer18 collection. They were showcased on the catwalk at New York Fashion Week.Loomia has also solved one of the great challenges for the technology: creating e-textiles that are machine washable. While the details are secret intellectual property, Loomia's breakthrough comes from the way its textile circuitry is patterned and the fact the fabric itself is a circuit. The custom insulation adds further protection.Over the next year, heated jackets and boots with Loomia's technology will be coming to market. The materials are also seen as being useful for furniture.""There was a three-year process finding the core technology in our lab, finding domestic partners who would be willing to try these processes to scale in the production of these textile circuits, and working through growing pains with our suppliers and manufacturers,"" Loomia CEO Janett Liriano said. ""Now we're at the point where we are getting to market and selling these textile circuits B2B (business-to-business) to brands to integrate into their products.""For mass adoption to occur, consumers will have to overcome a few anxieties. For one, battery-powered clothes, like phones, will carry the risk of exploding. But given the ubiquity of smartphones, wearables, and other personal gadgets, consumers have shown they can live with that risk.Also, smart clothing will not be cheap. Ralph Lauren's self-heating jackets first went on sale for $2,500 and were later auctioned on eBay for $6,000. But consider that wildly successful Canada Goose (GOOS) sells parkas that aren't self-adjusting or laced with circuitry for $1,000.Google's Poupyrev believes smart clothing technology trends make ""ubiquitous connectivity"" an attractive feature for consumers, who might see connected clothing as a practical investment. And Loup's Clinton thinks that a decade from now smart apparel products will be ""almost the standard.""""Over the next few years it will be more experimental, getting consumers comfortable with the idea of having smart apparel,"" Clinton said. ""There's always a bridge where you have to integrate the consumer into the new world. But I think once people see the benefits of the clothes, the demand for them will be pretty significant.""A spokeswoman for Julianna Bass said their color-changing clothes were well received at New York Fashion Week. Demand is expected to grow going forward.""Color-changing offers the ability to extend the life of a garment and allows more flexible identifications,"" said Carolyn Thomas, a spokeswoman for the fashion house.But even before smart clothes catch on with consumers, the path to mass adoption may begin with industry.In the next five years, sectors like health care, pro sports, the military and emergency services like firefighting will adopt intelligent clothes, predicts scientist Pekka Tuomaala. He leads the Smart Clothes 2.0 project at the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. The scientist adds that companies have signaled particular interest in self-heating features.""We human beings tend to be lazy,"" he said. ""If our clothing would be able to help us we would most likely use such products and services.""IDC's Llamas also sees heavy industry putting connected clothes to use. For example, supervisors will be able to track the heart rate of workers and know if a break is necessary.The military is another obvious candidate for such technology. British defense giant BAE Systems has developed an alternative use for e-textiles. Its Broadsword Spine is a power and data network built into clothes using conductive fabrics instead of wires and cables.The technology allows electronic devices to be plugged straight into a vest, jacket or belt. Custom-built connectors hook directly into power and data sources via a USB port. It saves an estimated 40% of weight, a major benefit for infantrymen already loaded down with gear.Circling back to the world of Marty McFly and Doc Brown, Clinton believes the future is bright for smart clothes. He says future inventors will use both the science and the fiction of the past to inspire smart clothing designs.""I think a lot of our movies in the past got the future pretty right. Even with 'Back To The Future,' Nike released self-tying sneakers so that became a reality,"" Clinton said. ""In lots of ways fiction and entertainment inspire entrepreneurs to create the products they think are really cool when they see movies as kids.""As the next generation thinks about what they can build on top of these products, innovation will just compound.""YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Amazon Vs.

54,O,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) must find ways to reduce the Pentagon's current $1.1 trillion estimate to own and operate the F-35 jet, the world's costliest weapons program, according to the Defense Department's latest annual program overview.XAccording to the document obtained by Bloomberg News, Lockheed ""must embrace much-needed supply chain management affordability initiatives"" to cut costs on the next-generation stealth fighter.The $1.1 trillion estimate to sustain the U.S. F-35 fleet through 2077 was compiled in 2015 by the Pentagon's independent cost assessment office but has not been updated, according to the Selected Acquisition Report, or SAR, obtained by Bloomberg News. The Pentagon said this week that the estimate will be updated next year before acquisition officials meet to decide whether the program should enter full-production.Although the estimate is unchanged, the acquisition report focused at length on the importance of reducing the $1.1 trillion figure as well comments from the F-35 program office pointing out what it said are shortcomings of the independent estimate.The report acknowledges that under current forecasts, ""the projected F-35 sustainment outlays are too costly"" and ""given planned fleet growth, future U.S. service operations and support budgets will be strained.""

55,O,"Home Depot (HD) beat fourth-quarter forecasts Tuesday, and management predicted recent tax cuts will fuel continued growth in the housing sector even as mortgage rates climb.X  The home improvement retailer's adjusted earnings per share advanced 17% to $1.69 as sales climbed 7.5% to $23.88 billion. Wall Street had expected EPS of $1.62 on revenue of $23.67 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research. Same-store sales were up 7.5% overall, with U.S. comps up 7.2%. Analysts saw a 6.5% gain overall and a 6.2% U.S. bump, according to Consensus Metrix.Home Depot's management was confident the housing sector will not be adversely affected going forward by interest rate rises or the reduction in the home interest rate deduction cap, which they said only impacts around 5% of homes. New York and California will be impacted more, however.""Eighty percent of US households have more money due to tax reform and the increase to the standard deduction,"" CFO Carol Tome said on a conference call. ""Corporations are taking cash and investing in people. Those two things offset any negatives.""She also said the firm believes interest rates would have to advance to 7% to adversely affect growth, while they currently sit at 4.2% for a 30-year mortgage. High-end estimates see this increasing to 4.6%. Tome also said the affordability index is still ""very good"" at 155%.Home Depot expects to earn $9.31 this fiscal year with sales growth of 6.5% and comps up 5%. The firm also raised its quarterly dividend by 16% to $1.03 a share, while projecting a share buyback scheme of $4 billion, though this may change as the year progresses. The firm has typically exceeded initial buyback projections by a wide margin in the past.Shares of the Dow Jones industrial average component dipped 0.1% to 186.71 after hitting 191.44 intraday on the stock market today. Home Depot had been making steady gains since coming out of a flat base last September. However it crashed through its 50-day moving average on Feb. 2 and has been struggling to regain momentum.Rival Lowe's (LOW) fell 0.7%. Lowe's, which will report fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 28, has been finding support at its 50-day moving average.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Home Depot executives were also pleased with performance in the Pro segment, which serves contractors, painters and electricians, and predicted continued growth as homeowners take on bigger projects due to the feel-good factor over rising house prices. Pro growth actually outperformed the DIY segment.The cold winter is expected to lead to strong spring sales as customers look to replenish their gardens, while extra sales due to the 2017 hurricanes are expected to add revenue for the first half of the year.Management said Home Depot's effective tax rate is now approximately 26%, and that it expects to invest $2.5 billion into the business to support strategic initiatives. Over the next three years it expects to nearly double its investment into the business.Tome said the company will be using its extra cash to pull forward investments, which will be  focused on personnel in the short term. She added that systems-based investments take more time to plan and implement. In addition, Home Depot will be opening three new stores in 2018.Management, however, did not address earlier reports that said Home Depot was considering acquiring XPO Logistics (XPO), a logistics services company, due in part to concern that Amazon (AMZN) will push further into home improvement supplies.Analysts were bullish on Home Depot after its results. Oppenheimer's Brian Nagel expects the stock to outperform the S&P 500 over the next 12 to 18 months.""We look favorably upon prospects for Home Depot and its shares. The company is managing its operations well. CEO Craig Menear and his team remain committed to stringent cost controls and cash discipline,"" he said in a research note. ""We view HD as well positioned to capitalize upon improving demand trends in the home improvement sector and over time to surprise investors with solid and persistent comp and EPS upside.""RBC Capital Markets analyst Scot Ciccarelli expects Home Depot to outpace its forecasts and sees its accelerated investments helping the company to gain market share.And CFRA analyst Victor Ahluwalia raised the stock's status to buy from hold following the results, raising the price target by $38 to $209.""We see HD benefiting from additional home price appreciation and greater consumer demand in 2018, amid gains from tax reform,"" Ahluwalia said in a research note.While investors need to watch housing metrics closely, he believes the home improvement industry should remain strong.Recent data have indicated demand is being helped by millennials finally shifting to homeownership and away from rentals, while confidence among builders remains high. Housing starts also surged in January with permits hitting the highest level since 2007.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Walmart Holiday Earnings Miss, Sales Top Amid Fight With AmazonHome Depot Follows BofA, Mastercard In Announcing Share BuybacksHomebuilder Stocks To Watch And Housing Market NewsBullish Chart Patterns II: How To Find The Exact Buy Point

58,O,"An ax can be either a useful tool or a dangerous weapon. In stock charts, the 50-day moving average has a similar dual nature.XThe 50-day moving average takes a stock's prior 50 daily price closes and averages them. Do this every day in an upward-trending stock, and you'll get a line on a chart that runs below the stock's price bars while smoothing out the jumps and buckles.The line serves a startling number of uses. When a stock is basing, a cup base with more than half its bulk above rather than below the line is a sign of health. Another sign of a stock's strength: a flat base that finds ""support"" at its 50-day line.What is support? Institutional investors often use the 50-day or 10-week line as a reference point, stepping in to add shares to their positions when a stock pulls back to the moving average. This buying creates upward pressure — or price support — to help keep the stock's prices above that moving average.This is why rising stocks often rebound from their 50-day lines, turning brief pullbacks into follow-on buying opportunities. It is also why 50-day and 10-week moving averages tend to cradle advances that can run across many months.On the dangerous side, a rallying stock that collapses below 50-day support in heavy volume is often sending a sell signal. Once below that line, institutional investors may use the 50-day line to mark a sell level. Short sellers may use the line as a level at which to sell shares short.These forces create a level of resistance. Stocks often need a large boost of buying power to muscle back above their 50-day lines after losing that level of support.There are other, similar moving averages. Most common is the 10-week moving average. This line tracks a stock's weekly closes over the prior 10 weeks. It generally tracks fairly close to the 50-day line. So if you are reading a daily chart, use the 50-day line. If you're analyzing a weekly chart, use the 10-week.There is a similar relationship between the long-term 200-day and 40-week averages. On a daily chart, use the 200-day. On a weekly chart, it's the 40-week line. In an uptrending stock, the 200-day and 40-week averages will generally track well below the 50-day and 10-week lines, respectively.When a stock consolidates its gains for an extended period, the 50-day or 10-week line will sometimes cross and pass below the longer-term averages.O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) broke out of a nine-week flat base at 94.98 in the week ended Feb. 8, 2013. The base formed near or above its 10-week moving average.The auto parts chain climbed 64% through February 2014. It ran up neatly and followed the rules of 10-week line etiquette.The stock found support near or at the line (1) twice within several months of the breakout, offering entry points for holders to buy more shares.O'Reilly slipped below the line in light trade in September 2014, but it was not a sell signal. The rally continued through the fall of 2015. In early 2017, the stock began a deep correction, resetting the base count.(Editor's Note: This column originally ran in the May 15, 2015, edition of IBD.)RELATED:How To Invest: Nuggets Of Wall Street Wisdom From Legendary Trader Gerald LoebThe Basics: How To Study The Market Each DayThe Basics: Don't Buy Before The Breakout; Wait For A Base To CompleteHow To Invest In Stocks: How Does The Base Count Reset?Stocks Near A Buy Zone

60,O,"U.S. crude hit its highest mark since June 2015 on Tuesday, fueling oil stocks again. EOG Resources (EOG) broke out into buy range, while BP (BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) looked to retake buy points.X U.S. crude closed up 2.6% to $59.97 per barrel, briefly hitting $60 intraday. Brent gained 2.7% to $67.02 a barrel, getting a lift on a Reuters report that an explosion in Libya took out a pipeline that feeds into the Es Sider port, losing about 90,000 barrel per day.EOG Resources broke out of a 108.95 entry point as shares climbed 2.15% to 109.41 on the stock market today, hitting a three-year high.  Volume was well below normal. Investors should look for breakouts to be in volume that's at least 40% above average. Overall market trading is far below average in the holiday-shortened week between Christmas and New Year's Day.Another concern: EOG's relative strength line has been lagging for the past year.

63,O,"Subsidies: Amazon's stock price took a hit after news that President Trump wants to ""take on"" the company for a host of alleged abuses. Most of Trump's complaints are misguided or plain wrong. Except for the part where he says that taxpayers are subsidizing Amazon's shipping costs.The news site Axios — founded by establishment journalists Mike Allen and Jim VandeHei — reported last Wednesday that Trump is ""obsessed with Amazon (AMZN)"" and has ""wondered if there may be any way to go after Amazon with antitrust or competition law.""Trump, the story says, complains that the company ""is killing shopping malls and brick-and-mortar retailers,"" which is no doubt upsetting to someone who made a fortune in the building trade.""He's an old-school businessman who sees the world in terms of tangible assets: real estate, physical mail delivery, Main Street, grocery stores,"" Axios reports.The story had an immediate impact on Amazon's stock price, which at one point was down more than 7%.Given the unreliability of the mainstream press to cover Trump accurately, it's not unreasonable to question whether Axios has this story right.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut the White House didn't exactly challenge the article, saying only that the Trump administration doesn't have any specific policy changes in mind right now.And Trump has regularly put Amazon in his cross hairs.During the Republican primaries in early 2016, Trump complained that ""Amazon is getting away with murder tax-wise"" and that CEO Jeff Bezos has ""huge antitrust problem because he's controlling so much.""Last June, Trump complained again that it is ""not paying internet taxes (which they should).""In August, he said that the company ""is doing great damage to tax paying retailers. Towns, cities and states throughout the U.S. are being hurt — many jobs being lost!""And in December he tweeted: ""Why is the United States Post Office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer? Should be charging MUCH MORE!""O Saturday, Trump was at it again, taking to Twitter to restate these complaints and say ""This Post Office scam must stop. Amazon must pay real costs (and taxes) now!""Let's take these complaints in order.First, Trump is simply wrong to say that Amazon isn't paying ""internet taxes."" When he sent that tweet out last year, Amazon was collecting and remitting state sales taxes for every state that imposes them, even though federal law only requires companies to collect sales taxes in states where they have a physical presence.The second claim — that many jobs are being lost because Amazon is hurting brick and mortar retail outlets — is both wrong and misguided.There are 2.4 million more people working in the retail industry today than when Bezos founded the company in his garage 24 years ago. And the overall jobless rate, which was 6.1% in July 1994, is now down to 4.1%.There's no question that Amazon is disrupting the retail business. Just look at the recent announcement that Toys 'R' Us was closing all its stores. This is just the latest in an ever-growing list of traditional retailers who are struggling.But this isn't a bad thing. It is precisely what should happen in a free-market economy. Newer, better, more efficient ways of doing business are constantly supplanting old ways. It's what economist Joseph Schumpeter aptly called the ""gale of creative destruction.""The internet would be disrupting traditional business, with or without Bezos. Complaining about it is like saying that Apple was doing ""great damage"" in the early 1980s by hurting IBM's mainframe business, or that Henry Ford should be attacked for putting buggy makers out of business.The pace of change can be unsettling, but it's far better than the alternative — which would be a stagnant economy.Trump does have a point, however, about the Postal Service, which is unfairly subsidizing Amazon's deliveries.The reason stems from a congressional mandate that the Postal Service allocate 5.5% of its fixed costs to package delivery. This was supposed to prevent the government-run USPS from unfairly competing with private sector delivery companies like UPS and FedEx. But it backfired.Today, more than 25% of the Postal Service's revenue is package delivery. That means the USPS can effectively shift much of the cost of its package delivery onto its first-class mail service.An analysis by Citigroup last year found that, as a result, Amazon is getting a subsidy of $1.46 for every package the USPS delivers on its behalf.""It is as if every Amazon box comes with a dollar or two stapled to the packing slip — a gift card from Uncle Sam,"" explained Josh Sandbulte, co-president of money management firm Greenhaven Associates.But this isn't Amazon's fault. It's the fault of Congress and the fact that the Postal Service remains a government-run monopoly that gets $18 billion in taxpayer subsidies each year. Bashing Amazon does nothing to change this.If Trump wants to fix this subsidy problem, he needs to push Congress to finally do what many other countries have already done — privatize the Postal Service.That would not only spare taxpayers from subsidizing Amazon, it would free Trump up to tweet about real problems the country faces.Note: This editorial has been updated since it was first published on March 28.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Amazon Stock Dives As 'Obsessed' Trump Considers Regulations, Tax ActionForget About Antitrust: Wal-Mart Is Punching Back At AmazonTrump's Attacks On Amazon Should Worry Everyone

The company reportedly plans to develop its own package delivery service, and plans to build an air cargo hub in Kentucky for its Prime Air Fleet.Meanwhile, logistics providers like XPO Logistics (XPO) and Echo Logistics (ECHO) have moved to digitize the services they offer to connect businesses that need products shipped and the companies that ship them.XPO Logistics rose 0.6% intraday, while Echo lost 1.1%.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Does FedEx Have A 'Secret Deal' With The Firearms Industry?Home Depot Reportedly Mulled Bid For Logistics Firm To Fend Off AmazonXPO Logistics Joins Rank Of Stocks With 95-Plus Composite Rating

82,O,"Nearly two and a half centuries ago, Adam Smith taught that ""the interested sophistry of merchants and manufacturers"" had created monopolies that ""confounded the common sense of mankind.""These days, the interested sophistry of merchants, manufacturers, and well-connected special interests, who use the federal government as their ATM, have confounded mankind's common sense in the form of the U.S. tax code.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveThe thing is 4 million words long. Every year, Americans waste 6 billion hours and $195 billion just trying to comply with it. And when they fall short, it costs them even more. In 2015, taxpayers, desperate for a little clarity, called the IRS helplines more than 56 million times — and over 50% of those calls went unanswered. No wonder: Congress has created a tax code so complicated, vague, and ambiguous that even the IRS cannot figure it out.Those who can afford the expense hire tax lawyers and accountants; but they also have trouble navigating the system.That's because for years, powerful industries and politically connected special interests have lobbied Congress for deductions and tax credits. And they've done so under the misguided notion that it will benefit them. It doesn't. As economist Milton Friedman put it, ""the most important single central fact about a free market is that no exchange takes place unless both parties benefit.""X In the long run, if it isn't good for the taxpayers footing the bill, it won't be good for business.And that's what we've seen.So many businesses and industries have special deductions now. And when products are subsidized or mandated, the economic incentives to adapt and improve disappear. Products stagnate. They can no longer find their way and the good that they may offer is never realized. Subsidies have poisoned the very things they were meant to prop up.Even worse, these deductions have complicated the tax code and stripped the system of transparency. When my wife and I go out to dinner and the bill comes, I can see exactly what taxes I'm paying on my meal, and I know that the rest of the diners are paying the same rate. Not so with the U.S. tax code, and that's wrong. We ought to know what everyone else is paying.On top of the complexity and unfairness, the special carveouts and deductions have contributed to a crushing tax burden shouldered by ordinary taxpayers, small businesses, and even the poor who pay no taxes, but still pay too much for the things they buy. In the past several years, average economic growth languished below the historic norm of 3% as opportunity dwindled.In short, these deductions are sand in the gears of our economy and we're all losing.We all need to look at ourselves in the mirror and ask, ""Am I asking for something to be carved out for me?"" Let's ask our representatives in Congress to make our tax code simple and open, and free of sophistry. As we eliminate the carveouts, we can lower the tax rates, and simplify the process of compliance to unleash economic growth and restore opportunity.Lawmakers should work together to free up the economy. The legislation currently under consideration in the U.S. Congress is a big step in the right direction.Tax reform will increase wages, make our country globally competitive, allow people to keep more of what they earn, and help propel us onto the path toward Adam Smith's recipe for prosperity: ""peace, easy taxes and a tolerable administration of justice.""Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

91,O,"Major indexes held on to light gains in afternoon trade Thursday while a hot Bitcoin-tracking exchange traded fund ushered its first key sell signal since blasting out of a deep cup with handle on Nov. 24.X Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) got showered by sellers for a third straight session as shares dropped more than 24% in trading running double its 50-day average.At 1,807, it was also the first time for the ETF to slide significantly below the 10-day moving average, a key sell signal for short-term trading.The 10-day moving average represents the average closing price over the past 10 trading sessions and can help determine an early exit for a stock or a highflying ETF that has broken out of a proper base such as a cup with handle or a flat base.Meanwhile, Chevron (CVX) led an impressive rebound among integrated oil and gas firms as the Dow Jones industrial average member surged more than 3% to 125.24 in heavy turnover. That gain hoisted the San Ramon, Calif., energy giant further above a 120.99 buy point in a six-week flat base.That flat base is part of an even longer consolidation. Chevron's buy zone goes up to 127.04.Other strong stocks in the oil patch include EOG Resources (EOG) and Diamondback Energy (FANG), which is one of four stocks to join IBD Leaderboard in December. Diamondback is now 7% past a 115.03 buy point and thus extended in price. The right time to buy a stock following its breakout is when it is still within 5% of the proper entry. In Diamondback's case, the buy zone goes up to 120.78.Other exploration and production stocks breaking out include Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) (flat base, 65.93 buy point), Norway's Statoil (STO) (flat base, 21.12) and Concho Resources (CXO) (base on base, 147.87).At 2:45 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 posted gains of around 0.4% and still look poised for weekly gains. The Nasdaq composite slightly lagged, up nearly 0.3%. Small caps are outperforming with the Russell 2000 up more than 0.7%.The Dow transports cooled off a bit, trading virtually flat, after running up four sessions in a row and rising almost 3.4% over that period. One of Thursday's top industry groups is shipping transport, up more than 4% as a group. But none of the companies in the 31-member industry group holds a Composite Rating of 90 or higher. The highest-rated name is Genco Shipping & Trading (GNK), a thinly traded dry bulk carrier. The stock has formed a handle on a base that resembles a double bottom. The buy point is 13.83, a dime above the handle's high.While Genco sports a lowly Composite of 65 on IBD Stock Checkup, the RS Rating is strong at 89 and the Accumulation/Distribution Rating is positive at B.On the Dow industrials, at least seven stocks are up 1 point or more, including Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs (GS). The investment bank rose 2.2% in active turnover and is aiming to move out of the 5% buy zone after clearing a saucer with handle at 247.84.On an adjusted basis, Goldman has notched five quarters in a row of rising earnings growth. Revenue has increased 22%, 18%, 31%, 6% and 11% vs. year-ago levels over the same time frame.Back to Chevron, the Street sees earnings rebounding 459% to $1.23 a share in the fourth quarter. In the year-ago quarter, profit dropped 38%.Yet amid the recent strength in crude oil prices, boosted in large part by OPEC's success in extending its pact to cut supply through the end of 2018, Chevron's top line has enjoyed a startling turnaround.Diamondback, an expert in the Permian Basin region and West Texas, rallied for a fourth straight session and jumped more than 3% to 120.96 in strong turnover. Mutual funds and hedge funds owning shares in the midcap energy play have risen for at least 18 quarters in a row. In the third quarter, 979 funds owned a piece of Diamondback, up from 584 funds in Q3 of 2015 and 731 funds in Q3 of 2016.Analysts see earnings rising 191% this year to $5.10 a share, which would be an record for the Midland, Texas-based firm that was incorporated in 2011.

92,O,"Saudi Arabia is reportedly looking at natural-gas assets in Texas shale basins and is in talks with a U.S. liquefied natgas producer as it looks to break into U.S. shale.X State-run oil giant Saudi Aramco is in early negotiations with Tellurian (TELL) to buy a stake or some of its natural gas, according to sources in a Wall Street Journal article. The report also said Armaco has asked about assets in the Permian and Eagle Ford shale formations.If the company starts production in the U.S., it would be the first time it had any output from outside the kingdom. It also would come after three years of struggles to cool shale's growth, which has upended markets that Saudi Arabia once swayed as the swing producer.But the kingdom's domestic energy needs may be prompting an embrace of its U.S. rivals. Investing in shale would give Saudi Arabia access to the U.S. industry's ability to quickly start and stop production projects and use that knowledge back at home.""Saudi Arabia has a lot of shale, a lot of tight gas,"" said Jim Krane, an energy analyst at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy. ""Aramco needs to get to the gas because Saudi Arabia is very short on natural gas. The only way to get to it without imports is to tap into shale."" Tellurian shares were up 2.7% on the stock market today.Chevron (CVX), which is a major holder of Permian acreage, rallied 0.9% to 120.89. Exxon Mobil (XOM), which is doubling its Permian holdings, added 0.5%. EOG Resources (EOG), a big Eagle Ford player, climbed 2.1%. Cheniere Energy (LNG), which owns the Sabine Pass export terminal in Louisiana, rose 1 cent.Chevron closed just shy of retaking a 120.99 buy point. Exxon, EOG and Cheniere are all approaching entries in bullish consolidations.U.S. crude rose 0.9% to $58.09 a barrel on a bigger-than-expected drop in domestic inventories. Brent crude climbed 1.2% to $64.56.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.Saudi Arabia uses roughly 1 million barrels per day of oil in the summer months to produce electricity to run air conditioners, but the kingdom is looking at using natural gas for electricity production and send its oil overseas.The kingdom would need up to 12 million tons of LNG a year if it switched to natgas for electricity production, energy consultants Poten & Partners said, according to the Journal.But Saudi Arabia is also looking at importing natgas from closer to home as Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said Riyadh was considering  gas from the Mediterranean Sea and East Africa. Russia is also eyeing sales to the kingdom.Any shale acquisitions would diversify Aramco as it looks to place 5% of the company on a global stock exchange or put up shares in a private offering.Saudi Aramco won't be the first Middle Eastern country to invest in U.S. shale; the UAE's Mubadala sovereign fund has invested in a private equity firm in U.S. shale, the report said.RELATED:U.S. Oil Inventory Drops But Output Continues Record-Setting StreakEnergy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, Coal

105,O,"The oil and gas sector is a big one in IBD's database, comprised of 10 subgroups. The groups are home to several of the best oil stocks, but the devil is in the details when it comes to identifying the names with the best potential.Headed into Wednesday, exploration and production firms were among the best oil stocks in the market based on six-month price performance. The group is also home to high-quality names with top Composite Ratings and outstanding fundamentals. While many leaders have made strong moves in the group, several of the best oil stocks are finding support at the 50-day moving average or the 10-week moving average for the first time after base breakouts.Oasis Petroleum (OAS), with a Composite Rating of 96, has a healthy weekly chart. After a breakout over an 11.49 buy point, it's getting support at the 10-week moving average for the first time. The company has a big presence in the North Dakota and Montana regions of the oil-rich Williston Basin.Oasis owns a market capitalization of just over $4 billion, and it's very liquid with an average daily volume of more than 11 million shares. It's expected to earn 41 cents a share this year, with earnings expected to surge 105% next year to 84 cents.Other liquid, institutional-quality stocks in the group could also be setting up for more upside. After breaking out from a bottoming base in March, Denver-based Whiting Petroleum (WLL) is also visiting its 10-week line for the first time. It's a top crude oil producer in North Dakota as well as northern Colorado.Like many other exploration and production firms, Whiting has the look of a turnaround story. After a series of quarterly losses, the company reported first-quarter profit of 92 cents a share, along with the third straight quarter of accelerating sales growth. Q1 sales rose 39% to $515.1 million. For Q2, the Zacks consensus estimate calls for profit of 57 cents shares. Sales growth is expected to accelerate again, up 60% to $498.25 million.EOG Resources (EOG) and Noble Energy (NBL) are two other liquid names in the group with compelling fundamentals and healthy charts.Diamondback Energy (FANG), new to Friday's Sector Leaders screen, jumped above its 50-day moving average this week, but it's prone to volatile price swings. The Texas-based firm has been a solid performer since its IPO in 2012 and shows big earnings and sales growth in recent quarters, but it's not in a proper buy area. Still, shares are up about 12% so far this week as it approaches its recent high of 138.14.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

107,O,"Apple got punched by sellers in Friday late-afternoon, dropping as much as 2.5% at the start, but shaved its losses. Plus, Apple's sell-off hardly dented the Nasdaq composite. The index, in fact, turned a moderate early-morning loss into a slight gain. Overall, the key indexes reversed from moderate losses into positive ground in stocks today as new NYSE stock leader Twitter surged.At 7645, the tech-driven composite edged up 0.2%. The leading index is off to a vigorous start in June, up nearly 2.7%. The S&P 500, up 0.2% as of 2:30 p.m. ET, also is doing well in June, rising nearly 3% for the month.Apple (AAPL) was the only stock within the Dow Jones industrial average to fall 1 point or more. The next worst decline: an 88-cent slip by fellow tech leader Intel (INTC). The chipmaking titan sank 1.5% to 55, but volume is light. No sell signals are being triggered. The Dow Jones industrials rallied 0.2% after falling only 0.3% early.See on a daily chart how Intel, up 19% year to date, holds a solid cushion above its fast-rising 50-day moving average and 10-week moving average.For more on how to use the 10-week moving average correctly to determine to best time to sell, please check out the latest Inside The IBD 50 column, published every Friday on Investors.com and in IBD Weekly.The Innovator IBD 50 (FFTY) fund rallied 0.6% to 36.05. It's up 8.5% since Jan. 1, vs. a 3.8% advance for the S&P 500. The exchange-traded fund, which now shows an average daily volume of 209,000 shares, ran up 34% in 2017 while the 500 gained 19.4%.Apple is a member of IBD Leaderboard since May 4, when the megacap tech presented a correct entry point as it rallied sharply and rose past a 179.04 buy point in a seven-week double bottom.While Apple is extended past the 5% buy zone from that entry, the stock has presented a new follow-on entry at 190.47 after forming a rare 3-weeks-tight pattern.The iPhone, iPad and digital services giant fell on news reports that it plans to order fewer components for the iPhone in the second half of the year. Keep in mind, however, that the company continually innovates its formidable line of smartphones. Some media have reported that Apple is likely to introduce new versions in the fall.Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters see Apple's fiscal Q3 earnings bolting 31% higher to $2.18 a share on a 15% revenue increase to $52.27 billion.For fiscal 2018, which ends in September, Apple's profit is seen growing 25% to $11.49 a share. That would mark the biggest year-over-year increase since the Cupertino, Calif., company posted a 43% profit jump in FY 2015.The Street sees revenue rising 14% for the current fiscal year to $260.87 billion. Apple's market cap is currently $940 billion.Lending LeaderBofI Holding (BOFI), highlighted as IBD's Stock Of The Day, rebounded 1% to 44.47 in light turnover. The internet bank is still in buy range after clearing a 43.60 prime buy point in a five-week flat base.Tesla (TSLA), highlighted in this earlier Stock Market Today feature, gained nearly 0.7% to 319.05 in active trade.

The stock rushed more than 3% higher to 41.40 in volume running more than 25% above its 50-day average.The social media network has now gained 21% past the proper entry. Taking gains in most stocks when you have a 20% to 25% profit is very sound portfolio management. But when you have supreme conviction in the company, holding longer may lead to stronger returns. But such stocks must have truly excellent fundamentals, high relative strength, and strong institutional sponsorship.The Accumulation/Distribution Rating of Twitter stands at a positive B+ on a scale of A to E, according to Stock Checkup. This means that over the past 13 weeks, fund managers have generally been net accumulators of Twitter shares.Twitter has scored four quarters in a row of earnings growth acceleration (from a 22% drop in Q1 2017 to flat growth the next quarter, then gains of 11%, 73%, and 129%).

116,O,"""Blockchain, blockchain, blockchain. Blockchain? Blockchain, blokchain, blokchin bokchn, bkcn, bk-bk, ch."" — That was conversation, basically, in parts of the world in 2017, when an iced-tea company rebranded as a blockchain company, grandparents talked up Bitcoin, and CryptoKitties pollinated the digital landscape.X Since the new year began, Eastman Kodak (KODK), Moviepass parent Helios and Matheson (HMNY) and Chanticleer Holdings (BURG), which operates Hooters and burger restaurants, have joined or may join Long Blockchain (LBCC) and Riot Blockchain (RIOT) on the bandwagon. Autonomous Research thinks we'll see at least 100 ""blockchain pretenders"" this year. While the current frenzy might obscure blockchain's actual potential, most people agree that the record-keeping technology behind Bitcoin that allows anyone involved in a transaction to see it and agree on it before clearing it is sound enough to outlast today's crypto-hellride. But if 2017 was a year of talk about blockchain, 2018 might be a year of more action, with a possible focus on trading, payments and architecture. ""I think in 2018 you're going to see a lot of these new projects that have been promoting themselves and raising money (in 2017), many of them are going to see their first real releases of software, official releases of their platform, happening in 2018,"" said Matthew Spoke, CEO of blockchain startup Nuco Networks.On Tuesday, IBM and the world's largest container shipping company, A.P. Moller-Maersk, said they are forming a joint venture up to provide a new platform for conducting global trade using blockchain technology.Analysts have long said blockchain has the ability to make trading in stocks and other securities quicker, cheaper and more transparent, and 2018 will offer more of a look into whether investors actually want to trade on a distributed-ledger platform.  Online retailer Overstock (OSTK), which is rapidly morphing into a blockchain company, has opened up a blockchain-based trading system it majority-owns, tZero, to more investors. TZero, along with Siebert Financial (SIEB) and Overstock, have said they intended to partner to ""offer deeply discounted online trading"" in the first quarter of 2018 — charging $2.99 per trade and, eventually, $1.99 for members of a new, ""elite"" segment of its Club O rewards program. The company also hopes to make it a bigger alternative trading system for tokens and initial coin offerings. And the tZero platform can settle trades on the same day, potentially offering brokers a way to shorten the time between when an investor's order is executed and when money and securities are actually exchanged. While investors will still be able to make trades in milliseconds, brokers could lower their risk of seeing a trading counterparty defaulting. Today, the SEC requires that trades must be settled within two days.For now, the platform is largely being used as an outlet for short-selling. In particular, Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne hopes the platform's blockchain technology will address what he has long considered abusive short-selling practices by prime brokerages — particularly surrounding rules for locating shares that short-sellers borrow to make trades. Byrne, a vocal Bitcoin and blockchain evangelist, said in November that he intended to use tZero to go after a huge chunk of Goldman Sachs' (GS) revenue. ""Arguably,"" D.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte said, ""they're disrupting or working to disrupt three things — one being short-selling, two being settlement, three being issuance, if you think about what they're doing with their initial coin offering.""  In November, Byrne said the platform had $80 billion to $120 billion worth of lendable securities.Meanwhile, Nuco is working with the TMX Group, the parent of the Toronto Stock Exchange, to build a blockchain platform for the NGX natural gas exchange, which is owned by TMX, said Nuco's Spoke.IBD'S TAKE: It is crucial for investors to understand the difference between cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, and the blockchain software programs that enable them. It is also important to get a feel for just how speculative digital monies like Bitcoin are right now before investing directly in the currencies or through related exchange traded funds or stocks.James Wester, research director for worldwide payment strategies at IDC, said he'll continue to keep his eye on blockchain's potential to make remittances — or money people living outside their home country send back to it — less expensive and more efficient this year.More than $400 billion in remittances were transferred around the world in 2016, with transaction fees hovering around 7%. An array of blockchain remittance startups — such as Abra, TransferWise and Circle, a company backed by Goldman Sachs — are working to cut the cost of transaction fees — and render wire transfers and Western Union (WU) irrelevant.""It also looks like a use case that could be on the point of really taking off in ways that I don't think other use cases are,"" Wester said.The incumbents in the space have taken notice. On Thursday, MoneyGram (MGI) said it will test the crytocurrency Ripple to transfer funds.To be sure, crypto transactions carry their own fees, and scaling up can be an issue. But some cross-border remittance fees are high, and companies can also use the underlying blockchain technology for transfers rather than a certain digital coin.But Wester also notes much of the technology that exists, at least within payments, already works pretty well.""Not to poke fun at anybody, but when the biggest news of 2017 is CryptoKitties trading on top of Ethereum,"" Spoke said, referring to a game where people breed digital cats, ""we have a long way to go before this really starts to change the fundamental infrastructure of the world.""Other things to watch for next year? Actually getting all the world's private blockchain networks to operate with some degree of coherence.A project by Toronto-based Nuco, called Aion, aims to develop a platform that enables the scores of blockchain networks with different protocols — public, private, region- or industry specific — to connect to one another.""Let's say I write a transaction on blockchain A, but I want that transaction's logic to be triggered autonomously as the result of a transaction on blockchain B. You can't do that autonomously today,"" Spoke said. ""You need somebody to kind of sit in the middle of that process.""The coming year may be a white-knuckle ride for blockchain believers as more comparisons are drawn to the dotcom bubble 20 years ago.But here's some perspective: the valuation of the dotcoms reached into the trillions before imploding, while the value of the entire crypto space, for now, is still about three to five times smaller, said Lex Sokolin, global director of fintech strategy at Autonomous Research.He added that 84% of dotcom IPOs vanished after 10 years. But the ones that survived, like Amazon (AMZN) and Netflix (NFLX), ended up dominating entire industries, he said.""So most projects here will fail, but that is the required creative destruction to get to the next stage of the economy,"" Sokolin said.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Bitcoin And Cryptocurrency News And TrendsBitcoin, Blockchain And Private Industry: You Ain't Seen Nothing YetWarren Buffett Is Bearish On Cryptocurrencies But Stops Short Of ThisMore Than Bitcoin: Blockchain's Links Reach JPMorgan, IBM, Walmart

127,O,"Thanks to the shale boom, the U.S. is set to boost oil and gas production to unprecedented levels by 2025, but OPEC will take back market power longer term, the International Energy Agency said Tuesday.XThe Paris-based energy watchdog estimated in its annual World Energy Outlook report that domestic output would jump 25% — to 30 million barrels of oil equivalent per day from 24 million currently. The U.S. had already topped Russia in 2011 to be the world's No. 1 oil and gas producer, but the IEA's forecast would put the U.S. head and shoulders ahead of any rivals.""A remarkable ability to unlock new resources cost-effectively pushes combined United States oil and gas output to a level 50% higher than any other country has ever managed,"" according to the report.Oil prices fell Tuesday, after the IEA cut its 2017 and 2018 oil demand forecast by 100,000 barrels per day, in the agency's monthly report. Brent fell 1.5% to $62.21 per barrel. U.S. crude was off 1.9% to $55.70.Shares of Exxon Mobil (XOM) were down 0.8% on the stock market today, Chevron (CVX) lost 0.3%, BP (BP) eased by 0.7%, and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) dipped 0.2%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.Thanks to advances by shale producers like EOG Resources (EOG), Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), Continental Resources (CLR) and Diamondback Energy (FANG), U.S. shale oil production is expected to grow by 8 million barrels per day from 2010 to 2025, exceeding the growth that Saudi Arabia saw from the 1960s to the 1980s.The IEA estimates that this boom will account for 80% of the growth in the world's oil supply by 2025 and will allow the U.S. to become a net oil exporter by the late 2020s.U.S. shale exploration and production companies weathered a global, two-year industry glut by tightening belts, cutting costs and adopting novel technological advances aimed at increasing production and lowering break-even costs.But shale production should start to decline starting in the middle of next decade, the IEA added, as a slower pace of investment weighs on longer-term output. That should let OPEC boost its market share to 46% by 2040 from about 43% today.Still, there are many other factors at play over the long term. The IEA noted the U.S. shale sector's history of beating expectations; the shift to electric vehicles putting downward pressure on oil demand; and changes in estimates of recoverable shale reserves.RELATED: Energy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, Coal

135,O,"In her 1968 hit song, ""D-I-V-O-R-C-E,"" Tammy Wynette spelled out the gut-wrenching word many couples dread. Now, amid a tax change to the support known as alimony, couples likely will fear divorce even more.In addition to all of the traditional reasons, the Trump tax reform creates new rules that will give many couples getting divorced additional, painfully conflicting goals — financial and emotional.New alimony tax rules, included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, apply to divorce or separation agreements executed after Dec. 31, 2018. Because the changes can dramatically affect finances, experts say the new rules intensify the divorce process. They also raise the specter that at least one soon-to-be-ex-spouse could take a big financial hit.Starting Jan. 1, alimony payers will no longer be able to deduct this outlay from their federal income tax. That means many will want to lock in alimony terms this year. That way, they will be grandfathered into existing rules, allowing them to deduct alimony this year and in the future.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIn addition, alimony recipients will no longer owe federal tax on this support. As a result, many will insist on waiting until next year to finalize divorce terms, believing that this will benefit them financially. But the overall net impact may hurt them financially rather than benefit them.'This is huge,"" said Renee Senes, a certified divorce financial analyst and author of ""Money & Divorce, Costly Mistakes You Don't Want to Make."" She added, ""The new rules are a significant change in the way alimony has been treated.""IBD'S TAKE: Learn which of your spouse's assets you can lay claim to, in this IBD report.A recent survey of members of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers found 95% of respondents expect the new alimony rules will change how divorces are settled. And 64% expect the change will make divorces more acrimonious.The law change has the potential to cost a lot of people big bucks. In the 2015 tax year — the latest year for which the IRS has data — 598,888 taxpayers claimed the alimony deduction (on Form 1040). Their deductions totaled more than $12.3 billion.That's up from more than 597,000 taxpayers who claimed the alimony deduction on their 2010 federal returns, for a total of $10.4 billion.Already, anxiety has been rising this year among prospective alimony payers (typically men) and recipients (usually women), suggests Ginita Wall, director of Women's Institute for Financial Education (WIFE). In divorce workshops, ""it's become more of a life-or-death issue, for both men and women,"" says Wall, whose organization sponsors Second Saturday workshops on divorce in 120 locations nationally.For alimony payers, getting the tax deduction is very important, says David Hryck, tax specialist and partner in the law firm of Reed Smith. The deduction dampens the financial impact of alimony on payers. The new rules removing it could hit payers three ways: Not only will they lose the deduction, but without it some may be pushed into a higher tax bracket. And they'll still have to pay the spousal support with fewer available dollars.For those reasons, many alimony payers will want to settle a divorce before the end of this year. Doing that this year will allow them to deduct alimony in future years as well, using existing rules rather than the new rules.Alimony recipients have the opposite incentive. On the surface, many of them will be motivated to wait until next year when they will no longer owe federal income tax on alimony.But because husbands will have more reasons to lower payments in settlements after this year, women may not come out ahead financially by delaying the divorce.And the size of any cuts in payments could exceed the savings from no longer owing alimony tax, since many women would be in a low tax bracket due to other changes in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, says attorney Madeline Marzano-Lesnevich. Bottom line: in many cases, the alimony tax change will ""hurt women more than men,"" says Marzano-Lesnevich, who is president of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers.How can soon-to-be-ex-spouses lessen any alimony tussles?

140,O,"EOG Resources (EOG) easily beat quarterly estimates late Thursday and announced two new oil plays that together could hold 750 million barrels of oil equivalent.XEstimates: Per-share profit of 10 cents, swinging from a loss of 40 cents per share a year ago. Revenue is expected to climb 22% to $2.58 billion.Results: EPS of 19 cents on revenue of $2.64 billion. Crude oil production grew 16% to 327,900 barrels of oil per day, though Hurricane Harvey impacted volumes by 15,000 bopd.Outlook: EOG expects to complete 505 net wells in 2017, up from a prior outlook of 480 net wells and is  targeting 20% U.S. crude oil growth. The company also expects to fund capital expenditures and its dividend with discretionary cash flow.The company expanded its premium locations the Delaware Basin's First Bone Spring play in New Mexico and the Woodford Oil Window in Oklahoma's SCOOP play. EOG considers premium inventory wells that have a minimum 30% rate of return at $40 per barrel oil prices.EOG estimates the First Bone Spring play has 540 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) net resource potential and 540 remaining net premium wells. The Woodford Oil Window play has an estimated 210 million BOE net resource potential and 260 net premium wells.So far this year, EOG has added 2,000 net premium locations, which is four times the number of wells the company expects to complete in 2017.""We have amassed an enormous, high-quality portfolio of assets by capturing sweet-spot acreage in the best oil plays in the U.S.,"" Chairman and CEO Bill Thomas in a statement. ""Combined with our consistent operational proficiency and innovative technology, this gives us great confidence in the long-term sustainability of our unique premium growth and high-return model.""Devon Energy (DVN) was also active in the Bone Spring play during Q3, and Concho Resources (CXO) has acreage there too.

142,O,"For the past two years, shale exploration and production companies have focused on growing the flow of oil, but now the focus may be shifting toward the flow of cash.XConcho Resources (CXO), Apache (APA), EOG Resources (EOG) and a slew of other U.S. shale producers report third-quarter results this week. While U.S. crude prices have climbed to $54 a barrel they have struggled to stay above $50 ever since prices collapsed in 2014, and producers' spending vs. cash flow will likely be a key metric for investors.The outlook for capital expenditures is dimming, as companies focus more on financial returns and operating within their cash flows vs. expanding production, oilfield service provider Schlumberger (SLB) said earlier this month.""In North America land (operations) where companies added capex, production growth is falling short of expectations,"" CEO Paul Kibsgaard said on the earnings call with analysts. ""This has led to moderating investment appetite.""Early reports from shale companies echoed this sense of caution. On Friday, Cabot Oil & Gas (COG) reported Q3 results that fell short of Wall Street estimates and reaffirmed its total 2017 program spending forecast of $845 million.""We remain committed to delivering positive free cash flow in 2017 and beyond, while continuing to focus on improving our corporate returns and increasing our return of capital to shareholders through prudent capital allocation,"" Chairman and CEO Dan Dinges said in a statement.Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at Price Futures Group, said he will be looking for a focus on wellhead profitability in the shale earnings reports and expects companies to be less aggressive about production.""Before it was a rush to raise production now it's a rush to produce profitability,"" he said. ""It could be positive if companies said they were going pull back and focus on cash.""Among U.S. oil giants, however, the spending picture is mixed. Chevron (CVX)  said Friday it would spend less money than expected this year, while Exxon Mobil (XOM) said it would spend more next year to increase drilling in U.S. shale plays. That could be a reflection of the uncertainty that continues to permeate oil markets, which increasingly look to the U.S. oil patch as the swing producer.""I think there's still one more big surge coming from U.S., which will knock prices down,"" Ian Taylor, CEO of Vitol Group, said at the Oil & Money conference in London last month.He expects Brent crude to fall to $45 per barrel in 2018 as U.S. shale production increases vs. $60 today.Shares of EOG Resources, a bellwether of the industry that is known as the ""Apple (AAPL) of oil"" for its tech advances, were up 1.1% at 99.53 on the stock market today, climbing further into buying range after breaking out from a 98.47 cup-with-handle base on Friday.U.S. crude futures closed up 0.5% to $54.15 a barrel on Monday.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Concho Resources, Anadarko Petroleum (APC), Devon Energy (DVN) kick off the busy earnings week, reporting results after the market closes Tuesday. Concho's earnings are seen falling 19% to 26 cents per share but revenue is expected to jump 44% to $622 million.Anadarko is expected to report a loss of 56 cents per share up from a loss of 89 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. Revenue is seen rising 23% to $2.32 billion. Last month, Anadarko announced a $2.5 billion share buyback plan.Devon's EPS is expected to soar 333% to 39 cents from 9 cents a year ago but revenue is expected to fall 25% to $3.16 billion.Laredo Petroleum (LPI) and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) are scheduled to report Wednesday. Analysts expect Laredo's EPS to rise 8.3% to 13 cents with revenue up 14.4% to $183 million.Pioneer's EPS is seen jumping 123% to 29 cents as revenue climbs 8.3%b to $1.3 billion.In Q2, Pioneer lowed its outlook of how many higher-value oil barrels it would produce in 2017. But at the Oil & Money conference, Pioneer said it plans to quadruple production over the next decade thanks to increasing output from Texas.CEO Timothy Dove said that the company's break even is $20 per barrel, giving it more room to expand and more cushion if oil prices fall.Apache and EOG Resources are due Thursday.Analysts see Apache reporting a loss of 2 cents per share vs. a 3-cents-per-share loss in the year-ago quarter. Revenue is expected to dip 2.1% to $1.41 billion.EOG is seen swinging to a profit of 10 cents per share vs. a loss of 40 cents per share a year ago. Revenue is  expected to climb  22% to $2.58 billion.Sanchez Energy (SN) rounds up the week Friday.

Price resistance and overcoming it.XA trader who wants to win consistently in exchange traded funds can gain a lot in the long run by employing even some basic chart-reading techniques employed by savvy investors in growth stocks. Learning the IBD method for uncovering major market bottoms and peaks will help as well.If you like to trade the broad-based equity indexes, then you can sharpen your buying and selling of the Nasdaq 100-tracking Nasdaq QQQ Trust (QQQ), SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), and SPDR Dow Jones industrial (DIA) ETFs by using the IBD ETF Market Strategy tool.Other Stories In Special ReportMaximize Your Investment Returns With These ETF StrategiesState Street Looks At Future Of ETFs As Industry Milestone NearsLong-Term Retirement Investing StrategiesHow To Invest In A Rising Rate EnvironmentMillennials Buy Low-Cost ETFs To Achieve Investment ObjectivesBuy signals get triggered when, after a significant correction in the market, at least one major market benchmark rises 1.2% or more in higher volume vs. the prior trading session on Day 4 of a new rally attempt or later. IBD calls this kind of significant gain in higher turnover a follow-through. Every major market bottom going back to 1900 started this way.In some cases, IBD will note a follow-through when the gain by either the Nasdaq composite or the S&P 500 is less than 1.2%.The follow-through does not guarantee a big rally is in store, but it's the earliest signal that an investor can get that large investment funds are seriously beginning to accumulate new positions in stocks. And tracking when large investors change behavior is important. Why? They tend to continue buying for months or years, thereby fueling the gains in your investments in stocks and ETFs.The June 30, 2016, follow-through was unique in that it occurred on Day 3 of a new rally attempt. On that session, the S&P 500 rallied 1.4%, the Nasdaq composite gained 1.3%. Volume gushed higher that day on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE (the turnover statistic used for analyzing the health of the S&P 500). On that day, SPY finished the bullish session at 209.48; QQQ closed at 107.54.Both ETFs have since rallied more than 30%. Use the ETF Market Strategy to determine when to sell half your position and when to go 100% cash. IBD Leaderboard features a daily summary of the market's action and uses the Nasdaq composite's chart to annotate the precise time to build or reduce a position in your favorite broad index ETF.What are some excellent tools you may employ to profit from timely moves in sector ETFs — be it an industry sector or a geographical one? Charts, both daily and weekly ones, help you pinpoint the moment in which you have a high chance of making an investment with maximum return and minimum risk.One of the keys to minimizing risk? Cut losses in both stocks and ETFs. Don't let any investment sour to a loss of greater than 7% or 8%. This is the golden rule. Do this every time, and you not only prevent yourself from becoming emotionally invested in a security but also preserve your capital to trade or invest again.IBD's TAKE: Mastering the art and science of growth stock investing may help enhance your returns in exchange traded funds as well. To quickly learn IBD's rules and concepts on how to select, buy and sell growth stocks, please go through the archives of Investor's Corner.That, in essence, is what defines a breakout. A stock, after a nice run, takes a break. But instead of falling sharply, it gives back part of its prior advance. A base forms. The market is steady. And then at some point, the stock breaks out and rapidly runs into new high ground.A leading ETF is capable of rewarding investors in similar fashion. Consider the Global X Lithium ETF (LIT): It gives investors a convenient vehicle to invest in companies that benefit from rising demand for the metal, which is used in high-performance batteries that store energy for electric cars and other machinery.In the IBD Weekly for the Week of July 11, 2016, LIT was one of 26 ETFs highlighted in a table right below the ETF Leaders Index. It sported one of the best Relative Price Strength Ratings on the list at 88.Meanwhile, LIT's weekly chart would have helped you spot several excellent buy points.The first one? In July 2016, LIT was ready for a break. It had already rallied from 17.03 earlier that year to a 52-week high of 25.95, good for a 52% gain. No wonder, then, that the ETF moved sideways for months.But after the Nov. 8 U.S. elections, LIT was ready to rumble. By the end of the year, it completed a six-month saucer-with-handle base. After the new year, LIT broke out in the week that ended Jan. 13, rising 4% to 26.08 and surpassing the 25.91 buy point. In a saucer with handle, the buy point is 10 cents above the highest price within the handle.Notice on a weekly chart how investors rushed into Global X Lithium shares. Volume ballooned 229% above its 10-week average, and was sharply higher than the prior week.Such price-and-volume action was bullish. It gave the savvy ETF trader a strong clue that the big boys and girls in the market — namely, large investment advisors, hedge funds, banks, pensions, college endowments and the like — were anxious to load up on shares.(Keep in mind, however, that IBD research has so far found that volume may not carry as much importance in ETFs as it clearly does in individual stocks. So when judging the overall health of an ETF's current move, focus more on price, not changes in turnover.)Have you heard of that proverbial expression, that in a good breakout a stock moves like the water in a bathtub when a bunch of elephants jump in? It moves up. Fast and furious.And that's exactly what Global X Lithium has done. By Sept. 20 of this year, the ETF has reached as high as 39.83, up 54% from the original saucer-with-handle buy point of 25.91.As seen on the weekly chart, LIT has also bounced off its 10-week moving average along the way. The first two tests of this line (in LIT's case, near 26.57 in mid-March of this year and 28.33 in mid-May) offer great chances to either initiate a new position or add a smaller amount of shares to a winning initial position. In general, don't add more than 20% of the original stake. More-aggressive traders can decide to add a larger percentage.Defensive sell rules are just as important in ETF trading.In the IBD Weekly published for the week of Jan. 9 this year, the ETF Leaders table showed the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Equipment & Services (XES) at the top. At the time, this fund boasted an 86 RS Rating. It finished trading on Jan. 6 at 23.72, good for a 6.1% weekly gain.The good times in January did not last for XES.After a few weeks of treading water, XES skidded lower like a go-cart with greased wheels. From Jan. 26 to Jan. 30, the fund fell 1% or more in three straight trading sessions, losing as much as 8.5% in the process. On that third session, XES also closed just a touch below the 50-day moving average near 22.24.Notice how volume jumped 93% above average on that third down day? IBD compares a stock or ETF's daily volume with its average over the past 50 sessions.XES tried to rally. It gained back some ground in three of the next four sessions, but never came close to reclaiming its 52-week high. When the ETF made another sharp drop through the 50-day line, it was time to sell.By Aug. 17, XES finished the day at 12.96, down 42% from the Jan. 30 close.RELATED:How To Win With Charts: Know The Flat-Base PatternWhen To Buy Key Index ETFs: Use LeaderboardHow To Maximize Your Portfolio Return: Use This Key Sell Rule For Stocks And ETFs

But investors have also been waiting for companies to return more capital via dividends and buybacks as higher oil prices leave them flush with cash.Last week, EOG Resources (EOG) also beat views and said plans to increase its payout at a faster pace can survive future volatility in oil prices.But with oil prices near the highest levels since late 2014, producers will be more tempted to spend more money on expanding output rather than maintain capital discipline.On Tuesday, the Energy Information Administration raised its estimates on U.S. crude production and now sees 2018 output averaging 10.72 million barrels per day, up 0.3% from a prior forecast, and sees 2019 output averaging 11.86 million barrels a day, a 3.6% upward revision.Editor's note: this story has been updated to clarify Occidental's Permian production.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Energy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, CoalThe 'Apple Of Oil' Sees Bigger Dividend Lasting Through Oil Swings

Based on the success of these so-called Version 3.0+ completions, the company is considering adding more of them in the second half of the year.Dove said Pioneer will have a better handle ""mid-year"" on how much the spending increase will be, but the company still plans to spend within its forecast cash flow of $3.2 billion.Shares of Marathon Oil jumped 6.3% to 19.45 on the stock market today, breaking out of a cup with handle base with an 18.76 entry point.

We believe our high Permian 'return on capital' will enhance shareholder value by delivering increasing 'return of capital' to investors.""Despite the drop in shale stocks, the earnings season has been positive for the sector so far. Along with Pioneer, Matador Resources (MTDR) and Continental Resources (CLR) reported earnings and revenue beats late Wednesday.On Tuesday, Viper Energy Partners (VNOM), Anadarko Petroleum (APC), Noble Energy (NBL) and Concho Resources (CXO) topped quarterly estimates.EOG Resources (EOG) and Parsley Energy (PE) will report Q1 results after the market closes Thursday.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Energy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, Coal

150,O,"Political Spying: As Robert Mueller's chimerical Russia-Trump collusion probe grinds on, a real possible crime has been revealed: the collusion between the Justice Department, the FBI, the Clinton campaign and, possibly, the Obama administration, to plant a spy in the Trump campaign.If so, as some say, it's bigger than Watergate.The spy's name is Stefan Halper, a professor at Cambridge University who has high-level ties to both U.S. and British intelligence, as Daily Caller New Foundation investigative reporter Chuck Ross discovered.The revelation made Trump livid, and rightly so, as his tweet on Sunday afternoon plainly showed: ""I hereby demand, and will do so officially tomorrow, that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the (FBI and Department of Justice) infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campaign for Political purposes — and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama Administration!""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBoth the New York Times and Washington Post knew the professor's name, but coyly decided not to reveal it, citing intelligence officials' warnings that to do so would might endanger him or other intelligence contacts.The Daily Caller's Ross, using Google and the copious information about the ""informant"" in the Times and Post pieces, was easily able to identify Halper.The debate over semantics of how to refer to Halper is amusing, but serious. Trump-hating mainstream media, echoing the FBI's and Justice Department's preferred term, call Halper an ""informant,"" not a ""spy.""Why? Because, if it turns out that putting a spy into Trump's presidential campaign was actually political rather than for national security, it would be plainly illegal. A lot of people could have careers ruined or go to prison.The FBI, it was reported last week, even had a name for the larger program of  spying on the Trump campaign: ""Operation  Crossfire Hurricane,"" cribbed from the Rolling Stones hit ""Jumpin' Jack Flash."" As part of this, now we know they had at least one spy in the Trump campaign.As the New York Times reported, the project began in earnest in August 2016 ""after the CIA director at the time, John O. Brennan, shared intelligence with Mr. (James) Comey showing that the Russian government was behind an attack on the 2016 presidential election. Intelligence agencies began collaborating to investigate that operation. The Crossfire Hurricane team was part of that group but largely operated independently, three officials said.""Despite repeated denials, the CIA and FBI were using Russian meddling in the election as an excuse to have Halper spy on the Trump campaign. A long-time CIA asset who worked for the Nixon administration, Halper was the son-in-law of former CIA Deputy Director Ray Cline, and still directs the Cambridge Security Initiative, a ""non-profit"" intelligence consultancy that Ross noted ""lists 'UK and US government agencies' among its clients.""Halper is also a close colleague of Sir Richard Dearlove, formerly the head of Britain's MI6 spy agency.Hmmm. Halper was the recipient of more than $400,000 in payments from the Department of Defense's Office of Net Assessment (ONA) — an internal Defense intelligence think tank — from July of 2016 to September 2017, after Halper spied on Trump campaign officials George Papadopoulos and Carter Page.Halper's ""unmasking"" as the mole in Trump's campaign raises many questions.Were those legitimate payments from ONA for past research, or was it used to pay for espionage services rendered to the Deep State? If the latter, it would be a gross violation of U.S. law.More troubling are Halper's extensive intelligence links. As a dual U.S.-British citizen and his close ties to both British and U.S. intelligence, did he task British assets to spy on Trump?Was Britain's government a party to this? Did it know about Crossfire Hurricane? Or that Halper was spying on the Trump campaign? If so, it would not be the act of an ally.In addition, what role did Halper play, if any, in engaging former British MI6 Russian spy Christopher Steele? Did Halper haven anything to do with getting Russian officials to make phony claims about Trump for his ""dossier"" in order to taint the Trump campaign?Far more seriously, was this coordinated from the Obama administration through the State Department, Justice Department and FBI, to aid the Clinton campaign and salvage President Obama's legacy?As Sara Carter has reported, ""The House Select Committee on Intelligence is now investigating former Secretary of State John F. Kerry's possible role into the unverified dossier paid for by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton Campaign...The dossier, assembled by a former British spy, laid the foundation for the FBI's investigation into alleged collusion between President Trump and Russia and was the essential piece of evidence used by the FBI to get a warrant to spy on a former volunteer for the Trump campaign.""Are former CIA Director John Brennan's and former FBI chief James Comey's recent bizarre veiled threats toward Republicans in Congress and Trump himself desperate acts to escape the coyote trap of their own criminality?It's already pretty clear that Comey lied to Congress. His deputy at the FBI, Andrew McCabe, testified that Comey cleared him to leak to the media, after Comey told Congress in sworn testimony that he did no such thing.Former IBD reporter Paul Sperry, writing for Real Clear Investigations, notes that the CIA's Brennan appears, at least, to have been caught in an outright lie to Congress by denying that the Steele dossier had anything to do with the FBI's and CIA's conclusion that Russia's meddling was intended to help Trump in 2016.Brennan also lied when he said he didn't know who was behind the Steele dossier, even though both the Justice Department and FBI knew a year earlier that Hillary Clinton, Trump's foe, had paid for the Steele hit job. The idea Brennan, head of the world's most powerful spy agency, didn't know who was paying for the dossier simply isn't credible on any level.Brennan may now face perjury charges, and so may Comey.But the greater question now arises, as it did in Watergate: What did President Obama know, and when did he know it? Did he deploy U.S. intelligence resources to keep Trump from being elected? Did he know about the spy in the Trump campaign, and the bogus dossier used to tarnish Trump?The same questions go for Hillary Clinton.The investigation is ongoing.House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, a California Republican, has been seeking answers from Obama administration officials about their role in the Trump fiasco, while demanding documents from a so-far recalcitrant Justice Department about spying on Trump.Meanwhile, responding to President Trump's Sunday tweet, FBI Deputy Director Rod Rosenstein on Monday directed the department's inspector general to determine ""whether there was any impropriety or political motivation"" in the FBI's investigation.If so, it is not a mere political trick, but a gross violation of the law. Richard Nixon never got involved in the political chicanery; but he tried to cover it up, and lost his presidency.This is far more serious, both legally and ethically. Obama, if he or his top White House aides knew and participated in these illegal acts of spying on a domestic political campaign, might possibly be charged with abuse of power. Yes, a crime.The people involved would — or at least should — go to prison. And that, in turn, could lead to the ultimate irony: Obama asking Trump for a pardon.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:As Evidence Piles Up, The Media Ignore The 'Other' Trump-Russia ScandalAmericans Support Mueller Probe — But Want Another One For FBI's Spying On Trump: IBD/TIPP PollRussia Scandal: Will Devin Nunes Investigation Prove 'Deep State' Collusion By FBI, DOJ?Russia Scandal: Did Hillary Clinton Run FBI's Trump Investigation?Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

EOG averaged 21 stages per day for the rest of the job.The company's technical prowess is also helping it keep drilling costs in the Eagle Ford play down 5%, with completion rates expected to follow.Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) warned earlier this week that it's seeing prices for oilfield services rising in the Permian Basin, but EOG said it's locked in about 60% of well costs with services already on contract.Late Thursday, EOG reported Q1 earnings of $1.19, up from 15 cents year-over-year, with revenue up 41% to $3.68 billion.

180,O,"U.S. production rose for the second straight week, the Energy Department reported Wednesday, as it inches toward a record high.XDomestic production climbed to 9.53 million barrels per day, according to the Energy Information Administration, nearing the record high of 9.61 million bpd reached in June 2015.Crude stockpiles fell by 3.3 million barrels and gasoline stocks were down by 1.2 million barrels, according to the EIA. Late Tuesday the American Petroleum Institute reported a 3.6 million barrel drop but saw a 1.4 million barrel increase in gasoline stockpiles.U.S. crude rose 1.2%% to settle at $48.41 per barrel. Brent was up 1.3% to $52.56.During the second quarter, U.S. shale firms like EOG Resources (EOG) raised their crude production outlook without changing their capital spending outlooks thanks to improved drilling technology and other advances.But some shale producers have cut capital spending going forward due to sluggish oil prices. U.S. oil rigs in operation fell last week to a seven week low. That suggests that U.S. output may soon peak, but that hasn't happened yet.IBD'S TAKE: Lower oil prices are weighting on producers but companies that use petroleum products in manufacturing, like Platform Specialty Products, are outperforming. Oil prices have also been dragged down by increased production from OPEC member Libya. The conflict conflict-ridden country is exempt from the current output deal among top producers inside and outside the cartel to remove 1.8 million barrels of oil per day from the market.Production had restarted at Libya's Sharara oilfield where production hit 280,000 barrels per day recently, before being shut Wednesday due to a pipeline blockage, according to Reuters.On Tuesday, Reuters reported that Chevron (CVX) CEO John Watson will retire next month with Vice Chairman Mike Wirth stepping up to the helm amid pricing pressure.Wirth has experience in refining, which has been more lucrative during the downturn and helped integrated oil companies outperform their peers.RELATED:Energy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, Coal

187,O,"Espionage: The remarks made in recent weeks by two former spy chiefs go well beyond anything ever uttered by previous espionage leaders, calling into question the commander in chief's competence and sanity. In politics, when considering such vituperative criticisms, it's always wise to consider the source.Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and former CIA Director John Brennan have both weighed in with scathing remarks about President Trump in recent days and weeks. To be blunt, Clapper and Brennan were political partisans of President Obama, and neither did exactly a bang-up job while in their posts.Speaking on CNN to left-leaning anti-Trump host Don Lemon this week, Clapper said, ""I really question his ability, his fitness to be in this office. And I also am beginning to wonder about his motivation for it. Maybe he is looking for a way out.""""How much longer does the country have to, to borrow a phrase, endure this nightmare?"" he asked, suggesting concern over Trump's access to nuclear codes.There's an awful lot to unpack there.For one, should a former intelligence chief who admitted to lying before Congress about the extent of National Security Agency spying on average Americans be passing judgment on any politician?And should we trust the judgment of someone who, laughably, claimed that Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood was ""largely secular,"" as Clapper did, and who predicted during Libya's civil war that Moammar Gadhafi would ""prevail"" in the end, just months before his dead body was dragged through the streets?And yet, we're supposed to take his criticisms of Trump seriously.As for also suggesting that Trump is ""looking for a way out,"" that's by now an old fantasy peddled and re-peddled by angry Obama-ites.""It's shocking that a former director of national intelligence takes the discredited 'Trump wants out' theme one step further at this late date,"" as Paul Mirengoff of the PowerLine blog put it. ""What does Clapper mean when he says Trump may be 'looking for a way out' by giving what Clapper considers over-the-top speeches? Does he think Trump, for whom winning means everything, wants to be impeached? That he wants to be institutionalized?""Or, perhaps, is he just trying to sow more confusion, more anger, more inchoate hatred for the president among those who didn't vote for him, thus obstructing Trump's ability to govern?We'd opt for the latter.Then there's former CIA chief John Brennan, who has also stepped out of his supposedly apolitical role as a spymaster to make highly charged political comments about Trump.After Trump's comments about Charlottesville, Brennan ripped into Trump for making ""dangerous"" and ""ugly"" comments.He's entitled to his opinion, of course. But it has long been a part of our tradition of government service that former officials serving in a nonpolitical capacity would leave the criticisms of other administrations to the elected politicians. To ignore this tradition runs the risk of tainting the professionalism of the agencies they once headed, and provides evidence that the heavily politicized, entrenched, progressive ""deep state"" that many Americans believe poses a danger to our republic really does exist.By the way, Brennan in remarks made last July that can only be called highly questionable suggested that it's ""obligation of some executive branch officials"" to refuse to fire Robert Mueller, who is heading up the open-ended investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia and its hacking of the 2016 election.Let's be clear: Trump, should he want to do so, would be absolutely within his rights as president to seek Mueller's firing. Whether it would be politically wise to do so is a separate question.And Brennan's remarks are incredibly self-serving, since he is the one who initiated the investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia last summer, in the heat of the campaign. The Obama loyalist did so, apparently, thinking it would fatally damage Trump's campaign.""It was then-CIA Director John O. Brennan, a close confidant of Mr. Obama's, who provided the information — what he termed the 'basis' — for the FBI to start the counterintelligence investigation last summer,"" wrote Washington Times national security correspondent Rowan Scarborough last May. ""Mr. Brennan served on the former president's 2008 presidential campaign and in his White House.""Brennan, by the way, also aided in making up the bogus talking points used by the Obama administration to lie about what happened in Benghazi, Libya, where four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens, were murdered. Whose interests was Brennan serving?Far from being a disinterested intelligence official, Brennan is in fact a highly partisan political operative with a far-left background. By his own admission (it came out in a CIA polygraph test administered early in his career), he voted for Communist Party hack Gus Hall for president in 1980.A mere youthful indiscretion? According to the authoritative ""Black Book Of Communism,"" Communist nations in the 20th century slaughtered more than 100 million people around the world. They did so in a (fortunately) failed attempt to impose that inhuman, totalitarian system on free people everywhere. Yet Brennan voted to have that same murderous, totalitarian system imposed on us here in the U.S. And was still given the keys to our nation's secrets.Anyone can criticize the president. That's America. But not everyone should. Neither Clapper nor Brennan have distinguished themselves in recent years, either professionally or politically. America's intelligence agencies were deeply dysfunctional during the Obama years.By inserting themselves so dishonestly into a partisan political dispute, Clapper and Brennan have not only damaged the agencies they once headed, but the democracy they once claimed to serve. They serve as Exhibits A and B in why the swamp must be drained, and drained thoroughly.RELATED:In Abusing NSA Intelligence, Did Obama White House Commit A Crime?Democrats' Real, Pervasive Collusion With Russia Somehow Lost In Media's Hysterical Anti-Trump CampaignMueller's Russia Probe Is A Political Hit Job: Either Rein Him In, Or Fire Him

203,O,"Oil slipped as investors weigh concerns over rising production from America's shale fields against the steady decline in crude stockpiles.Futures fell 0.7% in New York after inching closer to $50 a barrel earlier. A decline in U.S. inventories and a rise in fuel demand helped prop up prices on Wednesday, while production at its highest since July 2015 is stirring fears of a persistent glut. Meanwhile shale producers like EOG Resources (EOG) are boasting higher production targets in their earnings reports. Adding to the worries, Andy Hall, one of the most storied oil traders, is said to be closing down a fund.Oil climbed above the key $50-a-barrel-level this week for the first time since May as Saudi Arabia  promises to trim exports this month. But investors continue to evaluate whether output curbs by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies are helping to get the market back on track.""In the end, it looks like we are continuing to see lower inventories, not only on the oil side, but also on the product side. Demand remains quite robust,"" Bart Melek, head of global commodity strategy at TD Securities in Toronto, said by telephone. Yet, prices won't rally too much further ""until there is more certainty surrounding OPEC policy and what the fundamentals will look like into next year.""Hall, who has been trading oil since the 1970s and has sometimes been referred to as ""God"" by his peers, is closing down his main hedge fund after large losses in the first half of the year, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The global crude market has ""materially worsened"" and prices may be stuck around $50 a barrel or below, Hall told investors in his Astenbeck Capital Management firm in a letter last month.The legendary trader, who gained notoriety in 2009 when he earned a $100 million pay package from Citigroup, had until recently been one of the most bullish voices in the market.""This Andy Hall story sometimes can be just enough to get people to take at least a short-term move in the market,"" Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures Group, said by telephone. ""When you don't have a lot to go on, sometimes a headline like that can be enough to get a few people to cover and get a few computers to light up.""West Texas Intermediate for September delivery dropped 34 cents to $49.25 a barrel at 12:40 p.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was about 6% above the 100-day average. The contract advanced 43 cents to $49.59 on Wednesday.Brent for October settlement lost 10 cents to $52.26 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, after advancing 58 cents on Wednesday. The global benchmark crude traded at a premium of $2.85 to October-delivery WTI.Brent futures for the nearest delivery traded at a premium of 2 cents to those for the following month. This pattern, known as backwardation, typically signals tighter supplies, while the opposite contango structure signals a glut. The front-month spread had settled in backwardation on July 28 before flipping back to contango.U.S. production increased by 20,000 barrels a day to 9.43 million last week, the Energy Information Administration said Wednesday. Crude inventories fell by 1.53 million barrels, while gasoline stockpiles dropped to the lowest level since December. Gasoline consumption surged to a record high.""People have the sense that although visible inventories have tightened somewhat, that maybe the unmeasured inventories, floating inventories, have been moving now toward rebalancing,"" Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research in Winchester, Massachusetts, said by telephone.

225,O,"Movie producer Merian Cooper was a legend in Hollywood. He wrote and directed the 1933 classic film ""King Kong,"" arranged Katharine Hepburn's screen test, got David O. Selznick his first job as head producer, teamed Fred Astaire with Ginger Rogers, partnered with director John Ford to make John Wayne a star, and pioneered Technicolor.But it was his off-the-set activities that could have been turned into a blockbuster: He was nearly killed by a leopard in the jungles of Thailand, barely escaped being captured by pirates, and was a fighter-bomber pilot who was shot down and taken prisoner twice.""Coop was ready to go anywhere, anytime and accept any challenge,"" Wheeler Winston Dixon, professor of film studies at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln, told IBD. ""No matter what life or business fortunes dealt him, he remained an optimist and never lost his zest for life.""Cooper (1893-1973) was born in Jacksonville, Fla. When he was 6, he had Paul du Chaillu's ""Explorations and Adventures in Equatorial Africa"" read to him and decided he would become an explorer.First though, his father, a prominent lawyer, arranged an appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis, Md., in 1911. In his senior year, however, Cooper was kicked out for hard partying and too strongly advocating air power.In 1915, he became a newspaper reporter, then joined the Georgia National Guard to hunt the Mexican bandit and revolutionary Pancho Villa along the border, though Villa always eluded them.Back in Georgia, Cooper graduated first in his aeronautics class of 150 and in 1918 became a pilot in the Army Air Services, flying an American DH-4 Liberty. On Sept. 26, the Meuse-Argonne offensive began with the aerial bombing of enemy positions, but on the way back, the seven planes in Cooper's group were attacked by a dozen German Fokkers and Cooper's gunner-bomber Edmund Leonard was wounded and the plane caught fire. Cooper crash-landed near a German camp, where a doctor treated him for burns and Leonard for his wound.After the war, Cooper was promoted to captain and headed the division delivering aid to a newly independent Poland from Herbert Hoover's American Food Administration. In 1920, he recruited American volunteers to create a squadron to defend Poland from the first Russian effort to export its revolution. After 70 combat missions he was shot down in July and spent nine months in a prisoner-of-war camp before escaping to Latvia through a swamp.Back in the U.S. in 1921, he was assigned by a magazine to write articles about a sea voyage. He teamed with a friend from the Poland campaign, cinematographer Ernest Schoedsack, and they encountered headhunters in the Solomon Islands, met the charismatic future emperor, Haile Selassie, in Ethiopia, and got out of a trap set by pirates off Yemen.In 1924, Cooper, and Schoedsack set off on an expedition to film a migration of 5,000 tribesmen and 50,000 animals across frozen mountains and dangerous rivers in Persia, resulting in the landmark 1925 documentary ""Grass"" and a contract with Paramount Pictures. ""Chang"" in 1927 pioneered wildlife films by showing a Thai family's struggles to survive man-eating tigers and stampeding elephants, combining documentary with staged sequences. After spending a year among fighting tribes in the Sudan, their adaptation of the novel, ""The Four Feathers,"" was released in 1929, but Cooper had become disillusioned by the studio's interference.He returned to his other love, co-founding what would become Pan American Airways in 1927. The company lined up mail delivery monopolies for Latin America using seaplanes that could carry eight passengers. In 1931, it began flying Clippers, which were the epitome of luxurious international air travel.Living in New York City, Cooper spent his free time working on a movie treatment inspired by the gorillas he had seen on one of his trips. One day he looked up to see a plane flying above a skyscraper.""Without any conscious effort of thought I immediately saw in my mind's eye a giant gorilla on top of the building,"" he recalled. Civilization could be symbolized by the ""mightiest building in the world"" and nature personified in the gorilla would be defeated by ""the most modern of weapons, the airplane."" He also began thinking about a ""beauty and the beast"" plot.Paramount showed interest in Cooper's idea in 1931, but Hollywood had been hit hard by the Depression. Selznick had left the studio and come to New York to try to form an independent production company and Cooper introduced him to investors. But Louis B. Mayer of MGM threatened to prevent distribution, so Cooper set up a meeting with David Sarnoff, president of RCA, which owned the RKO studio. Selznick was hired as vice president of production and asked Cooper to be his assistant.In January 1932, Cooper gave Selznick the first draft of the screenplay for ""King Kong,"" the tale of how filmmaker Carl Denham (a thinly disguised Cooper) sails to Skull Island, where prehistoric monsters still live, captures Kong and brings him to New York for exhibition. Robert Armstrong would play Denham and Fay Wray was selected for the role of Ann Darrow, whom Kong is trying to protect when he takes her to the top of the Empire State Building (which had opened in 1931).On a sound stage, and with Schoedsack in the rear cockpit, Cooper would pilot the mock plane on that finally kills Kong. RKO's experimental stop-motion animation would bring all the monsters to life, but help drive the budget to $517,000 (equivalent to $9.5 million now).It was released in March 1933, during the nationwide ""bank holiday"" imposed by President Franklin Roosevelt to check the collapse of the banking system — caused by nervous depositors rushing to withdraw their funds. The economic strife did not deter the public, with 180,000 flocking to theaters in the first week to spend $100,000. In its initial release, the movie brought in $2 million (worth $36 million today). There have been countless remakes (notably ""King Kong"" in 2005), sequels (including ""Kong: Skull Island"" in 2017), parodies, cartoons, comics, books, video games, toys, and theme park rides (a Broadway musical has been announced for 2018). But there would be innumerable legal battles over who owned what rights, which largely prevented Cooper from benefiting."" 'King Kong' had been one of the great gambles in movie history,"" wrote Mark Vaz in ""Living Dangerously: The Adventures of Merian C. Cooper, Creator of King Kong."" ""It beguiled an entire generation and its financial returns marked the turning point for an entire industry that had recently bottomed out, but was back on an economic upswing. … Movie halls became a refuge during the Depression, ushering in the Golden Age of Hollywood. Kong's triumphant creator would be crowned in glory, raising him to the pinnacle of Hollywood power and influence.""Cooper had been named head of production, after Selznick left just before the release of ""Kong."" With an incentive of 20% profit participation, he aimed to lower the overhead per picture by dramatically speeding up production, while signing little-known actresses he thought would be audience magnets.He also began producing John Ford's movies, starting with ""The Lost Patrol"" and ""The Informer.""Cooper had invested in the Technicolor three-strip process and co-founded Pioneer Pictures in 1933. He directed its first full-length feature, ""Becky Sharp,"" in 1935, predicting with incredible prescience, that color would enable motion pictures to continue to attract audiences despite competition from TV, which was still in its infancy.In June 1941, at age 47 and seeing war as inevitable, he enlisted as a colonel in the Army Air Forces, serving as the logistics officer for the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo, setting up the airlift of supplies from India to China and acting as chief-of-staff to Gen. Claire Chennault in China, then chief-of-staff for the Fifth Air Force Bomber Command. Cooper, who finished his wartime service as a brigadier general, was on the battleship Missouri when the Japanese surrendered.Returning to Hollywood, in 1946 he partnered with Ford and they went on to make such John Wayne classics as ""Rio Grande,"" ""The Quiet Man,"" ""Fort Apache,"" ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon,"" and ""The Searchers.""""Cooper spent his final two decades pioneering Cinerama and other attempts to create more immersive theatrical experiences and was given an Academy Award for lifetime achievement in 1952,"" said Ivor Dawson, a film historian and president of the Traveling Space Museum. ""And long before man walked on the moon in 1969, this incurable adventurer was dreaming of commercial flights into the final frontier, outer space.""In 1960 Cooper received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame — though it got his first name wrong, misspelling it as ""Meriam.""He always saw the glass half-full and if something didn't work out, he moved on and didn't look back.Overcame: Enormous technical challenges to create ""King Kong.""Lesson: When you walk a tightrope, don't look down.""Keep it distant, difficult, and dangerous."" — motto of Merian C.

226,O,"Crude futures closed higher Wednesday but off their best levels as the U.S. government said domestic production kept rising, even as America's stockpiles fell sharply last week.Crude inventories fell by 7.6 million barrels last week, the Energy Information Administration said, though that was slightly less than the 8.1 million-barrel drawdown that the American Petroleum Institute estimated late Tuesday. Gasoline inventories fell by 1.6 million barrels, twice as much as API said.But U.S. production rose to 9.397 million barrels per day up from 9.338 million barrels in the prior week.U.S. crude rose just 1% to $45.49 a barrel, after being above $46 a barrel before the 10:30 a.m. ET report.Meanwhile, OPEC expects demand for its oil to fall next year as U.S. shale continues to be a formidable force in the global oil markets.According to its monthly oil market report out Wednesday, OPEC sees 2018 demand for its oil at 32.2 million barrels per day, down by 60,000 bpd from this year.OPEC cut production earlier this year in an effort to prop up prices by removing 1.8 million barrels of oil from the market daily.But the cartel's output climbed by 393,000 bpd last month to 32.611 million bpd on increased production out of Nigeria and Libya, which are exempt from the output deal. Nigeria said Wednesday it would be willing to consider a cap.OPEC and top nonmembers will meet in Russia on July 24 to discuss the effectiveness of the deal, as oil prices remain below the key $50 line. Officials from Libya and Nigeria may attend the meeting, according to a Reuters report.Exxon Mobil (XOM) rose 0.45% to 80.96 on the stock market today. Fellow Dow stock Chevron (CVX) was up 0.75%. BP (BP) jumped 1.5%. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) gained 0.9%.Among top shale producers, Continental Resources (CLR) and EOG Resources (EOG) fell 0.1% while Diamondback Energy (FANG) dipped 0.6%.Non-OPEC production continues to rise, and OPEC sees no signs of it stopping.The report said non-OPEC oil supply is expected to increase by 1.14 million bpd to 58.96 million bpd next year on growth out of the U.S., Brazil, Canada, Russia, Kazakhstan, Congo and the United Kingdom.But on Tuesday, EIA cut its 2018 U.S. crude output forecast by 1% to 9.90 million bpd. In June it expected 10.01 million bpd.Experts warn that shale won't be enough to make up for lack of investment in conventional drilling.International Energy Agency said Tuesday that underinvestment in new conventional projects will lead to a supply squeeze soon after investment in conventional oilfields hit the lowest level in over 70 years.On Monday, Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser echoed that sentiment at a conference in Istanbul, saying that shale and other energy resources, while important, weren't enough to replace conventional oil and gas operations, according to Reuters.RELATED: Crude Suffers Worst Loss In Month As Russia Says Nyet

227,O,"Crude oil prices briefly undercut $44 a barrel Tuesday morning, but a trio of energy reports sent crude futures close to $46 by Tuesday evening.Early Tuesday, the International Energy Agency warned Tuesday that underinvestment in new conventional projects will lead to a supply squeeze soon.X""A 17% decline in global energy investment since 2014 has not raised major concerns about near-term energy supply adequacy, which has been eased by excess capacity in global fossil-fuel supply,"" the IEA said in its World Energy Investment report.But investment in conventional oilfields hit the lowest level in over 70 years, which could ""lead to tighter supply in the near future.""Yet U.S. crude futures initially retreated more than 1% on a report that Saudi Arabia in June exceeded its production quotas for the first time since leading the push for new output curbs.But oil prices perked up, especially after the Energy Information Administration cut its 2018 U.S. crude output forecast by 1% to 9.90 million barrels a day. In June it expected 10.01 million BPD.Crude prices rebounded to close up 1.4% to $45.04 a barrel.But crude rose to $45.78 Tuesday evening after the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group estimated that U.S. crude supplies dried up by 8.1 million barrels, with gasoline stockpiles also down.The EIA will release official U.S. petroleum inventory and production figures on Wednesday morning. OPEC will release its monthly report earlier Wednesday.Exxon Mobil (XOM) rose 0.55% on the stock market today as Chevron (CVX) gained 0.1%. BP (BP) shares were up 0.1% after losing more than 1% intraday. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) rose 0.4%. All four oil majors rose slightly late Tuesday on the API figures.Electricity became the largest recipient of energy investment last year, ousting oil and gas for the top spot for the first time, according to the IEA's  report Tuesday.But while electricity is shining brightly, there are clouds on the horizon for oil and gas. On Monday, Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser warned conference attendees in Istanbul that shale and other energy resources, while important, weren't enough to replace conventional oil and gas operations, according to Reuters.""Financial investors are shying away from making much-needed large investments in oil exploration, long-term development and the related infrastructure,"" Nasser said.  ""Investments in smaller increments such as shale oil will just not cut it.""Shale operations are no longer for the little guys. Exxon Mobil and Chevron, both Dow industrial components, have said they wouldn't increase spending anytime soon but touted their increased investment in shale projects, especially in the Permian basin. Improved technology and discounts by oilfield service providers have made shale drilling more resilient during oil's price collapse.Upstream oil and gas costs fell 17% last year, and except for U.S. shale are expected to fall again this year on lower costs and improved operational efficiency.But the IEA warned that investment in conventional fields ""will need to rise to avoid a supply squeeze, even on optimistic assumptions about technology and the impact of climate polices on oil demand.""The agency expects upstream investment to rise by 3% in real terms this year after falling 44% between 2014 and 2016, as investment in U.S. shale rises 53%.Among top U.S. shale producers, Continental Resources (CLR) advanced 2.2% at the close. EOG Resources (EOG) rebounded for a 1.2% gain and Diamondback Energy (FANG) added 0.7%. Continental Resources, EOG Resources and Diamondback Energy, which are still near 2017 lows, rose slight in late trading on the API data.The future still looks bleak for coal despite President Trump's promises to bring back coal mining jobs. The IEA said investment in the coal supply fell by 11% last year.Overall energy investment fell by 12% in real terms last year.RELATED:Crude Pares Gains As U.S. Production Rises Most In 6 MonthsCrude Suffers Worst Loss In Month As Russia Says Nyet

238,O,"OPEC is likely to extend its production cuts at the group's biannual meeting Thursday, but questions remain on the duration, size and scope of the reduction, as giants like Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) join shale producers in the rush to pump more oil — and potentially send U.S. output to record highs later this year.In November, OPEC and top non-OPEC producers like Russia agreed to remove 1.8 million barrels of daily output off the market for six months starting in January. Prices rallied but then came back down as U.S. producers ramped up faster than expected and as inventories shrank slower than expected. By March, OPEC had started talking about extending the agreement by six months to the end of the year.OPEC's de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, along with Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Algeria and Venezuela, who collectively represent more than 80% of OPEC's output, have already said publicly that they support extending the cuts in some form.But Russia and Saudi Arabia have suggested taking the deal even further, saying they support extending the deal to March 2018.""There has been a marked reduction to the inventories, but we're not where we want to be in reaching the five-year average,"" Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said at a briefing in Beijing with Russia's Alexander Novak on May 15.On Saturday, al-Falih told Bloomberg that ""everybody"" he has talked to backs a nine-month extension. But on Monday, al-Falih reportedly visited his Iraqi counterpart in Baghdad to convince him to back a nine-month deal instead of a six-month one. Last year, Iraq had pushed to be exempt from the initial cut, saying it needed money to fight the Islamic State. It agreed to participate in the cuts but is considered a major cheater.The International Energy Agency warned last week that merely extending the deal won't be enough to bring markets in balance. Instead, deeper cuts are needed.And analysts at Citigroup have said there is a 60%-70% chance OPEC and its allies will announce an even deeper cut, taking 300,000-500,000 more barrels per day off the market.""An extension is in the bag,"" said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures Group. ""I would be shocked if it wasn't extended, and I wouldn't be surprised if OPEC announced an even bigger cut going forward.""On top of that, the scope of the output reductions could be broader, as Russia and Saudi Arabia are also pushing for non-OPEC members Turkmenistan and Egypt to participate in the next round. OPEC members Libya and Nigeria, which were exempt from reductions under the initial round, may participate in the next, while Iran, which was also shielded from cuts, has signaled it will maintain a cap on its output.In a note Monday, Goldman Sachs said a nine-month deal would help ""normalize OECD inventories"" by the start of next year. But the analysts warned that once the deal was over, stockpiles would start rising again.Goldman said that OEPC and its allies should ""gradually ramp up production to grow market share but keep stocks stable and backwardation in place,"" referring to the situation when a commodities' future contract price is below the current spot price.""Low forward prices could curtail shale's growth by reducing the ability to secure future cash flows and attract funding,"" Goldman said.Talk of more-aggressive moves has helped lift crude prices, with U.S. oil topping $50 a barrel again after rising 5% in the past week. Brent is now at a one-month high, above $53 a barrel.But OPEC members whose governments rely heavily on oil revenue need a higher price than that to stay out of red ink. Saudi Arabia's ""fiscal break-even"" price is $83.80 a barrel, according to an IMF report last month. Oman's is $79.20, Libya's is $71.30, and the United Arab Emirates' is $67. Others are in better shape, with Iraq's at $54.30, Iran's at $51.30 and Kuwait's at $49.10Meanwhile, U.S. producers learned during the oil crash how to become leaner and operate within cash flow at lower oil prices. They don't need to support government coffers either and are poised to boost production further if OPEC manages to raise crude prices again.Companies in the Permian Basin have break-even prices of $34 in some areas, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Earlier this month, EOG Resources (EOG) said it could hit its target of an 18% increase in oil production, while operating in its cash flow, if oil averages $47 per barrel this year.And Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) said recently that its break-even oil price is just $20 a barrel, and the company could make ""good returns"" at $40 oil. Plus, deep-pocketed heavyweights like Chevron, Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) plan to focus more spending this year on U.S. shale plays.That leaves OPEC with another dilemma, but one it is unlikely to resolve next week, if ever.""There is of yet no long-term strategy for dealing with shale oil, so any rebalancing will be temporary,"" Omar Al-Ubaydli, an affiliated senior research fellow at George Mason University, said.U.S. production fell in the prior week for the first time since February, according to the Energy Information Administration. But output is on pace to top the April 2015 peak of 9.61 million barrels per day by July, and Flynn has said it could even reach 10 million barrels per day by August.Still, Flynn is more bullish on OPEC's future, noting that it takes time to boost production from unconventional wells due to their steep rate of decline, whereas traditional wells like those in Saudi Arabia can produce at a high rate for several years.""Even now with shale's resurgence, as demand grows in the coming years (OPEC) feels that because of the lack of investment in more traditional projects by oil companies, they will have a leg up in being able to ramp up production to meet demand in the future,"" he said.RELATED:EOG Shows Why It's The 'Apple Of Oil' With Gusher Of Mobile Apps, Data

Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) ended flat.Among shale producers, Continental Resources (CLR) fell 0.85%, EOG Resources (EOG) lost 0.9% and Diamondback Energy (FANG) dropped 2.1%.On Monday, the Russian and Saudi oil ministers supported extending the current output cut to remove 1.8 million barrels per day (BPD) from the market for nine more months to help balance supply and demand.But the International Energy Agency said Tuesday that just extending the cuts wouldn't be enough to bring markets in balance.Global supply fell by 140,000 BPD last month, to 96.17 million BPD. But crude stockpiles in OECD countries rose for the first time since January, according to the monthly report out Tuesday.An increase in U.S. shale output has limited the effectiveness of the producers' deal. Domestic output is on pace to hit a new high in July and possibly even 10 million BPD in August, according to analysts.On Monday the EIA said that production from seven major U.S. shale plays should jump by 122,000 BPD to 5.401 million in June from the prior month.RELATED: Halliburton, GE Among Firms Seen Getting Saudi Energy Deals

246,O,"Crude futures fell sharply Wednesday on higher stockpiles in the U.S. and other rich nations despite the OPEC production deal. Dow Jones industrial average components Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) fell, with BP (BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) also were testing support levelsX Inventories jumped by 18.6 million barrels in OECD countries in April, meaning the total is above the five-year average by 292 million barrels and higher than before OPEC's production-cut deal in November, according to the International Energy Agency's monthly report.But for May, the IEA said stockpiles seem to be falling in Japan, Europe and Singapore, but are still rising in the U.S. and China.In a separate report, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said U.S. crude stockpiles fell by 1.7 million barrels last week, short of the 2.7 million barrels decrease analysts were expecting. Gasoline inventories rose by 2.1 million barrels.A report from the American Petroleum Institute last Tuesday that said U.S. oil stockpiles rose by 2.8 million barrels last week.Domestic oil production rose to 9.33 million barrels per day up from 9.318 million barrels, EIA also said Wednesday.U.S. crude futures closed down 3.7% to $44.73 a barrel, hitting a seven-month low. Gasoline futures sank 4.5% to their lowest levels since late November.Shares of Exxon Mobil dropped 1.1% on the stock market today and Chevron lost 1.4%. But the Dow closed higher as techs retreated following the Fed's hawkish policy statement. Exxon and Chevron found support at their 50-day lines.Royal Dutch Shell dropped 1.3%, closing just above its 50-day line. and BP declined 1.8%, just below its 50-day. The European oil majors have been trading better than Exxon and Chevron in recent months.Last month, OPEC and top nonproducers decided to extend their production cut to remove 1.8 million barrels per day from the market until March 2018 in an effort to push stockpiles below the five-year average.But U.S. producers, like Continental Resources (CLR), EOG Resources (EOG) and Diamondback Energy (FANG) have continued to pump, reducing the impact the OPEC cuts had on the market. The IEA sees U.S. supply rising by 430,000 barrels a day this year and by 780,000 barrels a day next year.Continental Resources fell 5.2%, while EOG lost 1.8% and Diamondback 3.3%.In OPEC's monthly report Tuesday, the cartel's production climbed 1% to 32.14 million barrels in May on increases from Libya, Nigeria and Iraq. Iraq's output last month rose by 44,000 barrels a day to 4.4 million barrels per day.But on Monday, de facto OPEC leader Saudi Arabia said it would cut shipments to Asia in July by 300,000 barrels per day, according to Reuters sources.

247,O,"Oil futures rallied Monday after the Saudi and Russian energy minsters threw their support behind extending output cuts by another nine months, but markets received another reminder that U.S. producers could undermine the deal as shale companies find ways to turn profits at lower prices.The Energy Information Agency said Monday afternoon that production from seven major U.S. shale plays should jump by 122,000 barrels a day to 5.401 million in June from the prior month. Total U.S. production was 9.31 million barrels a day during the week ended May 5, EIA said last week.U.S. crude futures gave up some earlier gains but still settled 2.1% higher at $48.85 a barrel.Exxon Mobil (XOM) shares were up 0.3% on the stock market today. Chevron (CVX) climbed 0.8%. BP (BP) added 0.9%. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) gained 0.6%.The ministers back a plan to extend the current deal to remove 1.8 million barrels per day from the market until March 2018. The original deal, struck back in November 2016, originally was to last six months. A decision to extend the deal is expected at the biannual OPEC meeting on May 25.Saudi Arabia and Russia are also pushing for other countries to join the pact including non-OPEC participants Turkmenistan and Egypt, according sources cited by the Wall Street Journal. ""There has been a marked reduction to the inventories, but we're not where we want to be in reaching the five-year average,"" Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said at a briefing in Beijing with Russia's Alexander Novak.But an extension of the deal still might not be enough to balance markets.U.S. producers are a major reason for the lack of meaningful declines in stockpiles. Domestic output is on pace to hit a new high in July and possibly even 10 million barrels per day in August, according to analysts.Shale producer Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) said recently its break-even oil price is just $20 a barrel, and the company could make ""good returns"" at $40 dollar oil.EOG Resources (EOG) said it could increase production by 18% while operating within cash flow if oil averages $47 per barrel this year.But Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures Group, was upbeat on the prospect of an extension and thinks oil prices will hit $73 a barrel by the end of the year.""But now with rising demand and a commitment by Russia and Saudi Arabia to extend cuts, we could see the recent 5 week drop in U.S. oil inventories continue for the foreseeable future,"" he wrote in his daily Energy Report newsletter.""Add the potential default of Venezuelan bonds and the upcoming Iranian election, and we could see more support as prices get back what they gave back in the month of April. The extension of the cuts may drive global inventories below the five-year average as demand starts to rise.""Goldman analysts said in a note that while the support for an extension helped boost oil prices, ""the rally so far today has remained modest compared to the move that occurred last year when the OPEC cuts were first announced.""The deal still needs two things for it to work, according to Goldman: high compliance and low enough long term prices that will stop U.S. shale producers from putting more rigs to work.Goldman sees long term oil prices at $45-$55 per barrel, but U.S. producers have already said they plan to boost production at those prices.RELATED:

"
249,O,"OPEC's production declined last month, but the cartel expects non-OPEC producers to increase oil output by nearly 1 million barrels per day this year.In its monthly oil report out Thursday, OPEC said it sees non-OPEC production this year growing by 950,000 barrels per day, with projected U.S. oil production growth of 600,000 barrels per day. Just last month, total non-OPEC growth was put at 580,000 barrels a day, with 540,000 from the U.S.OPEC also raised its overall U.S. liquids production by 285,000 barrels a day to 820,000.Accounting for most of the upward revision is non-U.S. output. OPEC raised its growth forecast for Canada by 220,000 barrels a day and Brazil's by 210,000. But it sees contractions from Mexico and China.Despite a decline in capital spending, U.S. producers have been bullish on production increases in their first-quarter reports. And on Tuesday, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) raised its full-year U.S. oil production forecast for 2018 yet again, to 9.96 million barrels per day, the highest annual per-day output since the agency started keeping records in 1859.U.S. crude finished 1.1% up at $47.83, the highest close since May 1. Oil prices got a lift from Saudi Arabia announcing it would cut supplies to Asian customers by 7 million barrels next month.Thursday's gains followed surges on Wednesday, when the EIA said U.S. inventories fell by 5.2 million barrels last week vs. the 1.8 million barrel decline analysts expected.Exxon Mobil (XOM) shares rose 0.85% on the stock market today. Chevron (CVX) fell 0.3%. BP (BP) was up 0.6%. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) edged up 0.1%.Production growth in U.S. and other non-OPEC producers could make OPEC's plan to curtail production to balance oil markets ineffective. Still, OPEC and its allies are likely to extend and possibly deepen their current output cut agreement to remove 1.8 million barrels of oil from the market.OPEC's production last month fell by 18,000 barrels per day, according to secondary sources cited in OPEC's report, to 31.73 million barrels per day. Production fell in the UAE, Libya, Iraq and Iran, but rose in Saudi Arabia and Angola, with Saudi Arabia's output up nearly 50,000 barrels a day.Analysts still see benefits from extending the cut.An extension of the deal would push supply down even further in the second half of the year, the International Energy Agency's Neil Atkinson said at the Platts Crude Oil Summit in London on Wednesday.OPEC monthly report also found that world oil supply growth for the year was increased by 37,000 barrels per day with supply to now average 58.3 million barrels per day. World oil demand growth for 2017 was left unchanged at 1.27 million barrels per day.RELATED: As Oil Crashes, This Chart Shows Why OPEC Is TrappedEOG Shows Why It's The 'Apple Of Oil' With Gusher Of Mobile Apps, Data

250,O,"Oil prices bounced between positive and negative territory Monday even as OPEC reportedly considers making deeper production cuts, in addition to prolonging them into next year.Four anonymous OPEC delegates told Bloomberg that some members could deepen output cuts past the current 1.8 million barrels daily to help rebalance the oil market.Earlier, Russia and Saudi Arabia spoke in support of extending the current cuts past their June 30 expiration into 2018, and Kuwaiti Energy Minister Essam al-Marzouq also said there ""is almost consensus about the importance of extending the agreement for at least six months,"" adding that his country supports it.A 2018 timeline is especially key to Saudi Arabia, as it shops around Saudi Aramco's initial public offering, which is expected next year. Higher oil prices could boost demand for Aramco shares, and proceeds from the IPO are needed to fund the kingdom's economic reform agenda.U.S. crude futures finished the day up 0.5% at $46.43 per barrel as markets weighed the credibility of deeper and prolonged cuts as well as the prospect that any efforts to boost prices will only encourage U.S. producers to add more supply.Exxon Mobil (XOM) edged up 1.1% to close at 82.89 on the stock market today. Chevron (CVX) rose 0.8% to 106.68, BP (BP) added 0.4% to 35.43 and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) edged up 0.5% to 54.48.Late last year, OPEC and top non-OPEC members like Russia agreed to trim production for six months to ease the worldwide inventory glut and prop up prices.Early Monday, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said he was ""rather confident the agreement will be extended into the second half of the year and possibly beyond"" at a talk at the Asia Oil and Gas Conference in Kuala Lumpur as the cartel looks to hit its target of lower stockpiles to the five-year average.Hours later, the Kremlin followed up with a similar remark.""We are discussing a number of scenarios and believe extension for a longer period will help speed up market rebalancing,"" Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said in a statement, according to Bloomberg.OPEC will discuss extending the deal at its next meeting on May 25.Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group, wrote in his morning energy report that he expects a drop in crude inventories and a balanced market if OPEC extends its deal by at least six months.Still, rising U.S. production has reduced the effectiveness of the output deal and U.S. companies have lowered their breakeven prices on improved drilling techniques and service cost reductions.U.S. output is on pace to exceed peak production levels in July and could hit 10 million barrels per day in August, according to analysts, and U.S. shale producers reported bullish production outlooks for the second quarter and the year last week.RELATED: Shale Producer Eyes Drilling With Artificial IntelligenceAs Oil Crashes, This Chart Shows Why OPEC Is Trapped

251,O,"Recent device analysis by Chipworks points to several semiconductor winners, Susquehanna Financial Group said in a report Wednesday.Those winners include Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM); Texas Instruments (TXN); ON Semiconductor (ON); and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), which is being purchased by Qualcomm (QCOM), Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland said in a report.Maxim gained significant market share in audio amplifiers in the first half of the year, helped by contract wins at Huawei, the giant Chinese tech firm. It also is being used in Samsung's flagship Galaxy S8 smartphone, Susquehanna said.Texas Instruments has been gaining power-management chip content in Chinese smartphones. It also won business in security cameras, game consoles, solid-state drives, routers and set-top boxes, the investment bank said.ON Semi has gained in power-management chips in PCs, handsets and other devices as well as in rapid-charge components in handsets. Plus, ON Semi is benefiting from the growth of devices with USB Type-C connections, Susquehanna said.NXP has been dominating the near-field communications chip market. It captured about 80% of NFC sockets in the first half of 2017, Susquehanna said.Ambarella (AMBA) stock dived below its 50-day moving average, a key support level, in bearish fashion on Wednesday after the maker of video-processing chips gave disappointing sales guidance for the current quarter late Tuesday.Ambarella reported better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter results, but offered weak revenue guidance for its fiscal Q2.The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company earned 39 cents a share excluding items, up 15% year over year, on sales of $64.1 million, up 12%, in the quarter ended April 30. Analysts expected 36 cents and $63.5 million.For the current quarter ending July 31, Ambarella expects revenue of $69 million to $72 million, below Wall Street's consensus estimate of $72.35 million. The midpoint of its guidance would be an increase of 8% year over year.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks now features nine chip-industry players including Nvidia and Microchip Technology.Most of the revenue shortfall in fiscal Q2 is related to weakness in its drone camera business.Ambarella is working to diversify its business from action cameras and drone cameras for customers like GoPro (GPRO) and DJI and into more internet-enabled security cameras, law-enforcement cameras and automotive cameras.Ambarella stock was down 10.25% to 53.60 on the stock market today. The stock peaked at 129.19 in July 2015 when GoPro wearable action cameras were a hot item.Investment bank Stifel reiterated its buy rating on Ambarella stock, but trimmed its price target to 64 from 65 on Wednesday.Needham maintained its hold rating on Ambarella on Wednesday.""Despite a weaker outlook for drones, the rest of Ambarella's business is performing strongly,"" Needham analyst Quinn Bolton said in a report. ""The company saw strong revenue growth in IP security cameras, both in professional and home monitoring, body-worn police cameras, and auto (equipment manufacturer) video recorders. … Additionally, Ambarella is seeing strong initial traction for 360-degree cameras and virtual-reality solutions, but notes it is still too early to forecast the size of this opportunity.""RELATED:This IBD 50 Chip Stock Just Notched A Record High, Here's Why

257,O,"X Stock futures were little changed early Thursday morning. The same can't be said about Snap (SNAP), which plunged as revenue and user growth fell short as much-larger Facebook (FB) clones the upstart social network's most-popular features. Meanwhile, Merck (MRK), a member of the Dow Jones industrial average, rallied on a new win for its immunotherapy blockbuster Keytruda.Futures for the Dow industrials, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 edged lower. In Wednesday's regular session, the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 index rose slightly, while the Dow dipped on Boeing (BA) and Walt Disney (DIS).Snap shares plunged 23% to 17.68 in after-hours trading. That would be a post-IPO trading low and not far from the actual IPO price of 17.Snapchat's revenue surged to $150 million, but that was below views for $157.8 million. Average revenue per user fell vs. the fourth quarter. Perhaps most worrying: User growth was sluggish and missed forecasts.IBD'S TAKE: Snap never hit a proper buy point before Wednesday night's tumble. Before Snap began trading, IBD cautioned investors about how to play Snap and IPOs generally.Facebook has been ramping up Instagram Stories, aping the popular Snapchat Stories. Snapchat has 166 million users while Instagram Stories has topped 200 million in short order.Facebook's other properties, including WhatsApp and its main site, also are adopting key Snapchat features. And those efforts only gained momentum in the current second quarter.Snapchat's core, lucrative audience — North American teens and young adults — may be secure, but Facebook may be able to keep Snap within that niche.Facebook shares rose fractionally in late trading, close to recent record highs.Meanwhile, Merck shot up 3.1% to 65.90 in after-hours action. Merck appears set to open close to a potential buy point of 66.90. During the regular session, Merck rose 1%, retaking its 50-day line.Late Wednesday, the FDA approved Keytruda to treat metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer when paired with chemotherapy.

258,O,"As the mad dash back to the U.S. oil patch has even global oil giants like Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) turning their focus to shale, U.S. oil production is on pace to exceed peak production levels in July and could hit 10 million barrels per day in August.Those milestones loom as OPEC and top non-OPEC producers weigh whether to extend by another six months their agreement to reduce output by 1.8 million barrels a day. The cartel's next meeting is scheduled for May 25.The initial pact reached late last year lifted oil prices and encouraged U.S. producers to pump more oil. The extra supply has since weighed on prices, which have fallen more than 10% since the start of the year. But hedges allowed U.S. firms to lock in the higher, earlier prices, and they have continued ramping up output.U.S. crude futures sank 4.8% to settle at $45.52 a barrel on Thursday, plunging to a five-month low and dropping below the price seen before OPEC reached its production pact in late November.While an extension of OPEC's deal could spur even more U.S. activity, member countries that rely heavily on oil revenue to fund government coffers may have no choice but to try propping up prices again.Meanwhile, shale leaders like Diamondback Energy (FANG), Continental Resources (CLR) and EOG Resources (EOG) have also improved their efficiency via new technology and techniques, allowing them to pump profitably even at lower prices.The Energy Information Administration said Wednesday that U.S. crude production hit 9.29 million barrels a day last week. Since October, domestic output has risen by roughly 112,000 barrels per month, putting production on track to top the April 2015 peak of 9.61 million barrels per day by July. Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group, said U.S. production could reach 10 million barrels per day in August.Tracking the rise in U.S. output, the U.S. oil rig count is up by 365 year-over-year at 697 rigs, according to Baker Hughes (BHI) data, and has risen for 15 straight weeks with only one down week so far this year.Much of the recent growth in production and rigs in operation is coming from the Permian Basin, but the DJ Niobrara and Bakken shale formations farther north could see renewed investment as well, said Robert W. Baird senior oil and gas analyst Daniel Katzenberg.But Flynn warned that the biggest threat to U.S. shale is its own success, noting that as production increases, the additional activity could lead to higher costs and less money for shale producers to spend on drilling. A lack of pipelines and other transportation channels could also weigh.And shale production could also take a hit if OPEC and its allies decide not to extend their production deal. Markets have already priced in an extension, and analysts have said that failure to reach a deal could send crude down to $40 a barrel.Despite possible short-term setbacks, U.S. production is expected to trend higher in the long run.In a report last week, the International Energy Agency predicted that liquids production from U.S. shale plays will expand by 2.3 million barrels per day by 2022 at current prices, and could grow more if prices rise further.Still, IEA points out that conventional oil accounts for 69 million barrels per day out of total global oil production of 85 million, with just 6.5 million from U.S. shale, warning that shale gains may not offset declines in conventional resources due to underinvestment.""I worry that we will get too complacent with the increase in shale production at the expense of conventional and other higher-cost drilling and will see a future price shock down the road,"" Flynn said.RELATED: Pioneer Natural Resources Beats But Costs Rise; Continental, Concho MixedExxon, Chevron Signal Stalling Investment As Oil Prices Lose Momentum

259,O,"E-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) broke out to a record high Wednesday, a day after the company unveiled a new grocery service and also announced an acquisition that gives it a big foothold in the Middle East.Amazon stock jumped 2% to end regular trading at 874.32 on the stock market today. On Tuesday, Amazon fired another salvo at Wal-Mart (WMT) and other brick-and-mortar retailers with a new service designed for time-sensitive shoppers who buy groceries on the internet.Called AmazonFresh Pickup, the service allows consumers to order groceries online and then collect their purchases from a physical location at a convenient time. The AmazonFresh Pickup locations are in test mode and available to current employees only but will ultimately be available for Amazon Prime members.Cowen analyst John Blackledge in a research note late Tuesday applauded the grocery move, saying it was ""the biggest potential source of revenue upside.""Blackledge maintained an outperform rating on Amazon and price target of 1050.In addition to the grocery pickup venture, Amazon on Tuesday also announced that it reached a deal to acquire Dubai-based Souq.com, one of the largest e-commerce companies in the Middle East.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon is one of the closely watched FANG stocks, the others being Facebook, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet. You can get the latest news and stock quotes at IBD's FANG page.The acquisition price was not disclosed, though media reports say Amazon's offer was below a competing bid of $800 million by Dubai billionaire Mohamed Alabbar, owner of Emaar Malls. Souq.com is an English and Arabic language e-commerce platform often called the Amazon of the Middle East.Amazon's main international markets currently are Germany, Japan and the U.K.""We do note that using an acquisition to enter a geographic region is a new strategy,"" wrote Pacific Crest Securities analyst Edward Yruma in a research note. ""Amazon has built its business in India from the ground up over years and just launched Amazon Prime in India last summer.""Yruma said both Amazon and Wal-Mart are enhancing product and geographic offering though acquisitions.Amazon on Wednesday also said it will shut down the diaper and soap-selling websites it acquired for $545 million in 2010.The division it's shutting down is Quidsi, which includes Diapers.com and Soap.com.""We have worked extremely hard for the past seven years to get Quidsi to be profitable, and unfortunately we have not been able to do so,"" Amazon said in a statement. ""Quidsi has great brand expertise and they will continue to offer selection on Amazon.com; the software development team will focus on building technology for AmazonFresh.""Amazon acquired Quidsi from co-founders Marc Lore and Vinit Bharara in September. Lore went on to create e-commerce site and Amazon competitor Jet.com, which Wal-Mart acquired for $3.3 billion in September. Lore is now CEO of Wal-Mart's e-commerce operation.Wal-Mart stock was up o.6%, to 70.74.RELATED:Macy's Breaks Support As Amazon, Wal-Mart Squeeze RetailersSamsung Joins Digital Assistant Fray To Take On Amazon, Alphabet

260,O,"Saudi Arabia is slashing crude exports to the U.S. as part of the OPEC deal to reduce production and others in the region may follow, according to a report, as record-high domestic crude stockpiles weigh on prices.Exports to the U.S. will drop by 300,000 barrels per day this month with the reduced rate staying at that level for few months, a Saudi energy ministry official told Reuters, adding that other Persian Gulf producers could lower their output to the U.S. in March too and then make further cuts.U.S. crude futures settled down 0.7% at $47.70 a barrel, and Brent crude dipped 0.2% to $50.56.Dow Jones industrial component Exxon Mobil (XOM) closed up 0.1% on the stock market today.

U.S. production rose 0.2% to 9.129 million barrels per day, the highest level since February 2016, according to the Energy Department's Energy Information Administration report out Wednesday.Meanwhile, inventory surged by 5 million barrels to 533 million, excluding the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.RELATED: Why OPEC, Russia May Be Desperate Enough To Help U.S. ShaleOil Rigs Hit Highest Since September 2015; More Mixed Signals From Saudis

263,O,"Oil futures rose Wednesday as the International Energy Agency expects a bigger supply deficit if the OPEC output agreement is extended, while other data showed a big U.S. weekly inventory drop. But booming U.S. shale production could offset that.The production cut by OPEC and its allies had reduced some of the supply glut and an extension of the deal would push supply down even further in the second half of the year, the IEA's Neil Atkinson said at the Platts Crude Oil Summit in London on Wednesday.""It is starting to become clear that if the objective of the OPEC cuts was to flip the market from surplus into deficit that is now slowly beginning to happen,"" he said.Meanwhile, the Energy Information Administration said inventories fell by 5.2 million barrels last week. The American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, said late Tuesday that inventories fell by 5.8 million barrels. Analysts had expected a decline of 1.8 million barrels.U.S. crude futures jumped 3.2% to settle at $47.33 a barrel. Oil prices have been under pressure in May.Exxon Mobil (XOM) shares were down 0.5% on the stock market today. Chevron (CVX) was up 1.35%. BP (BP) dipped 1%. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) climbed 1.4%.The production deal extension is widely expected to happen. Saudi and Russian officials have said the cuts could even be extended into 2018 and may even be deeper than the current cut to remove 1.8 million barrels per day from the market. The official decision is expected at the OPEC meeting on May 25.But shale could derail OPEC's plans. U.S. producers are raising their drilling 2017 spending outlooks by 32% to $84 billion vs. only a 3% increase for international projects, according to Barclays report cited by Bloomberg.The U.S. is on track to top its peak of 9.61 million barrels in July and to hit 10 million barrels per day in August. Production rose to 9.31 million barrels per day, up from 9.29 million barrels a week ago, according to the EIA.On Tuesday, the EIA raised its full-year U.S. oil production forecast for 2018 yet again, to 9.96 million barrels per day, the highest annual per-day output since the agency started keeping records in 1859.Top oil trader Vitol Group also told Bloomberg that demand isn't growing as much as anticipated, while U.S. shale production is growing faster than expected.U.S. oil companies have used the downturn to become leaner and more productive at lower oil prices. On Tuesday, EOG Resources (EOG) it could hit its 18% output increase while in its cash flow if oil averages $47 per barrel this year.Also Tuesday, Carrizo Oil & Gas (CRZO) raised its 2017 production target to 32,400-32,700 barrels per day from a prior outlook of 31,400-31,900 after reporting a 12% jump in oil production in Q1 vs. the year-ago quarter.Sanchez Energy (SN) said current Q2 production levels are 46% higher than the average in Q1. CEO Tony Sanchez said in a release that the company expects ""operating cash flow and margins to increase through the remainder of the year.""Individual OPEC countries are struggling more than others during the output cut.Protests, rival factions and terrorist attacks aren't the only issues hurting Libya's production. Mustafa Sanallah, chairman of state run National Oil, told the Wall Street Journal that a dispute with German producer Wintershall is causing the shut down of 20% of Libya's oil.Libya, along with Nigeria, is exempt from the current OPEC output cut agreement. Libya said it can reach 1.2 million bpd later this year, further weakening the production pact.RELATED: EOG Shows Why It's The 'Apple Of Oil' With Gusher Of Mobile Apps, Data

264,O,"Exelixis (EXEL) is taking a page out of Incyte's (INCY) playbook, teaming up with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Roche (RHHBY) to test its Cabometyx and their immuno-oncology (I-O) drugs in liver and bladder cancer.In the stock market today, Exelixis stock flirted with a 16-year-plus high it touched on Tuesday, as the company announced its collaborations with Bristol-Myers and Roche. Shares came within 10 cents of eclipsing that Tuesday high of 23.49, rising 6.5% to 23.09. It helped lift IBD's 423-company Biomed/Biotech industry group 4.2%, as did 7%-plus gains by Bluebird Bio (BLUE) and Cara Therapeutics (CARA).""Planned phase 3 trials, if successful, could support potential label expansion for Cabometyx in several additional indications, including first-line kidney cancer, bladder cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and potentially other tumor types,"" Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt said in a research note.Cabometyx inhibits tyrosine kinases and VEGFR2 receptors to slow tumor growth, metastasis and angiogenesis. It is approved as a monotherapy for second-line advanced renal cell carcinoma.I-O partnerships are nothing new. Merck (MRK) is testing out its PD-1 inhibitor Keytruda in conjunction with Incyte's IDO inhibitor epacadostat (not yet approved) in five tumor types. Bristol-Myers also has teamed up with Horizon Pharma (HZNP) in advanced solid tumors.IBD'S TAKE: There are more than 1,000 I-O trials underway right now, analysts estimate. But only a small handful of I-O drugs have actually been approved. Who's leading the sector in terms of approvals? Head to IBD's Technology page for the best opportunities in I-O.Exelixis and Bristol will focus on first-line RCC and have trials planned in HCC and bladder cancer, the companies said Monday. Exelixis' outside-U.S./Japan partner Ipsen will participate in the RCC trial. Exelixis' Japan partner Takeda Pharmaceuticals has the opportunity to do so.Partnering in the phase 3 trial will help Exelixis shave off some costs, Schmidt wrote. Exelixis' Cabometyx will be combined with Bristol's Opdivo and Yervoy — respectively, PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors.""While detailed economics with Bristol-Myers were not disclosed in the press release, Exelixis may potentially end up paying as little as 20%-25% of these trial costs given the 50-50 cost split with Bristol-Myers,"" he wrote.Exelixis and Roche will combine Cabometyx and Tecentriq, a PD-L1 inhibitor, in a phase 1b escalation study in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors, they said. The trials will begin enrolling in mid-2017.The trial will look at first-line advanced clear cell RCC and three cohorts of urothelial carcinoma. Exelixis will sponsor the study with Roche contributing Tecentriq. Ipsen will participate and contribute 35% of the costs.

267,O,"Dow component Merck (MRK) rose above the fray during a month-over-month decrease in immuno-oncology sales throughout the industry, swiping share from rival Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) as Roche (RHHBY) remained flat, industry analysts said Wednesday.Four immuno-oncology drugs from Merck, Bristol-Myers and Roche brought in $464 million in February, declining 4% from $483 million in January, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said, citing data from tracker Symphony Health.But February was a shorter month, which could be partly responsible for the decrease, Fernandez said in a research report. Despite the slowdown, Merck's Keytruda sales grew 2% in February vs. the prior month.Meanwhile, Bristol-Myers' drugs Opdivo and Yervoy held on to a collective 69% market share, falling 1% vs. January. Merck's Keytruda now has 24% of the market, up from 23% the prior month. Roche's Tecentriq was flat at 7% share.Immuno-oncology drugs fight cancer by teaching the body's immune system to identify cancer cells hiding behind specific proteins. Those proteins are called checkpoints.A number of checkpoints are being explored by AstraZeneca (AZN), Incyte (INCY) and others. Keytruda and Opdivo, the immuno-oncology market leaders, are also direct rivals. Both target the interaction between a PD-1 protein on an immune system cell and the PD-L1 protein on a cancer cell. Doing so allows the immune system to identify and destroy the cancer cell.Both are approved to treat advanced lung cancer, melanoma, head and neck cancer, and classical Hodgkin lymphoma. Opdivo is also approved in kidney cancer and bladder cancer.Yervoy, from Bristol-Myers, targets the CTLA-4 checkpoint. Roche's Tecentriq targets the PD-L1 protein on a cancer cell. Yervoy is approved to treat melanoma. Tecentriq is approved in lung cancer and bladder cancer.IBD'S TAKE: What if your body could fight off cancer the way it fights common germs? It's happening. Head to IBD's Technology page for a breakdown on these new drugs.Merck's Keytruda saw a spike in sales in July 2016 after a key trial showed Keytruda is superior to chemotherapy in improving progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with advanced lung cancer. The trial was stopped early on strong efficacy.Keytruda was approved in October for first-line advanced lung cancer for patients with a heavier concentrations of PD-L1 protein in their systems. Since then, ""we continue to see a steady increase in U.S. sales estimates and market share,"" Fernandez said.Tecentriq is also putting additional pressure on Opdivo following its approval as a second-line treatment for some advanced lung cancer patients in October, he said. But growth in Opdivo's newer approvals (liver cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma, head and neck cancer, and bladder cancer) should help offset that trend.Merck stock finished 0.6% lower at 63.50 on the stock market today, as shares of Bristol-Myers rose 1.2% to 56.36. Roche stock edged up 0.4% to 31.55.RELATED:These Are The First Immune-System Cancer Drugs OK'd By FDAMerck Could Be Nearing This Rival With Another Keytruda ApprovalMerck, Roche Gouge Bristol's I-O Share After Lung Cancer Approvals

269,O,"Saudi Arabia said it raised its crude output last month, a week after officials with the world's top oil exporter warned U.S. shale executives last week not to automatically assume a deal to trim production would be extended. The news sent U.S. crude futures lower for a seventh straight session.Saudi Arabia said it raised its oil production to 10.011 million barrels per day in February, up 2.7% from January, but still under the 10.05 million-barrel target the country agreed to under a production-cut deal reached last year between OPEC and top non-OPEC countries.But the number conflicted with figures OPEC derived from other sources, showing Saudi production falling by 68,100 barrels a day to 9.8 million barrels per day.After rallying before the OPEC data were released, U.S. crude closed down 1.4% to $47.72 a barrel, their lowest levels since late November. But prices rallied a bit in late trading after the American Petroleum Institute reported a decline of 531,000 barrels in U.S. oil inventories last week, while analysts expected a surge of 3.5 million barrels.Dow Jones industrial average component Exxon Mobil (XOM) shares dipped 0.5% to 80.99 on the stock market today.

BP (BP) retreated 1.9%, while Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) slid 2%.The OPEC report comes as Saudi energy minister Khalid Al-Falih told attendees at IHS's CERAWeek energy conference in Houston last week that the output deal is ""so far so good,"" but his country ""will not bear the burden of free rides"" by others in the agreement.Saudi officials also had a closed-door meeting with executives from top shale producers including ConocoPhillips (COP), EOG Resources (EOG) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY) warning that the producers should not assume the cartel will extend the output cuts, according to a Reuters report.Meanwhile, as U.S. shale rebounds, the additional supply will weigh further on crude prices. OPEC raised its growth forecast for U.S. oil production, now seeing an increase this year of 340,000 barrels per day, up by 100,000 barrels from a prior outlook.The bearish signs for oil come as OPEC members start pushing to extend their six-month production deal for another six months.While Saudi Arabia's Al-Falih said it was too early to decide on extend the output cuts, Iraq has signaled it wants an extension. And Kuwait's oil minister said Monday his country wants to extend the OPEC output cuts as U.S. stockpiles rose more than the cartel was expecting, according to the state run news agency Kuna.Iran said Tuesday it would stick to its end of the production deal, if the rest of OPEC does as well.""If OPEC members stay committed to the agreement (on freezing output), Iran will produce 3.8 million BPD of oil in (the) second half of the current year,"" Bijan Namdar Zanganeh was quoted as saying by state news agency IRNA, Reuters reported.RELATED: Why Oil Prices May Come Under Even More Pressure Next Month

272,O,"Tesaro (TSRO) stock crashed as Clovis Oncology (CLVS) bounded to a 16-month high Tuesday on word that rival AstraZeneca (AZN) said its PARP inhibitor Lynparza delayed the resurgence of ovarian cancer by more than two years.In late trading on the stock market today, Tesaro stock was down 13.1% at a six-week low, near 149.30. Clovis stock, on the other hand, rose 7.3%, near 65, after earlier topping its 2017 high achieved Feb. 1 by a penny.Shares of AstraZeneca, meanwhile, lifted less than 1%, near 30.30, despite unveiling robust phase 3 results of Lynparza in 295 patients with relapsed ovarian cancer whose tumors have a mutation of the BRCA gene associated with breast and ovarian cancer.Lynparza staved off the reoccurrence of ovarian cancer by a median 30.2 months vs. a 5.5-month span for patients receiving a placebo. The drug reduced disease progression by 70% and safety remained consistent with earlier studies, AstraZeneca said in a release.IBD'S TAKE: Last week an analyst suggested Gilead Sciences should look to buy, among others, a company with a PARP inhibitor.

273,O,"Merck's (MRK) Keytruda and Roche's (RHHBY) Tecentriq are swiping market share from Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) I-O drugs after the companies won FDA approvals in advanced lung cancer, market tracker Symphony Health said Thursday.Total immuno-oncology drug sales rose 1% in January from December to $483 million, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez wrote in a research note, citing Symphony data.Keytruda and Opdivo are direct rivals as both work to block the interaction between a PD-1 protein on a T-cell and the PD-L1 protein on a cancer cell. Doing so allows the T-cell to see the cancer cell for what it is and destroy it. Roche's Tecentriq targets the PD-L1 checkpoint.Opdivo was the first to gain approval in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in March 2015. Keytruda and Tecentriq followed in October 2015 and October 2016, respectively. All three are also approved in treating advanced melanoma. Bristol's Yervoy, a CTLA-4 checkpoint, also has approvals in melanoma.Sales for January show Merck and Roche are gaining share to Bristol's detriment, Symphony data show. Bristol saw its share tip to 70% in January from 72% in December. Keytruda increased to 23% share from 21%, and Tecentriq has 7% share.IBD'S TAKE: Analysts estimate more than a thousand ongoing trials in immuno-oncology, looking at a multitude of checkpoints. But there are fewer than a dozen approved I-O drugs. Read on for a list of the strongest competitors.Merck's lead is seemingly solid in NSCLC. In January, the FDA accepted an accelerated approval for Keytruda plus chemo to treat NSCLC. Less than two weeks later, Bristol said it wouldn't seek accelerated approval for its Opdivo plus Yervoy combination in NSCLC.Last year Merck saw an inflection in shares after its late-stage Keynote-24 trial in NSCLC read out positively, Fernandez wrote. November marked the first full month of sales following Keytruda's approval in NSCLC for patients with 50%-plus PD-L1 expression.""We continue to see a steady increase in U.S. sales estimates and market share,"" Fernandez said. ""In addition, the approval of Tecentriq for PD-L1 unselected second-line patients on Oct. 18, 2016, is putting additional pressure on Opdivo in this setting.""Opdivo's newer indications in renal cell carcinoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, head and neck cancer and bladder cancer should partially offset its losses in older indications, Fernandez said.In the stock market today, Merck stock rosed 0.87% to 6586 and Bristol-Myers rose 0.75% to 55.76. Roche stock slipped 0.23% to 30.54.

274,O,"Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK) and Allergan (AGN) stand to outperform broad pharma stocks in 2017, a Credit Suisse analyst said Monday, citing their strong pipelines and expected clinical data this year.Merck stock closed down 1.5% at 64.15 on the stock market today. Shares of Allergan dipped 0.2% to 240.65, and Lilly finished 0.3% lower at 84.14. Drug stocks were down broadly, but stayed above their 50-day moving average.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan expects macro uncertainty to pressure drug stocks in the first half of 2017, continuing a trend that began in 2016 with the raucous election season. Drug stocks ended 2016 down 27%, though are up 2.3% since January.Merck will outperform on Keytruda, its immuno-oncology drug, Divan said. Keytruda and similar drugs from Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Roche (RHHBY) teach a patient's immune system to identify tumor cells. The immune system then destroys cancer.Keytruda goes head-to-head against Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo in that both target a specific protein within the body. Merck is teaming up to test Keytruda with Incyte's (INCY) drug, epacadostat. Epacadostat targets another protein.IBD'S TAKE: Jazz Pharmaceuticals tops IBD's 43-company Ethical Drugs industry group with a Composite Rating of 78 out of a best-possible 99. The score means Jazz outperforms nearly two-thirds of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Get the rest of the leaders list on IBD's Stock Checkup.Lilly's pipeline is now derisked, Divan wrote in a note to clients.

He cited further upside to the pipeline from new drugs like Linzess and Viberzi for irritable bowel syndrome, as well as Vraylar for bipolar disorder.On the small- and midcap scene, Divan prefers Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR), Corvus Pharmaceuticals (CRVS) and Aimmune Therapeutics (AIMT). Alder is working on a migraine medicine based on inhibiting a specific peptide within the body to eliminate migraines.Corvus is an ""underappreciated peer player,"" Divan said. RELATED:These Are The First Immune-System Cancer Drugs OK'd By FDAMerck, Bristol-Myers, Incyte Race For A Career In $25 Billion I-O Market

275,O,"U.S. shale production is expected to rise further next month with companies squeezing out more oil from each rig, adding downward pressure to crude prices as OPEC struggles to prop them up with output cuts.The Energy Information Administration said Thursday that output from seven major U.S. shale formations will climb by 109,000 barrels per day in April, or 2.2% vs. the prior month, to 4.962 million barrels per day.The gains will be led by the Permian Basin, which should see output climb by 79,000 barrels per day. Eagle Ford production will rise by 28,000 barrels per day. In Colorado, DJ Niobrara production will rise by 11,000 barrels per day. But output from the Bakken is seen falling by 10,000 barrels per day.Per-rig production from new wells is seen rising by 7 barrels per day to 1,001 in the Bakken, by 2 barrels per day to 1,442 in the Eagle Ford, by 2 barrels per day in the Permian to 662, and by 6 to 1,300 barrels per day in DJ Niobrara.U.S. crude futures settled down 0.2% at $48.40 a barrel, marking a sixth consecutive decline. Brent crude ended virtually unchanged at $51.35.Shares of Dow industrial component Exxon Mobil (XOM) closed down 0.2% in the stock market today. Fellow Dow stock Chevron (CVX) fell 1.1%. Among top shale producers, Continental Resources (CLR) rallied 1.6%, EOG Resources (EOG) dipped 0.3%, and Diamondback Energy (FANG) edged down 0.2%.IBD'S TAKE: U.S. shale producers have ramped up spending and rig counts as oil prices rise and OPEC curbs production. But a debate is raging over how innovative producers have become vs. how much they relied on discounts. U.S. crude sank 9% last week amid mounting evidence that shale companies are racing ahead with plans to ramp up production and investment after prices surged late last year, when OPEC and key non-OPEC countries agreed to trim their output.An extension of that agreement for another six months is starting to be talked about, but continued gains in U.S. output loom, threatening to unravel OPEC's strategy of supporting prices for its members.Last week, the EIA reported a surge in U.S. oil production rose 0.6% vs. the prior week to 9.088 million barrels per day, keeping inventories high.Also last week, the EIA raised its 2017 U.S. crude output forecast to 9.2 million barrels per day from a prior outlook of 8.98 million and raised its 2018 outlook to 9.73 million from 9.53 million.RELATED: U.S. Oil Rig Count Highest September 2015 As Crude Caps 9% Weekly Loss

276,O,"The Food and Drug Administration has approved Merck's (MRK) Keytruda to treat classical Hodgkin lymphoma, but needs more time to review the drugmaker's application for Keytruda in a DNA repair disorder tied to several colorectal cancers.Merck announced the developments late Tuesday. The FDA gave Merck the OK to sell Keytruda as a treatment for children and adults whose classical Hodgkin lymphoma has relapsed after three or more prior treatments.But the FDA needs more time to examine Keytruda as a treatment for previously treated microsatellite instability-high cancer. The disorder is caused by a deficiency in the DNA repair sequence, leading to cancer.""We believe that patients whose tumors harbor DNA repair defect may be especially responsive to Keytruda,"" Merck said in November when it first applied to have the FDA consider Keytruda as a treatment for the disorder.The new Prescription Drug Fee User Act date for Keytruda in microsatellite instability-high cancer is set for June 9.IBD'S TAKE: What if your body could target cancer the way it does common bacteria? It's no longer theoretical. Dive in with this feature on the immuno-oncology space on IBD's Technology page.Keytruda competes directly with Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) Opdivo in melanoma, lung cancer, head and neck cancer, and now classical Hodgkin lymphoma. Both drugs belong to a class of drugs that use the body's immune system to fight cancer.Specifically, Keytruda and Opdivo aim to block the interaction between a PD-1 protein on an immune system cell and the PD-L1 protein on a cancer cell. Doing so allows the immune system to identify the cancer cell and destroy it.AstraZeneca (AZN), Roche (RHHBY) and Incyte (INCY) are also working on varying checkpoints. Roche's FDA-approved Tecentriq targets the PD-L1 protein on the surface of the cancer cell. Incyte's epacadostat belongs to another class, targeting IDO enzymes. Bristol's Yervoy works similarly, targeting the CTLA-4 protein.Merck stock closed up 0.8% at 64.70 on the stock market today. Shares of Bristol-Myers rose 1.7% to 57.65, after Bristol gave a presentation at the Barclays Global Healthcare Conference.RELATED: Could Merck's 'Meaningful' Keytruda Royalty Give Bristol-Myers A Leg Up?Merck, Roche Gouge Bristol's I-O Share After Lung Cancer Approvals

277,O,"Eli Lilly's (LLY) pipeline has the best ""bang-for-the-buck,"" one analyst said Wednesday in an R&D comparison pitting Lilly against rivals Pfizer (PFE), Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY).Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said Lilly is outperforming the pack, achieving the best balance in R&D investment while limiting external investments over the past five years. Bristol and Pfizer trail whereas Merck struggles on these metrics, he wrote.Still, drugmakers like Lilly have struggled to gain FDA approvals. Only 9%-22% of drugs from 2011 pharma pipelines have gained approval. By contrast, biotechnology companies AbbVie (ABBV) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) have been more successful with 36% and 40% conversion rates.Among the top drugmakers, Bristol-Myers and Lilly have had considerably more success with phase three drugs. Meanwhile, Pfizer has only converted 20% of its late-stage pipeline in 2011 to drugs sold on the market.Pfizer has the broadest pipeline in the group -- with 57 disclosed new drugs, Fernandez wrote. But it has struggled with fallen megamergers and R&D disruptions, limiting its scale on productivity. Merck is the lowest in the pharma universe with 30.IBD'S TAKE: American Funds recently upped its stake in Bristol-Myers Squibb stock. Who else received American Funds' vote of confidence? Find out at IBD's Mutual Funds page.In his analysis, Fernandez also looked at ""churn,"" the turnover of new drugs from 2011-15, and ""burn,"" the percentage of attrition of the 2011 portfolio by 2016. Bristol has the highest burn rate and lowest churn rate.""The company appears to be focusing more on internal assets/partnerships/early stage M&A over mid- to late-stage external agents,"" Fernandez wrote in a note. ""Conversely, Merck's churn rate is among the highest in the group.""Merck's ""high overall R&D expenses are driven in part by the large Cubist and Idenix deals, which have so far struggled to generate the sizable returns management had hoped (for), as well the company's extraordinary investment behind Keytruda,"" he wrote.Though Merck isn't alone in its struggles with partnerships and acquisitions. Among big drugmakers and biotechs, only Gilead's purchase of Pharmasset in 2011 appears to have succeeded, Fernandez wrote.Pharmasset began development on Sovaldi, the hepatitis C drug that rocketed Gilead's sales in 2014-15. But Gilead's hepatitis C franchise began faltering in 2016 amid the high cure rates of its trio of drugs, Sovaldi, Harvoni and Epclusa.At the closing bell on the stock market today, Lilly finished trading up 0.8% to 83.41. Bristol-Myers rose 1.4% to 57.12. Meanwhile, Merck slipped 0.2% to 65.80 while Pfizer also lost 0.2% to 33.91.RELATED:Gilead Hepatitis C Sales Plunge As Merck Swipes Share: AnalystAbbVie Stronger Bet Than Gilead, Amgen — At Least Until 2020: LeerinkMerck, Roche Gouge Bristol's I-O Share After Lung Cancer Approvals

278,O,"EOG Resources (EOG) said it would step up drilling but spend less, all while boosting production and staying within cash flow with oil under $50.The shale producer said it could hit its target of an 18% increase in oil production while operating on its cash flow if oil averages $47 per barrel this year.EOG Resources shares fell 5 cents to 91.64 on the stock market today after reporting in-line earnings late Monday.EOG, called the ""Apple (AAPL) of oil"" has been a leader in new technology from smartphone apps to real-time geosteering to help boost productivity""We continue to reduce costs so we can drill more wells with the same capex,"" said Gary Thomas, chief operating officer, during the company's conference call.EOG plans to operate 26 rigs, three more than planned, while staying within its current capital-spending budget of $3.7 billion to $4.1 billion for the year. Exploration and production costs will account for 81% of total capex spending, and EOG plans to focus spending in the Eagle Ford Shale, the Delaware Basin and the Rockies.EOG still plans to complete 400 net wells this year, but said the extra rigs will give operators flexibility.Thomas said oil prices were still volatile but that the company can ""adjust readily"" by adding inventory or adding completions spending depending on prices.During the quarter EOG said well costs in the Delaware Basin were down 8% vs. 2016 to $7.8 million. The company now plans to lower costs to $7.6 million per well by the end of the year. Bakken Shale well costs fell 6% to $4.8 million.Late Monday, EOG reported Q1 earnings that met views and revenue that beat and said new wells in the Permian Basin ""shattered"" industry records for early production.EOG expects Q2 crude production to rise to 322,200-332,400 barrels a day, up 20%-24% annually or 2%-5% vs. Q1.And EOG isn't the only one increasing production.The Energy Information Administration on Tuesday raised its full-year U.S. oil production forecast for 2018 yet again, to a 9.96 million barrels per day, the highest annual per-day output since the agency started keeping records in 1859.The report sent U.S. crude down 1.2% to settle at $45.88 per barrel. Crude prices are trading around their lowest levels since November. But prices pared losses late after the American Petroleum Institute reported a weekly inventory decline of 5.8 million barrels.Since October, overall domestic output has risen by roughly 112,000 barrels per month, putting production on track to top the April 2015 peak of 9.61 million barrels per day by July and the key 10-million-barrel-per-day mark in August.Early Tuesday, Carrizo Oil & Gas (CRZO) raised its 2017 production target to 32,400-32,700 barrels per day from a prior outlook of 31,400-31,900 after reporting a 12% jump in oil production in Q1 vs. the year-ago quarter.Also earlier today, Sanchez Energy (SN) said current Q2 production levels are 46% higher than the average in Q1. CEO Tony Sanchez said in a release that the company expects ""operating cash flow and margins to increase through the remainder of the year.""Sanchez added that drilled but uncompleted wells with short lateral lengths of around 4,400 feet are ""exceeding production expectations"" in its new Eagle Ford assets, which were acquired in March from Anadarko Petroleum (APC).Carrizo shares crashed 6.7% to 23.92.

Instead, the company has developed 20 mobile apps of its own in the last two years that allow workers to stay connected day and night.""It's a major game-changer,"" Sandeep Bhakhri, chief information and technology officer, said on EOG's conference call Tuesday. ""We call it having a control a room in your pocket.""EOG has also collected data from 5,000 horizontal wells in almost every major unconventional play in the U.S., with the help of new ""black boxes"" deployed on rigs to help get more insight into data collected, he added.The company has been collecting its own data for nearly 30 years, but in the last two to three years EOG has had access to real-time data that allow it to steer drill bits in the most productive part of the rock.""Data is king and one of our most valuable resources,"" Bhakhri said.Faster access to data means quicker and more precise drilling, cutting time and waste and lowering costs.Late Monday, EOG reported Q1 earnings that met views and revenue that beat. Service and equipment prices rose ""in certain areas"" but were offset by ""continued advances in drilling and completion tools and techniques, benefits from extended lateral lengths and new contracts at lower prices,"" according to a statement.Management also noted its new wells in the Permian Basin ""shattered industry records"" for initial production. ""Our advanced technology and proprietary techniques are leading to breakthrough well performance across our diverse portfolio of premium plays,"" EOG said.EOG shares closed down just 5 cents to 91.64 on the stock market today, as U.S. crude futures retreated 1.2% to $45.88 a barrel.

280,O,"X EOG Resources (EOG), the so-called ""Apple (AAPL) of oil,"" matched Q1 earnings views late Monday and beat revenue forecasts, while the shale producer touted record performance from its new Permian Basin wells.While dozens of shale companies have reported or are about to report, EOG's reputation for innovation makes it stand out, especially as U.S. oil prices have fallen back below $50 a barrel. To generate bigger profits at that level, producers have to find ways to extract oil as efficiently as possible.Houston-based EOG swung to a per-share profit of 15 cents, matching estimates, as revenue soared 93% to $2.61 billion, topping forecasts for $2.41 billion.Crude production climbed 18% year over year to 315,700 barrels of oil per day. Average completed well costs were down 6% vs. 2016 averages in the Eagle Ford, Delaware and Bakken formations. Service and equipment prices rose ""in certain areas"" but were were offset by ""continued advances in drilling and completion tools and techniques, benefits from extended lateral lengths and new contracts at lower prices.""""EOG's Whirling Wind wells shattered industry records in the Permian Basin,"" said Chairman and CEO Bill Thomas in a statement, noting they set new records for 30-day initial production from Permian Basin horizontal oil wells.  ""Our advanced technology and proprietary techniques are leading to break-through well performance across our diverse portfolio of premium plays.""Management sees Q2 crude production rising to 322,200-332,400 barrels a day, up 20%-24% annually or 2%-5% vs. Q1.EOG stock slipped 0.7% late.

Total production jumped 25.6% to 63,192 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per day. Lease operating expenses were $7.71 per BOE, up from $7.60 in Q4 and $6.78 a year earlier.Oasis shares rallied 2% after hours.Carrizo Oil & Gas (CRZO) and Sanchez Energy (SN) will release results Tuesday.So far, shale firms aren't seeing much cost inflation, despite surging activity in the Permian Basin. Pioneer said it has long-term contracts in place for sand used in fracking and has access to cheap water.Continental Resources (CLR) said last week that service costs are only seeing a slight uptick in a few areas and have stabilized.

281,O,"XThe extension of a deal among OPEC and top non-OPEC countries to trim output isn't a foregone conclusion, Saudi Arabia reportedly warned top U.S. shale firms this week, in a sign that the No. 1 crude exporter's strategy to lift prices may be backfiring in the face of surging U.S. producers.In a closed-door meeting with executives from Anadarko Petroleum (APC), ConocoPhillips (COP), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), EOG Resources (EOG) and Newfield Exploration (NFX) on Tuesday, top Saudi officials said U.S. producers should ""not automatically assume OPEC will extend the cuts"" and that OPEC ""would not take the hit for the rise in U.S. shale production,"" an executive at the meeting told Reuters on Thursday.U.S. crude futures fell 2% to settle at $49.28 a barrel, its lowest close since November, after tumbling more than 5% Wednesday. Brent futures fell 1.7% to $52.19.Late last year, OPEC and non-members like Russia agreed to trim output by a collective 1.8 million barrels a day for the first six months of this year. While crude prices surged leading up to and immediately after the deal was reached, they later stayed sideways as U.S. companies rushed to add drilling rigs and crank up production.With the deal's upside fizzling out, OPEC member Iraq had starting talking about an extension when the agreement expires in June. And on Tuesday, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih appeared to lay out an initial, albeit tough, negotiating position.He told IHS' CERAWeek energy conference attendees Tuesday that ""conformity by all"" will be a criterion for any extension of the production-cut pact and that his country ""will not bear the burden of free rides"" as Saudi Arabia takes the brunt of the production cuts.Anadarko shares rose 0.9% to 61.94 on the stock market today. Conoco shares were up 1.2%. Occidental edged up 0.7%. Pioneer Natural climbed 1.9%. EOG was up 0.9%. Newfield jumped 1.9%.IBD'S TAKE: U.S. shale producers have ramped up spending and rig counts as oil prices rise and OPEC curbs production. But a debate is raging over how innovative producers have become vs. how much they relied on discounts. Failure to extend the agreement could send oil prices even lower, as U.S. companies have vowed to unleash a flood of investment this year to pump more oil from low-cost formations like the Permian Basin.On Tuesday, the Energy Information Administration raised its 2017 U.S. crude output forecast to 9.2 million barrels per day from a prior outlook of 8.98 million and raised its 2018 outlook to 9.73 million from 9.53 million. Last week, U.S. output hit 9.09 million barrels, the highest in a year and a half.Saudi Arabia's warning to U.S. shale comes despite strong compliance with the terms of the current agreement.Last month, OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo said he wants compliance on the output deal to rise past 90% to nearly 100%.But the high number is a collective figure and was due in part to Saudi Arabia cutting its output by more than it was expected, offsetting weaker compliance elsewhere.During an interview with CNBC after his speech, Al-Falih said Russia's cuts in February weren't enough but that Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak assured him that March cuts will be better.OPEC's next meeting is scheduled for May 25, and on March 26 a committee formed to monitor compliance with the production deal will meet in Kuwait.RELATED:Does OPEC Have Anything Left In The Tank As U.S. Shale Looms?This Is When Shell Expects Global Peak Oil DemandDow's Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell Announce Energy Deals As Oil Undercuts $50

Long term, shale won't be able to supply the world and respond all on its own to changes in demand, but for the time being (its actions are) tempering expectations"" for an oil recovery.Following this week's slide, the USO ETF sits 15% below its June high of 12.45 but is up 37% from an all-time low of 7.67 in its decade-plus history, which came more than a year ago.Energy stock ETF were mixed Thursday.Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) clawed back the morning's losses to finish with a 0.7% gain. However, PowerShares S&P SmallCap Energy (PSCE) and SPDR S&P Oil and Gas Equipment and Services (XES) closed sharply lower.Year to date, XLE is the worst performer among Select SPDRs investing in S&P 500 stocks. The ETF is down nearly 7% through March 9 vs. a 10% jump for its health care sibling.IBD'S TAKE: Collapsing oil prices have renewed attention on the OPEC deal, specifically its continuation after June. This is what Saudi Arabia wants to see before extending the output cut.What Is Going On In The ETF Market?

Shares rose a fraction in Tuesday's regular session, to 54.78, but they're down 27% over the last six months amid investor worries that Merck (MRK) has the upper hand in the lung cancer market.Merck's Keytruda and Bristol's Opdivo both belong to a class of immuno-oncology drugs that target PD-1 checkpoints in a patient's immune system. Roche (RHHBY), AstraZeneca (AZN) and Incyte (INCY) are also working on I-O drugs targeting an array of checkpoints.Last month, the Food and Drug Administration accepted Merck's supplemental filing for Keytruda plus chemo in advanced lung cancer.

AGCO (AGCO), another farm equipment company, edged up 0.3%.Deere's Q1 earnings per share fell 24% to 61 cents, but that was better than analyst expectations for 55 cents. Net sales ticked down 1% to $4.697 billion, just beating estimates for $4.684 billion.Allen said that the company ""continues to perform far better than in agricultural downturns of the past.""He also said he remained ""confident"" that the company could deliver at least $500 million in savings by the end of next year amid efforts to operate more efficiently.RELATED:Deere Stock Soars As Q4 Earnings Crush Estimates

287,O,"The battle between OPEC and U.S. shale companies isn't the only cage match in the oil sector. A debate is raging over how innovative producers have become vs. how much they relied on discounts given during the depths of the price bust.Those discounts are now disappearing, and higher demand for labor, equipment and fracking materials is pushing costs up, meaning producers will soon reveal whether they spent the last two years developing new ways to do more with less, or simply coasted by on cheap inputs.The answers that emerge will not only help determine how quickly U.S. crude production recovers and how competitive domestic exploration and production companies will be against OPEC rivals, they will eventually trickle down to the bottom lines and share prices of firms like EOG Resources (EOG), Continental Resources (CLR), Diamondback Energy (FANG) and Parsley Energy (PE). Global integrated giants like Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX), which are both on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, may also feel the changes as they focus more on shale plays.""E&Ps will be able to handle the price inflation,"" said James Williams, an economist at energy consultant WTRG. ""But it will slow the rate of production increases, absolutely. It doesn't look well on their bottom line, so it won't be as easy to get more money to drill a new well. That's the normal cycle of a market. If you want service companies to survive, you're going to have to pay them more money.""Companies and analysts have thrown around a wide range of numbers on what share of cost savings is due to structural efficiencies and innovation and what share is due to cyclical discounts.At one end of the spectrum, EOG Resources said in November that 75% of its cost savings were from efficiencies. At the other end, Schlumberger (SLB) said last year that ""there has been little to no fundamental change in technology ... and no general transformation of the industry business model.""Barclays analyst Dave Anderson told IBD he would be surprised if more than half of cost savings are structural, estimating the real number to be closer to a third. Meanwhile, Macquarie Securities analyst Paul Grigel thinks half of cost savings are from sustainable improvements and innovation, and Edward Jones analyst Brian Youngberg agrees.Diverging expectations on cost growth are also emerging. According to a recent Barclays survey, nearly 80% of North American oil companies expect an increase in oilfield service prices, with more than half of them only seeing an increase of up to 10%.But Halliburton's (HAL) CEO Dave Lesar said in January he would ""be using something higher"" than 10% when calculating price increases, adding that while some cost reductions are structural, equipment demand will tighten and prices will rise.Exxon is confident it can keep costs under control, saying planned increases in its capital spending this year and through the end of the decade assume no significant cost inflation, with most of the extra dollars going to exploration and production.To be sure, several factors are at play in the debate. Producers and service providers have incentives to discount what the other says as they negotiate new prices. Different shale formations have different geologic traits that can be costlier or cheaper, though recent innovations have made vast amounts of oil recoverable in places like the Permian Basin. There's also a backlog of wells that were drilled during the downturn but weren't completed as producers waited for prices to rebound. Completing wells today with drilling costs that were booked years ago may skew a company's overall efficiency numbers.The price of oil will also be key as any further increases would spur more activity and boost demand for services.Diamondback Energy CEO Travis Stice told analysts last month he expects service cost increases to be ""muted"" if oil stays rangebound at $50-$55 per barrel. But if prices rise to $55-$60, then he sees cost increases starting to ""accelerate in the back half of the year.""U.S. crude prices edged down 0.1% to settle at $53.14 a barrel on Tuesday.Drilling and completion costs will largely determine the price that companies need to either make a profit or take a loss on a project. In the Permian's Delaware basin, the average break-even price — including drilling and completion costs, operating expenses and royalties — was $32.16 per barrel, according to S&P Global Platts. But if drilling and completion costs rise 10%, the break-even price climbs 8% to $34.74. If those costs jump 25%, the break-even goes up 20% to $38.60 per barrel.About one-third of a well's cost is on the drilling side and two-thirds is on the completion side, according to Barclays' Anderson. Completion includes fracking and bringing oil to the surface.But there is less cost pressure on the drilling side. One reason is that there is still excess supply of equipment like rigs, and improvements in efficiencies are ""stickier,"" said Macquarie's Grigel.The U.S. oil rig count rose to 609 in the latest week, according to Baker Hughes (BHI). That's the highest level since October 2015, but still about 1,000 rigs below the 2014 peak.Among drilling efficiencies, the biggest improvement comes from high-grading, or using ""the best equipment with the best crews,"" Anderson said. Pad drilling — or drilling several wells from a single location vs. moving rigs around — is also popular.Improved sensors and more effective drill bits have shortened drilling times. New rigs have also slashed the time it takes between starting a new well and moving to another well to 7 to 10 days from 3 to 4 weeks.In addition, geosteering services like those from Nabors Industries (NBR) allow companies to drill more accurately. And new lubricants from companies like Flotek (FTK) have reduced drag on drills, while also easing their maintenance needs.Labor cost pressure in drilling services is less pronounced too. Because companies continued to drill wells during the downturn, skilled workers stayed on payrolls and don't need to be coaxed back from another job or state.On the completion side, however, some of the innovations are adding to cost pressures. The biggest is the use of higher proppant loads to release more oil in the fracking process. Longer lateral wells also require more sand. Anderson said producers are now using an average of 4,600 tons of frac sand per well vs. 2,600 tons in 2014.Costs have already gone up for proppants, with sand and chemical companies preparing new rounds of price increases. Last month, fracking materials provider U.S. Silica said it saw positive momentum in pricing in Q3 and Q4, with the trend accelerating in Q1.""We'll see some pretty substantial increases in price as we go through Q1 here,"" said CEO Bryan Shinn, adding that the market will continue to tighten over the coming quarters.Producers have started to back off from higher proppant loads.Trisha Curtis, the president and co-founder of PetroNerds, an energy analytics and advising firm, said companies are now fracking closer to the wellbore, allowing them to use cheaper sand vs. pricier specialized ceramics needed with widely spaced fractures. And some companies are hauling their own water to drill sites instead of outsourcing it.Gary Gould, Continental Resources' vice president of production, told analysts last month that the company is using 1,000-2,000 pounds of fracking sand per foot in the Bakken shale play vs. the 3,000 pounds per foot other operators are using. EOG even sees its sand costs falling by 18%, saying it has multiple sand vendors.Labor costs in completion services look to go up as well. The extended pause in completing wells forced workers out of the sector, and they must now be lured back or new ones must be trained. On top of that, companies are now in a hurry to complete those wells.In the Bakken, Continental plans to increase the number of completion crews there to eight by mid-May from five now, but maintain the number of drilling rigs at four through the end of the year.WTRG's Williams expects a short-term labor shortage in completion crews as companies work down those backlogs and compete new wells that were drilled more recently.And while companies established new drilling techniques over the last two years, completions only started to thaw out recently, and producers are still trying to find the right recipe that yields the highest production.There is a completion learning curve, Williams said, and as more wells are completed, new techniques will be found. ""Every time one completion is done you get more information on how to do it better. Some of these improvements are experimental.""But developments in automation look to offset some labor pressure on both the drilling and completion sides. Repetitive or dangerous tasks like connecting pipes, sending them down wells, mixing chemicals and monitoring equipment have been automated at some sites.Nabors Industries even expects more automated drilling rigs will eventually let it slash the number of workers at each well site to just five from 20 today, according to Bloomberg.But what's not automatic is the ability to take advantage of the latest improvements. Good management still matters.Companies that allow their engineers more flexible drilling practices to experiment will do better than those that jump on a drilling frenzy and send efficiencies ""out the window,"" warned PetroNerds' Curtis.Meanwhile, there is an upside to higher costs, which can encourage more innovation, and the current environment may be more favorable than when producers were in survival mode.""The best innovation comes when things aren't booming per se but when you are a little stressed,"" said Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group. ""You have to have enough money to do the studies to innovate. But it does help to have a little cost pressure to do that.""RELATED:IEA: Shale Productivity Has Improved By 'Leaps And Bounds' Does OPEC Have Anything Left In The Tank As U.S. Shale Looms?New Ways The U.S. Can Squeeze Its Oilfields -- And Its Rivals

288,O,"What if your body's immune system fought off deadly cancer cells just like it protects you from germs you encounter every day?That's the goal of an emerging class of treatments called immuno-oncology, or I-O, drugs, which Barclays analyst Geoff Meacham says could become a $25 billion market by 2025. Products from Merck (MRK), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Roche Holding (RHHBY) already are approved by the FDA to treat melanoma and lung cancer.Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez estimates some 1,000 trials are underway in the I-O stratosphere. Those include drug trials by the likes of AstraZeneca (AZN), Incyte (INCY) and a slew of others to treat kidney, bladder, urothelial and head and neck cancers.Results are still very preliminary, says Tim Reilly, development lead for Bristol-Myers' early I-O pipeline.""That 'cure' is a tough word,"" he told IBD. ""We are seeing indications that we can at least reset the patient's immune system to normal homeostasis. ... Our hope is we can bring patients who have an official diagnosis of cancer back to that homeostatic place.""Bristol-Myers stock rose 0.6% to 54.58 in stock market trading Friday. Merck shares rose a small fraction, to 65.38, while Roche shares inched up 2 cents, to 30.53.  Incyte ended the day up 0.3%.Though preliminary, the I-O thesis played out for Bristol-Myers and Merck in Q4. Bristol-Myers tacked on $1.57 billion in sales of its I-O drugs Opdivo and Yervoy. Yervoy sales were flat, but Opdivo sales grew 176% from a  year earlier. Merck's Keytruda grew 125% to $483 million in sales. (See a list of the major immuno-oncology drugs cleared so far by the U.S. FDA and their approved uses.)Cancer cells are constantly occurring in everyone, Reilly says.""Every time we get out in the sunlight and get some UV exposure, there's a mutation to a cell that is technically now a mutated cell and is, technically, cancer,"" he said. ""But our body eradicates that cell.""That's what a healthy immune system does. But, in some cases, aberrant cells evolve to outpace or outsmart the system, throwing off the body's natural homeostasis. Those cells then grow, becoming a cancerous tumor.IBD'S TAKE: Wall Street was nervous entering the Q4 earnings season as biotechs took political heat for high drug prices. But biotech Incyte is riding high on a plethora of potential blockbusters, including those in the I-O sector. Head to IBD's The New America article to get a deep dive on Incyte's vast opportunities.Chemotherapy — pumping the body full of poison to kill cancer cells — is the standard of care. In the early 2000s, targeted therapies changed the growth rates of tumors. After that, drugmakers looked at combining therapies to improve results.Immuno-oncology drugs — more precisely checkpoint inhibitors — are completely different, Meacham says.Merck's Keytruda and Bristol-Myers' Opdivo are both PD-1 inhibitors. Both were first approved in 2014 to treat melanoma. Since then, they've tacked on a slew of indications including lung cancer and head and neck cancer. Yervoy is Bristol-Myers' CTLA-4 inhibitor. It was approved in 2011 for advanced melanoma.""A lot of these drugs basically train the immune system to see the difference between a regular cell and a tumor cell, and use the immune system to fight the tumor off,"" Meacham said.Immune system T cells patrol the body for aberrant cells. When a T cell encounters another cell, it probes the surface looking for proteins that would indicate a cancerous cell. Upon finding a cancer cell, the T cells attack, calling forth additional molecules to prevent the battle from injuring regular tissue.These additional molecules are checkpoint inhibitors, explained a July 6, 2016, blog post from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. But a cancerous cell can trick a T cell by wearing the proteins of a normal cell, evading detection and destruction.""Checkpoint inhibitors block these normal proteins on cancer cells, or the proteins on T cells that respond to them,"" Dana-Farber wrote. ""The result is to remove the blinders that prevented T cells from recognizing the cells as cancerous and leading an immune-system assault on them.""Monotherapies like Merck's Keytruda and Bristol's Opdivo block the interaction between the PD-1 protein on a T cell surface and the PD-L1 protein on the surface of the cancer cell. Doing so allows the T cell to see the cancer cell for what it is.Bristol's CTLA-4 antibody Yervoy works in a similar fashion.More than 1,000 clinical trials are exploring different inhibitors, Leerink's Fernandez wrote in a Jan. 20 note. Firms are also looking at checkpoint modulators that would stimulate T cell activation.Merck's Keytruda and Bristol-Myers' Opdivo have myriad indications as solo therapies. Both are indicated in advanced lung cancer and head and neck cancer. Opdivo is also approved to treat melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and Hodgkin lymphoma. Bristol-Myers' Yervoy is indicated in melanoma.Near-term excitement, though, is on the potential for I-O combinations. That's where Merck might have a slight lead. In January, the Food and Drug Administration accepted Merck's supplemental filing for accelerated approval of a Keytruda plus chemo combination to treat non-small-cell lung cancer.Less than two weeks later, Bristol-Myers said it wouldn't seek accelerated approval for its combination of Opdivo and Yervoy in non-small-cell lung cancer, confirming Merck will have a lead in that market. Bristol-Myers is studying that combo in its Phase 3 trial CheckMate-227.In the aftermath, Wall Street is awaiting the results of AstraZeneca's Mystic trial with bated breath. Like Opdivo and Yervoy, AstraZeneca's durvalumab and tremelimumab are PD-1 and CTLA-4 antibodies, respectively, Barclays' Meacham says.""That trial is a leading indicator of what could happen with 227,"" he told IBD. ""It's a similar mechanism to Bristol-Myers' Yervoy and Opdivo. ... There are a lot of subtleties between the (Mystic) trial and the 227 study, but I think overall people want to see if the idea worked.""Meanwhile, Merck is testing out Keytruda with Incyte's epacadostat in first-line melanoma, advanced lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, head and neck cancer, and bladder cancer. Epacadostat belongs to another class of checkpoint inhibitors working to target IDO enzymes.CTLA-4 antibodies were among the first I-O antibodies approved. In 2011, when it was first approved, Yervoy ""was a pretty toxic drug,"" Meacham said. But drugmakers pushed forward upon the discovery of ""eye-popping"" efficacy when combining CTLA-4 and PD-1 antibodies.Finding the right dosages of both drugs requires ""a bit of trial and error,"" Bristol-Myers' Reilly said. Through that testing, Bristol-Myers has cut down on the toxicity of its Opdivo and Yervoy combo to ensure the benefits outweigh the risks.""We don't want to bring toxicity to patients,"" he said. ""But we know one thing for sure: The cancer will kill the patient. We want to be sure we're bringing the benefit and that the Opdivo plus Yervoy combination will bring that benefit.""Reilly expects future cancer treatment to focus on segments of patients who share a diagnosis and similar biomarkers. In the distant future, treatment combinations could potentially be tailored to specific patients based on their body's chemical makeup, said Merck's Dr. Roy Barnes.Barnes is the senior vice president of global clinical development for Merck Research Laboratories. Like Reilly, he won't call I-O a cure for cancer. But he notes impressive results from patients who've been on Yervoy, one of the first approvals, for years without progressing.""A lot of patients have started coming off of the drugs after three or four years,"" he said. ""When they come off, there have been very few relapses. It's early days, but it's quite encouraging.""RELATED:Merck Keytruda Sales Lag Without $40 Million In Deferred Revenue: AnalystBristol-Myers Topples On 2017 Guidance Cut Amid Merck I-O CompetitionCould Merck's 'Meaningful' Keytruda Royalty Give Bristol-Myers A Leg Up?

Rigs fell by one in the Cana Woodford and DJ Niobrara plays to 50 and 20 respectively. Rigs rose by two to 308 in the Permian and jumped up five to 64 in the Eagle Ford.The overall U.S. rig count, including natural gas rigs, was up by two to 756.U.S. crude futures rose 1.4% to $53.33 on Friday, though they fell 1.2% for the week.Exxon Mobil (XOM) fell 1% on the stock market today.

291,O,"EOG Resources (EOG) outlined ways it is keeping some costs down Tuesday as it prepares for a surge in oil exploration and production activity this year.The shale producer sees 2017 capital spending of $3.7 billion-$4.1 billion, up from $2.7 billion in 2016, and will drill more wells. Meanwhile, it plans to cut completed-well costs by 8.2% in the Permian's Delaware Basin, 8.5% in the Eagle Ford formation and 9.8% in the Bakken shale play this year.As drilling activity picks up, increased demand for labor, equipment and fracking materials is expected to lift costs. Newer techniques that require greater amounts of sand are also putting upward pressure on prices. Barclays analyst Dave Anderson recently said suppliers of frac sand and proppant are already instituting a second round of price increases.Like its peers, EOG is experimenting with longer lateral wells, but those require more sand, and some companies like Continental Resources (CLR) are testing techniques that use less sand.But EOG Chief Operating Office Gary Thomas isn't worried about price hikes, telling analysts on a conference call Tuesday that the company has multiple vendors and has secured half the fracking teams and equipment that it needs.EOG actually sees its sand costs falling by 18% year over year, he added, though overall service costs will rise this year.Along with sand, water is another expensive input in fracking. But EOG is using more recycled water, along with improved water systems, to slash drilling and completion costs by $100,000 per well in the Delaware Basin and in the Rockies.""We also expanded our water handling infrastructure in the Delaware Basin and Rockies to better reuse and more efficiently transport drilling, completion, and production water, which will reduce transportation and disposal costs,"" Thomas said.EOG shares fell 0.9% to close at 96.99 on the stock market today, as crude prices dipped. Continental shares edged down 0.4%.Late Monday, EOG reported a Q4 loss that was less than expected and revenue that topped Wall Street views.RELATED: U.S. Oil Rig Count Climbs For Sixth Week, Hits Highest Since October 2015

292,O,"X Shares of IBM lurched 2.5% lower early Friday amid news that Warren Buffett has been dumping the tech giant in 2017. Investors digested the news ahead of Berkshire Hathaway's (BRKB) annual meeting, a day when the Berkshire CEO answers shareholders' questions.Late Friday, Berkshire reported Q1 net earnings dropped 27% to $4.14 billion as insurance losses and adjustments soared 146%, but revenue climbed 25% to $65.19 billion. Insurance premiums earned nearly doubled to $21.75 billion, and railroad, utilities and energy revenue grew 6.3% to $9.4 billion.Among the potential topics that billionaire investor could address are his reasons for selling IBM (IBM), Apple's (AAPL) rising dividends, turbulence in the airline industry and a merger snub for one of his top stocks.Buffett has sold a third of his stake in the tech giant over the first and second quarters, considerably trimming his 81 million shares as of December 2016, CNBC reported.""IBM is a big strong company, but they've got big strong competitors too,"" he said in an interview, adding IBM stock had not performed in line with his expectations.The iPhone maker is a sure bet for the spotlight at Saturday's meeting.Buffett doubled his stake in Apple at the start of this year, owning $17 billion of the stock as of February. He disclosed a position in Apple in 2016 after sitting out the tech giant's hot growth streak over the past decade. He attributed the change of heart to Apple's ""enormously useful product"" and intelligent deployment of capital.Buffett's ""invest in what you know"" principle made him a big buyer of the best high-dividend stocks such as Verizon (VZ), General Motors (GM), IBM (IBM) and Coca-Cola (KO). He likes financially sound companies with a durable competitive advantage that reward shareholders. Dividends can be a sign of a quality company.Apple's hefty dividend hike may make the stock more attractive for Buffett, though he said in February that Apple stock was ""at a price different than I would buy it now.""Apple shares rose 0.6% to 147.38 in morning trade on the stock market today. The stock fell fractionally Wednesday and Thursday after reporting tepid revenue and iPhone sales for the second fiscal quarter but significantly raising its dividend and buyback.Berkshire Hathaway has also been upping its stake in airline stocks — another big change of heart. He is reported to have owned more than 7% of the total common stock of each of Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL), American Airlines (AAL) and Southwest Airlines (LUV) as of February.With airlines executives in congressional crosshairs after a spate of disturbing passenger-related incidents, Buffett may be grilled himself on his airline positions.Other headwinds for airline stocks include high labor costs, increased competition and discounted fares that cut into profits.Still, all four of the big U.S. carriers have moved back above their 50-day moving averages.If Buffett stays true to form, investors can expect some frank discussion of Kraft Heinz's (KHC) failed $143 billion merger bid for Unilever (UN) and what other steps Kraft may do to revive growth.Berkshire is one of the largest stakeholders in the $108 billion company behind beloved household names such as Jell-O and Kool-Aid.After Wednesday's market close, Kraft Heinz reported earnings per share and revenue below Wall Street views. EPS climbed 15% to 84 cents a share while sales dipped 3% to $6.36 billion. Analysts had expect EPS of 85 cents and sales of $6.462 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Sales have fallen for four of the last five quarters, while there may be limits to Kraft's aggressive cost-cutting measures under Berkshire and co-lead investor 3G.Kraft shares fell sharply intraday Thursday, but closed up 0.6%. The stock dipped 0.1% Friday morning.In previous annual meetings, Buffett has weighed in on Valeant Pharmaceuticals' (VRX) flawed business model, defended his sizable stake in Coca-Cola, and knocked hedge fund managers (between playing ping-pong with a giant paddle and doing a ukulele singalong).RELATED:Apple Investors Find Comfort In 10.5% Dividend HikeLawmakers Grill United CEO Munoz

Shares briefly topped a buy point at 23.59 out of a cup that began forming in late February.Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt raised his 2017 expectations for Cabometyx sales to $293 million from his earlier view for $277 million. He sees Cometriq bringing in $24.2 million for the year. Cometriq is Cabometyx in its capsule form.The company reiterated its previous guidance for $290 million to $310 million in total sales.Cabometyx, which launched in April 2016, pulled in $62.4 million during the quarter, beating views by 25%, Schmidt wrote in a research report. Cabometyx is approved to treat kidney cancer.IBD'S TAKE: Exelixis stock is among three big growth biotech stocks to watch. Head to IBD Industry Themes for more on Exelixis and other strong contenders during this first-quarter earnings season.""Fundamentals underlying the Cabometyx U.S. launch in second-line renal cell carcinoma remain strong,"" Schmidt said. ""There were no changes in channel inventory, and volume growth in Q1 was entirely driven by new patient starts and refills.""Sales of Cometriq lagged the consensus by $1.2 million in the first quarter. Sales of Cometriq as a treatment for medullary thyroid cancer and renal cell carcinoma came in at $6.5 million.Exelixis and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) are on deck to start a trial of Cabometyx and Opdivo in renal cell carcinoma in mid-2017. Opdivo is one of Bristol's two immuno-oncology drugs, which aim to teach the immune system to identify camouflaged cancer cells.RELATED:Exelixis Rockets On Bristol, Roche I-O Ties Following Merck-Incyte TeamWill Trump's FDA Chill Innovation Or Kill 'Astronomical' Prices?

294,O,"After the price of oil more than doubled over the past year, SPDR Oil & Gas Equipment & Services ETF (XES) this month touched the highest levels since July 2015 and is forming a base.The fund is working on a base-on-base pattern with a potential buy point at 24.68. Shares have slipped below the 50-day moving average in the past couple of weeks, and continued work below that level would indicate weakness. But for now, at least, there's no serious flaw in the pattern.The exchange traded fund owns companies that provide the muscle to produce oil and gas. That comes from drilling specialists, builders of offshore platforms and geological analysts, plus providers of tubing, pumps and other elements of the vast network that goes into getting oil into barrels.Even now that crude oil has recovered some, the earnings outlook remains soft. The energy sector's fourth-quarter earnings are so far the weakest of any S&P sector, down 13.6% from the year-ago period.""Despite West Texas intermediate oil prices remaining steadily above $50 per barrel since the start of the year, earnings results from some of the majors have not been very strong,""  Lindsey Bell, investment strategist at CFRA Research, noted in a report Thursday. ""That being said, the growth decline is an improvement from the 67.5% decline in Q3 and the 86.1% decline in Q2.""But most energy stocks tend to follow the price of oil more closely than profits. The ETF's performance has shown a close correlation to oil prices for at least the past three years. On that front, the price of oil has stalled since June, and forecasts are uncertain. For example, Wells Fargo Investment Institute is skeptical. ""We don't see where the fuel is going to come from to push oil prices higher,"" wrote John LaForge, head of real asset strategy.The ETF, however, has traded better than oil in the past few months, snapping to new highs from Nov. 30 to mid-December, when it began its current consolidation.  On Nov. 30, OPEC finalized an agreement to curb oil output.The ETF's best-performing components include Fairmount Santrol (FMSA) and U.S. Silica (LSCA), two providers of the special sand used in oil wells. They've been in strong price uptrends since a low in January 2016.Patterson-Uti Energy (PTEN) has scaled higher from its 2016 breakouts and is trying another breakout now. RPC (RES) also has made good on last year's breakouts, rising about 16% from each of the three. But a move above a 22.38 buy point on Jan. 25 is sputtering.Ensco (ESV), Noble (NE) and Weatherford (WFT) are some holdings that haven't participated much in the energy's rebound. Most of the ETF's stocks bottomed around the same time crude prices bottomed, on Feb. 11, 2016.SPDR Oil & Gas Equipment & Services surged more than 27% in 2016.

298,O,"Kite Pharma (KITE) outperformed med stocks Tuesday, gapping up on lymphoma trial results even as Perrigo (PRGO) and Tenet Healthcare (THC) made double-digit plunges, leading similar declines for Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) and Akorn (AKRX).By the closing bell on the stock market today, Kite stock had rocketed 24.3% to 70.66. Shares traded in a buy zone after hitting an entry point at 64.40 out of a consolidation period that began in August. Biotech stocks, though, were broadly down almost 1% Tuesday.Juno Therapeutics (JUNO), too, jumped more than 2.7% to 24.04 on Kite's news. Both are working on drugs to treat diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. At six months, Kite's drug, known as KTE-C19, showed a 31% complete response rate in 77 B-cell lymphoma patients, continuing the 33% response rate reported at three months.KTE-C19 achieved a best overall response rate of 82% and response rate of 49% in the patient group. Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt noted the results are ""durable,"" and also set the bar for Juno's drug, known as JCAR017. Juno plans to begin a trial using JCAR017 in the same type of lymphoma patients during 2017.Biotech Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) saw shares charge higher by 6.1% to 49.77, well above their 50-day moving average on consensus-crushing, fourth-quarter metrics. Ionis posted 24 cents earnings per share excluding certain items, though analysts expected a 12-cent loss. Sales of $160.35 million topped by nearly $63 million.IBD'S TAKE: Want more on the biotech and pharma industry? Be sure to stop by IBD's Biotech & Pharma Stock page for best ideas in the sector.The upward stock motion Tuesday was largely limited to Kite and Ionis, though. Exelixis (EXEL) stock recovered from an earlier beating following Stifel Nicolaus analyst Stephen Willey's downgrade to a hold rating from buy. Willey cited Exelixis' inflated valuation and lack of inputs to support it for his downgrade.""Everything (is) going right"" at Exelixis, he wrote in a note. On Monday, Exelixis posted strong fourth-quarter results and announced immuno-oncology partnerships with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Roche (RHHBY). But shares fell 6.8% Tuesday, closing at 21.52.Tenet stock toppled 14.9% to 19.30 after reporting 6 cents earnings per share minus certain items on $4.85 billion in sales, missing the consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for 22 cents and $4.96 billion, respectively.Perrigo, though, continued on its downward stock path on Tuesday.

299,O,"Horizon Pharma (HZNP) stock toppled to a month-low Monday despite ""nothing alarming"" in its Q4 report, though sales of Ravicti were ""unexpectedly disappointing"" and 2017 sales guidance lagged, said Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler.Meanwhile, a number of biotech stocks shot up at least 7% in the stock market today — Bluebird Bio (BLUE), Cara Therapeutics (CARA) and Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND).Horizon stock, though, fell 5.6% to 16.48, after earlier falling as much as 7.4%. Shares are now trading below their 50-day moving average and have spent two months below their 200-day average.For Q4, Horizon reported $310.35 million in sales, up 27% vs. the year-earlier quarter and narrowly topping views for $309.6 million. Earnings per share minus items were flat at 64 cents, but crushed the 51-cent consensus model.IBD'S TAKE: Horizon's partnership with Bristol-Myers Squibb in kidney and bladder cancer is taking advantage of the emerging immuno-oncology field which, analysts say, could be worth $25 billion by 2025. Get more on the potential opportunity via this deep I-O dive.Brand performance in Q4 was mixed, Koffler wrote. Duexis sales fell 15.7% year over year to $46.2 million but beat expectations. Vimovo sales lagged at $31.6 million vs. analysts' model for $33.1 million, and were down 32.8%. Pennsaid 2% solution sales, on the other hand, beat by $11 million at $96.6 million, rising 74.4%.""The company appears to have stabilized its average net realized price for Duexis, Vimovo, Pennsaid 2% and Rayos in 2016, declining to $496 in Q4 2016 from $504 in Q4 2015,"" Koffler wrote. ""It is not yet clear how ANRP will evolve under the new (pharmacy benefit manager) contracting model.""Orphan business was also weak, with Actimmune sales coming in at $24.2 million, missing views for $25.8 million and dipping 13.9% vs. last year, Koffler wrote. Actimmune is being tested with Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) Opdivo in kidney and bladder cancer.Ravicti sales of $32.9 million were well below expectations for $44.2 million, but only fell 4.6% on a year-over-year basis.Guidance for 2017 sales of $1.24 billion to $1.29 billion bracketed the consensus for $1.28 billion, but was short at the midpoint. Sales would be up 20.5% at the midpoint of guidance.Koffler kept her 25 price target and buy rating on Horizon stock.As for Bluebird, the stock rose 7.1% to 87.85, hitting a 14-month high and still in a buy zone after breaking out of a cup-with-handle base at 78.90 on Feb. 14. Cara stock is extended from its Jan. 25 breakout at 12.84. Its shares hit a 13-month high of 17.20 on Feb. 1 and jumped 7.9% Monday, to 16.21.

300,O,"OPEC and top nonmember producers reportedly will meet May 25 as they remain publicly undecided over whether to extend production cuts. But crude prices fell the most in six weeks Wednesday as U.S. output continues to rebound and gasoline supplies rose.The cartel and its allies will meet jointly to discuss production, Reuters reported, citing sources. Last year, OPEC and non-members such as Russia met separately.Earlier Wednesday, OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo stopped short of saying the output deal to remove 1.8 million barrels of oil per day from the market would be renewed for another six months, as U.S. crude production continues to rebound. ButBut Barkindo said at a conference in Abu Dhabi that the cartel and other top nonmember producers are committed to keeping global crude inventories below the five-year average.Inventories have been heading back down in the U.S. and dropped by 1 million barrels in the latest week, the Energy Information Administration said Wednesday, a smaller drop than expected. The American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, reported a 840,000-barrel drop in inventories late Tuesday. Gasoline inventories rose by 1.5 million barrels, the first gain in two months, EIA said. Distillates fell.U.S. crude production rose to 9.252 million barrels per day from 9.235 million barrels in the week prior, continuing a strong rebound, according to EIA.The existing output pact reached late last year between OPEC and key non-OPEC producers lifted oil prices and encouraged U.S. firms to lift their own output, which has since put pressure back down on prices.Now the deal's participants must weigh whether another such agreement is worth it, given that any price increases would spur more U.S. production.U.S. crude futures tumbled, falling 3.8% to $50.44 a barrel.Dow Jones industrial component Exxon Mobil (XOM) fell 0.7% on the stock market today. Fellow Dow stock Chevron (CVX) lost 1.4%. Both Exxon and Chevron are stuck below their 50-day and 200-day moving averages. BP (BP) was down 1.5%. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) fell 2.4%.OPEC will meet May 25, when a decision on extending the output deal is expected, but Barkindo said it's too early to say whether Iran, Nigeria and Libya, who are currently excluded from the output cut, will participate if the cuts are extended.Kuwaiti Oil Minister Issam Almarzooq told Bloomberg that Iran would likely keep its output flat if the cuts are extended.On Monday, Saudi Energy minster Khalid al-Falih also said it's premature to talk about extending the output cut after reports last week suggested that the de facto OPEC leader would back an extension.By the time OPEC meets next month, members must grapple with further gains in U.S. shale. On Monday, the EIA said it sees May shale output climbing 123,000 barrels per day to 5.19 million barrels with the majority of production grown seen in Texas' prolific Permian basin.Among top U.S. shale producers, Continental Resources (CLR) fell 3.1%, EOG Resources (EOG) 1.6% and Diamondback Energy (FANG) 2.5%.RELATED: Dow's IBM Gets Price Cut, Goldman Upgraded, Oil Majors Downgraded

Oil prices also searched for direction before closing modestly lower for a second straight sesssion.Energy minster Khalid al-Falih told reporters Monday ""it is premature to talk about extending the cut,"" according to a Wall Street Journal report.Last week, anonymous sources told the Journal that Riyadh would back extending the deal to remove 1.8 million barrels daily from the market until the end of the year, when the cartel meets on May 25.U.S. crude closed down 0.5% to $52.41 a barrel.Dow Jones industrial component Exxon Mobil (XOM) fell 0.65% to 81.05 on the stock market today. Fellow Dow stock Chevron (CVX) lost 0.5%. Exxon fell through its 50-day moving average on Friday. Chevron undercut its 200-day line at the end of last week.Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) was off 0.9%. BP (BP) fell 1%.Saudi Arabia has been sending mixed signals about the output deal, want to convince markets that they'll curb production while leaving doubts in the minds of U.S. shale producers. In March, Al-Falih said the agreement could be prolonged if inventories are ""still above the five-year average"" and earlier he said he wanted ""conformity by all"" before extending the cuts.Saudi officials also warned U.S. shale producers last month that they shouldn't assume an extension will be automatic.But U.S. producers continue to boost production. On Monday, the Energy Department's Energy Information Administration said it sees May shale production climbing 123,000 barrels per day to 5.19 million barrels with the majority of production grown seen in Texas' prolific Permian basin.In a report out last week, the EIA said it still sees U.S. crude production averaging 9.2 million barrels a day this year but raised its outlook for 2018 to 9.9 million barrels from a prior outlook of 9.7 million.Among notable shale producers, Continental Resources (CLR) retreated 1.2% to 44.63. EOG Resources (EOG) slid about 1%. Diamondback Energy (FANG) fell 1.9%. Continental and Diamondback are trading just below their 50-day lines, while EOG Resources is testing 200-day averages.RELATED:U.S. Rig Count Jumps By 11 To Two-Year High; Oil Markets Near Balance

But with the oil cartel cutting output and talking about extending curbs past mid-year, U.S. production hit its highest level in 20 months. CrU.S. oil stockpiles fell by 2.2 million barrels last week, according to the Energy Information Administration.  Analysts expected a 87,000 barrel increase. The American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, reported a 1.3 million barrel draw late Tuesday.Total gasoline inventories fell by 3 million barrels last week, but gasoline production rose to over 9.9 million barrels per day. On Monday, the EIA said gasoline prices are expected to average $2.39 per gallon this year, with gas averaging $2.46 per gallon during the peak April-through-September driving season vs. $2.23 per gallon last summer.U.S. production continued its climb, hitting 9.24 million barrels per day, up from 9.20 million barrels the week prior.U.S. crude futures snapped a seven-session winning streak, closing down 0.5% to $53.11 a barrel.Shares of Dow Jones industrial average component Exxon Mobil (XOM) rose 0.2% to 82.97 on the stock market today.

In February, output slipped to 31.96 million barrels a day from 32.1 million in January,Saudi Arabia's production rose by 41,600 barrels per day to 9.994 million barrels per day, according to secondary sources. But Saudi Arabia said it lowered production by 110,000 barrels per day last month to 9.9 million barrels, after increasing production in February.The OPEC report also found that global crude supply fell by 226,000 barrels per day last month to average 95.82 million barrels per day.On Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Saudi Arabia, OPEC's de factor leader, will back an extension of an agreement for OPEC and top non-OPEC producers to remove 1.8 million barrels daily from the market.RELATED: U.S. Oil Rigs Rise By 10 As Crude Markets Weigh Syria Attacks

306,O,"No. 3 biotech Celgene (CELG) set a lofty goal Thursday: Tack on annual EPS growth 2020-3030 even as cancer blockbuster Revlimid loses patent exclusivity in 2027. But investors were seemingly disappointed Celgene didn't update its 2020 guidance.Celgene also announced an agreement to acquire privately held biotech Delinia for an initial $300 million payment and contingent $425 million payments for developments in Delinia's lead program, DEL-106, an IL-2 mutation Fc fusion protein designed to regulate T cells.The acquisition is expected to close next quarter. Celgene expects it to expand the company's pipeline of autoimmune treatment drugs.In the stock market today, Celgene stock fell 2.15% to finish at 111.53. Shares fell as much as 2.6% in earlier trading. Evercore analyst Mark Schoenebaum noted Celgene had seen ""upside"" to 2020 views during the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference this month.Though Celgene reiterated that ""upside"" verbiage during the Q4 earnings conference call with analysts Thursday morning, the company didn't boost its 2020 guidance.

See how analysts expected the group's largest companies to do on IBD's Industry Themes.""Early feedback I've gotten from clients is that some folks thought Celgene might officially raise their 2020 guidance today,"" Schoenebaum said in a note to clients. ""They did not, in fact, raise 2020 targets.

On Monday, shares rose nearly 6% to 14.94. In intraday trading Monday, they reached a more than 16-year high of 15.86.ON Semi earned price-target increases from Baird, Mizuho, Needham and Pacific Crest Securities. On Monday, it received a PT hike from Susquehanna Financial Group.On Sunday, ON Semi said in Q4 it earned 29 cents a share excluding items, up 53% year over year, on sales of $1.26 billion, up 50%. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected 23 cents and $1.22 billion. The company also guided higher for the current quarter.IBD'S TAKE: ON Semiconductor stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 90, meaning it has outperformed 90% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. But it ranks No. 10 out of 39 stocks in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group.

308,O,"U.S. crude stockpiles rose for the sixth straight week, according to Energy Information Administration data out Wednesday, but inventories were down at the key delivery hub in Cushing, Okla.Oil prices reversed higher then turned lower again, with U.S. crude down 0.5% to $52.94 per barrel and Brent down 0.5% at $55.69.Also Wednesday, shale producer Diamondback Energy (FANG) said it sees moderate cost increases if oil prices stay in the $50-$55 a barrel range.The EIA said stocks jumped by 9.5 million barrels, well above the 3.5 million-barrel increase analysts expected but roughly comparable with the 9.94 million-barrel increase the American Petroleum Institute found.""The market realizes that a big part of that increase was the previously announced sales of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve,"" Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group, wrote of the API results in his morning energy update.Oil stocks at the Cushing hub were down by 702,000 barrels. Gasoline stocks climbed by 2.8 million barrels vs. analysts expectations for a 752,000-barrel drop. Production was flat at 8.98 million barrels per day.Exxon Mobil (XOM) shares dipped 0.4% to close at 83.16 on the stock market today. Chevron (CVX) edged up 5 cents to 112.57. Continental Resources (CLR) fell 1.4% to 46.32. EOG Resources (EOG) dipped 0.5% to 100.75.Diamondback Energy hosted its fourth-quarter earnings call Wednesday after reporting Q4 results late Tuesday.As drilling activity continues to ramp back up, the shale producer assumes a 10%-15% increase in service costs this year. But Chief Executive Travis Stice said service prices haven't yet increased in the first quarter, and if oil stays between $50 and $55 per barrel, cost increases would be ""muted.""Diamondback shares jumped 3.9% to 111.84.And when the increases do happen, Stice said they will be on the completion side of operations, especially pressure pumping, vs. the drilling side.In a survey last month, Barclays found that 80% of U.S. exploration and production companies expect an increase in oilfield service prices this year but more than half only expect an increase of up to 10%.But Halliburton (HAL) recently warned oilfield service prices would increase by more than 10% this year.Stice said that Diamondback is insulated from some of the cost increases, as half its total cost savings seen since the downturn started are permanent efficiency gains.Late Tuesday, the company reported Q4 earnings that jumped 58% to 90 cents per share with revenue up 62% to $185 million, both beating Wall Street views.

Analyst consensus had called for $324.4 million and 13 cents.Sales of Jakafi, the company's main product, which is used to treat myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera, a bone marrow disorder, rose 30% in Q4 to $237.5 million. RBC Capital analyst Simos Simeonidis says the consensus called for $238.3 million in Q4 Jakafi sales.Novartis (NVS) paid Incyte $33 million and $111 million in Q4 and 2016, respectively, to market the drug outside the U.S., as Jakavi.Iclusig, which wasn't being sold a year ago, brought in $12.87 million. Incyte sells Iclusig outside the U.S. in a deal with Ariad Pharmaceuticals (ARIA). Japan's Takeda Pharmaceuticals last month announced an agreement to acquire Ariad for $5.2 billion.Incyte wrapped up 2016 with $1.1 billion in sales, up 47%, and EPS of 54 cents, up from 3 cents in 2015.For 2017, Incyte guided to $1.02 billion to $1.07 billion in Jakafi sales and $60 million to $65 million in Iclusig sales, which would be up 23% and 119% vs. the year-earlier quarter.

316,O,"Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) stock toppled early Thursday after the biotech reported mixed Q4 earnings and lowered its 2017 earnings guidance by 15 cents, leaving analysts to question whether Merck (MRK) will win the ongoing I-O rivalry.In the stock market today, Bristol-Myers stock tumbled 5.5% to 46.82 and touched its lowest price since September 2013. Bristol shares are down 20% this year. Merck stock, on the other hand, rose a fraction, to 61.20, and is up 4% in 2017.For Q4, Bristol-Myers reported $5.2 billion in sales, up 22% year over year, and topping analysts' views for $5.1 billion. But its 63 cents earnings per share ex items, though up 66%, missed the 67 cents analysts had modeled. Sales of immuno-oncology drug Opdivo grew to $835 million.The company wrapped up 2016 with $19.4 billion in sales and $2.83 EPS ex items, up a respective 17% and 41%. Opdivo brought in $1.31 billion, topping views for $1.16 billion, Evercore analyst Mark Schoenebaum said.IBD'S TAKE: While Bristol-Myers offered mixed guidance, analysts expect Incyte to outperform the industry on its potential blockbusters. Get more ""Incyte"" on The New America.U.S. Opdivo sales rose 74% in 2016 to $715 million. That disappointed, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said in a research report. The beat on Opdivo was mostly due to outside-U.S. sales, Schoenebaum said in his report.Bristol-Myers also adjusted its full-year EPS minus items guidance downward by 15 cents to $2.70-$2.90 from $2.85-$3.05. The high end of the new guidance missed analysts' expectations for $2.96. Worldwide sales are expected to increase by low-single digits. Analysts had viewed 2.9% growth.Schoenebaum suggested the EPS guidance cut could be due to increasing competition in second-line non-small cell lung cancer, continued rivalry with Merck in first-line NSCLC, Bristol's decision against seeking accelerated approval for an I-O combo and/or exchange rate issues.Whatever the reason, Schoenebaum questioned ""can Bristol-Myers news get worse from here?""This month, Bristol decided against seeking accelerated approval for its Opdivo plus Yervoy combo in first-lung non-small cell lung cancer — an I-O cocktail most analysts suggest could be more potent than Merck's Keytruda plus chemo combo. But the latter already has accelerated approval.Still, ""our NPV (net present value) analysis indicates that even with zero first-line lung cancer sales (which is an unreasonable assumption), this stock is worth something like $40,"" Schoenebaum wrote in a research report.Leerink's Fernandez, though, still sees major value in Bristol-Myers despite the temporary missteps.""Opdivo, Yervoy, and the burgeoning I-O pipeline at Bristol is a high-value industry asset that cannot be ignored,"" he said. ""If history teaches us anything in pharma, it is that companies suffering from short-term missteps or surprises but with great assets are more likely than not to become vulnerable M&A targets over time if there isn't either a reversal of fortune or a series of value-added pipeline surprises.""RELATED:Could Merck's 'Meaningful' Keytruda Royalties Give Bristol-Myers A Leg Up?Bristol-Myers Dives On Opdivo Setback, Will Get Keytruda RoyaltiesFDA Track Record Bodes Well For Merck Keytruda Plus Chemo: Leerink

321,O,"Roche's (RHHBY) Tecentriq is modestly trailing Merck's (MRK) Keytruda and continues to chip away at Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) share of the second-line lung cancer market, Barclays analyst Geoff Meacham said Tuesday.Overall, immuno-oncology drugs have swiped 30% of the total lung cancer market, up from the high 20% range seen in previous quarters, Meacham said in a research report. I-O drugs are most popular in second-line non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma, with 60% and 60%-70% shares, respectively.Bristol-Myers, though, is struggling in the second-line NSCLC setting, Meacham says. In Q4, Opdivo saw its high 40% share of the market fall as Tecentriq gained by mid-single digits sequentially. Tecentriq is now modestly trailing Keytruda, he says.Investors are seemingly disappointed that Bristol-Myers isn't seeking accelerated approval for its Opdivo plus Yervoy combination in first-line NSCLC. I-O combos are widely suspected to be more potent than combining I-O plus chemo. Merck is testing the latter with Keytruda plus Eli Lilly's (LLY) Alimta.Keytruda already is approved as a monotherapy in first-line NSCLS for patients with a high expression of the PD-L1 gene, metastatic melanoma, and head and neck squamous-cell carcinoma. The Food and Drug Administration recently granted priority review to its I-O/chemo combination.IBD'S TAKE: Merck, Biogen and Eli Lilly tied in 2016 for two drug approvals apiece, leading the broader biotech industry. Who trailed? Get more on IBD's Industry Themes.The combo could open Merck up to a broader patient population. Only 25%-30% of patients fall into the category of having a high expression of the PD-L1 gene. But half of patients are being tested, Meacham says. Four in 10 have the gene, regardless of expression.Chemotherapy is dominant in first-line NSCLC, where it has an 80% share to Keytruda's 11%. Still, momentum looks good in 2017 for Keytruda, Meacham said. But sentiment is more negative on Bristol-Myers following its decision against the accelerated regulatory route for Opdivo plus Yervoy.""For Bristol, the recent decision not to pursue an accelerated first-line pathway has little impact on our near-term estimates, but increasingly negative sentiment makes the premium to the group harder to sustain absent convincing pivotal data,"" he wrote in a research report.Meacham trimmed his price target on Bristol-Myers stock to 58 from 65. His rating on the overall biotech industry is positive.Bristol-Myers stock fell 2.1% to 48.96 on Tuesday, coming within a penny of a more than two-year low. Merck fell 1% to 61.21.RELATED:FDA Track Record Bodes Well For Merck Keytruda Plus Chemo: LeerinkCould Merck's 'Meaningful' Keytruda Royalty Give Bristol-Myers A Leg Up?Bristol-Myers Dives On Opdivo Setback, Will Get Keytruda Royalties

322,O,"Amazon (AMZN) reportedly is preparing to enter a huge retail sector — auto parts — sending shares of AutoZone (AZO), O'Reilly Auto Parts (ORLY) and Advance Auto Parts (AAP) sharply lower on Monday.Amazon already has deals with Robert Bosch, Federal-Mogul (FDML), Dorman Products (DORM) and Cardone Industries, the New York Post reported, citing sources.The do-it-yourself aftermarket auto parts is a $50 billion business.AutoZone fell 4% to 739.29 on the stock market today. O'Reilly Auto Parts lost 3.3% and Advance Auto Parts 2.2%. Shares of eBay (EBAY) dipped 1.2% amid concerns that eBay's online auto parts sales will come under pressure.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon is trying to break out this week, as several ""FANG+"" big cap tech stocks are all at or near buy zones.Amazon stock climbed 1.2% to 817.90. The stock has now formed a handle in its cup base, which means it has a new, lower buy point of 821.75.But Amazon may be a niche player, wrote RBC analyst Scot Ciccarelli in a note. Casual DIY auto parts buyers won't feel comfortable buying specific parts on their own, while commercial customers will want parts delivered in a shorter window than Amazon will be able to offer, Ciccarelli said.

323,O,"Cancer biotech Tesaro (TSRO) could fetch north of $200 per share in a rumored takeover, Credit Suisse and Leerink analysts suggested this week, as Tesaro stock bounded to record highs Wednesday and Thursday.But on Friday, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez recommended Tesaro buyers hang out on the sidelines amid the potential M&A flurry. He downgraded Tesaro stock to a market perform rating from outperform, though he upped his price target to 186 from 152.In the stock market today, Tesaro stock fell 2.6% to 182.02, after touching a record high of 192 intraday Thursday.Tesaro stock jumped 167% in 2016, and has increased fivefold over the past eight months. Investors clearly value Tesaro's niraparib as the leading PARP inhibitor, Fernandez said. Tesaro's drug competes against FDA-approved drugs from AstraZeneca (AZN) and Clovis Oncology (CLVS).""Barring a takeout, upside from current levels looks challenging given the competitive event path over the (next six) to 12 months,"" he wrote in a research note, ""although preclinical evidence suggests that niraparib may have better activity than AstraZeneca's Lynparza and Clovis' Rubraca.""IBD'S TAKE: Among biotechs, Incyte is a steady bet, analysts say. With a pipeline of potential blockbusters, Incyte could generate $2.5 billion to $3 billion in peak sales on its Jakafi alone. Dive into The New America for more on Incyte's catalysts.Niraparib is under priority review by the Food and Drug Administration to treat ovarian, fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancers. Key trials are also being conducted in first-line and second-line breast and prostate cancer.Success in those trials could boost Tesaro's valuation as an M&A target, Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young said Thursday. She estimates $1 billion in unadjusted sales in 2020 and $4.3 billion in 2025 across ovarian and all indicated therapies. That's up from very little. The company, which made its IPO in 2012, has just started to generate revenue. It's expected to have ended 2016 with revenue of about $53 million. It hasn't yet set a date for its Q4 earnings release.Young sees Tesaro grabbing a third of the first-line metastatic breast cancer market in patients with the BRCA mutation, and grabbing $500 million in the prostate cancer market in a collaboration with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).Fernandez views $1.6 billion in total 2021 sales, though others are more bullish with projections of $2.2 billion assuming ""dominance across the key registrational trials currently underway or completed in breast, ovarian and prostate cancer."" A takeover could top $220 per share, he said.All that is without taking into account Tesaro's immuno-oncology pipeline. It is currently testing checkpoint inhibitors include PD-1, LAG-3 and TIM-3. These drugs work by teaching the immune system to see, and destroy, cancer cells that often hide behind normal-looking proteins.Credit Suisse' Young puts a $2.5 billion sales estimate on Tesaro's I-O platform. Assuming success in niraparib across breast, ovarian and prostate cancers could mean a $169-$210 per share takeover price. That would jump to $197-$243 per share with I-O success, she said.""We wouldn't expect Tesaro to agree to a takeout without credit to this platform, which is our thesis over 2017 as well,"" she wrote in a research report.Young kept her outperform rating and 151 price target on Tesaro stock. News of Tesaro's potential acquisition interest wasn't a surprise, she said.""We ... think that an auction process for this company will be highly competitive, with most of the big global biotech and pharma companies coming to the table to talk,"" she said.RELATED:Tesaro Rockets To All-Time High On Rumored Takeout InterestTesaro, AstraZeneca Could Shrink Clovis' Ovarian Cancer Drug PoolBiotech Stocks Might Catalyze, Or Plunge, On 4 Key Sectors In 2017

"
325,O,"Infrastructure: Of all the things President Trump has promised, none gets as much bipartisan love as his pledge to spend $1 trillion on infrastructure and create ""millions"" of jobs. Sounds great. But the idea that spending will be a big boost to the economy is a mistaken one.Speaking Thursday to airline executives, Trump described the U.S.' obsolete ""plane system, obsolete airports, obsolete trains, we have bad roads.""He's going to fix all that. ""You're going to be so happy with Trump,"" the president promised. Airline stocks soared.Well, sure. And no, we won't get tired of all the winning. But while we are solidly in favor of reasonable, targeted spending on infrastructure, it's not at all clear that we need a crash program — or that the nation would be better off if it built a bunch of megaprojects, including the proposed California bullet train or even a possible Olympics.A study by the man known as the world's foremost expert on megaprojects — Bent Flyvbjerg, a professor at Oxford University's Said Business School — shows why this is so. Politicians inevitably promise to spend a pittance on building their grandiose schemes, he says, but inevitably vastly overspend their budget. Any economic rationale for having the project disappears in a pool of red ink.And that's not hyperbole.""The vast majority of these instances of billion-dollar spending ... ultimately result in a net loss to economies,"" notes Flyvbjerg, in a paper on the Cato Institution website.And, he adds, these projects operate on the ""Iron Law of Megaprojects"": ""Over budget, over time, over and over again.""Flyvbjerg's research shows that nine out of 10 big projects have cost overruns. ""Overruns of up to 50% in real terms are common, over 50% not uncommon.""Take the much-beloved Channel Tunnel, which links Britain to France. It was 80% over the estimated cost, in real terms. Boston's Big Dig, another megadisaster, was 220% over. The memorable Sydney Opera House, 1,400% over. The list goes on and on. But the fact is, once over budget, very few of these projects make much economic sense.The Channel Tunnel is instructive. It was sold to both French and British investors as a can't-miss economic and financial boon, built with both nations' governments' backing and blessing. Private finance poured in.Not only was it 80% over budget, but its financing costs were 140% higher than thought. Meanwhile, revenues from passengers and cargo on the route has been half of what was forecast. The result? ""The internal rate of return on the investment is negative, with a total loss to the British economy of $17.8 billion.""In answer to such claims, proponents point out that the cross-channel train is both fast and price-competitive with the alternatives. True enough. But that's only because each person who rides the underwater tunnel train is heavily subsidized by the private investors who went bust financing the project.In this case, private investors got fleeced — but usually, taxpayers do. The Democrats rubber-stamped President Obama's foolish ""stimulus"" and ""shovel ready jobs"" and had nothing to show for it but trillions in debt.Oh, and about the border wall here in the U.S. which was originally to cost just a couple billion and be built in a year? The Department of Homeland Security now estimates it will cost $22 billion and take 3 1/2 years to build. American taxpayers should hope that President Trump can get Mexico to pay for it, otherwise they'll get a much bigger bill than they expected.The real problem is, such projects often result from little more than fraudulent estimates put forward by politicians, financial agencies, and builders, leading to negative net economic returns. The great economist Albert O. Hirschman called this the ""Hiding Hand,"" which amounts to this: If those who want a project badly are completely honest about it, it will never get built. So they deceive the public.The legendary California politician Willie Brown, known for his slippery ethics and silky way with words, once put it this way: ""If people knew the real cost from the start, nothing would ever be approved. The idea is to get going. Start digging a hole and make it so big, there's no alternative to coming up with the money to fill it in.""Brown as usual is good for a laugh, but it's very bad public policy. When President Trump inevitably seeks a massive amount of money to rebuild the nation's infrastructure, we hope at the very least Congress will look over the individual projects proposed with a jaundiced eye, keeping in mind the ""Hiding Hand.""It's their job. Knowing the poor record of overspending and losses on questionable projects, it's the least they can do.RELATED:What Should Trump Do First?

330,O,"AstraZeneca (AZN) execs remained confident Thursday on immuno-oncology combinations despite Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) decision in January against seeking accelerated approval for a rival combo from the Food and Drug Administration.But Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez was less enthused on AstraZeneca's Q4 and 2016, and 2017 guidance — all hinging on a year-over-year increase in externalization revenue and other operating income. Plus, AstraZeneca needs to restructure SG&A (Selling, General and Administrative expenses), Fernandez said Friday.On its face, AstraZeneca smashed Wall Street's Q4 and 2016 expectations. For Q4, the firm printed $5.86 billion in sales and $1.21 core earnings per share, topping the consensus for $5.43 billion and 59 cents. Though sales fell 13% vs. last year, EPS grew 29%.For 2016, AstraZeneca reported $23 billion in sales, down 7%, but edging views for $22.9 billion. Core EPS came in at $4.31, up 1%, and more than doubling the consensus view of $2.09.But in Q4 and 2016, product sales declined 15% and 10%, respectively. Externalization revenue grew a respective 58% and 69% on a year-over-year basis. Other operating income was up 10% in 2016. Guidance for 2017 depends on increases in those metrics, Fernandez said.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech Incyte is often referred to as a ""throwback"" to what biotech companies ought to be doing. And its stock price has reflected that over recent months. Dive into The New America for a deeper look into Incyte and its blockbuster potentials.AstraZeneca guided to low to mid single-digit declines in sales and core EPS for 2017. To stave off some of those declines, the sum of externalization revenue and other operating income is expected to be ahead of 2016, the company said.In 2017, AstraZeneca has a slew of trials slated to unveil data. Key among those is the Mystic trial, which looks at durvalumab and tremelimumab in first-line non-small lung cancer. Progression-free survival (PFS) data is due in mid-2017.Mystic is expected to be a key indicator of Bristol's Checkpoint-227 trial. Both trials are examining I-O combinations that target PD-1 and CTLA-4 checkpoints in advanced lung cancer. But in January, BMS decided against seeking accelerated approval for its I-O combo in lung cancer.Still, AstraZeneca isn't concerned, Chief Medical Officer Sean Bohen said on the Q4 earnings conference call early Thursday. AstraZeneca assumed from the beginning that accelerated approval wouldn't work for an I-O combo based on the high bar already set by the standard of care (chemotherapy).""The BMS announcement — part of what you're asking is what did BMS see. I don't know any more than you do about what BMS saw,"" Bohen told an analyst on the call. ""It was our assumption that, that accelerated approval path wouldn't work.""AstraZeneca ended trading up 1.3% to 27.92 on the stock market today.

333,O,"U.S. stock indexes recovered nicely, trimming the day's losses as the market struggled with the Trump factor.The Nasdaq ended flat, while the S&P 500 and the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average dropped 0.1% and 0.5%, respectively. The small-cap S&P 600 rose more than 0.8%. Volume in the stock market today was running slightly higher on both major exchanges, according to preliminary data.President Trump has shaken the Street with his apparent willingness to risk a trade war and his aggressive immigration policies. The top items on the Street's wish list include lower corporate taxes and a rollback on regulations that slow economic growth. Any focus on anything other than economic growth could be regarded as wasted political capital.Still, the recent 1.5% pullback in the major indexes and almost 4.5% pullback in the small cap S&P 600 might be nothing more than a small decline after a decent run. The Nasdaq rose as much as 9% after Election Day, and the small cap S&P 600 thrust as much as 18%.On Tuesday, savings and loan BofI Holdings (BOFI) popped 4% in heavy volume. The stock recently found support and bounced off its 50-day moving average.Biotech stock Incyte (INCY) added 2.5% in above-average volume. The stock broke out Jan. 9 in twice its usual volume. Incyte's gap-up entry was the opening price of 113.55. The stock is 7% above that buy point.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, the day's big losers included airfreight, steel and cement stocks. Gold miners and medical stocks were among the day's gainers.Apple (AAPL) faded 0.3% in brisk volume as the market awaited the iPhone maker's quarterly report after the close. The Street expected Apple to report earnings of $3.22 a share but results came in at $3.36. Revenue was pegged at $77.38 billion, but Apple delivered $78.4 billion. After hours, Apple rose 2.8%.In the blue chip Dow industrials, Procter & Gamble (PG) posted one of the biggest gains, up 1% in average trade. The megacap has added a handle to its cup base. The potential buy point is 88.07. Procter & Gamble's annualized dividend yield is 3.1%.RELATED:Apple Price Target Cut, But Amazon, Facebook Rated BuysGoldman Loses Key Support; Banks Fall

334,O,"Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Ono Pharmaceuticals could benefit from a ""meaningful"" royalty stream on Merck's (MRK) Keytruda following a $625 million settlement announced Friday, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said Monday.In the stock market today, Merck and Bristol-Myers stocks split the difference. Merck stock dipped 1.2% to 61.81, while Bristol-Myers stock lifted 1.6% to 50. That was a reversal from Friday, when Merck rose 3.6% but Bristol-Myers plunged 11% to a more than two-year low.Merck will make Bristol-Myers a one-time payment of $625 million to settle all patent infringement litigation related to Keytruda. Merck will also pay a 6.5% royalty on Keytruda sales from January 2017 through December 2023. The rate will drop to 2.5% for the following three years.Bristol-Myers will get 75% of the royalties. Japan's Ono will get the remainder. Bristol-Myers and Ono developed Opdivo in 2014, using the PD-1 antibody to target cancer in the U.S., Europe, Australia and Japan. The duo say Merck's Keytruda infringed on their patent.IBD'S TAKE: Merck tied Biogen and Eli Lilly for most drug approvals in 2016 (two apiece). But that was the slowest year in nine years for the FDA. Read IBD'S Industry Themes for deeper analysis.Keytruda also targets cancer via the programmed cell death-1 receptor (PD-1). Keytruda is approved as a monotherapy for metastatic melanoma and head and neck squamous-cell carcinoma. Late last year, it got an indication for non-small cell lung cancer in patients with a high expression of the PD-L1 gene.Now, Merck is testing Keytruda (an immuno-oncology drug) in combination with Eli Lilly's Alimta chemotherapy. Meanwhile, Bristol-Myers is looking at combining Opdivo and Yervoy (both I-O drugs) in NSCLC. Though Bristol-Myers isn't looking for accelerated approval for the combo.Divan estimates Keytruda will garner $4.6 billion in sales this year, rising to $10 billion in 2022. The royalty on those sales could be ""quite meaningful,"" he wrote in a research report. Still, Divan has an outperform rating on Merck stock and a neutral rating on Bristol-Myers stock.""The settlement will provide some underappreciated upside to Bristol-Myers and remove some of the economic contribution that is currently assumed for Merck,"" he wrote. ""But overall we still prefer Merck given the impact we expect Keytruda to have on Merck's sales and earnings growth.""RELATED:Bristol-Myers Threatens Merck's 'Head Start' In Lung Cancer: AnalystMerck Lung-Cancer Drug May Get OK For Large Patient PopulationMerck Carries Incyte On Keytruda Coattails In 4 'Hot' Tumors: Leerink

Amid the legal battle with rival Cisco, Arista Networks has rushed to ramp up manufacturing within the U.S.The U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agency late Friday said it would reinstate an import ban on Arista switches, pending further review, due to some ""concerns"" that its earlier decision in November to lift the ban was ""incorrect."" Cisco hailed the latest development in a blog post Saturday.If the CPB reverses its earlier ruling, Arista would no longer be able to import products for sales to U.S. customers.IBD'S TAKE: Arista Networks is No. 7 on the IBD 50, a screen of leading growth stocks. Chipmaker Nvidia still tops the IBD 50, but see what other takes make the list of stock that have performed the best over the past 52 weeks.""The good news is that Arista's U.S. contract manufacturer is up and running, which enables the company to supply its U.S. customers,"" said Jason Ader, a William Blair analyst, in a research report Tuesday. ""The bad news is that legal uncertainty has reared its ugly head (just when we thought legal risks were subsiding), while both supply constraints and gross margins could be worse than expected in the near term.""Arista Networks has denied infringing o Cisco's patents. It also says it has modified its network software to resolve issues. Many of Arista's senior executives come from Cisco.An International Trade Commission judge ruled Dec. 2 that Arista infringed on two Cisco patents. The ITC judge's ruling is subject to full commission review, which is expected to be completed by April 9.However, an eight-person jury in December ruled that Arista owed no damages over Cisco's claims of copyright infringement.It is important to understand that CBP has not ruled that Arista's products infringe,"" Arista said in a statement. ""Instead, CBP has expressed concern that its original ruling was incorrect, based on input provided by Cisco.""It is equally important to understand that Arista has not yet responded to Cisco's arguments and has not yet had an opportunity to address any concerns Customs may have as a result of those arguments. We look forward to engaging with CBP in the coming days, and we are confident that CBP will diligently and carefully evaluate the facts, as they have done throughout this process.""RELATED:As Networks Speed Up, Arista Gains Ground On Giant CiscoWill Broadcom Chip Boost Arista Networks Vs.

The Dow Jones industrial average underperformed, falling 0.8%, as Intel (INTC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) lagged.Several medical-related industry groups outperformed after Trump met with Big Pharma leaders. He called on CEOs to manufacture in the U.S. to curb rising drug prices.The Nasdaq composite lost 0.6% and the S&P 500 eased 0.5%.

338,O,"Exxon Mobil (XOM) boosted its 2017 capital spending budget by 14% as it expects activity to ramp up, and the oil giant backed ""free-market principles"" as President Donald Trump threatens to impose a border tax.The spending contrasts with Chevron, which said last week total investment would drop this year, though spending will rise on shale assets like those it holds in the Permian Basin.But Exxon is planning on $22 billion in capital spending this year, up 14% from its 2016 budget, which marked a 35% decline. And the additional dollars aren't due to higher prices for services and materials.The outlook ""doesn't reflect a year-on-year increase associated with cost inflation,"" said investor relations chief Jeff Woodbury during the company's conference call, noting that it's ""by and large a function of activity levels.""Exxon said its recent $6.6 billion purchase to double its stake in the Permian would add more than 3.4 billion barrels of oil to its inventory. And Exxon plans to increase drill well inventory to more than 45,000 wells in the play.Woodbury said the company is continuing to look for ""high-impact capital efficiencies to drive costs down.""IBD'S TAKE: Shale operators became more efficient as oil prices plunged. But part of their cost savings reflected lower oilfield-services costs. But with drilling activity ramping up, costs will rise too.Meanwhile, Trump's border tax proposal has rattled companies that rely heavily on imports and foreign factories, ranging from retail chains to automakers.Integrated global oil majors like Exxon, Chevron, BP (BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) also import oil for their refinery operations.When asked during the conference call about the import tax, Woodbury said Exxon would ""continue to advocate for free-market principles"" with a ""globally competitive"" and ""stable"" tax framework.Exxon shares fell 1.1% to 83.89 on the stock market today, sinking to their lowest level in nearly three months. Chevron, which reported weaker-than-expected Q4 earnings on Friday, dipped 0.4%.Permian-focused shale operators Parsley Energy (PE) rose 0.6%, EOG Resources (EOG) gained 0.4% and Diamondback Energy (FANG) rallied 2.6%.Exxon reported fourth-quarter earnings of 41 cents per share, down by 39% from a year ago. But excluding a $2 billion write-down on natural gas assets, Exxon's EPS was 90 cents. Analysts were expecting 70 cents.Revenue rose 2.2% to $61.1 billion, its first year-over-year gain since Q2 2014, but fell short of views for $62.28 billion.Production fell by 3% to 2.4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. The U.S. upstream division reported a loss of $2.3 billion, including the impairment charge of $2 billion.

339,O,"Eli Lilly (LLY) heisted some of Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Type 2 diabetes share in Q4, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said Wednesday, a day after Lilly stock outplayed a mixed quarter on a President Trump-related boost.Lilly stock ramped up 3.1% on Tuesday and continued in the black on Wednesday. At the closing bell on the stock market today, shares ended the regular session up 0.7% to 77.60, earlier touching a nearly three-month high of 78.57. Lilly stock reacted to a softer tone from Trump on Tuesday, who pledged to deregulate the industry and cut taxes.But Trump also called for drugmakers to manufacture in the U.S. in a meeting with executives from Celgene (CELG), Merck (MRK), Lilly, Novartis (NVS) and J&J. There, Trump reportedly backed off calls to revisit allowing the federal government to negotiate on behalf of Medicare and Medicaid.Fernandez, in a research note, said he was ""reluctant to call this first event a victory, but it was not as bad as prior commentary."" He kept his outperform rating and 91 price target on Lilly stock, noting the drugmaker's sales of diabetes drugs improved in Q4.Lilly's Q4 and 2016 sales topped estimates Tuesday, though earnings missed. Fernandez credited growth in diabetes products for sales performance. Sales of diabetes drugs Trulicity and Jardiance grew 200% and 421%, respectively, in 2016.IBD'S TAKE: Trump's commentary may have sent drug stocks on a run Tuesday, but his immigration ban on Monday toppled airline stocks. Who's falling and who will survive? Read IBD's Industry Themes for a deeper look.Trulicity belongs to a class of drugs called GLP-1 receptor inhibitors where it has 32% of new-to-brand share, with 30% year-over-year growth in the space, Fernandez wrote. Jardiance has 35% new-to-therapy share with endocrinologists, exceeding J&J's Invokana.Barclays analyst Geoff Meacham is less bullish, though he boosted his price target on Lilly stock to 85 from 80 and kept his outperform rating. In the Trump-rattled drug industry, Meacham says investors will prefer product-driven companies like Lilly.""Given the difficulty in triangulating where the drug pricing debate will settle out, we continue to prefer product-driven stories like Lilly with relatively low reliance on price or revenue concentration risk,"" he wrote in a research report.Lilly, though, is likely to struggle in the emerging immuno-oncology market, he wrote. The company is partnering with Merck to combine I-O drug Keytruda and chemotherapy Alimta to treat non-small-cell lung cancer. The FDA looks likely to approve the combo, he wrote.""We anticipate that the approval of KN-021G (a Phase 3 study) for Keytruda along with the recent favorable patent ruling could drive a pickup in Alimta growth,"" Meacham said.Outside oncology, Meacham expects Lilly to add two drugs to its pipeline in 2018: baricitinib for rheumatoid arthritis and galcanezumab in the anti-CGRP migraine market. In the latter arena, Lilly competes with Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA), Alder Pharmaceuticals (ALDR) and Amgen (AMGN).RELATED:Eli Lilly, Novartis Challenge Pfizer's Potential $8 Billion Breast Cancer DrugPfizer Reports Lagging Q4 EPS; Rebounds On Trump CommentaryBiotechs 'Round-Trip' Trump-Inspired Rally; FDA Appointment Key

340,O,"Incyte (INCY) could pull in $4.8 billion in 2026 peak sales on its Merck (MRK) partnership alone, Goldman Sachs analyst Salveen Richter said Friday — and that's without noting collaborations with AstraZeneca (AZN), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Roche (RHHBY).But those collaborations with AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers and Roche don't target the substantial non-small cell lung cancer market, an opportunity that Richter pegs at $2.7 billion in 2026 peak sales. And whether Incyte goes that route will likely depend on whether Merck pushes for exclusivity, she says.Richter boosted her price target Friday on Incyte stock to 149 from 116, and kept her buy rating. In the stock market today, Incyte stock rose 0.9% to 121.72. Shares are up 21% for the year but are now extended from a 110.05 buy point out of a flat base first touched on Jan. 9.Incyte's epacadostat is an immune-oncology, or I-O, drug, as are Keytruda from Merck, Opdivo and Yervoy from Bristol-Myers, Tecentriq from Roche and durvalumab from AstraZeneca. These therapies target PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4 and IDO molecules, which act as ""brakes"" on the immune system, providing a negative signal to T cells.IBD'S TAKE: Incyte has a slew of potential blockbusters, and not all in the immune-oncology sector. Dive into The New America for a deeper analysis for more ""Incyte"" into those potential markets.Tumor cells apply the brakes to prevent their destruction by the immune system, Richter explained. I-O drugs remove the brake, allowing T cells to attack the tumor. Combinations of I-O drugs are thought to be more potent than combining I-O with chemo (though Merck is testing that too).""Based on encouraging early data from epacadostat in combinations with Keytruda, we view Incyte's IDO (inhibitor) as one of the leading 'add-ons' to PD-1/PD-L1,"" she wrote in a research report.Merck and Bristol-Myers are often seen as going head-to-head in the I-O space as their Keytruda and Opdivo both target PD-1 and are approved as monotherapies for melanoma, advanced lung cancer, and head and neck cancer. Both firms are also working on combos.This month, though, Merck announced an expanded collaboration with Incyte to test Keytruda and epacadostat in a total of five tumor types: first-line melanoma, advanced lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, head and neck cancer and bladder cancer.Incyte's epacadostat is safe as a monotherapy, but only 29% of advanced melanoma patients in an earlier phase 1 trial could achieve a stable disease. In an earlier combo of epacadostat and Yervoy, 31% of patients hit an overall response rate. But toxicity also rose in the liver.""In our view, this result highlights the potential for I-O/I-O synergies with IDO, with a continued focus on finding the most effective I-O doublets as second generation immunotherapies continue to emerge,"" Richter said.She sees Incyte hitting $2.7 billion in 2026 peak sales in the NSCLC market alone. But that estimate could be conservative. Incyte could also team up with AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers and Roche in NSCLC, pending the details of exclusivity with Merck.Outside its partnership with Merck, Incyte is already testing epacadostat with AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers and Roche in treating other types of cancer.Editor's Note: Corrects fourth paragraph to correctly identify the Roche and AstraZeneca drugs.RELATED:Bristol-Myers Topples On 2017 Guidance Cut Amid Merck I-O RivalryCould Merck's 'Meaningful' Keytruda Royalty Give Bristol-Myers A Leg Up?Biotech Stocks Might Catalyze, Or Plunge, On These 4 Key Sectors In 2017

Tesaro stock rose 157% in 2016. The group, by contrast, fell 24%.Tesaro's performance makes it the seventh best-performing stock this year, of stocks that started the year above 10 and had a minimum average daily trading volume of 10,000 shares.This month, Tesaro's won priority review from the Food and Drug Administration for its ovarian cancer drug, niraparib. Niraparib belongs to a class of drugs called PARP inhibitors. Companies are studying whether inhibiting those enzymes could be a key to treating cancer.IBD'S TAKE: Donald Trump's election caused biotech and pharma stocks to yo-yo on Wall Street, first on relief that he wouldn't battle rising drug prices, then on worry over the president-elect's pledge to take up a fight that typically had been led by the Democratic party.Tesaro's FDA win came a day after the FDA approved Clovis Oncology's (CLVS) ovarian cancer drug. Previously, AstraZeneca was alone in the market, having a PARP inhibitor approved in 2014 for some uses. Medivation (MDVN) and AbbVie, too, are testing PARP inhibitors.Dermatologic biotech Novan (NOVN) and gene therapy firm Avexis (AVXS) followed Tesaro as top performers in 2016 among IBD's biotech group. Novan jumped 146% from its September IPO at 11. after rising 6% on Friday, while Avexis stock rose 139% following its initial public offering at 20 in February.Immuno-oncology biotech Merus (MRUS) filed its IPO at 10 in May and rose 111% in 2016. On the stock market today, Merus stock fell 1.3%, though, and it remained extended from a buy point at 19.73 achieved Dec. 21.Merus competes alongside Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Roche (RHHBY) and AstraZeneca, among others, in the immuno-oncology (I-O) market. Immunotherapies target the body's immune system to help fight cancers.Reata Pharmaceuticals (RETA) also filed its IPO at 11 in May and rose nearly 100% in 2016, falling 1.3% on Friday to 21.83.Reata works primarily on anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory drugs.After the top five, then come Theravance Biopharma (TBPH) (up 94.5%), Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN) (up 87.9%) and Xencor (XNCR) (up 80%).Of IBD's 44-company Medical-Ethical Drugs industry group — down 24.7% for the year — only August IPO Protagonist Therapeutics (PTGX) landed on the list of the top 100 performers this year.

Among oil majors, Exxon Mobil (XOM) rose 0.3%, BP (BP) climbed 2.1%, Chevron (CVX) rose 0.9% and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) added 1%.IBD'S TAKE: U.S. shale oil companies have been the biggest winners on the OPEC and ""NOPEC"" deals but shale companies still have debt and workforce issues that could hamper a quick uptick in drilling.U.S. shale firms should get a boost next year from rising oil prices after OPEC and top producers outside the cartel agreed to cut production by nearly 1.8 million barrels per day.Goldman now sees West Texas Intermediate crude at $57.50 per barrel, up from a prior outlook of $55 per barrel. For Brent crude, it now sees $59 per barrel up from $56.50. Earlier, Goldman warned that oil could fall to the $30s if OPEC couldn't reach a deal.While it's temping for members to cheat on deals, Saudi Arabia and other big producers are showing signs they will stick to the agreement.""Ultimately, our work on Saudi Arabia's fiscal balance suggests that the kingdom has a strong incentive to cut production to achieve a normalization of inventories, even if it requires a larger unilateral cut, consistent with comments last weekend by the energy minister,"" Goldman analysts said in the note.Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak also said Friday that all Russian oil companies, including Rosneft, will make cuts as part of the deal. And the Kuwait Petroleum Corp. told customers in the U.S. and Europe that it would cut back shipments starting Jan. 1, according to Bloomberg.""Every country is already taking steps to do what they say they are going to do which, by my estimation, will put oil in a global supply deficit early next year,"" Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group, wrote in his morning energy report.But a stronger dollar has weighed on oil prices after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday. Libya also is a drag on prices. The OPEC member is exempt from the output cuts and reports said it reopened a pipeline from the Sharara and El Feel oil fields.Still, the oil market is expected to rebalance next year.Earlier this week OPEC raised the demand outlook for its crude to 32.6 million barrels per day next year, up from 32.5 million barrels. The higher demand, coupled with the cooperation of Russia and other non-OPEC countries to cut production will ""bring forward the rebalancing of the oil market to the second half of 2017,"" OPEC said in its monthly report.RELATED: Chevron Cuts Spending To Keep 'Dividend Printing Machine' Going

346,O,"Stocks were in a holding pattern in afternoon trades Wednesday, hovering around the break-even point, as investors weighed a hotter-than-expected reading on wholesale inflation and weaker-than-expected November retail sales ahead of the Fed decision on interest rates at 2 p.m. ET.The FOMC is widely expected to raise the federal funds rate to a range of 0.50% to 0.75%. For now, the Fed has signaled two rate hikes in 2017, although if inflation ramps up, that outlook could change. Fed Chief Janet Yellen has a press conference scheduled for 2:30 p.m. ET.The Nasdaq inched up, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average were just slightly off. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking about 10%-20% lower than Tuesday's levels, although volume should pick up after the Fed decision.Caterpillar (CAT) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) lagged in the Dow, falling more than 1% each, while Cisco Systems (CSCO) and IBM (IBM) outperformed with fractional gains.At the New York Mercantile Exchange, January WTI crude oil futures slipped 1% to $52.30 a barrel. The 10-year Treasury yield eased 4 basis points to 2.43%.Steel producers outperformed after some selling Tuesday. Posco (PKX) added 2.4% to 57.60. It's still holding above its 50-day moving average and a 54.73 buy point.IBD'S TAKE: Steel stocks have been some of the strongest performers since Nov. 9. Leadership is broad in the group.

347,O,"U.S. stocks were mostly flat in afternoon trade Friday, as big-money investors apparently decided to skip out early for the three-day weekend.The Nasdaq added almost 0.1%, but the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average were flat. Volume in the stock market today was running sharply lower on both major exchanges. The market will be closed Monday in a nod to Christmas. Trade will resume Tuesday.In the IBD 50, a list of top-rated stocks in fundamentals and technicals, most stocks were up. Four stocks posted gains of 1% or more: savings and loan BofI Holding (BOFI), up 2%; chip designer Nvidia (NVDA), 1%; health savings account provider HealthEquity (HQY), 1%; and cloud-based communications and storage provider J2 Global (JCOM), 1%.Savings and loans and chip stocks are leading sectors in the current stock market. Meanwhile, HealthEquity is expected to benefit from a repeal of ObamaCare. HealthEquity surged 12% the day after the presidential election, en route to a 44% gain in the so-called Trump rally, before stepping back to a 31% gain.On the weekly chart, HealthEquity is consolidating. The stock is above its 50-day line and could form a flat base.Hospitals, an industry group benefiting from ObamaCare, lost as much as 16% after the election before trimming the loss to 7%. Under ObamaCare, hospitals are able to shift at least some of the costs of caring for nonpaying patients onto the government.Biotech stocks, a group that could suffer if President-elect Trump follows through on his threat to knock down drug prices, were the top-performing industry group Friday, up 2%. The worst performer of the day was stock in foreign banks.Incyte (INCY) popped 1% in slow turnover. The biotech is consolidating within a flat base.Blue chip stocks were not moving much Friday, and the day's losers in the Dow only narrowly outnumbered gainers.In the S&P 500, gold miner Newmont Mining (NEM) was one of the day's better performers. The stock rose 3% in soft trade. Newmont is almost 30% off its high.RELATED:4 Tech Earnings Leaders You Don't Want To MissStocks Buy More Time: What Are IBD Indicators Saying?New Home Sales Jump, Topping Analysts' Consensus Target

348,O,"When Western Digital (WDC) closed its $16 billion acquisition of SanDisk in May, the leading provider of disk drives greatly expanded in the business of flash-based chip-storage products widely used in mobile devices.Western Digital made the acquisition to address the dramatic growth in data creation and the evolution of data storage.SanDisk has long been among the leaders in flash-based chip storage, the kind used in smartphones and tablet computers. With SanDisk, Western Digital sees its total addressable market at $72 billion.Already the No. 1 provider of disk drives, just ahead of archrival Seagate Technology (STX), Western Digital now is also a formidable player in chip-based flash storage. Western Digital and Seagate for several years have been dealing with lower demand for disk drives as consumers shift from desktop PCs to smartphones and tablets.The move helped Western Digital's stock, which is up 17% in 2016 and trading well above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, key support lines. Western Digital stock fell a fraction to 70.17 in the stock market today.The data storage market is evolving to meet the growing demands of cloud computing, mobile computing, the Internet of Things and other forms of computing, Mike Cordano, Western Digital's president and chief operating officer, recently told IBD in a Q&A about the road ahead in 2017.IBD: With the SanDisk acquisition done, what kind of 2017 do you expect from Western Digital?Cordano: For one, we hope to reach our full stride as an integrated company — the new Western Digital, combining all the SanDisk assets. We're through the first big wave of this integration. We're in a position to deploy an integrated product roadmap across various markets that are changing dramatically.IBD'S TAKE: There are plenty of places on Investors.com to research and find top stocks, but when you're looking to get a broader idea on top tech stocks, IBD's Tech Leaders feature is worth reviewing. You can, for example, find out about four tech earnings leaders.What we see happening is an acceleration of new computing architectures. Some people call it a third platform. It's the advent of cloud mobility and other things like artificial intelligence and machine learning. For us it's really about continuing to provide the technology and storage-product building blocks. We've got a very clear focus on that across the breadth of the company. Having SanDisk and its nonvolatile memory, or flash, platform within our portfolio really allows us to play across the entire storage landscape.IBD: What do you mean by a third platform?Cordano: The third platform has various elements. One central theme is the buildout of cloud computing, both public and private. Another is mobility, which is becoming sort of a leading driver of the edge, or client. And then there are a number of other threads within that, like the Internet of Things, which is creating machine-generated data.Once you've created these big data repositories in the cloud, new methodologies allow you to derive value and insights from that data. Those are all attributes of this third platform. The previous architectural construct, the second platform, was really client-server technology. We're in the transition from second to third now.IBD: What opportunities does the third platform provide Western Digital?Cordano: Some examples are in the area of mobility and the Internet of Things. Prior to acquiring SanDisk, we had limited exposure to the storage elements of smartphones, or edge sensors in the case of IoT. And now we have exposure to all of those types of products.We're also well-aligned with the people innovating in those areas. So we have a very good view of what's happening, what the storage needs are and what the next-generation products are. We're now participating in those market segments that we were not in prior to the SanDisk acquisition.And if you look at the basic construct in the cloud data center, two storage building blocks are primarily contemplated. One is the enterprise hard drive — an optimized disk drive that is built for the data center, where you get a cost-per-gigabyte advantage. The other major building block is flash, or flash-based storage. So the coupling of those two are really the new building blocks of the cloud data center.One is optimized for cost per gigabyte, which is disk. The other is optimized for cost per I/O, which is a performance measurement — cost per input/output. Depending on the way that application is written, you're going to blend those two technologies in an optimal way to provide capability and performance.IBD: What's the future of disk drives now that chip storage is becoming more pervasive?Cordano: We recognized there was going to be a changing role for disk drives and that, given this transition to the third platform, the fundamental technology was going to change. The role of the hard drive will continue, but it's a changed role.In the data center we see the emergence of this capacity enterprise product line, which is where the growth is, relative to exabytes deployed. We really see the growth in 2020 and beyond to be largely in high-capacity enterprise drives.Historically, Western Digital was primarily in a PC-driven market. That segment of the market is changing as attributes of mobility are more important. The role of nonvolatile memory is playing a more significant role in the PC market. In the markets we serve we see a shifting, changing landscape, where flash is becoming more important in some categories. Disk drives are shrinking in those markets but, as far out as we are planning, we see a role for hard-drive technology, in particular in the data center.IBD: What has the rise of cloud computing meant for Western Digital?Cordano: Its provided multiple levels of opportunity. We've been working directly with large hyper-scale providers for years. That has given us insight into how the tech transitions were going to occur. That was very useful in making plans for products and forming our own strategy. It's been a growth driver. It's also creating a lot of interesting dynamics in the broad IT ecosystem, where things that were more traditionally on premise are moving to the cloud.IBD: How much data can we expect to see crammed into future flash chips?Cordano: What you see is quite interesting. If you look at the capacity growth-rate metrics, solid state is growing roughly at the same rate as disk. If you look at the rate of what we would call areal density, we see that growing in the neighborhood of 25% annualized. That will enable the right balance of cost and performance to support this burgeoning data growth that everyone wants to get access so. Certainly on both technology types the cost per gigabyte is dropping at roughly the same rate.RELATED:Western Digital Draws Praise At First Full-Scale Analyst Meeting In 4 YearsBox CEO Interviewed: Aiming To Change How Businesses Work

349,O,"The market may hate uncertainty, but it has reacted with unmistakable enthusiasm to the prospect of a political leader who is an unknown quantity. So have investors in exchange traded funds.Since the Nov. 8 election, major indexes have shot to record highs and investors have poured billions into ETFs. The rally has been fueled by optimism over President-elect Donald Trump's proposals of more government spending, less regulation of certain industries, and tax cuts.In recent interviews with IBD, two money pros expressed hope for the stock market going into the new year.Tempering this sentiment is their circumspect view of the Trump agenda, the earnings picture and the economic outlook.Philip Blancato of Ladenburg Thalmann discussed where he is looking to tap growth and where he is hunting for income as both hopefulness and wariness color his views. One of his top ETF ideas, VanEck Vectors Fallen Angel High Yield Bond (ANGL), outperformed in the past month and is among the ETF winners of 2016.Click Here For A List Of The Best-Performing ETFs Of 2016Brian Sterz of Miracle Mile Advisors identified some ETFs that could benefit most from the ""Trump bump"" in the markets.Here are the ETF investing pros in their own words:Philip Blancato is CEO and president of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management in New York City. The registered investment advisory firm has $2.2 billion in assets under management.We are fairly optimistic about U.S. equities going into 2017, but not without caution. There still remains uncertainty on what President-elect Donald Trump will do, but the broad direction is pointing to the positive side.We believe the S&P 500 will eke out returns between 5% to 7% as the U.S. economy continues to expand at a modest rate between 2% and 2.5% and profits expand modestly.Volatility will be heightened more than its current level as markets trade more actively on the president-elect's announcements and actions.We also believe the Fed will raise rates in a gradual manner with two hikes at most in 2017. Given the concern surrounding rising rates, I chose two fixed-income ETFs with compelling cases.Additionally, active-management and smart-beta ETF strategies can be used to take advantage of price dislocations in less price efficient asset classes.VanEck Vectors Fallen Angel High Yield Bond (ANGL) invests in below-investment-grade corporate bonds that were rated investment grade at the time of their issuance.Higher-yielding bonds should be less affected by rising rates than your standard corporate bonds, which have lower yields. When interest rates increase, bonds with lower yields are less attractive than bonds with higher yields and as a result they can experience a more significant sell-off. So, higher coupons actually help to cushion the impact of rising interest rates.Further, ANGL invests in ""fallen angels,"" which are higher-quality, high-yield bonds that are trading at a discounted value when purchased. So, the majority of the selling of these bonds is already done before they are purchased, which makes these bonds even less interest-rate sensitive.Between Nov. 8 and Dec. 12, when the 10-Year U.S. Treasury yield increased from 1.88% to 2.49%, ANGL outperformed the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index by 3.96%. Also, high-yield bonds outperformed corporate bonds in 2013 during the ""Taper Tantrum"" period, when rates were increasing.ANGL invests in bonds that have had historically higher average credit quality than the broad high-yield bond universe. The yield is attractive in this low-interest-rate environment at 5.23%. And the ETF's current 27% allocation to the energy sector could be beneficial given OPEC's agreement to cut oil production.ANGL is up 23.66% this year through Nov. 30.Fidelity Total Bond (FBND), an actively managed ETF, is based off Fidelity's Total Bond Fund (FTBFX), which has a long-term track record of strong risk-adjusted returns. The strategy invests across various sectors, maturities and credit qualities to achieve a diversified core bond position.FBND has an attractive yield of 2.96% and a duration of 5.32 years. The ETF has navigated volatile fixed-income markets, and I believe its actively managed approach can adapt to future rate hikes. Year to date through Nov. 30, it returned 6.09%, outperforming the Barclay's Aggregate Bond Index.(Editor's note: FBND trades on average less than 50,000 shares a day. Ladenburg Thalmann says that, as long-term investors, they can be patient when trading in and out of an ETF to ensure they execute trades at reasonable prices.)JPMorgan Diversified Return International Equity (JPIN) is passively managed to an FTSE index developed by JP Morgan Asset Management to provide exposure to developed international equities.JPIN uses a top-down risk-allocation framework that equally distributes portfolio risk across 40 regional sectors. It ranks holdings with a focus on value, size, momentum and low-volatility factors. The construction methodology entails monthly rebalancing, liquidity screens and turnover constraints.Active management has a better chance of success in less price efficient asset classes like international equities. So we are willing to take some active bets through the use of smart-beta strategies like JPIN.Brian Sterz is an investment advisor at Miracle Mile Advisors, an RIA firm based in Los Angeles; AUM: $ 720 million.Despite the strong investment returns following the Brexit decline and, more recently, the U.S. election, we believe that domestic stock markets will be volatile next year but ultimately positive.Given that the Fed and most economists predict only modest GDP growth, and the Fed is set to again raise interest rates, stock market returns will be based on forecasts of what effect any tax and fiscal policy legislation will be able to achieve in 2018 and beyond.While the rhetoric is known, the substance is not yet, and the market will move based on perceptions of what will ultimately be passed. We see the S&P 500 ending next year at 2400, and small-cap stocks outperforming large peers, but with a high probability of a correction during the year.Dispersion is likely to increase, meaning that investors will have to pick their sectors and markets much more carefully than during these previous ""Fed driven"" years.The surprise of next year may be that Europe, trading at low valuations and even lower investor sentiment, may outperform U.S. stocks. Given the positive intermediate market responses to both England and Italy's populist referendums, there may be precedent for such follow-through across the region.SPDR Oil & Gas Exploration & Production (XOP) holds 58 stocks in the energy sector. Following OPEC production halts, and potentially firmer oil and gas prices, domestic exploration and production (E&P) companies are set to ramp up production.Given the turmoil in the industry over the past year, and subsequent cost and debt rationalization, these firms are set to generate dramatically increased profits given increased demand and decreased regulation.The sector performed well in 2016, though it has trailed the S&P 500 on a two- and five-year basis, and appears set to rebound sharply.SPDR S&P Homebuilders (XHB) invests in homebuilders, home furnishers, home-improvement stores and the like. U.S. homebuilders are set to profit from an environment of encouraging housing data, limited supply of available housing stock, and increasing employment and wages.As the demand for new homes continues to outstrip supply, these firms are dramatically ramping up efforts to produce homes to sell. The sectors' revenues rose 20% in the first three quarters of 2016, and diversified builders are beginning to expand margins going into the new year.Despite this, stocks in the sector have not yet caught up to the fundamentals and may outperform going forward as they do.SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI) invests in stocks that have borne the brunt of campaign rhetoric for more than a year and now trade at their lowest valuations in more than two years.Historically, these have made for strong entry points for long-term investors.We like the prospects for the industry as it is filled with innovators creating solutions to a constantly evolving collection of medical concerns.One could view the sector as a collection of venture investments, and owning a broad basket of these potential future market leaders is the best way to own them.ETFs such as iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) or SPDR Biotech are great ways to get this exposure. They include many of the smaller-market-cap, early-stage names that may be tremendously volatile before eventual large gains.For those who are looking for stable health care exposure, an ETF such as Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) holds a broader range of biotechnology, pharmaceutical and medical-device stocks that, owned together, may offer a potentially smoother investor experience.RELATED:Which ETF Investment Strategies Are Right For You?

350,O,"Consolidation in the semiconductor industry is likely to continue next year, Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Rolland said Wednesday.He identified three publicly traded chip companies that are likely M&A targets in 2017: Marvell Technology Group (MRVL), Microsemi (MSCC) and Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM).""While semiconductor companies are likely late cycle, white-hot M&A activity cannot be ignored, as over 20% of all U.S. publicly traded semiconductor companies were acquired in each of the last two years,"" Rolland said in a research report. ""The big get bigger and the small get bought.""The chip industry consolidated by 25% in 2015 and 20% in 2016, he said.""While this pace is likely to slow in 2017 (we expect about 15%), it remains well above the historical average of about 5%,"" Rolland said.IBD'S TAKE: Microsemi is one of seven chip industry stocks on the IBD 50 list of top growth companies. Others include Nvidia and Macom Technology Solutions.His ""top takeouts"" are based on an analysis of earnings power after potential synergies from M&A. Rolland gives a 25% chance each to Marvell, Microsemi and Maxim being acquired in 2017.Shares of Microsemi closed 0.9% lower at 54.70 on the stock market today, and Marvell dipped 0.35% to 14.26, while Maxim eased 0.8% to 38.64. Microsemi touched a record high of 57.32 on Thursday, and Marvell hit a 19-month high of 15 on Nov. 21. Maxim is forming a flat base with a buy point of 42.47.Outside of M&A, he favors semiconductor stocks tied to the massive hyperscale and cloud computing buildouts, expected infrastructure and military spending acceleration under President Donald Trump, and ""a bona fide optical supercycle.""In the hyperscale market, he sees Cavium (CAVM), Nvidia (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Intel (INTC) and Broadcom (AVGO) as winners.In the infrastructure and defense market, he identified Microsemi, Maxim and ON Semiconductor (ON) as winners.In the optical networking market, he pointed to Broadcom, Intel and Microsemi as winners, along with Applied Micro Circuits (AMCC), which is being acquired by Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI).Of all those chip stocks he picked Broadcom, Microsemi and ON Semi as his ""top 3 ideas for 2017."" RELATED:Nvidia, 2 Other Chip Stocks Get Buy Ratings, Qualcomm Downgraded

352,O,"President-elect Donald J. Trump's improbable electoral victory has left the international community stunned.  With foreign policy elites around the world bracing for a geopolitical earthquake when it comes to the 45th President of the United States, the Iran file may very well undergo an extreme makeover, pivoting from quasi-detente to aggression.A Trump presidency has the potential to be a game changer in relations between Iran and the United States for three principle reasons: the emboldening of Iranian hardliners as a result of his election; the initiation of a tit-for-tat retaliatory dynamic between both countries; and the thwarting of the piecemeal normalization of U.S.-Iran bilateral diplomatic contacts.From the day the nuclear deal was inked, the Supreme Leader of Iran Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has been hedging his bets — blessing the nuclear agreement, while publicly complaining that the United States could not be trusted to fulfill its end of the bargain, akin to consuming a ""lethal poison.""With President-elect Trump's dubbing of the accord as a ""disaster"" that could lead to a ""nuclear holocaust"" and vow that his ""(n)umber-(o)ne priority"" would be to ""dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran,"" such rhetoric will likely play into the worst suspicions of conservatives in Tehran's corridors of power.  If a U.S. presidential administration was seen as abrogating an international commitment, Iran's firebrands would be given even more ammunition to direct at the pragmatic President Hassan Rouhani, who is up for reelection in the spring of 2017.We've seen this movie before during the administration of President George W. Bush, when the Iranian leadership allegedly proposed a ""grand bargain"" in 2003 that would include a broad dialogue with the United States on all issues, including support for terrorism.The Bush White House rejected the overture, suggesting that there were no guarantees that such a proposal had the support of various power centers in Iran.  Nonetheless, the repudiation of this feeler and especially, as some observers have noted, the administration shutting down a diplomatic channel on Afghanistan issues, convinced some players in Iran that the United States was not a reliable partner.This perception may have led, in part, to the rise of hardliner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to the Iranian presidency in 2005, and in 2016, feeds into the Supreme Leader's narrative of a deceitful America, right ahead of President Hassan Rouhani's reelection.A Trump White House will also likely increase the gamesmanship with Tehran's mullahcracy.  Reports indicate that the ""Never Trump"" GOP establishment is preparing to work with its new counterparts to ""squeeze"" Iran — namely through the reintroduction of the Iran Ballistic Missiles Sanctions Act, which would sanction entire sectors of the Iranian economy that are involved in the Islamic Republic's ballistic missiles development, and three related bills, one of which denies the Iranian government and banks access to U.S. dollars.That's on top of the proposed 10-year reauthorization of the Iran Sanctions Act (ISA).These legislative opening salvos may trigger similar reprisals in Tehran, namely the possibility of the improvement of Iran's ballistic missile capabilities, something the Secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council hinted at on Wednesday after the House of Representatives passed an extension of the ISA.When the U.S. Treasury Department unveiled new restrictions related to Iran's missile program in January, hardliner former presidential candidate Maj. Gen. Mohsen Rezaei wrote to President Rouhani saying, ""I am hoping that with your support, the range of Iran's missiles will exceed 5,000 kilometers (3,106 miles).""Similarly in 2013, when U.S. legislators proposed tightening sanctions should negotiations between the P5+1 and Iran breakdown over a final accord, Iranian parliamentarians retaliated and proposed an increase in uranium enrichment to 60% purity, from 20%, if the sanctions legislation was enacted.Lastly, let's not forget the power of personalities in international diplomacy — especially the close working relationship forged between Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry.  The State Department likes to point to the resolution of the episode when Iran seized ten U.S. Navy sailors in the Persian Gulf in January as resulting from both men's personal chemistry—often emailing and calling each other directly.That's not to mention the ongoing talks between Iran's Central Bank Governor and U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew; dialogue between U.S. Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz and the head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization; and strong ties between other political appointees at the deputy level, like Iran nuclear deal czar Stephen Mull and Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi.Such channels were unheard before the Obama administration, and there's no guarantee — especially given Trump's rhetoric — that there will be a ""John and Javad""-like dynamic with Trump's Cabinet.In the end, Trump's victory may serve to fundamentally change the trajectory in relations between Iran and the United States — from gradual normalization to rapid destabilization.  While some may argue that the President-elect's fondness for Vladimir Putin — Russia has formed an axis with Iran in Syria — may prevent the situation from going from bad to worse, campaign pledges to scrap the nuclear deal; Republican control over Congress and the Executive Branch; and the changing of the diplomatic guard may prove even more potent.RELATED:Victor Davis Hanson: Thanks To Obama, Next President Will Be UnboundObama Funded Terrorism With His $1.7 Bil Ransom To Iran

353,O,"Farm-equipment maker Deere & Co. (DE) reported fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday that were much better than expected, helped by ongoing cost control efforts.Estimates: EPS down 63% to 40 cents, with revenue slipping 9.4% to $5.38 billion.Results: EPS fell 17% to 90 cents; equipment sales fell 5% to $5.65 billion.Outlook: Deere sees equipment sales falling 4% in fiscal Q1 and just 1% in fiscal 2017.Stock: Shares soared 11% to 102.17 in the stock market today, hitting an all-time high The stock is now greatly extended from breakout earlier this month from a cup base with an 88.73 buy point.AGCO (AGCO), which also makes farming equipment, rose 3.4%. Lindsay (LNN), a maker of irrigation systems, climbed 2%. Retailer Tractor Supply (TSCO) advanced 0.9%.Heavy construction and mining equipment maker Caterpillar (CAT), which does have some market overlap with Deere, rose 2.7% to its best levels since December 2014.Falling crop prices after massive harvests have reduced demand on farms for Deere's equipment. The company has expanded into Brazil, but the recession there and political upheaval combined with the stronger dollar have posed challenges to results. Still, the company's EPS in the third quarter far surpassed views.IBD'S TAKE: Goldman Sachs recently predicted Deere, Caterpillar, Cummins and Terex should see improved margins as key machinery end markets bottom out and manufacturing restructures. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB)  remains a shareholder in Deere but in August the holding company disclosed the sale of 1.32 million shares of Deere, a nearly 6% cut, bringing its stake down to 21.96 million shares.RELATED:Caterpillar Stock Soars On Trump Win On Hope For Coal; GE, Boeing UpDeere Crushes Profit Views On 'Great Job Cutting Costs'

354,O,"U.S. oil rig counts soared by 21 this week according to Baker Hughes (BHI) data out Friday, the largest weekly increase since the recovery started six months ago.Oil rigs hit 498 this week and are now just down 26 vs. a year ago. Oil rigs in Texas's prolific Permian basin jumped by 11 to 246. Six rigs were added to Colorado's DJ Niobrara basin and three rigs were added in the Eagle Ford and one in the Williston basin.The U.S. oil rig count has climbed in 25 of the last 28 weeks, with drillers adding a total of 182 oil rigs in that time. Total U.S. rigs were up by 27 to 624.U.S. crude rose 1.3% to settle at $51.50 a barrel, down 0.4% for the week.

Permian-focused Diamondback Energy (FANG) fell 1.1%. Chevron (CVX) edged up 0.6% and Exxon Mobil (XOM) added 0.8%.IBD'S TAKE: Rig counts are on the rise and U.S. shale producers were the big winners of OPEC's decision to cut production, but don't expect shale producers to ramp up production right away. The report comes ahead of a meeting between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC officials Saturday in Vienna.

356,O,"Air conditioning and heating equipment makers might not get the flashy media coverage that do Apple (AAPL), Alibaba (BABA), Netflix (NFLX), or other large-cap tech and internet names. Yet on Tuesday, these stocks quietly showed another day of strength ahead of the soon-to-start Donald Trump presidential era.IBD's Building-Air Conditioning & Heating Products industry group led the market's upside Tuesday, rising nearly 1.5%. The group itself boasts a gain of more than 32% year to date on a price-weighted basis. Watsco (WSO)was the sole name in the eight-stock group to post new highs Tuesday, rising 1% and getting as high as 153.78. Last month the stock broke out past a 147.08 buy point in a 13-week double-bottom base.The breakout picked up steam on Nov. 30 as shares rallied 1.9% and volume bulged 149% above its 50-day average. From the breakout price of 147.08, the 5% chase zone in the Miami-based distributor of A/C products for the replacement and homebuilding markets extends up to 154.43.While Watsco's average daily share volume is on the light side at 199,000 shares, the high share price makes liquidity less of an issue. Average daily dollar volume is more than $30 million.On Oct. 25, Watsco plunged 7.7% in the heaviest turnover since February following Q3 results that saw earnings rise 7% to $1.76 a share on a 5% lift in sales. Profit missed the Wall Street consensus view by 8%. However, Watsco dusted itself off the next session, rising back above its 200-day moving average and proceeding to form the right side of the double-bottom pattern.The stock's RS line, which compares day-to-day performance with the S&P 500 and is painted blue in IBD's stock charts, has risen sharply over the past week, a positive sign.On the fundamentals side, Watsco posted a solid 18.8% return on equity in 2015, meeting the CAN SLIM requirement of 17% or higher. Wall Street sees fiscal year 2016 profit up 6% and 2017 profit accelerating to an 11% gain. Other stocks worth watching closely in the same group:A.O. Smith (AOS), which does big business with its water heaters in China and South Asia. The stock is forming a new cup base with a 51.59 entry. IBD Stock Checkup shows the firm having the second best Composite Rating of 84, next to AAON (AAON) with a 91. The latter is within buy range following a breakout past a 30.90 flat-base entry. AAON last month announced an 18% hike in its semiannual cash payout. The annual yield is now 0.8%.Lennox International (LII) (65 Composite), whose sales derive mostly from the U.S. The Richardson, Texas, firm, fended off a deep sell-off in October and found buying support at the 200-day line in early November. Now it's trying to build the right side of a potential new cup. Notice how Lennox formed a narrow flat-base pattern from September to early October, barely meeting the minimum time requirement of five weeks, or 25 trading sessions. However, the stock did not break out to new highs.RELATED:The Case For A Trump Era Secular Bull Market

357,O,"Oil closed little changed Wednesday even affter Iraq said it would participate in OPEC's production cuts, and the Energy Department reported a drop in U.S. crude stockpiles.Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi said Baghdad will ""shoulder responsibility"" for some of the production cuts planned by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, the AP reported.""What we lose in lowering production we will gain in oil revenues,"" he said. ""Our priority is to raise the price of a barrel of crude.""U.S. crude rebounded from session lows for modest gains on that news, but ultimately closed down 7 cents to $47.96 a barrel.On Tuesday, an OPEC panel concluded an initial round of talks ""successfully"" with a recommendation that each country cut 4% to 4.5% of production with exemptions for Nigeria and Libya.But Iraq argued it was a special case because it is fighting the Islamic State, while Iran tries to boost production to presanction levels. So OPEC officials deferred a decision to exempt Iran and Iraq to the meeting on Nov. 30. Two days earlier, OPEC was set to meet with Russia and other non-cartel members about broader production curbs.Hammering out a country-specific agreement will be challenging, and the temptation for members to exceed their quotas will be high.Exxon Mobil (XOM) shares rose 0.3% to 86.92 on the stock market today.

359,O,"Russia's oil minister said Wednesday that he saw ""big chances"" of OPEC agreeing on an output deal later this month, sending oil futures higher, just minutes after the Energy Department reported an increase in U.S. crude stockpiles.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will hold its official meeting Nov. 30 in Vienna, where the cartel is supposed to finalize terms on how it will cut production. Crude prices have been hit lately on indications that the deal could collapse, but top energy officials will meet on the sidelines of the Gas Exporting Countries Forum later this week to discuss the deal.Meanwhile, the Energy Information Administration reported a 5.3-million-barrel build in U.S. crude stockpiles. Analysts were only expecting a 1.5-million-barrel increase, and late Tuesday the American Petroleum Institute reported a 3.65-million-barrel increase.Domestic production dipped 0.1% to 8.681 million barrels per day.U.S. crude climbed on the Russia news before reversing to close down 0.5% to $45.57 per barrel.Shares of U.S. shale bellwether Continental Resources (CLR) climbed 0.8% to close at 49.25 on the stock market today.

That's up from the $1.5 billion it plans to spend this year.Noble sees total 2017 production volumes averaging between 400,000 barrels per day to 410,000 barrels per day vs. the 427,000 barrels averaged in the third-quarter.Noble shares fell 2.3% to 36.61.RELATED: Oil Rallies By Most In Seven Months As OPEC Tries To Save Output DealIEA Sees Oil Demand Flat In 2017 While Output Grows; Conoco Cuts Capex

360,O,"The International Energy Agency warned of ""greater oil price volatility"" in a report out Wednesday but despite the Paris climate agreement, oil demand won't peak until 2040.""We are entering a period of greater oil price volatility,"" said Fatih Birol, the IEA's executive director in a release. ""If oil prices rise in the short term, then shale producers can react quite quickly to put more oil on the market, producing a seesaw movement. And if we continue to see subdued investments in new conventional oil projects, this could have profound consequences in the longer term.""Earlier this month oil major BP (BP) lowered its capital expenditure outlook for the year and was cautious on 2017, while Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) downgraded its spending outlook for next year.U.S. oil rig counts rose last week but EOG Resources (EOG) said the U.S. shale industry needs oil prices of $60 a barrel to ramp up production significantly.EOG shares ticked up 0.7% to close at 95.22 on the stock market today. BP shares fell 0.9% to 33.30. Royal Dutch Shell was down 1.3% to 49.27. Exxon Mobil (XOM) shares were off 1.2% to 85.75. Chevron (CVX) shares reversed to gain 0.4% to 108.35. Shale bellwether Continental Resources (CLR) tacked on 0.8% to 49.25.Brent crude futures were off 0.6% to $46.66 per barrel. U.S. crude fell 0.9% to $45.39 after hitting the highest level in two weeks on Tuesday.The IEA offered several scenarios for the future of the energy sector in its annual World Energy Outlook depending on how closely countries followed the Paris accord.In its central scenario with countries trying to meet requirements from the Paris deal, the IEA sees oil demand hitting 103.5 million barrels per day by 2040 from 92.5 million barrels per day last year. India will lead the demand growth while China will topple the U.S. for highest demand from a single country.Global oil production is seen rising to 100.5 million barrels per day by 2040 from 92.5 million barrels in 2015.Under this scenario $80 oil is needed to balance supply and demand in 2020, the same estimate the IEA had in its 2015 report.Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is still expected to control output to support oil prices but it sees production from the cartel declining until it is 10% lower than its current output of 33.8 million barrels per day in 2040.If President-elect Donald Trump keeps his promise to ""cancel"" the Paris deal and other countries don't comply to the accord, the IEA sees oil demand hitting 117 million barrels per day by 2040, with global supply rising to 113.6 million barrels per day by 2040.Failure to commit to the Paris deal still won't end coal's long decline, the IEA says. It doesn't see demand for coal rising in the next 25 years as demand from China slows. The IEA sees electricity generated from coal falling 21% in 2040 from 2014 levels if the Paris deal isn't kept vs. 41% if the deal is implemented.IBD'S TAKE: During the campaign Trump promised to bring back coal, but economists say it is unlikely that there is anything a U.S. president could do to help return coal to peak levels. Natural gas would be a big winner if the Paris deal is scrapped, with electricity generated from the commodity up 56% vs. 27% if the deal isn't kept.""We see clear winners for the next 25 years — natural gas but especially wind and solar — replacing the champion of the previous 25 years, coal,"" the IEA's Birol went on to say. ""But there is no single story about the future of global energy: in practice, government policies will determine where we go from here.""RELATED: Oil Rallies By Most In Seven Months As OPEC Tries To Save Output Deal

364,O,"From its modest beginnings in a Long Island, N.Y., storefront, Ina Garten has built Barefoot Contessa into a blockbuster cooking and lifestyle brand. Food Network's ""Barefoot Contessa"" recently debuted its 24th season and features her cooking for her friends and her husband Jeffrey Garten, globalization expert and dean emeritus of the Yale School of Management. Her 10th cookbook, ""Cooking for Jeffrey,"" was released in October and has already spent weeks atop the New York Times Best Seller list.Garten's catchphrase — ""Wasn't that easy?"" — is a reminder to home cooks not to complicate matters. Her recipes have short lists of ingredients that help the main item take center stage. ""I want the intrinsic flavor of the chicken to come out through seasoning, marinating, roasting — whatever makes the chicken taste exactly how it wants to be,"" she writes in 2008's ""Barefoot Contessa Back to Basics.""As a brand, Barefoot Contessa balances aspiration and accessibility. While a fraction of the show's audience may be able to afford the table in her East Hampton home, she makes it clear that the people around the table are what's important, and the food is a means to enjoying them more.Garten was born Ina Rosenberg in Brooklyn, N.Y., in 1948 to Charles, a surgeon, and Florence, a reluctant housewife whose thwarted intellectual interests may be why she kept young Ina out of the kitchen. ""It's my job to cook. Your job is to study,"" she'd say.At 15, Ina met Jeffrey Garten, a Dartmouth classmate of her older brother. They married in 1968, while Ina was studying economics at Syracuse University. The young couple took a trip to France where Ina had her culinary awakening. She began teaching herself to cook by working through Julia Child's ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking.""Cooking was only a hobby, though, as Garten heeded her mother's advice to study. The couple moved to Washington, D.C., where Jeffrey worked at the State Department. Garten earned an MBA at George Washington University and eventually became an analyst with the Office of Management and Budget, working on nuclear energy policy.Nearing 30, Garten grew disillusioned with her government career. Jeffrey encouraged her to commit to something she loved. She spotted an ad for a specialty food shop on Long Island named The Barefoot Contessa, after the 1954 Ava Gardner movie. Using money she'd earned flipping two D.C. row houses, Garten made a low offer, hoping to stall the sellers while she debated the career change. It didn't work. Days later she was the owner of The Barefoot Contessa in the beachside hamlet of Westhampton.Initially, Garten was in over her head. But her on-camera ease belies a steely work ethic. She put in 20-hour days that often ended with her getting up to test a recipe idea that she'd had as she was drifting off to sleep.Garten's roast chicken and coconut cupcakes were the ideal upscale comfort foods to soothe the area's demanding clientele. Her MBA came in handy as the shop rose above the challenges that often befell Hamptons food businesses, such as adjusting staff to the seasonal population and managing a catering department. The store counted Steven Spielberg and Martha Stewart among its loyal patrons.By the 1990s, she had moved the store to a larger space in East Hampton and supervised a hundred employees.In 1996, after nearly 20 years running the store, Garten knew it was time for a change. ""A friend told me that Type-A people (I think she was talking about me!) think they can figure out what to do next while they're doing something, but it never happens. She suggested that I stop working and spend the next year figuring it out,"" wrote Garten in Katie Couric's ""The Best Advice I Ever Got."" She sold the store to two employees and embraced her year of ""doing nothing.""After months of reading magazines and getting manicures, she'd had enough. She wrote a proposal for a cookbook, thinking it would keep her busy while she figured out her next step. But when publisher Clarkson Potter snapped it up, the book turned out to be her next step.Garten invested $200,000 of her own money on the book's production and publicity. The gamble paid off. Filled with lush photographs and recipes of the store's greatest hits, 1999's ""The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook"" quickly sold its first run of 15,000 copies and went on to sell over 100,000 in its first year.Of all her professional incarnations, cookbook author is her favorite, her ""primary delight.""  Both her debut and its follow-up ""The Barefoot Contessa's Parties!"" were nominated for James Beard Awards. She's since released eight more titles, with over 10 million copies in print.""Her smartest decision was to do nothing until she got a new idea. She stopped everything until a new idea found her,"" Allen Salkin, author of ""From Scratch: The Uncensored History of the Food Network,"" told IBD.The books are as comforting as the foods they produce. ""Her books do a great job of addressing the core concerns of home cooks ... (the recipes) emphasize easy preparation — without being boring — and the social aspect of eating,"" T. Susan Chang, cookbook critic and host of The Level Teaspoon podcast, told IBD. ""They have a strong brand presence — the look, the recipes, they're very consistent ... as with any brand, you're successful to the extent that you're consistent.""In 2000, Martha Stewart Living gave Garten a magazine column and asked her to shoot a show for the Food Network. According to Salkin's ""From Scratch,"" the pilot episode, a standard instructional cooking show with Garten preparing dishes in real time, was a failure. Garten appeared uncomfortable, her usual joie de vivre absent in her performance.Network executive Eileen Opatut tried again, enlisting producer Rachel Purnell, who'd had a success with the Nigella Lawson's cinematic ""Nigella Bites."" Garten's new show was a day-in-the-life of its star as she entertained in her East Hampton home. Its episodes would be unified by moments with Jeffrey, who traveled home on the weekends from Connecticut, where he served as the dean of the Yale School of Management.""Barefoot Contessa"" debuted in 2002 and was a quick hit with critics and viewers. It has earned multiple Daytime Emmy Award nominations, and won for Outstanding Culinary Host in 2009 and 2010, and Outstanding Culinary Program in 2015.Throughout the 2000s, Garten penned columns in O magazine and House Beautiful. In 2010 her recipes were featured on Google's Thanksgiving home page, and in 2012 she launched a Facebook blog that attracted 100,000 followers within three weeks.Garten films ""Barefoot Contessa"" only a few weeks each year in order have more time with family and friends. The investment in her personal life might be why her work life resonates with her audience. ""I think the key to why she is the most popular Food Network star is because she lives her authentic brand,"" said Salkin.The Gartens never had children, and the show features a diverse cast of friends, family and acquaintances, including celebrities such as Michelle Obama, Jennifer Garner and Neil Patrick Harris. Garten has given the world hundreds of scenes of loving gatherings of nontraditional families and families of friends. She writes in ""Barefoot Contessa Family Style"" (2002) that family is ""about people who are bound together by love and a sense of being responsible for one another.""With Garten's emphasis on simplicity and closeness, it's no wonder that she says Thanksgiving is her favorite holiday.What advice might she have for Thursday's harried home cooks? Remembering a memorable Thanksgiving in ""Cooking for Jeffrey,"" she reminds us not to get too hung up on the stuffing. ""It's the connections that we have with people that will nourish our souls ... entertaining isn't just about making dinner parties. It's about celebrating those connections, and I think that's what makes life worth living.""Ina Garten went from burned-out government analyst to best-selling author and Food Network star.Overcame: A career dead end by taking time to rest and then diving head-on into the next chapter.Lesson: Find your ""primary delight"" and learn how to leverage your brand on different platforms.Quote: ""You can't figure out what you want to do from the sidelines. You need to jump into the pond and splash around to see what the water feels like. You might like that pond or it might lead to another pond, but you need to figure it out in the pond.""RELATED: Celebrity Chef Paul Prudhomme Caught Fire With Cajun-Creole CookingWolfgang Puck, Food Network Feeding Mobile AppetiteJulia Child Set The Course For The Foodie Craze

365,O,"OPEC will accept natural declines from non-OPEC members to get a production-lowering deal to pass, according to Bloomberg sources Wednesday, while U.S. stockpiles fell. That pushed U.S. crude prices back below $50 a barrel.That means nonmembers may not be required to actively reduce output, according to the report, potentially easing the path to securing an agreement.Last month, OPEC agreed to cut 1.2 million barrels a day from its production as long as non-OPEC producers cut 600,000 barrels per day, with Russia shouldering half of that. OPEC and nonmembers will meet Saturday to finalize details of the agreement.Russia was already expected to make a seasonal cut in output after pumping out 11.21 million barrels per day last month, a post-Soviet Union high.""I think that Saudi Arabia has been planning to cut production unilaterally for organic reasons ... Russia produces less for technical reasons,"" said Omar Al-Ubaydli, an affiliated senior research fellow at George Mason University's Mercatus Center. ""It's harder to extract oil in deep Siberian winter.""But OPEC still expects Russia to intentionally cut 300,000 barrels per day, according to Bloomberg sources. So far only Russia and Oman have agreed to cut from actual production.Russia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Oman and Mexico said they would be at the meeting Saturday and Bolivia, Brunei, Colombia, Republic of Congo, Egypt, Trinidad & Tobago, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan were invited.U.S. crude futures closed down 2.3% to $49.77 a barrel, settling below $50 for the first time in a week. Prices were not able to get a lift from a larger-than-expected U.S. stockpile drawdown. Oil prices fell from 16-month highs on Tuesday after OPEC and Russian production hit new highs in November.Exxon Mobil (XOM) shares rose 0.6% to 88.07 on the stock market today. Chevron (CVX) was up 1.5%. BP (BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) climbed 0.9%.Shale bellwether Continental Resources (CLR) slid 2%. EOG Resources (EOG) dipped 0.4%. Diamondback Energy (FANG) fell 0.85%.IBD'S TAKE: U.S. shale producers were the big winners of OPEC's decision to cut production. But shale firms won't be in a rush to start drilling.Meanwhile, U.S. crude production was roughly flat at 8.697 million barrels per day from 8.699 in the week prior, according to the Energy Information Administration, which earlier raised its U.S. production outlook to 8.9 million barrels in 2016 and 8.8 million in 2017, vs. the previous view for 8.8 million in 2016 and 8.7 million in 2017.It also said crude stockpiles fell by 2.4 million barrels last week. The American Petroleum Institute's weekly survey showed a decline of 2.2 million barrels. A Reuters poll was expecting a decrease of 1 million barrels.On Tuesday, the EIA said it now sees West Texas Intermediate averaging $50.66 a barrel next year, up 1.5% from its prior forecast, and expects Brent to average $51.66 in 2017, also up 1.5% vs. its November view.RELATED: Dakota Access Pipeline Easement Denied, But Trump Will Review RulingOil Caps 12% Weekly Gain, But U.S. Rig Count Highest Since January

366,O,"OPEC finalized a deal Wednesday to cut production by 1.2 million barrels a day starting in January, its first reduction since 2008, but the agreement is contingent on non-OPEC members cutting 600,000 barrels per day.Russia said it will cut by up to 300,000 barrels per day in the first half of 2017, though Moscow is pumping out a post-Soviet Union record of 11.2 million barrels a day. Energy Minister Alexander Novak cautioned that Russia will ""gradually"" reduce due to technical issues. OPEC will meet with nonmembers to hammer out the details on Dec. 9.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries set a ceiling of 32.5 million barrels per day, down from 33.6 million barrels a day in October. Saudi Arabia took the biggest cut, agreeing to lower output by 486,000 barrels but the cartel hasn't yet released figures on other members. Iran and Iraq previously have resisted calls to reduce.Kuwait's oil minister said cuts include Iraq reducing output by about 4.4% to 4.35 million barrels a day, according to Reuters. Earlier this month, an OPEC panel recommended a 4%-4.5% cut with exemptions for Nigeria and Libya.The production deal will last six months with a committee comprised of Kuwait, Venezuela and Algeria monitoring compliance within OPEC, which will review the decision at its next meeting on May 25 to determine if the cuts will last another six months.So-called secondary oil data, which come from sources like media reports and the International Energy Agency, will be used in determining production levels. Iraq had argued against using secondary sources, which tend to show lower levels and would result in a steeper cut vs. calculating cuts using Iraqi data.Indonesia's membership in OPEC was frozen as the island country is now a net importer of crude but Jakarta's production will still be counted toward OPEC's ceiling.U.S. crude soared 9,3% to settle at $49.44 a barrel. Brent spiked 8.8% to $50.47 per barrel.Exxon Mobil (XOM) shares rose 1.6% to close at 87.30 on stock market today. Chevron (CVX) was up 2% to 111.56. BP (BP) gapped up 4.5% to 35.01. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) surged 4.2% to 51.10.IBD'S TAKE: With OPEC agreeing to cut output, that's good news for U.S. shale production and earnings. Shale stocks are soaring, see which shale plays are now buys.Earlier, Iraqi Oil Minister Jabbar al-Luaibi said he hopes the accord will push prices to over $55 per barrel.Such a level would provide U.S. shale companies with more revenue but spur them to produce more, eventually adding more supply to global markets and weighing on oil prices again.Shale bellwether Continental Resources (CLR) shot up 22.9% to 58.01. EOG Resources (EOG) popped 10.9% to 102.52. Diamondback Energy (FANG) jumped 13.1% to 107.85.But Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group, said in his morning energy report that shale producers won't be able to replace OPEC's production ""anytime soon.""""(T)hey are struggling to keep oil production where it is,"" he wrote. ""Most drillers are not drilling for profits but to protect leases or keep cash flow to pay off loans, but does not signal a major ramp up in production.""Flynn also said OPEC was feeling pressure to reach a deal as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office.""The cartel that has a lot more to lose other than money if this deal fails,"" he wrote. ""Not only will they lose credibility this is their last chance to act ahead of a Trump presidency that has vowed to retaliate against oil producers that don't have our best interest at heart.""But OPEC President Mohammed bin Saleh al-Sada said the group reached its deal independent of the U.S. election.""We are considering the market conditions of supply and demand and the stock overhang but we don't … to be honest, speculate fully on what will be policy of different countries including the United States,"" he told reporters Wednesday.RELATED:U.S. Crude Production Hits Highest Level In Nearly 6 Months
"
367,O,"Two years after OPEC sank oil markets by refusing to trim production in the face of rising U.S. output, prices remain low and the latest attempt to prop them up appears doomed before it even had a chance to kick in.In September, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to trim production to 32.5 million-33 million barrels per day, down from 33.64 million barrels per day in October, to help rebalance oil markets. On Wednesday, it will try to finalize details on how much certain members must cut and obtain pledges from key nonmembers to cooperate. But even Saudi Arabia is signaling that there may be no deal.Failure to reach credible terms would send oil prices lower, extending the slump. But even a serious agreement that goes beyond any face-saving attempt to maintain a unified facade is no guarantee participants will actually stick to their quotas. It also would lift prices and encourage already-resurgent U.S. shale companies to pump more oil, adding to global supplies and bringing prices back down.Fresh signs that a deal remains far off sent prices lower Friday. U.S. crude futures fell 4% to $46.06 a barrel, but still ended the week 0.8% ahead. Brent futures fell 3.6% to $47.24 a barrel Friday.Exxon Mobil (XOM) closed up 0.2% on the stock market Friday. Chevron (CVX) shares were flat. BP (BP) dipped 0.4%. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) closed off 0.3%.IBD'S TAKE: The OPEC output cut would last for at least six months but possibly up to a year, according to reports. Even a deal as short as that would have some benefits for oil markets, analysts say.
"
368,O,"OPEC members are as fractured as ever, even as the cartel struggles to deal with non-OPEC producers.Saudi Arabia is pushing to set OPEC's collective production ceiling at the low end of the agreed-upon range to 32.5 million barrels, representing a 3.4% drop vs. October. For individual members, however, an OPEC panel recommended a 4%-4.5% cut with exemptions for Nigeria and Libya.Iran has argued for an exemption too, saying it should be allowed to boost production to pre-sanction levels following the nuclear agreement between Tehran and the West.Iraq also has said it would be unfair for it to make reductions while it's trying to generate revenue to wage war against the Islamic State, though Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi recently said Baghdad will ""shoulder responsibility"" for some of the cuts planned by OPEC. Even then, disagreements over the data sets used to calculate cuts are sticking points.Now Riyadh appears to be wavering as it backed out of a preliminary meeting set for Monday, when OPEC and non-OPEC producers like Russia, Azerbaijan and Mexico had planned to attend. It's not clear who, if anyone, would still show up. But the absence of OPEC's de facto leader at Monday's gathering has lowered expectations considerably for Wednesday's meeting.Saudi Arabia signaled for the first time on Sunday that there may be no OPEC output cut.""We expect demand to recover in 2017, then prices will stabilize, and this will happen without an intervention from OPEC,"" Saudi oil minister Khalid Al-Falih said, according to the Saudi newspaper Asharq al-Awsat. ""We don't have a single path which is to cut production at the OPEC meeting, we can also depend on recovery in consumption, especially from the U.S.""Meanwhile, Russia remains a big hurdle as it pumps out 11.2 million barrels of oil a day, a post-Soviet Union record, and it will likely only offer to freeze rather than cut production. Energy Minister Alexander Novak said Thursday that a freeze would be ""quite a difficult and harsh situation for us as our plans envisioned an output growth next year,"" according to Bloomberg.And in the U.S., shale producers like Continental Resources (CLR), EOG Resources (EOG) and Diamondback Energy (FANG) are becoming the new swing producers and could offset any diminished supply from OPEC.""If oil prices rise in the short term, then shale producers can react quite quickly to put more oil on the market, producing a seesaw movement,"" Fatih Birol, the International Energy Agency's executive director, said in a report out earlier this month.RELATED: Oil Dips Even After Iraq Vows To Join OPEC Cut, U.S. Stockpiles Fall

Revenue is expected to rise nearly 24% to $2.12 billion.""We think Salesforce should be able to comfortably beat a low bar,"" Ross Macmillan, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a research report.Alex Zukin, a Piper Jaffray analyst, has an overweight rating on Salesforce.com stock.""Checks suggest a rebound quarter with multiple large deals across geographies and particular success in the financial services vertical,"" he said in a report.IBD'S TAKE: The Computer-Software Enterprise group now ranks No. 36, down from No. 3 eight weeks ago, out of 197 industry groups, so exploring other options may be a good idea. Companies with superior earnings and revenue growth are featured at IBD Sector Leaders, which now includes such companies as Western Alliance Bancorp., Gigamon and Inphi.John DiFucci, an analyst at Jefferies, is cautious.""Salesforce.com will likely exceed low estimates, but it's unclear what's needed to send the stock higher,"" he said in a report.San Francisco-based Salesforce.com's stock climbed 1.7% o 74.02 in the stock market today. The stock is trading just above its 50-day moving average and just below its 200-day line.In Q2 ended July 31, Salesforce.com beat on EPS and sales, but billings missed expectations. Company guidance implied that Q3 billings growth might tick down, analysts say.Keith Weiss, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, says better billings guidance for fiscal Q4 would boost the stock. ""An acceleration back to 20%-plus billings growth in Q4 should be a strong positive catalyst for shares,"" Weiss said in a report.In the January quarter, analysts project EPS ex items of 25 cents and $2.24 billion in revenue.""As we continue to do our research in the ecosystem, we're more confident that the weakness in Q2 was a short-term issue and that the company is rebounding strongly here in Q3 and is set up well for the fourth quarter,"" Marshall Senk, an analyst at Rosenblatt Securities, said in a report.RELATED:ServiceNow: A Buy Point Poised Just Below Its December HighSalesforce.com M&A Scorecard Raises Questions On Growth, TargetsSalesforce.com Officially Rules Out Twitter Bid

370,O,"U.S. crude closed down 2.8% to $43.41 a barrel on Friday as OPEC reported record output and U.S. rigs in operation rose yet again. Crude fell 1.5% for the week, the third straight weekly slide.U.S. oil rigs rose by two on increased drilling in Texas' Eagle Ford play, according to Baker Hughes (BHI) data out Friday.Domestic oil rigs rose by two to 452 as the Eagle Ford added three more rigs bringing its total to 33 rigs. The number of oil rigs in the Williston Basin in the Dakotas fell by two to 35 rigs. Rig counts were flat in Colorado's DJ Niobrara play and Texas' Permian.The slight uptick in rig counts comes after rig counts rose by nine to 450 in the week ended Nov. 4. Rigs have now risen in the past 21 out of the last 23 weeks.Total U.S. rigs were down by one to 568.For the past year U.S. production has failed to stay consistently above $50 as the prospect of new drilling and more production on higher prices push U.S. oil prices slower.Shale exploration and production companies were down on Friday after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said it ramped up oil production to a record high in October. Continental Resources (CLR) plunged 4% to close at 45.40 in the stock market today. EOG Resources (EOG) lost 1.3% to 91.41. Diamondback Energy (FANG) fell 1.9% to 95.49.Oil majors were also down on the OPEC production drag to oil prices. Exxon Mobil (XOM) dropped 1.6%. Chevron (CVX) fell 1.1%.IBD'S TAKE: Donald Trump's victory initially rocked oil markets, but the conservative is expected to be bullish for U.S. shale E&P companies as he removes restrictions on fracking. RELATED: Analysts Are Bullish On Fracking Supplier Antero MidstreamOPEC Production Hits High, Adding To Doubts On Output Cut

371,O,"The International Energy Agency warned in a report Thursday that sluggish economic growth will continue to weigh on demand for oil, and ConocoPhillips (COP) cut its capital spending for next year.The IEA sees demand growth at 1.2 million barrels per day in 2017, the same increase as it forecasts for this year, after climbing by 1.8 million bpd in 2015.""There is currently little evidence to suggest that economic activity is sufficiently robust to deliver higher oil demand growth, and any stimulus that might have been provided at the end of 2015 and in the early part of 2016 when crude oil prices fell below $30 a barrel is now in the past,"" the energy watchdog said.Brent futures closed down 1.1% to $45.84 per barrel. U.S. crude fell 1.4% to $44.83.Exxon Mobil (XOM) finished up 0.9% on the stock market today. Chevron (CVX) rose 0.1% and BP (BP) 0.3%. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) climbed 0.5%. Continental Resources (CLR) added 0.2, but EOG Resources (EOG) lost 0.9%.IBD'S TAKE: Oil prices could fall before rising. Goldman Sachs warned that oil could plummet to near $40 per barrel if OPEC can't implement its production cut.While demand looks to stay weak, oil producers are pumping out more. The IEA said global supply was up by 800,000 per day in October, hitting 97.8 million barrels per day on record OPEC production and increased output from Russia, Kazakhstan and Brazil.Non-OPEC production is expected to grow by 500,000 barrels per day in 2017 vs. a drop of 900,000 barrels per day this year.The supply outlook will worsen if OPEC fails to implement a production cut its biannual meeting in Vienna on Nov. 30. IEA OPEC's production last month hit 33.83 million barrels a day, well above the target of 32.5 million-33 million agreed upon this summer.""If no agreement is reached and some individual members continue to expand their production then the market will remain in surplus throughout the year, with little prospect of oil prices rising significantly higher,"" the IEA warned. ""Indeed, if the supply surplus persists in 2017 there must be some risk of prices falling back.""On Tuesday, OPEC said that oil demand could peak by 2029 if the Paris climate agreement is fully executed. But in May now President-Elect Donald Trump said he would ""cancel"" the deal, putting the agreement in doubt.Meanwhile, ConocoPhillips lowered its 2017 capex budget by 4% to $5 billion and said it would sell $5 billion to $8 billion in North American natural gas assets, ahead of an analyst meeting. The oil company sees Brent at $50 per barrel next year and production flat to up 2%.""During the past two years, we have significantly transformed ConocoPhillips to succeed in a lower, more volatile price environment,"" CEO Ryan Lance said in a statement. ""We've lowered the capital intensity and break-even price of the company, lowered the cost of supply of our investment portfolio, and created strategic flexibility for future price cycles.""Earlier, BP lowered its capital expenditure outlook for the year and was cautious on 2017, while Shell downgraded its spending outlook for next year.ConocoPhillips fell 2.1% Thursday, despite plans for a $3 billion share buyback.RELATED:Permian Lifts U.S. Oil Rig Count After Falling A Week AgoTotal, CNPC To Win $6 Billion Iran Gas Deal Years After Sanctions Pushed Them Out

372,O,"Crude futures nearly gave up this week's gains, as hopes withered that top oil producers will reach an agreement next week to trim production and prop up prices.U.S. crude dropped 4% to settle at $46.06 a barrel, more than double the loss earlier Friday but still 0.8% higher than a week ago. Brent fell 3.6% to $47.24.Top OPEC oil producer Saudi Arabia is pushing for total cartel production of 32.5 million barrels, at the deep end of an earlier proposal, which would help take 2% of the world's oil supply off the market, Wall Street Journal sources said Thursday. In September, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to trim production to 32.5 million-33 million barrels per day, down from 33.64 million barrels a day in October, to help rebalance oil markets.But Saudi Arabia won't be attending an informal meeting Monday in Vienna between the cartel and non-OPEC producers, according to Reuters sources Friday, and a Reuters reporter later tweeted that the Monday meeting will only include OPEC members. Non-members Russia, Azerbaijan and Mexico had planned to attend. Azerbaijan's oil minister said Thursday that OPEC was pushing oil producers outside the cartel to also make cuts.Exxon Mobil (XOM) shares closed up 0.2% on the stock market today. BP (BP) fell 0.4%. Chevron (CVX) ended flat and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) lost 0.2%.Meanwhile, Russia only plans to freeze production, not trim it. Energy Minister Alexander Novak said Thursday that a freeze would be ""quite a difficult and harsh situation for us as our plans envisioned an output growth next year,"" according to Bloomberg.Speaking after an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Lima, Peru, earlier this month Russian President Vladimir Putin said freezing its crude production ""is not an issue for us,"" and that he sees a ""high probability"" that OPEC can agree to its production cut at the meeting later this month, according to Reuters.But Russia is pumping out 11.2 million barrels of oil a day, a post-Soviet Union record, so even a cap would do little to help the oil glut on markets.Even if OPEC and non-OPEC nations agreed on significant cuts next week, that's no guarantee that they will actually stick to their individual quotas. And any increase in oil prices that result from an agreement would encourage U.S. shale companies pump more oil and add to global supplies.IBD'S TAKE: Algeria's energy minister told Bloomberg earlier that the proposed output deal would last six months or maybe up to a year. Analysts believe that even a short six-month cut is better for markets than no reduction at all.On Wednesday, Baker Hughes (BHI) said U.S. oil rig counts rose by 3 to 474 with rigs in Colorado's DJ Niobrara up 2 to 20. But rig counts were flat at 32 in the Eagle Ford and fell by one to 228 in the Permian basin after rising 11 in the week ended Nov. 18.The total U.S. rig count for oil and natural gas climbed up five to 593.Shale bellwether Continental Resources (CLR) shares tumbled 2.9% to 51.83, falling away from its 54.97 buy point. EOG Resources (EOG) fell 1% to 95.98, consolidating in a flat base, but falling further from its 98.42 buy point.

373,O,"Oil futures erased early losses to close higher Wednsday.  despite Donald Trump's presidential victory and larger-than-expected U.S. stockpiles.The Energy Information Administration said weekly U.S. crude stockpiles rose by 2.43 million barrels, above the 1.3 million barrels that analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting. Late Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, said stockpiles rose by 4.4 million barrels.Domestic production rose 2% to 8.69 million barrels.U.S. crude fell about 1% intraday but closed up 0.6% at $45.27 a barrel.Trump's victory initially rocked markets as investors saw a win by Hillary Clinton more likely. But soon stock markets turned higher, the dollar bounced back and Fed rate hike odds for December returned to 70% or more.IBD'S TAKE: While a Trump administration may boost crude production and coal burning, solar stocks crashed on fears that the new president will not promote alternative energy.Also adding pressure on prices is uncertainty over how much the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' production cap will help boost oil prices, if it can agree on a cap at all.The cartel was seen waffling before on actually implementing the cap at its meeting in Vienna later this month, but even if it can agree on a cap, the group will likely face rising U.S. production. Trump has been a proponent of boosting U.S. output by opening up federal land for drilling. Fears of a weaker global economy on a Trump victory could also play into the cartel's decision-making.""The outcome of the U.S. election adds to the challenges for the oil exporters because it will likely lead to weaker economic growth in an already fragile global economy,"" Daniel Yergin, a Pulitzer Prize-winning author and vice chairman of IHS Markit told Reuters. ""And that means additional pressure on oil demand.""On the other hand, Trump has said that he opposed the U.S. nuclear deal with Iran, which could affect foreign investment in the country.Last week, Goldman Sachs (GS) warned that oil could fall to low $40s per barrel if OPEC can't agree on the cap.Exxon Mobil (XOM) rose 1.1% to 86.25 on the stock market today. Chevron (CVX) climbed 0.3%. Among top shale producers, Continental Resources (CLR) jumped 3.5% and EOG Resources (EOG) ticked up 0.1%.A Trump victory is expected to be bullish for U.S. shale E&P companies. Continental's CEO Harold Hamm spoke at some of Trump's rallies and is seen as the leading candidate for energy secretary or as a possible candidate for interior secretary.""The Energy Industry will be very happy as a president Trump will take a harder line with OPEC and revisit things like the Keystone Pipeline that started the anti-pipeline movement in this country that threaten to lead to shortages of supply and sharply higher energy costs down the road,"" Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group, wrote in his morning energy report.RELATED:Total, CNPC To Win $6 Billion Iran Gas Deal Years After Sanctions Pushed Them Out

374,O,"CNN's Brian Stelter sent around an Election Day email declaring ""This is the year of the fact-checker."" He joked, ""Trump made fact-checking great again.""""It's really remarkable to see how big news operations have come around to challenging false and deceitful claims directly. It's about time,"" said Brooks Jackson, the director emeritus of FactCheck.org.PolitiFact editor Angie Drobnic Holan said, ""All of the media has embraced fact-checking because there was a story that really needed it."" She was singling out Trump: ""(T) he level of inaccuracy is startling."" PolitiFact founder Bill Adair boasted: ""Is this the post-truth election, as people have claimed? No. It's actually the thank-goodness-there-are-fact-checkers election.""The rise of ""fact-checking"" in the American media is now honored in a new book called ""Deciding What's True."" Unsurprisingly, the author, University of Wisconsin professor Lucas Graves, focused first on how journalists challenged President Reagan's ""well-established reputation for error and exaggeration.""From the Reagan years to today, conservatives have been dismissed by the press as the ""poor, uneducated and easy to command"" types. Thirty years later, nothing's changed.It's precisely this long-standing ideological arrogance — that conservatives are both intellectually challenged and the most resistant to what ""objective"" journalists define as reality — informing the fact-checkers. Throughout this election cycle, liberal journalists have touted the honesty and factual accuracy of Hillary Clinton by grading her on a curve with Donald Trump based on the verdicts of these biased fact-checkers.Trump can be careless with facts, and resistant to media shaming. But for these fact-checkers to claim Clinton is far more honest is preposterous. PolitiFact awarded its ""Pants on Fire"" tag to Trump 57 times to Clinton's seven. Likewise, Washington Post Fact Checker Glenn Kessler reported that ""Trump earned significant more four-Pinocchio ratings than Clinton — 59 to 7,"" and ""The numbers don't lie.""Well, yes, they do. Just ask the parents of the brave men murdered in Benghazi if Clinton lies. Ask the FBI — even Director Comey, who exonerated her. Ask those who held hearings in the House and Senate and listened to her testimony. Ask those who have investigated the Clinton Foundation. They and so many others will speak to her endless lies. But not so the ""fact checkers.""It is a given that the default position for the media elite is to rate liberal politicians ""True"" and conservatives of every faction ""False."" Take the vice presidential candidates on the PolitiFact ""Truth-o-Meter"" in this campaign. Tim Kaine was rated ""True"" or ""Mostly True"" 26 times, and Mike Pence drew those positive ratings only 8 times. Pence was ""False"" or ""Mostly False"" 18 times, and Kaine drew those marks only 11 times. Since Sept. 1, conservatives and Republicans have been scolded as ""Pants on Fire"" 28 times (fully 14 of those tags were for Trump). Liberals and Democrats? Only four (and only one for Clinton). That's a 7-to-1 tilt, and an obscene 14-to-1 tilt for the presidential candidates.PolitiFact founding editor Bill Adair recently admitted this was an awfully subjective racket. (Ya think?) When a supportive interviewer suggested their measurements contained some personal opinion, Adair admitted, ""(Y) eah, we're human. We're making subjective decisions. Lord knows the decision about a Truth-O-Meter rating is entirely subjective. As Angie Holan, the editor of PolitiFact, often says, the Truth-O-Meter is not a scientific instrument.""In a review of the Graves book in The Washington Post, Heidi Moore asserted that Graves ""shies away from branding any politician a liar, noting that fact-checkers never use the term."" Are these analysts so dim as to think a ""Pants on Fire"" rating doesn't strongly imply ""liar""? Or The Washington Post Fact Checker's ""Four Pinocchios"" doesn't imply a falsehood?It's time to fact-check the fact checkers. In fact, it's already been done. According to a recent Rasmussen poll, just 29% of likely voters trust media fact-checking of the candidates, while 62% believed the media ""skew the facts to help candidates they support.""Don't you just love the American people? They have awarded on big, fat ""Pants on Fire"" to the entire national news media for their fact-checking arrogance and plain old dishonesty. And that's a fact.

Brent was closed down 1.7% to $45.58.""Oil in the $40s won't sustain enough production to meet demand worldwide,"" CEO William Thomas said during the company's third-quarter conference call Friday.He added that while EOG could deliver strong production at $50 per barrel, the U.S. industry as a whole would need a sustained price of $60 and extended lead time to provide a ""moderate"" level of growth.Despite oil's setback this week, EOG raised its full-year capital spending guidance by $200 million to a range of $2.6 billion-$2.8 billion, excluding acquisitions. The company expects to drill 290 wells this year, 40 more than its earlier outlook and 90 more than its plans at the start of the year.EOG shares finished 0.3% lower at 91.80 on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: While EOG raises its spending outlook for the year oil majors BP and Royal Dutch Shell are taking cautious capital expenditure outlooks for 2017.Other shale exploration and production companies have also boosted drilling and production outlooks.Earlier this week, Carrizo Oil and Gas (CRZO) raised its full-year oil production outlook and said it would add a third full time rig in early 2017 for use in the Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin.Apache (APA) said it will add three rigs in the Midland Basin in Q4 and would end the year at the high end of its North American onshore production guidance of 268,000-278,000 barrels per day.EOG's Q3 oil production rose 1% to 275,700 barrels, 3% above the company's guidance while exploration and development costs fell 32%.The company will end the year with 140 drilled by uncompleted wells, calling it a normal level of working inventory, and plans to ""exit the year with oil production on the upswing near record rates,"" according to management on the conference call.Late Thursday, EOG announced that it lost 35 cents a share in Q3, or 40 cents excluding various items.

Plus, EOG Resources (EOG) is on tap after the market closes.During Continental's third-quarter conference call, Chief Executive Harold Hamm said no matter what the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries does at its meeting later this month, ""markets are at a turning point"" and that U.S. shale has made the cartel ""less relevant."" But earlier this week Goldman Sachs (GS) warned that oil prices could hit the low $40s per barrel if an OPEC agreement fails.U.S. crude fell 1.5% to $44.66 a barrel on Wednesday, its lowest close since Sept. 23.Despite current volatility in oil prices, Continental said it expects a ""a very strong"" 2017 but won't give full-year guidance until January. The company said more than 50% of the cost savings it's seeing is from operational restructuring and will stay with the company as it looks to complete drilled but uncompleted wells in the Bakken shale play in North Dakota.IBD'S TAKE: Continental is talking a bullish game about 2017 but oil majors BP and Royal Dutch Shell are taking more cautious capital expenditure outlooks for 2017.The company also said it bundled services for greater efficiencies and plans to continue negotiating packages as service providers look at raising prices. Earlier Halliburton (HAL) said it is still in a ""brawl"" on pricing with competitors.Late Wednesday Continental reported third-quarter results that fell short of Wall Street views. Continental shares fell 1.8% to 46.17 in the stock market today.Among shale producers that issued quarterly results Thursday, Carrizo's earnings jumped 15% to 23 cents a share, beating analyst views by 6 cents.

378,O,"U.S. shale companies' earnings will likely be unimpressive, but with oil prices on the uptick, analysts will be looking for guidance for future quarters.""Luckily the first quarter was the nastiest one, with the lowest oil prices and everything,"" said Jason Wangler, managing director at Wunderlich. ""So now I think it's more of a function of can companies walk us through how much better the scenario is today?""Wangler expects guidance on activity and production levels and commentary on whether $50 a barrel will be enough for companies to really start ramping up activity.West Texas intermediate oil has been hovering around $50 a barrel for several weeks after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to cap production. Rig counts, especially in the Permian basin, have risen, though the latest week saw the first dip in more than four months, according to Baker Hughes (BHI) data.U.S. oil has retreated from $50 earlier this year and lately has had trouble breaking out higher. Some companies and analysts have said the industry needs a price closer to $60 or more to see a major comeback.Just holding around $50 may be a challenge. Oil prices fell 2.1% to $48.70 a barrel on Friday as a divided OPEC failed to agree on specific cuts for members. Without an internal deal, OPEC failed to reach a supply pact with other big producers over the weekend.A top oilfield services provider thinks $50 is enough. Halliburton (HAL) CEO Dave Lesar maintained that ""significant activity increases start with sustainable commodity prices of over $50 per barrel.""

Revenue is seen falling 11.3% to $557.73 million.Parsley Energy (PE) is also out Wednesday, and analysts see earnings of 2 cents per share, up from a loss of 8 cents a year ago. Revenue is expected to jump 102.6% to $130.15 million on acquisitions.Apache (APA) is on tap Thursday. Wall Street expects its per share loss to widen to 16 cents and revenue to fall 7.5% to $1.38 billion.

""You'll see shipments of crude to the U.S. delayed by four days to three weeks.""But if the storm wrecks havoc on the U.S. it would hit demand and drag down prices.The producers meeting in Istanbul Oct. 8-13 would also be bullish on prices as it gives investors another sign that the deal is serious.Analysts said earlier this week that oil prices likely wouldn't stay above $50 until next year.Brian Youngberg, an energy analyst at Edward Jones, said via email that his company expects to see oil prices staying in the mid-to-high 40s before rising above the $50 ceiling next year.RELATED: U.S. Oil Rig Counts Rise Again On Permian, Williston GainsU.S. Oil Drilling To Jump Next Year As OPEC Looks To Scale Back

387,O,"Oil prices are likely to remain volatile for the rest of the year, but some analysts believe U.S. crude will finally rise above $50 per barrel in 2017.Since the spring, West Texas Intermediate has topped the $50 mark repeatedly only to drop back below that level soon after. The price surged last week after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to curb production, raising hopes for a more sustained price rally.Despite some doubts about whether the OPEC deal will hold, oil prices crept higher Monday, with WTI settling up 1.2% to $48.81, the highest in three months, and Brent up 1.4% to $50.89.Brian Youngberg, an energy analyst at Edward Jones, said via email that his company expects to see oil prices staying in the mid-to-high 40s before rising above the $50 ceiling next year. But he doesn't see shale companies increasing spending until oil is solidly in the mid-50s, and even then the ramp-up will be modest as firms remain conservative.For now, Youngberg is bullish on EOG Resources (EOG) and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) for their ""flexibility both financially and operationally"" and Devon Energy (DVN), Marathon Oil (MRO) and Apache (APA) for their ""attractive acreage.""EOG shares closed down 0.6% to 96.11 on the stock market today. Pioneer edged down 0.1%. Devon added 0.2%. Marathon rose 1.1%. Apache climbed 0.1%.IBD's TAKE: The Permian Basin in Texas is the epicenter of low-cost production of U.S. shale oil. Read more about stock winners in the oil patch in the Industry Snapshot.The U.S. Energy Information Administration said last month — before OPEC announced its plan to cut output — that it sees U.S. oil averaging below $45 a barrel this quarter and in Q1 2017, before topping $50 later in the year.Chris Lafakis, a director at Moody's analytics said the OPEC agreement put a floor on prices of $45 per barrel and while the cartel hasn't yet committed to the production cuts decided last week, he said it was clear that Saudi Arabia is struggling with low oil prices as it trims government workers' salaries and depletes its foreign reserves.""For some places, the point is that we think that current prices are sufficient to have a modest increase in investment, especially if companies are hedging oil prices and as prices continue to creep up,"" Lafakis said.U.S. shale companies have taken advantage of the rise in oil prices to lock in price risk for next year by hedging.""Hedging makes sense given uncertainty in markets, but many companies hedge on a regular basis and may just be taking advantage of the rise last week,"" Youngberg said. ""It may not be a bearish take, just a good opportunity to hedge given the recent flat price environment with oil stuck in the low to mid-40s.""RELATED: U.S. Oil Drilling To Jump Next Year As OPEC Looks To Scale BackU.S. Oil Rig Counts Rise Again On Permian, Williston Gains

388,O,"""Lots o' folks confuse bad management with destiny."" — Kin HubbardThe good news, a commodity in short supply, is that Americans are about to get a respite from the inundating Niagara of candidates' blather. The bad news is that the respite will be a tsunami of Cubs Gush, which will slosh from sea to shining sea. So, brace yourself for a surfeit of dubious sociology and worse metaphysics. There is something about baseball, and especially about the Chicago National League Ball Club, that triggers — consider this column a trigger warning — incontinent rhapsodizing and nonsensical theorizing by otherwise sensible citizens.The mesmerizing arithmetic of the moment is that the Cubs last won the World Series in 1908, when Teddy Roosevelt was president. Today the nation that is selecting its 45th president is as distant from 1908 as that year was from the second presidency, that of John Adams.In the sport of the long season, after playing 162 games in 183 days, a team is what its record says it is, and the Cubs have baseball's best record. This year's team is vastly more talented than the team that made the Cubs' last appearance in the World Series, in 1945, when many of the major league's best players were still wearing military uniforms. (The Tigers had enough of them to defeat the Cubs in seven games.) From 1946 through 2014, just before today's team materialized, the Cubs were 714 games — almost four and a half 162-game seasons — under .500 (5,095 wins, 5,809 losses).Ethicists say losing builds character. Cub fans, who are mostly scar tissue, say they already have quite enough character, thank you. Dime-store anthropologists brood about how a Series win might puncture the mystique of the ""lovable losers."" But what is lovable about consistent failure? For that, Americans have government.Some Cub fans, luxuriating in losing, have taken a perverse pride in their team's colorful failures, such as third baseman Don Hoak striking out six times in a 17-inning game. Or second baseman Glenn Beckert stranding 12 runners in a nine-inning game. Or Lou ""The Mad Russian"" Novikoff trying to steal third base — with the bases loaded. (He explained that he got ""a good jump on the pitcher."") Or shortstop Lennie Merullo making four errors in one inning. (He had a son born that day who was nicknamed Boots.) Or pitcher Dickie Noles being traded for himself. (Sent to the Tigers for a player to be named later, he promptly surrendered a bases-loaded triple, so the Tigers designated him the player named later and shipped him back to Chicago.)Some Cub fans seem to relish theories about how curses or karma have destined the Cubs for failure. Actually, for many years the team's management, having inherited a dandy ballpark but having no clue how to build a good team, decided to market Wrigley Field's charms: The grass would be so green, the ivy so lush, the beer so cold and the sunshine (there were no night games until 1988) so warm that no one would care what the scoreboard said. Phil Wrigley, son of William, after whom the ballpark is named, even encouraged calling it Cubs Park rather than Wrigley Field because people like going to a park. This, he said, would appeal to ""people not interested in baseball."" Good grief.Wrigley's bleachers became the best singles bar on the North Side, and the ballpark became a health resort for visiting teams. Then, in 2009, the Ricketts family, which did not make enough money to buy the Cubs by being indifferent to excellence, turned the team over to son Tom, who met his wife in Wrigley's bleachers but who is agreeably unsentimental about the cult of futility.So, all you purveyors of Cubs Gush, listen up. Referring to Wrigley Field as a ""baseball cathedral"" should be a flogging offense. It is just a nice little place on the North Side where men (calling major leaguers ""boys of summer"" should be punishable by keelhauling) work hard at a demanding and dangerous craft.And Cub fans, loyal through thin and thin, you must remember this: Your team at least won the Cold War. For years, it held spring training on Catalina Island near Los Angeles. So, when a Des Moines radio sportscaster named ""Dutch"" Reagan went to report on them he stopped in Hollywood for a screen test, and the Soviet Union was doomed. So there.

393,O,"The U.S. rig count, which is already on the rise, is expected to jump next year, in contrast with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which is now trying to reduce its own output after pressuring U.S. companies to cut down.Rigs in operation will average 579 for 2017, up 29% from what's expected this year, according to a study out Wednesday by Platts RigData, a forecasting unit of S&P Global Platts. Analysts forecast 11,151 new wells to be drilled next year, up 25% from the 8,915 wells expected to be started this year.After collapsing last year, the U.S. oil rig count is heading back up and climbed by two to 418 in the week ended Sept. 23, marking the 15th gain in the last 17 weeks, according to Baker Hughes (BHI) data. Similarly, U.S. production has started to creep higher after a drawdown.Platts RigData expects capital spending this year to rise in the Anadarko Woodford, Marcellus/Utica, and Permian basins as exploration and production companies focus on ""highest-margin opportunities.""Spending is seen falling in the Bakken and Eagle Ford plays as companies keep capital spending targets steady, but drilling improvements and efficiencies have helped lower costs.""We have seen efficiency gains, like  high grading, and companies are able to do more with less as far as capex is concerned,"" said Jenna Delaney, senior energy analyst, Platts Analytics. ""They had to get creative to survive, and even though prices are only going to rise a fairly marginal amount next year, we would still see production rebounding.""IBD'S TAKE: The Permian is the epicenter of low-cost production of U.S. shale oil and investors should look at shale oil companies with large assets in the Texas play. Read more about stock winners in the oil patch in the Industry Snapshot. The Permian has been the focus of heavy acquisition interest lately.Noble Energy (NBL), Marathon Oil (MRO), and Occidental (OXY) are reportedly looking at offers for privately held Silver Hill Energy Partners.EOG Resources (EOG) said earlier this month it would buy Yates Petroleum to expand its presence in the Permian, and in July Diamondback Energy (FANG) bought $560 million worth of assets in the southern portion of the Permian.Chevron (CVX), the Permian's largest net acreage holder, could double its holdings there to $3 billion by 2020, according to a BMO Capital Markets note out earlier this month.Producers will also use their extra capital to finish drilled but uncompleted (DUC) wells. Platts RigData  said that DUC ""inventories may get depleted by between 950 to 1,200 wells this year.""The rise in U.S. rig counts comes as OPEC and other top producers agreed to limit production starting in November, according to Reuters.OPEC members are discussing concessions where Saudi Arabia would cut 400,000 barrels a day from its production, which hit 10.6 million barrels  a day in August, and Iran would cap production at 3.7 million barrels, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier, below the presanction level of about 4 million Tehran has said it is targeting.""If OPEC actually curtails production obviously that is going to be supportive of prices, and the rig count tends to track what the price of oil does,"" said Trey Cowan, Senior Industry Analyst, Platts RigData.Shares of Noble Energy climbed 4.55% in the stock market today on news of the OPEC agreement.

397,O,"Continental Resources (CLR) is testing new well-completion techniques in the Bakken shale formation ahead of plans to ramp up production next year, and EOG Resources (EOG) plans to drill more wells and complete existing ones.During the second-quarter conference call Thursday, Continental Resources CEO Harold Hamm said the company has decided to finish eight drilled but uncompleted (DUC) wells in the Bakken to test different proppant loads and spacing between wells, among other methods.The company is experimenting so it can use the best practices to boost incremental production once U.S. crude prices hit $60 per barrel, by completing DUCs. On Thursday, West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 2.7% to close at $41.93 a barrel.Hamm added that Continental doesn't expect oil prices to stay low for much longer, predicting production will come back on by the end of the year.After the close, fellow shale bellwether EOG Resources increased its 2016 well completion target to 350 net wells from 270, with many of the completion scheduled for late this year. And citing improved drilling productivity, EOG expects to drill 250 net wells in 2016, 50 more than in its original forecast. The company maintained its full-year capital spending outlook at $2.4 billion-$2.6 billion.If U.S. crude prices hold at $50 a barrel, EOG sees 10% annual growth in oil production though 2020. And if prices hold at $60, management sees 20% annual growth through 2020. On Thursday, West Texas Intermediate rose 2.7% to $41.93 a barrel.Continental shares closed down 1% to 44.42 in the stock market today. EOG rallied 2.8% in late trading, after finishing 2.3% higher.IBD'S TAKE: EOG Resources bounced above sell range Thursday. But oil majors like Royal Dutch Shell have fallen out of buy range and into sell range after analysts warned the gasoline market was severely oversupplied.In Q2, EOG swung to an adjusted loss of 38 cents a share as revenue fell 28% to $1.78 billion, with both beating views.Late Wednesday, Continental reported a Q2 adjusted loss of 18 cents a share on revenue of $451.2 million. Analysts were expecting a loss of 17 cents per share and revenue $554.8 million. It will give 2017 production and capital spending guidance in Q4.Continental raised its full-year production view to 210,000-220,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from 205,000-215,000. It also said its DUC inventory in Bakken grew to 165, with expectations to end the year with 190, down from its view of 195 in Q1.The number of DUCs in the U.S. shot up after oil prices tanked in 2014 and 2015, as shale companies sought to maintain a backlog of wells that could easily be tapped when prices recover. Meanwhile, companies have been developing better ways to extract oil.Earlier this year, Continental's VP of investor relations and research told IBD that the company now uses 15 million-20 million pounds of sand in each proppant load, which contain particles that hold hydraulic fractures open, up from 2.5 million-3 million pounds two to three years ago, to boost the amount of oil from each well.

It closed 0.7% lower.XLE sits 7% below its early September high and USO 37% below its 52-week high.On Tuesday, one market intelligence firm gave a thumbs down to the troubled energy sector while noting demand for energy ETFs remains strong, with global inflow of $3 billion year to date through Sept. 23.Stewart Glickman, head of energy equity research for S&P Global Market Intelligence, sees negative fundamentals in this sector. These include growing crude inventories and an expanding rig count that could further weaken oil prices, as well as stretched valuations in many energy companies. The latter concern is especially noteworthy in the oil and gas equipment and services sub-industry, according to S&P Global analysts.Their sell recommendations include Core Laboratories (CLB), Halliburton (HAL), Superior Energy Services (SPN) and Weatherford (WFT).S&P Global's Todd Rosenbluth noted that iShares U.S. Oil Equipment & Services (IEZ) and SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Equipment & Services (XES) have as much as 80% of their assets in this energy sub-industry, while XLE allocates 16% of assets to companies that provide oil and gas equipment and services.S&P Global ""recommends investors have an underweighted stake in the sector"" and has underweight rankings on the narrowly focused IEZ and XES, according to Rosenbluth, the firm's director of ETF research.Rosenbluth questioned whether demand for energy ETFs is warranted.But he added in a note: ""We think energy exposure can be appealing in a diversified ETF"" such as XLE and iShares Core High Dividend (HDV).HDV has a 20% stake in energy companies.IBD'S TAKE: Oil majors are on the rebound, but the more nimble U.S. exploration and production companies are outperforming them. Diamondback Energy is among top energy stocks with Permian Basin assets.SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) dropped for a second day Tuesday.An analyst at Kitco News wrote: ""The key 'outside markets' are in a bearish daily posture for the precious metals Tuesday, as the U.S. dollar index is higher and Nymex crude oil futures prices are lower.

403,O,"When FBI Director James Comey came before the press to deliver his bizarre proclamation -- that Hillary Clinton had lied relentlessly about her private email server but shouldn't be prosecuted because no prosecutor would ever dare take her to court (even though prosecutors all over the country rose to say they'd do so immediately) -- many were shocked and angered. One industry was thoroughly embarrassed: the media-elite ""fact-checker"" websites and projects, from PolitiFact to FactCheck.org to The Washington Post's Fact Checker column.These so-called guardians of truth felt forced to revise and upgrade their ""Pinocchio"" counts to reflect the  fact  that so many pivotal things Clinton had claimed about her emails turned out to be falsehoods. It's all well and good that they had to change their rulings, but how effective were these watchdogs in the first place?James Taranto of The Wall Street Journal describes the problem well: ""Frequently they accuse politicians of dishonesty because the journalists favor a different interpretation of facts that are not in dispute. Sometimes their 'rulings' are mere opinions on matters about which they do not know the facts, or that are not factual questions at all.""This was seriously underlined on the first night of the Republican National Convention. Patricia Smith -- the mother of Sean Smith, who died in the terrorist attack on our consulate in Benghazi, Libya, on Sept. 11, 2012 -- gave an impassioned speech, tearing into Clinton for lying. ""For all of this loss, for all of this grief, for all of the cynicism the tragedy in Benghazi has wrought upon America, I blame Hillary Clinton. I blame Hillary Clinton personally for the death of my son.""This could not stand. PolitiFact put a picture of this angry mother on their home page with the headline ""Checking Patricia Smith's claims about Clinton and Benghazi."" The suggestion? Smith probably told some whoppers on the floor in Cleveland.But the article that followed was, to borrow from Taranto, ""mere opinions on matters about which they do not know the facts."" PolitiFact creator Bill Adair wrote, ""We can't put Smith's claims on the Truth-O-Meter. But here, we'll lay out the case for and against the allegations against Clinton and let readers come to their own conclusion.""When the review of what the survivors of the four men lost in Benghazi said was finished, PolitiFact merely threw up its hands, claiming that none of these grieving relatives can really be trusted as reliable providers of fact.""It is impossible to know with certainty what Clinton told these families in brief conversations at a private reception only three days after Benghazi. Some, but not all, family members who have spoken to the media said Clinton mentioned a video or protests in their meeting. Some said she didn't mention a video. Clinton says she did not.""To Politi-""Fact,"" Clinton's record of lying about her server doesn't tilt the scales of credibility. In another article on Monday night, the website suggested grieving relatives might have ""fuzzy"" memories. Adair even suggested that even if Clinton was incorrect, she might not have been lying: ""If she did say something about the video, would it have been an intentional lie? It's very possible that this is one of the many conflicting pieces of intelligence that the administration was working with at the time.""Adair claimed no one can really claim Clinton lied: ""There simply is not enough concrete information in the public domain for Rubio or anyone to claim as fact that Clinton did or did not lie to the Benghazi families.""Adair and his ilk aren't fact-checking in any way. They're masquerading in fact-checker costumes to engage in shameless speculation, blather and spin favoring democrats.

He also expects production in the region to grow by 300,000 barrels per day, per year.Last week, oil rigs in the Permian rose by two to 202, representing nearly half the 416 oil rigs in operation across the U.S., according to Baker Hughes (BHI) data.In its September update last week, the Energy Information Agency said production from the Permian will rise by 22,000 barrels a day this month to reach 2 million barrels a day in October. But production is seen falling in all other regions, including the Bakken and Eagle Ford basins.And Pioneer isn't the only one with eyes on the Permian.

And in July, Diamondback Energy (FANG) bought $560 million worth of assets in the southern portion of the Permian.IBD'S TAKE: The Permian is the epicenter of low-cost production of U.S. shale oil and investors should look at shale oil companies with large assets in the Texas play. Read more about stock winners in the oil patch in the Industry Snapshot. Even oil major Chevron (CVX), which is the Permian's largest net acreage holder, is boosting its spending on unconventional plays, mostly in the Permian, and could double its outlays there to $3 billion by 2020, according to a BMO Capital Markets note out last week.But while interest in the Permian heats up, Total said it would cut overall investment to $15 billion-$17 billion a year next year down from $18 billion-$19 billion this year.The company still said it would boost output by 5% each year until 2020 and then 1% to 2% afterward.Chevron shares rose 0.35% and Total jumped 2.45%.RELATED:Iraq Says It's 'Right Time' For Production Cap; Oil Majors ReboundOil Falls As IEA Cuts 2016 Demand Forecast; U.S. Crude Below $45Permian-Focused Parsely, Laredo Benefit From Low-Cost Shale Center

See more details about which bank stocks might be in buy range. Wednesday's Fed decision, which keeps the target of the federal funds rate at a range of 0.25%-0.50%, prolongs the low-rate environment that has kept banks from charging more interest on loans and straining their net interest margins.The move drew an abnormal amount of dissent. Fed policymakers Esther George, Loretta Mester and Eric Rosengren voted against the move, wishing instead to raise the rate to a range of o.50% to 0.75%.While that statement said that the U.S. economy had gained momentum from the first half of the year, they expect that the economy will ""evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate.""The statement added that ""the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.""RELATED:Sen.

413,O,"Last week the Supreme Court of the United States voted that President Obama exceeded his authority when he granted exemptions from the immigration laws passed by Congress.But the Supreme Court also exceeded its own authority by granting the University of Texas an exemption from the Constitution's requirement of ""equal protection of the laws,"" by voting that racial preferences for student admissions were legal.Supreme Court decisions in affirmative-action cases are the longest-running fraud since the 1896 decision upholding racial segregation laws in the Jim Crow South, on grounds that ""separate but equal"" facilities were consistent with the Constitution. Everybody knew that those facilities were separate but by no means equal. Nevertheless, this charade lasted until 1954.The Supreme Court's affirmative action-cases have now lasted since 1974 when, in the case of DeFunis v. Odegaard, the Court voted 5 to 4 that this particular case was moot, which spared the justices from having to vote on its merits.While the 1896 ""separate but equal"" decision lasted 58 years, the Supreme Court's affirmative-action cases have now had 42 years of evasion, sophistry and fraud, with no end in sight.One sign of the erosion of principles over the years is that even one of the Court's most liberal judicial activists, Justice William O. Douglas, could not stomach affirmative action in 1974, and voted to condemn it, rather than declare the issue moot.But now, in 2016, the supposedly conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy voted to uphold the University of Texas' racial preferences. Perhaps the atmosphere inside the Washington Beltway wears down opposition to affirmative action, much as water can eventually wear down rock and create the Grand Canyon.We have heard much this year about the Supreme Court vacancy created by the death of the great Justice Antonin Scalia -- and rightly so. But there are two vacancies on the Supreme Court. The other vacancy is Anthony Kennedy.The human tragedy, amid all the legal evasion and fraud, is that while many laws and policies sacrifice some people for the sake of other people, affirmative action manages to harm blacks, whites, Asians and others, even if in different ways.Students who are kept out of a college because other students are admitted instead, under racial quotas, obviously lose opportunities they would otherwise have had.But minority students admitted to institutions whose academic standards they do not meet are all too often needlessly turned into failures, even when they have the prerequisites for success in some other institution whose normal standards they do meet.When black students who scored at the 90th percentile in math were admitted to M.I.T., where the other students scored at the 99th percentile, a significant number of black students failed to graduate there, even though they could have graduated with honors at most other academic institutions.We do not have so many students with that kind of ability that we can afford to sacrifice them on the altar to political correctness.Such negative consequences of mismatching minority students with institutions, for the sake of racial body count, have been documented in a number of studies, most notably ""Mismatch,"" a book by Richard Sander and Stuart Taylor, Jr., whose subtitle is: ""How Affirmative Action Hurts Students It's Intended to Help, and Why Universities Won't Admit It.""When racial preferences in student admissions in the University of California system were banned, the number of black and Hispanic students in the system declined slightly, but the number actually graduating rose substantially. So did the number graduating with degrees in tough subjects like math, science and engineering.But hard facts carry no such weight among politicians as magic words like ""diversity"" -- a word repeated endlessly, without one speck of evidence to back up its sweeping claims of benefits. It too is part of the Supreme Court fraud, going back to a 1978 decision that seemingly banned racial quotas -- unless the word ""diversity"" was used instead of ""quotas.""Seeming to ban racial preferences, while letting them continue under another name, was clever politically. But the last thing we need in Washington are nine more politicians wearing judicial robes.

415,O,"Saudi Arabia's energy minister said the kingdom could reclaim its traditional rebalancing role for the oil market and said the global supply glut is over.The swing producer role has largely fallen to U.S. shale producers like Continental Resources (CLR) and EOG Resources (EOG), after Saudi Arabia refused to prop up falling oil prices in 2014 and instead increased production to protect market share.Since then, U.S. companies have slashed spending, payrolls, drilling and production -- key goals for Saudi Arabia, which has said the burden of rebalancing should be on higher-cost producers.""Despite the surplus in global oil production and lower prices, the focus of attention remains on countries such as Saudi Arabia which, due to its strategic importance, will be expected to balance supply and demand once market conditions recover,"" Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said Wednesday, according to Reuters.Falih also told the Houston Chronicle that the oil supply glut ""has disappeared.""""The question now is how fast you will work off the global inventory overhang,"" he said. ""That will remain to put a cap on the rate at which oil prices recover. We just have to wait for the second half of the year and next year to see how that works out.""U.S. crude fell 1.4% to $49.13 a barrel, and Brent lost 1.5% to end at $49.88, as jitters over Thursday's ""Brexit"" vote also weighed. Exxon Mobil (XOM) shares closed down 0.4% in the stock market today. BP (BP) lost 0.8%. Chevron (CVX) fell 0.9%.  Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) edged down 0.5%. Continental Resources eased 0.6%, and EOG slipped 1.5%.But while oil prices are still well below their 2014 highs, they have rebounded somewhat, prompting some U.S. companies to start drilling again. U.S. oil rigs have been rising, and wells that had been left uncompleted are now being fracked.Meanwhile, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries said Wednesday that its 2015 revenue from crude and refined products sank by 46% to $518.2 billion, a 10-year low, as the slump in oil prices more than offset a 1.7% increase in OPEC exports.Also Wednesday, the Energy Information Administration said U.S. crude inventories fell by 900,000 barrels -- less than the 1.5 million draw analysts were expecting. On Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute reported a 5.2-million-barrel stockpile drop. Production fell 0.4% to 8.677 million barrels per day.The EIA also said domestic gasoline consumption hit a record high of 9.81 million barrels per day last week.

416,O,"Apache's (APA) Alpine High discovery in the Permian Basin will receive more than a quarter of its $2 billion 2016 capital spending budget, which was raised by $200 million to exploit a play that holds billions of barrels of oil, the company said Wednesday.The mountainous region had previously been dismissed by hydraulic fracturing experts but Apache said it spent the last two years exploring the basin's fracking potential and has drilled 19 wells in the region.The company estimates its acreage in the Barnett and Woodford formations alone holds 75 trillion cubic feet of gas and 3 billion barrels of oil, with ""significant oil potential"" in the Pennsylvanian, Bone Springs and Wolfcamp formations, according to a statement.""While other companies have focused on acquisitions during the downturn, we took a contrarian approach and focused on organic growth opportunities,"" said CEO John Christmann in the statement. ""These efforts have resulted in the identification of an immense resource that we believe will deliver significant value for our shareholders for many years.""He added later that ""Apache clearly has more profitable-growth opportunities than at any other time in the company's 60-year history.""Apache shares jumped 6.7% to 55.13 on the stock market today. The stock had climbed as high as 14% to 58.99 Wednesday, nearing a 59.69 buy point. Shares of Parsley Energy (PE), Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and Diamondback Energy (FANG), which are also big Permian players, were down 1%, up 2.6% and 1.45% higher, respectively.U.S. crude futures closed up 1.5% to $45.50 a barrel and added to those gains in late trading, following reports that the American Petroleum Institute's inventory survey showed a decrease of 12.1 million barrels last week.The Energy Information Administration raised its U.S. output forecast for the year to 8.77 million barrels a day in 2016, as drilling rigs in operation rise and wells become even more productive. EIA also raised its 2017 production estimate by 200,000 barrels per day to 8.51 million.IBD'S TAKE: The Permian is the epicenter of low-cost production of U.S. shale oil and investors should look at shale oil companies with large assets in the Texas play. Read more about stock winners in the oil patch in the Industry Snapshot. But the Alpine High discovery is still in early innings and the play could still fail to live up to its lofty promise. But James Williams, an economist at WTRG, said that historically companies underestimate reserves.So far the Alpine High basin has produced more natural gas than oil, but production costs are so low, some of the natgas wells in the area break even at 10 cents per million British thermal units, Apache said. Natgas futures are currently trading at $2.72.At an industry conference Wednesday, Christmann said that in some parts of Alpine High, the company can ""virtually get gas for free.""Exploration and production companies have been shifting their focus toward investing more in the lucrative Permian. EOG Resources (EOG) said Tuesday it would purchase privately held Yates Petroleum to expand its presence in the region.EOG shares dipped 0.5% to 94.32 after spiking 6.7% to a 52-week high Tuesday.Related: Facebook, Lockheed, EOG Price Targets Raised; Conoco UpgradedPermian-Focused Parsely, Laredo Benefit From Low-Cost Shale Center

419,O,"Eight years ago, it took Continental Resources (CLR) and its service companies over a month to drill to the bottom of a well in the Bakken shale play. A year ago, it took 18-20 days, and it looked like that was the technical limit on how fast a well could be drilled.Wrong.Wells can now be drilled in 13-15 days thanks to improved sensors that keep drillers in the optimal drilling zone, more effective drill bits that can power though the Bakken's hard rock, and other advances.The number of oil rigs operating in the U.S., despite recent increases, could stay depressed for years. But don't let that fool you. New technology and techniques are unlocking more oil per well. While OPEC has succeeded in forcing U.S. producers to cut back, the industry that is emerging from the oil bust has found ways to pump oil faster and more cheaply, making it a tougher adversary for the next global standoff.""The downturn in oil prices has accelerated the adoption rate of new technology because at this point the industry's back is against the wall and you have to adapt or you're going to die,"" said Matt Marietta, an analyst at Stephens.Technological innovation will be key as oil prices head up again. By slashing costs, producers were able to continue pumping when oil prices first collapsed, but that was largely the result of squeezing discounts from suppliers.In fact, only 20% of current cost reductions have come from technology improvements, according to Dan Guffey, vice president of equity research at Stifel Nicolaus. The other 80% came from service providers slashing costs and working with negative margins. But rock-bottom prices won't last forever, he warned.While BP (BP), Exxon Mobil (XOM), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and other oil majors with deep financial resources can take their time adopting new techniques, smaller producers have been forced to adapt quickly.Continental, which was among the pioneers in the original fracking revolution, is seeing success with enhanced well-completion techniques that it started doing two years ago when oil prices were higher.For example, the company now uses 15 million-20 million pounds of sand in each proppant load, which contain particles that hold hydraulic fractures open, up from 2.5 million-3 million pounds two to three years ago, said Warren Henry, vice president of investor relations and research at Continental, noting that the cost of sand has been falling.""In effect you're hitting (the well) with a really big hammer,"" he said.The result has been to keep oil flowing from some wells, even as prices neared recession-era lows. In its Q1 earnings report, Continental said enhanced completions in the Scoop shale play in Oklahoma have increased initial production rates 30%-35% vs. traditional completions.""I am proud of our teams as they continue to increase production and improve well economics through our ongoing process for optimizing completion designs,"" said Gary Gould, Continental's vice president of production and resource development, in an earnings release.""We continue to apply enhanced completion designs on all new operated wells, by testing, for example, various proppant volumes, stage lengths and proppant sizes in order to determine the optimum completion design for each area in each play.""Other companies are working on new twists on older practices. EOG Resources (EOG) announced last month that it has been injecting natural gas into existing wells in the Eagle Ford shale formation in south Texas.EOG wouldn't provide further details on how exactly its new method works. But James Williams, an economist at WTRG, said the process is likely similar to a water or CO2 flood, where liquid or gas is pumped in a well, mixes with oil to add pressure, and pushes oil toward wells at the other end of a field to be pumped out.EOG has been working on the process for three years and plans to do another pilot project later this year to test 32 wells.The company cautioned that the new method might not work in other shale plays with different geologic properties.Halliburton (HAL), Baker Hughes (BHI) and Flotek Industries (FTK) are working on customized nanofluids designed to reduce surface tension and increase a well's productivity.Nanofluids are made up of molecules that are smaller than those found in traditional fluids and reduce the friction to increase the flow rates of oil and natural gas out of the reservoir rock, Marietta said.Another technique that has gained popularity in U.S. plays is pad drilling, or drilling several wells from a single location to reduce the time and money spent disassembling the rig and moving it to another spot. Improving drilling time is a priority for shale drillers, as each additional drilling day can cost thousands of dollars.Meanwhile, the rigs themselves have also become more advanced. Helmerich & Payne (HP) pioneered the alternating current (AC) rig for shale back in the early 2000s. The rig's ability to drill at various speeds improves precision and energy efficiency vs. direct current (DC) rigs.Newer versions of the AC rig reduce ""spud to spud time"" -- or the time it takes between starting a new well to moving to another well -- to 7-10 days from 3-4 weeks, according to Marietta. That While good for oil producers, that also means suppliers of drilling products and services will see lower spending revenue and employment because fewer rigs are needed.More expensive offshore drilling is also seeing new advances that could be ready when prices get high enough to begin new projects.General Electric's (GE) oil and gas unit used carbon fiber technology to create a light-flexible pipe that connects a floating platform to the sea floor in deepwater drilling, like in the Gulf of Mexico or off Brazil.Ray Burke, a global product leader for GE Oil & Gas in the U.K., said the new pipe has been in the works for three years and will go into service in mid-2018.Burke wouldn't disclose the companies that are looking at the pipe but said several international and national oil companies are interested. He said the pipe can produce cost savings of 20%.""The simple story is we are going deeper and using carbon fibers and the end results are going to be cheaper for our clients.""Advances in drilling will help continue the success that U.S. companies have seen over the last five years, said Omar Al-Ubaydli, an affiliated senior research fellow at George Mason University's Mercatus Center.New technology can also lead to more gradual moves in the price of oil, instead of wild swings, as shale is more nimble than conventional production, he added.OPEC countries like Nigeria and Venezuela that haven't invested in newer technology will be hurt by advances in the U.S., said Thomas O'Donnell, a senior energy analyst at the consulting firm Wikistrat. Russia also can't exploit shale and Arctic assets because of economic sanctions that limit Westerners from helping develop the new fields.Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has low-cost production fields, and state-run oil company Saudi Aramco can bring in foreign experts knowledgeable about fracking and new technologies, he added.Still, OPEC must now grapple with U.S. shale producers on the rebound, which could lead to volatility, O'Donnell said. ""The oil order has changed. It's conventional oil on one side, and new shale oil on the other.""To be sure, new technologies and techniques don't all deliver immediate, upfront savings, and finding the right technique for each reservoir can be time-consuming and expensive.The oil business remains capital intensive, and capital has been in short supply for some companies. Breitburn Energy Partners, SandRidge Energy, Magnum Hunter Resources, Energy XXI, Goodrich Petroleum and others haven't been able to survive lower oil prices and filed for bankruptcy protection.But for those with strong balance sheets, the new techniques can, over decades, boost the estimated total recovery for a well, as more oil is recovered for longer.""We are leaving behind 80% of oil in place, even with the best technology we have today,"" Continental's Henry said. ""So we'll continue to be surprised at the improvements that can be made.""

421,O,"Continental Resources (CLR) CEO Harold Hamm said the shale producer is starting to frack wells in the Bakken Shale Formation again, as U.S. oil topped $50 per barrel this week.Earlier this year, Continental said it had stopped fracking in the Bakken as oil prices hit recession-era lows, and said it wouldn't wouldn’t resume drilling or completing drilled-but-uncompleted wells (DUCs) until oil hits $60. But Hamm told Bloomberg late Thursday that Continental has started completing DUCs.Continental isn't the only producer ramping up production. On Friday, Baker Hughes (BHI) said the U.S. oil rig count rose by 3 to 328 in the latest week, following the prior week's increase of 9 rigs. This is the first time since August that rig counts have been up two weeks in a row.And on Wednesday, the Energy Department said domestic output edged up to 8.745 million barrels per day last week from 8.735 million barrels a week earlier, the first uptick in 12 weeks.U.S. crude dipped below $50 a barrel Friday, falling 3% to $49.29 a barrel. Brent dropped 2.7%, to $50.54 a barrel. Continental shares closed 5.45% lower in the stock market today.Oil producers had held off on completing wells as a way to save money when prices plunged. Drilling accounts for 40% of a new well’s cost, while completion accounts for 60%, according to analysts at Platts.Hamm also backed his earlier view that if U.S. oil tops $60 per barrel, rigs will start drilling new wells again. He also sees U.S. oil hitting $70 per barrel by the end of the year.Despite Hamm's bullishness, other shale producers have signaled more caution. EOG Resources (EOG) said earlier this year it wouldn’t be in a rush to boost production, even when oil hits $60.According to Bloomberg, there were 4,290 DUCs at the end of 2015, and most of them were in the Bakken and Permian basins.Last month, Dan Guffey, vice president of equity research at Stifel Nicolaus, said shale producers would likely start completions once oil hit hit $55 or $60.

422,O,"The major indexes fell further midday and got stuck near intraday lows as investors reacted negatively toward more hawkish comments from Federal Reserve officials and another surprise nuclear test by the isolationist regime North Korea. But some banking shares bucked the trend.Meanwhile, Tesla Motors (TSLA) wiped away early losses Friday to edge up 0.1% to 197.64. However, its weekly action continues to be weak, suggesting that the imbalance between buyers and sellers remains heavily in the latter.The Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrials were all down more than 1.2% at lunchtime on the East Coast. All 30 Dow industrials components dropped, but JPMorgan Chase (JPM) inched just 0.3% lower to 67.03. As noted in a Stock Market Today column earlier this week, Morgan is acting well following a recent breakout.Deutsche Bank (DB) gapped up 3% to 15.31 in heavy trading, while Bank of America (BAC) rose nearly 0.6% to 15.96, edging closer to a potential cup-with-handle breakout at 16.34. Comments from Boston Federal Reserve Bank Chief Eric Rosengren appear to up the odds that the U.S. central bank will strongly consider its first hike in interest rates this year during an upcoming Sept. 20-21 meeting. Rosengren, considered to be dovish on interest rates, added that it's unlikely the Fed would take an aggressive stance toward raising the cost of money. Tesla may continue to lose ground, thus taking more time to consolidate the nearly sevenfold gain it captured following a 2013 breakout past a 40.10 first-stage buy point. One reason: The company announced earlier this week it secured a $300 million credit line in order to continue its rapid expansion of manufacturing capacity. IBD research has found that many top-notch growth companies have been able to expand their business without the need of external funding.A second reason why Tesla shares face more downside risk: Fund managers and analysts increasingly question how CEO Elon Musk will be able to manage the electric vehicle maker against increasing competition while simultaneously leading his separate SpaceX company, which has little if any relation to Tesla's own business.Third, the stock's proprietary ratings from IBD hint at the potential for further decline. If the stock can hold above a recent low of 187.87, then the chartists would be hard pressed to say that Tesla is in a long-term downtrend. However, Tesla gets a lowly 11 Relative Strength Rating from IBD Stock Checkup, meaning over the past 12 months it's outperformed just 11% of all stocks in IBD's U.S. database.Tesla's D+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 0.8 up/down volume ratio (1.0 is neutral, above 1.0 is positive) implies that institutional investors remain net sellers of the big-cap stock. Finally, Tesla's Auto Manufacturers industry group ranks in the bottom quartile of IBD's rankings of 197 industry groups and subgroups. Great stocks tend to show outstanding industry group relative strength. In the same group, only India's Tata Motors (TTM) and Italy's Ferrari (RACE) deserve note as potential market leaders.Some leading stocks continued to feel heavy selling pressure. A.O. Smith (AOS), which is having brilliant success in the water heater market in China and India, slid 4% to 92.89 in volume running nearly 90% above average. The stock ran up more than 20% after busting through resistance near 80 in May, but now is facing a critical test of support at the rising 50-day moving average.A sharp drop below the 50-day line can often mean it's time to sell a leading stock, especially if volume is the heaviest during the stock's advance.On the upside, recent IPO Glaukos (GKOS) rallied more than 1% to 32.12, jumping back above its rising 50-day moving average in the process. The eye-care treatment firm specializes in glaucoma disorders and went public in June 2015 at 18 a share. Its RS Rating is solid at 91, and a 79 EPS Rating belies strong earnings growth expected over the next two years (10 cents a share in 2016 vs. a net loss of $1.22 a share in 2015, 23 cents in 2017).RELATED:Why The Up/Down Volume Ratio Is Helpful For Growth InvestorsHow Tesla Motors Matches Up Against Its Auto Industry PeersHow is JPMorgan Chase Doing After A Recent Breakout?

Home prices also advanced, topping estimates.Amid those reports, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) inched up in early trade toward its April high of 210.92. It fell short of that mark, ending the session lower but at the midpoint of the day's range.SPY bagged a 1.7% gain for the month of May as investors digested hawkish Fed comments, strengthening oil prices and mixed corporate earnings.

433,O,"Speculation that Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google will take the wraps off a new virtual reality platform, taking on Facebook (FB), HTC and other rivals, is heating up ahead of its developers conference next week.Google is also expected to disclose more wrinkles for Android N, the next major update of the mobile operating system, due for release this year. And it might have something to say about Android apps coming to the Chrome OS or about combining the two operating systems.While Nest Labs, acquired by Google in 2014, seems to be struggling, some Web pundits say Google could provide an answer to Amazon.com’s (AMZN) “Echo” home hub. Google and Amazon also seem to be on a collision course in online video, but YouTube has not grabbed the spotlight at the developer’s conference in the past few years.Whatever new products and technologies are coming to Google I/O, slated for May 18 to May 20, will likely be unveiled by CEO Sundar Pichai in his keynote address. Pichai’s keynote is scheduled for 10 a.m. PT on May 18.The Google I/O schedule is packed with virtual reality. There’s speculation Google might roll out its own VR headset, firing back at Facebook’s Oculus Rift. Another line of thinking has Google sticking with its low-cost Cardboard VR offering for now.Like Facebook, Google may also be charging into augmented reality. While virtual reality immerses a user in an imagined or replicated world (like videogames, for instance), augmented reality overlays digital imagery onto the real world.That’s where Google’s “Project Tango” comes in. One of the first products to come from that effort is a new smartphone built by Lenovo and due out this summer.Google's annual developer's conference arrives before Apple's (AAPL) June developers meeting.

434,O,"Oil prices touched $50 per barrel on Thursday before falling just below that level, but U.S. shale producers won't start bringing production back online until prices are higher.West Texas Intermediate closed down 0.2% at $49.48 per barrel. Brent dipped 0.3% to $49.59 a barrel.Exploration and production companies won't put ""their foot on the gas"" to finish drilled but uncompleted (DUC) wells or drill new wells until oil reaches mid-$50 or $60 per barrel, said Dan Guffey, vice president of equity research at Stifel Nicolaus.""Producers want more clarity in terms of where oil prices are going before they sink capital and before they start completing wells,"" he told IBD.Another factor in their decisions is an urgency to lock in low prices from service providers. Most of the savings which producers have seen came from squeezing service companies, while only about 20% are from technological improvements. But those discounts are unlikely to last once crude prices rise further, so Guffey predicts there will be a rush for producers to start drilling at $55 or $60 per barrel.Continental Resources (CLR) has said it wouldn't resume drilling or complete DUCs until oil hits $60, and EOG Resources (EOG) management has said it wouldn't be in a rush to boost production, even when oil hits $60.EOG shares closed down 0.9% in the stock market today, while Continental shares rose 1%.After oil prices rose last year only to come crashing down again, E&P companies will be more judicious this time around. Until prices go higher, they will do the bare minimum.""They will complete wells as needed to just sufficiently generate enough cash flow to service debt,"" Guffey said.There are reasons for the oil patch to remain cautious now. Guffey said much of the recent oil price rally has been related to production disruptions in Nigeria and the Canadian oil sands region. But Canadian production is coming back online, and it's unclear how long the disruption in Nigeria will last.There is also uncertainty over what Saudi Arabia will do with production, now that the new regime wants to produce as much as it can to keep market share. Guffey isn't sure Saudi Arabia can reach the 11 million to 11.5 million barrels they estimate by the end of the year. But a boost to output would have a very bearish effect on the market.Still, analysts overall are becoming more bullish about oil prices. On Monday, Citigroup predicted Brent crude will hit $50 per barrel by Q3, if not sooner, and will reach $65 by the end of 2017. The analysts see West Texas Intermediate hitting $50 per barrel by the end of the year, and $61 by the end of 2017.

436,O,"EOG Resources (EOG) said Friday that drilling new wells won't be its first priority when oil prices recover and indicated that any uptick in industry production won't happen until next year at the soonest.The shale leader, which bills itself as the largest crude oil producer in the Eagle Ford formation -- and in Texas -- said it would take sustained oil prices of $60-$65 per barrel and 12 months of lead time for the industry to modestly grow production.EOG management said on a conference call that the company could produce more at a lower price but didn't give a level at which it would resume drilling. U.S. crude futures rose 0.8% Friday to settle at $44.66 a barrel.Instead of drilling, the company's first priority is to fund capital expenditures with cash flow, reduce net debt with property sales, and then complete drilled but uncompleted wells.EOG said it's picking up low-cost acreage in places it couldn't before the downturn and that it had successfully tested enhanced oil recovery techniques in 15 wells in the Eagle Ford.Shares closed down 3.2% in the stock market today, even as oil prices rose amid a massive wildfire in the tar sands area of Canada.Despite a 20% rally in oil prices last month, drilling activity continues to slump. Baker Hughes (BHI) said Friday that the U.S. oil rig count fell by 4 vs. the prior week to 328.Other shale players echoed EOG's caution about resuming drilling. Earlier this week, Continental Resources (CLR) CEO Harold Hamm said he wouldn’t consider adding drilling rigs until oil prices reach $60 a barrel.Continental shares fell 2.3% after soaring 13.9% Thursday.Late Thursday, EOG said it swung to an adjusted Q1 loss of 83 cents a share, beating estimates by a penny, from a year-earlier profit of 3 cents a share. Revenue fell 41.6% to $1.35 billion, below forecasts of $1.67 billion.

437,O,"What does it take to survive in a top job in a competitive, bottom-line industry? Win, baby! Long term.Larry Puglia has been at the helm of $30.7 billion T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth Fund (TRBCX) since mid-1993 and has been sole manager since May 1997.In that span, the fund has racked up a 9.97% average annual gain through April 29 vs. 9.02% for the S&P 500, says Morningstar Inc.Over the past three and five years through April 29, his fund's performance tops 94% and 97% of its direct rivals, respectively.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersThe fund captures an A+ 36-month Performance Rating from IBD, which means that its performance is among the top 5% of all mutual funds in that time.And the fund is an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards winner, shining in three categories — U.S. equity funds, growth funds and large-caps.Puglia is himself among the tops in sheer longevity. He ranks 20th out of 558 managers of U.S. stock mutual funds that have had a single skipper.But he is not immune to market volatility: Year-to-date through April 29, the fund was down 5.64%, topping just 21% of its peers.Puglia, 55, spoke with IBD from his office in Baltimore about how he invests.IBD: What types of markets does your fund struggle in, Larry?Puglia: We like to think we can perform well in most environments. When I first started to work with Tom Broadus (co-manager of Blue Chip from mid-1993 until leaving the fund on May 1, 1997), he warned me that your investment style will sometimes be out of sync (with the market). Your job, he said, is to recognize that and lose as little as possible.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Categories' PerformanceWe paid a price for having less technology during the height of the tech bubble. But we were able to offset that ... when the market clobbered tech companies with very high valuations as the tech bubble burst.But our rolling three-year performance numbers have been solid against both the growth benchmark and the S&P 500. Our rolling five-year numbers have outperformed the benchmark 93% of the time. Sometimes things that seem unpopular -- like Amazon (AMZN) in 2013 and part of 2014 -- can reward you if you're right in your long-term analysis.IBD: What does ""Blue Chip"" in your fund's name say about your overall approach?Puglia: As we've talked about before, Paul, blue chips are those with leading market positions and seasoned management, and we pay close attention to management's ability to allocate capital. We've learned over time that if you have a great business that throws off superior returns, but management doesn't know how to reinvest wisely, the business is soon ""worsified,"" as I think Warren Buffett said.Having strong returns -- returns on invested capital, returns on equity -- is another characteristic we look for. And because there are vagaries to book accounting measures, we've always looked at free cash flow as an important measure for profitability. As a result, we tend to own the leaders or No. 2 companies in industries.Home Depot (HD) is important to us, but so is Lowe's (LOW). We're willing to own the No. 1 or No. 2 names in market share, especially if both are high-quality companies and well-managed.IBD: You're fairly reluctant to own smaller stocks. What are the exceptions?Puglia: We have been willing to own midcaps or some rapidly growing companies. We've owned Amazon and O'Reilly (ORLY) over a decade and Facebook (FB) as a private placement, the only one in our fund. Some view it as an early-stage growth company, but we view it as a company with a unique leadership position in an area growing rapidly.We owned Genentech before it was acquired by Roche (RHHBY), so we're willing to own rapid growers. But we try to discern as early as we can that they will have durable growth.IBD: Is Ross Stores (ROST) a play on a slow-growth economy in which consumers are careful about their spending? Or would this be an attractive stock even if the economy were growing gangbusters?Puglia: Historically, Ross and TJX Cos. (TJX) have been dominant in off-price retail. They've done well in most economic environments. Some of that is due to the fact that they are well below their saturation points in number of stores in the U.S. and especially internationally.In a slow-growth economy, other retailers have to unload overstock. They make fashion misses. So Ross and TJX get more pack-away inventory -- they take unwanted merchandise off other retailers' hands, pack it away and sell it at good margins over time.IBD: PayPal (PYPL) is still trying to get back to where it went public. Where does this fit into your strategy?Puglia: This is an example of where we started our conversation. This is a high-quality but emerging blue chip.They are leading in their area of expertise. But because it was born (went public) early in its gestation, it has certain frailties. If certain other payment companies wanted to gang up and hurt PayPal, they could succeed somewhat.But instead, PayPal has a collaborative relationship with Visa (V), where we also have a position.And PayPal has broadened itself. They bought Venmo, a consumer-to-consumer network (that lets users transfer money to each other). It's growing rapidly. And it cornered Braintree, which can process debit and credit transactions (for many devices, and is used by online and mobile firms such as Uber and Airbnb).IBD: Which do you like more about Amazon -- what it is now, or what it has the potential to become?Puglia: In the last three to four years, they've invested heavily in building out their network of warehouses, distribution centers and related inventory management capabilities. They've also built out their free-delivery ability and more rapid delivery to attract more Prime members, who spend over twice as much as other customers and have higher retention rates.We've felt that the company should be valued on free cash flow, and that's going to move up dramatically because the third-party business (selling and distributing products for third-party sellers) and Amazon Web Services (AWS) should grow very rapidly. And both have much higher margins than their core retailing business, which is doing fine. And we feel the third-party business and AWS’ margins would improve over time.The real story is that the third-party and AWS businesses should pull their composite gross margin up very dramatically. That's happened, and we think it will continue.But predicting free cash flow for them is tricky because if they build, say, two more distribution centers, that can absorb a lot of free cash flow.Another way to think about the company is that AWS is, in our minds, worth well over half of the company based on our analysis of growth in that business. People don't appreciate that.IBD: Are you bothered by Broadcom's (AVGO) slowdown in earnings-per-share growth?Puglia: The growth rate is slowing temporarily because we're coming out of a big downturn.Now, Broadcom's acquisition of Avago is going to be accretive to earnings over time. Avago management has shown the ability to improve the profile of their product set. There's talk that they might sell parts of the business and what we'll end up with is a higher-quality business.When they're finished with restructuring, they will look like Texas Instruments (TXN) but trade at a lower multiple.Just in the last year, we came back into both of these names (Broadcom and its now-subsidiary Avago).IBD: O'Reilly Automotive is a cyclical play because people want to fix cars in a slow-growth economy rather than buy new ones. It's also a secular play because they're taking share in the repair-shop market. Is there a third element you like?Puglia: They are really extraordinarily well-managed. They key success factor is being able to distribute product to a mechanic or repair shop in a short time frame. They need parts within minutes, within the hour. And O'Reilly has distribution nodes and warehouses that can get product to repair shops in a very short time.That took a lot of investment and expertise.AutoZone (AZO) is also moving aggressively into the do-it-for-me market. They've been in the do-it-yourselfer market. Both companies have performed well and are taking market share. They're well-managed and have room to penetrate the total addressable market. And these are businesses that are less likely to be disintermediated by Amazon. Home Depot and Lowe's are the same.IBD: Does Constellation Brands' (STZ) growth come from acquisitions?Puglia: The reason it's grown in the last 12 to 24 months is their fortuitous and smart acquisition of Corona and Modelo and Pacifico and other Mexican specialty beers that were spun out as a result of mergers elsewhere in the industry.They have a wine business that has been a slower grower. But they've acquired Prisoner Wines and other specialty wines. They're smart in wines, and that business is poised to grow.IBD: Some people love to doubt Facebook (FB). You like the stock, right?Puglia: Yes, we're constructive. While it is inevitable that growth will slow, it is being sustained at a very high level.The stock has been robust because they've managed the transition to mobile devices much better than people thought they could. That will constitute their next leg of (share-price) growth: having that transition understood.Also, they've made several acquisitions in recent years that are not well understood (by many investors). Instagram now has 400 million users. What's App now has 800 million users, up from 500 million. And Messenger has a ton of users. As those businesses are monetized, they'll provide a new level of growth layered onto their core business, which is already seeing rapid growth due to video, for example.They'll earn in the $4s -- call it $4.50 per share in calendar 2017. They could be pushing a $6 number in calendar '18.IBD: Can Alaska Air (ALK) keep flying high despite the cost of the Virgin America (VA) takeover?Puglia: This is an interesting situation. Some of the most difficult decisions are when we have a high-quality company like Alaska, with the best balance sheet of any major airline, and then they make an acquisition and pay more than we would like. But they didn't have much flexibility because JetBlue (JBLU) was trying to buy Virgin too.Less appreciated is that Alaska gets important gates in Newark, LaGuardia, Kennedy and Dulles. Those are important airports, especially in relation to the West Coast.We hate strategic deals when you pay too much. But the more we look at it, the more we think it will be accretive.IBD: If you had a mentor, who was it?Puglia: I've had several. My father as a businessman who invested on his own over about 50 years. He had a growth-at-a-reasonable price style. He lived through the Depression, so he liked firms with earnings and cash flow. That influenced me.He also had an eye for new growth areas. He had seen new industries created, like TV and copying machines. And he never invested in gold. He always said, ""It can't innovate, it can't grow."" That focus on looking for companies that compound and grow has been a great influence.Jack Laporte (who ran New Horizons Fund (PRNHX) from 1987 until 2010) taught me that a few winners can make a big difference in growth investing. They can offset many losing stocks.And I mentioned Tom Broadus (who ran and co-ran Blue Chip from June 30, 1993, through May 1, 1997, with a 21.64% average annual return topping 95% of its peers, and whose Oct. 31, 1985-March 1, 1994, tenure atop Equity Income generated a 14.98% average annual gain, topping 86% of its peers) taught me to make sure that the managers of companies we're interested in really follow through on things they say they're going to do.And I learned from Brian Rogers (T. Rowe Price chairman and chief investment officer, who ran Equity Income (PRFDX) from 1985 to 2015), even though he is a value investor.Rogers once said to me that consistent thought and action were important. The most grievous mistakes he had made were trades he knew he should have made (but hadn't). He taught me to make sure my portfolio reflected my best thinking. Now, several times a week, I review why I own every single name. If I don't believe in a holding, I reduce or end it. That's especially valuable for growth investors. If a growth name is not compounding, that is dangerous.

438,O,"Continental Resources (CLR) CEO Harold Hamm said he wouldn’t consider adding drilling rigs until oil prices reach $60 a barrel, and the first rigs could be headed to North Dakota.The price is higher than what others have said would spark more drilling. Pioneer Resources (PXD) said last week it would add five to 10 drilling rigs when oil hits $50 a barrel. Some analysts have put the price at $45-$55. U.S. crude futures rose 1.2% to $44.32 a barrel.But the usually brash Hamm sounded more cautious on a conference call Thursday, saying he wants to see a sustainable price recovery before adding rigs and that drilled but uncompleted wells would first be brought online.""It will be some time before we think about bringing on more rigs,"" he said.Continental shares jumped 13.9% on the stock market today, after reporting late Wednesday that its Q1 adjusted per-share loss widened to 41 cents from 9 cents a year ago, missing views by 4 cents. Revenue from crude oil and natgas sales fell 30.7% to $403.6 million, below views of $441.22 million. But Continental boosted its 2016 output guidance.EOG Resources (EOG) said late Thursday that it swung to an adjusted loss of 83 cents a share, beating estimates by a penny, from a year-ago profit of 3 cents a share. Revenue fell 41.6% to $1.35 billion, below forecasts of $1.67 billion.When asked about the Bakken’s prospects in the long term as it competes for capital against newer plays like the Stack and Scoop plays in Oklahoma, Hamm said that assets in the older play would be more valuable in the future. But management said it was looking at the possibility of selling some of its non-core assets.Meanwhile, other oil and gas producers continue to raise production outlooks after first-quarter results.Occidental Petroleum's (OXY) loss, adjusted to account for discontinued operations and non-recurring gains, was 56 cents per share, swinging from a gain of 4 cents a year ago. Analysts were expecting a loss of 40 cents a share. Revenue fell 26.5% to $2.28 billion, below analyst estimates of $2.35 billion.But the company said its Permian production rose 30% year over year while operating costs in the area fell 33%. Total oil and gas operating costs were 23% lower.Occidental also raised its full-year production growth outlook for the year to 4%-6%. Occidental shares climbed 3%.Elsewhere, Apache's (APA) adjusted loss widened to 40 cents per share. Analysts were expecting a loss of 89 cents a share. Revenue fell 35% to $1.05 billion, under views for $1.1 billion.Apache shares tacked on 8%. The company drilled and completed 47 gross-operated wells in its North America on shore operations in the first quarter.""Apache's first-quarter performance was characterized by notable achievements in operations, drilling and further cost reductions. Despite a continued decline in our drilling activities, we delivered strong production results in North America Onshore,"" said Chief Executive John Christmann IV. ""Results in the Permian Basin were particularly strong with solid performance from our base production and very good results from maintenance projects and new drilling.""He said drilling and completion costs in key onshore plays were down 45% from 2014.Apache raised its full-year 2016 North American onshore production outlook to 268,000-278,000 barrels per day, up from an earlier outlook of 263,000-273,000 barrels.But Jason Wangler, a managing director at Wunderlich, told Investor's Business Daily earlier that most companies gave low production guidance in the fourth quarter in the hopes of beating it and drilling activity wouldn't start increasing  until oil hits $50-$55 per barrel for a sustained period.Exxon Mobil (XOM) also said Thursday it is teaming up with FuelCell Energy (FCEL) to develop new fuel cells to capture carbon emissions.The companies are working on creating technology that would lessen carbon dioxide emissions from natural gas power plants and other large emitters.""Carbon capture configuration has the added benefit of eliminating approximately 70% of the smog-producing nitrogen oxide generated by the combustion process of these large-scale power plants,"" said FuelCell Chief Executive Chip Bottone.Exxon shares edged up 0.1%. FuelCell rose 5.75%.

441,O,"High volatility will remain the new normal for oil markets, although prices have turned a corner, Citi analysts were quoted as saying in a report.The analysts raised their 2017 oil outlook on Tuesday to $65 per barrel, sending shares of Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX) and other oil majors higher.The report said Citi sees Brent crude hitting $50 per barrel by the third quarter, if not sooner, and $65 by the end of 2017, according to a report in MarketWatch. The analysts see West Texas Intermediate hitting $50 per barrel by the end of the year and $61 by the end of 2017.Brent edged up 0.5% to $48.61 per barrel, and U.S. crude rose 1.1% to $48.62 a barrel.Chevron shares closed up 0.8% in the stock market today to break the 100 mark. Exxon Mobil rose less than 0.1%. BP (BP) added 1.2%. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) rose 0.7%.""After a bumpy 2015, with a persistent crude-oil supply excess of some 1.5 million barrels a day, supply-versus-demand dynamics are at work and look likely to push the crude oil sector into equilibrium by midyear and deficit for much of the next six quarters,"" MarketWatch quoted the analysts as saying.Analysts expect U.S. commercial crude stocks to have fallen by 2.5 million barrels to 538.8 million last week, according to a Reuters poll. The American Petroleum Institute will release inventory data Tuesday, and the Energy Information Administration will announce official figures Wednesday.Last week, Goldman Sachs said the oil supply deficit would be short-lived and that it sees oil swinging back to surplus in the first quarter of 2017. For 2017, Goldman sees West Texas crude at $45 per barrel in the first quarter, down from $55 a barrel in March, but still hitting $60 per barrel in the fourth quarter.The supply glut is easing as companies cut capital spending and reduce drilling. Rystad Energy said oil discoveries in 2015 fell to the lowest level since 1952, as 12.1 billion barrels of oil reserves were found, according to a report by Bloomberg Monday. Over 75% of the reserves were found in the U.S.It will take some time before oil companies start drilling again. E&P firms have said in recent months they want prices to stay at $50 or $60 consistently before they resume drilling. Continental Resources (CLR) Chief Executive Harold Hamm said on the earnings call earlier this month that it ""will be some time before we think about bringing on more rigs.""At an industry conference in March, EOG Resources (EOG) Chief Executive Bill Thomas said that the company won’t be in a rush to boost production when oil hits $60.Continental Resources ended flat, and EOG rallied 1.5%.The three-day Williston Basin Petroleum Conference and Expo starts Tuesday in North Dakota. Industry experts are expected to talk about how to survive the oil slump. Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump is scheduled to speak Thursday.

442,O,"The Nasdaq took a stab Tuesday at its best gain in more than two months as the stock market approached the day's last hour of trade.Blue chips lagged with a 1.2% gain for the Dow industrials, while the S&P 500 stepped up 1.3%. The Nasdaq and the small cap Russell 2000 led with pops of 1.9% and 2%, respectively. Volume was higher on the NYSE and slightly lower on the Nasdaq, compared to the previous session.Technicals are improving in the stock market. The Nasdaq retook its 50-day and 200-day lines Tuesday. The S&P 500 also reclaimed its 50-day line (after climbing above the 200-day line in March). Recently, the Nasdaq's 50-day line crossed back above its 200-day line, which is a positive development.The Dow industrials were up almost without exception Tuesday afternoon, with 29 of the 30 stocks rising, including Visa (V), which added 2.8%, its biggest percentage gain since early March. Visa's volume, though, was below average Tuesday. Boeing (BA) was the Dow's only loser, down 0.6% in strong volume.Is Visa's stock overdrawn with selling, or is the stock ready to charge higher? See IBD Stock Checkup.Top-rated stocks featured many breakouts and new highs. Stocks breaking out included TurboTax provider Intuit (INTU), chip designer Ceva (CEVA), joint replacement maker Zimmer Biomet (ZBH), telecom software developer BroadSoft (BSFT), water heater maker A.O. Smith (AOS) and financial data and analytics provider S&P Global (SPGI). S&P Global was formerly known as McGraw Hill Financial.New highs included designer of organic LED devices Universal Display (OLED), chip designer Nvidia (NVDA), software developer Cadence Design Systems (CDNS), Broadridge Financial Solutions (BR) and chip designer MaxLinear (MXL).Economic reports released Tuesday offered grist for the bears and bulls alike.For the bears: The Richmond Federal Reserve's manufacturing index for May was weaker than expected. Wall Street had projected a reading of 8, but the figure came in at -1, a sign of contraction. In April, the reading was 14. Manufacturing weakness has been a concern in recent months. U.S. manufacturing accounts for about 12% of GDP.For the bulls: New-home sales in April trounced expectations. The Street's consensus estimate was 523,000, but the economy posted 619,000 -- a stunning 18% beat and the highest level in more than eight years. The figure easily topped the entire range of estimates, which ran from a low of 510,000 to a high of 530,000.Homebuilder stocks rose in response, with gains mostly in the 3% to 5% range, but many of the stocks remain far off their highs. Toll Brothers (TOL) jumped more than 8% Tuesday on a strong quarterly report, but the stock was still about 30% below its August peak.Two homebuilder stocks have better-looking charts than most in their group. D.R. Horton (DHI) is 8% off its high, and NVR (NVR) is only 5% off its high.

443,O,"Top shale oil producers like Continental Resources (CLR) and EOG Resources (EOG) are on tap to report quarterly results this week and could give an update on when drilling might start again after crude prices jumped 20% last month.U.S. oil prices are nearing the break-even level of $45 to $55 per barrel, when some producers could start bringing wells online.Some producers may have even started pumping when oil hit $40 per barrel. Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and Sanchez Energy (SN), which are active in Texas, already reported results in April. Pioneer boosted its 2016 production growth outlook to 12% from an earlier outlook of 10%, helped in part by increased output from the Spraberry/Wolfcamp zones.Sanchez reported a 25% rise in first-quarter production to 56,500 barrels of oil per day, above its 48,000-52,000 guidance, on better-than-expected results in the Eagle Ford’s western Catarina region. The producer brought 11 new wells online in the area.Late Monday, Anadarko Petroleum (APC) reported that its adjusted Q1 loss deepened to $1.12 a share, beating views for a loss of $1.16, while revenue sank 28% to $1.67 billion, below views of $1.81 billion. But in the Delaware Basin of west Texas, Anadarko grew sales volumes by 47%. In the DJ Basin of northeast Colorado, sales rose 11%.Despite the recent sharp rally in oil prices, some shale companies may wait and see how sustainable the upswing really is. EOG Resources  Chairman Bill Thomas said at an industry conference in March that his company won’t rush to boost output right after oil hits $60 a barrel.Producers also have to wait for capital markets to reopen and for workers and rigs to come back. Jason Bordoff, founding director of Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, has said it could take nine months to a year before production ramps up again.Market headwinds also remain. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pumped out 32.64 million barrels per day in April, near a new high, according to a Reuters survey. Oilfield service provider Baker Hughes (BHI) has said it doesn’t expect activity “to meaningfully increase in 2016,” but U.S. rig counts may stabilize in the second half of  the year.Carrizo Oil & Gas (CRZO)  and Noble Energy (NBL) will announce quarterly results before the market opens Wednesday.Analysts see Carrizo's earnings staying flat at 14 cents a share but revenue is expected to fall 17.2% to $123.44 million.  Noble is seen posting a 57-cent per-share loss vs. a 3-cent per-share profit a year ago. Revenue is expected to rise 3.4% to $784.5 million.Continental Resources reports late Wednesday, and analysts expect its Q1 per-share loss to widen to 37 cents from a 9 cents a year ago. Revenue is seen falling 24.6% to $439.52 million, marking a fifth straight decline. After its Q4 report, Continental said it had suspended fracking in the Bakken Shale formation.Concho Resources (CXO) and Marathon  will announce results after the market closes on Wednesday.Analysts see Concho breaking even vs. an EPS of 36 cents a year ago. They see revenue rising 9.9% to $454.2 million. Marathon's loss is expected to widen to 46 cents a share from a 37 cent a share loss a year ago. Revenue is seen plunging 41% to $903.3 million.EOG Resources will report results late Thursday, with analysts expecting a loss of 84 cents a share vs. EPS of 3 cents a year ago. Revenue is seen falling 28.1% to $1.67 billion.Meanwhile, Apache (APA)  and Occidental Petroleum (OXY)  will issue results early Thursday. Apache is expected to report a 90-cent per-share loss, down from a 37-cent per-share loss a year ago. Revenue is seen falling 39.3% to $1.1 billion. Occidental is expected to swing to a loss  of 40 cents a share vs. EPS of 4 cents a year ago. Revenue is seen falling 24.2% to $2.35 billion.

444,O,"O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) reported better-than-expected first quarter earnings and revenue growth after the market close Wednesday, but shares fell in extended trading after the auto parts retailer gave weak guidance.Earnings per share minus one-time items rose 26% to $2.59, beating analyst consensus by 10 cents a share. That continued a string of earnings beats going back more than eight quarters. Revenue grew 10.3% to $2.096 billion, edging views for $2.059 billion. Same-store sales rose 6.1%, which O'Reilly Automotive said was their 10th straight quarter of comps rising more than 5%.But O'Reilly Auto sees Q2 diluted EPS of $2.54-$2.64, well below consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for  $2.77 EPS. President and CEO Greg Henslee said the company ""can face headwinds relating to merchandise acquisition"" and other factors that ""can create short-term pressure on our gross margin results due to reducing our inventory value.""He noted that the company expects a noncash impact from a specific new supplier contract resulting in LIFO (last-in, first-out inventory) headwinds of about $23 million in the current quarter.Shares of O'Reilly fell more than 3% to 264 in after-hours action. The stock had closed up 0.2% at 272.87 in the stock market today. Its stock has been in a first-stage consolidation for about four months, with a buy point of 277.93. But Wednesday's late action suggests that the stock could undercut its 50-day moving average, where O'Reilly has been finding support.O'Reilly is the top-rated company in the auto parts retailers group with a 94 IBD Composite Rating out of a best-possible 99.

Revenue slid 8.1% to $13.36 billion, better than the expected $13.18 billion.CEO Gregory Hayes told analysts on a conference call that he expects rising activity in China in the second half of the year. That could boost orders for Otis Elevator and the company's climate controls and security products businesses. The company said it also sees signs that the equipment market is bottoming in China as units orders rise.New equipment orders for Otis rose 1% in the quarter at constant currency, and grew 6% excluding China. Equipment orders at UTC Climate, Controls & Security shrank by 8%, mainly due to a difficult comp in the refrigeration business.At its Pratt & Whitney aerospace unit, commercial aftermarket sales jumped 19%. The company said it sees aftermarket sales of aircraft parts rising as plane retirements slow and airlines fly planes longer.United Technologies shares rose 1% in the stock market today. The diversified manufacturer reiterated guidance. Its stock has been consolidating for about 10 months and as of Wednesday had risen 27% from the 83.39 low point of the trough on Jan. 20.A.O.

QNX Software Systems, a subsidiary of BlackBerry (BBRY), has also pushed into Web-connected infotainment and telematics systems, along with AT&T (T).Apple and Google have faced challenges because of the lengthy design cycles for autos. While Apple’s CarPlay technology is built around its iOS software, some automakers have preferred open-sourced technologies, analysts say.At the developer’s conference, Google showcased the Android N software working in a Maserati Ghibli equipped with a 15-inch screen. Google said it has added Wi-Fi capability to “Android Auto,” a move Apple took in 2015.IHS Automotive says Android software has been built into infotainment systems on new Honda (HMC) and Renault vehicles.“General Motors (GM) and Harman (HAR) announced a tie-up to build Android-based infotainment systems for GM vehicles,” said the IHS report. “This $900 million contract will (create) a new next-generation infotainment system powered by Android by the end of 2016 -- it’s possible that those vehicles will be powered by this (Android N) embedded system.”

454,O,"The Federal Reserve convinced markets that a June rate hike is on the table. Warren Buffett disclosed a big Apple (AAPL) stake. Home Depot (HD), Lowe's (LOW) and Wal-Mart (WMT) reported strong results, but Target (TGT), Gap (GPS) and Ross Stores (ROST) were among those with weak results or outlooks. Cisco (CSCO) and Salesforce (CRM) had upbeat reports that were good news for IT spending. General Motors (GM) and Uber tested self-driving cars on the road, joining Alphabet (GOOGL) Google cars, while Google held a major developers conference.The major averages continued to move sideways in a choppy fashion as the market remains under pressure. The Nasdaq rose 1.1% for the week after falling for the prior four weeks. The S&P 500 eked out a 0.3% rise while the Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.2%, its fourth straight weekly decline. The S&P 500 and Dow moved back above their 50-day moving averages on Monday as Apple rose on Buffett's stake, but then fell back as near-term Fed rate hike buzz took hold, pushing up the dollar. Thanks to Friday gains, the S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq are slightly higher for the week.While some stocks broke out -- Salesforce and Lowe's -- older breakouts struggled. Facebook (FB) closed just below a buy point Thursday, though it regained its entry point on Friday. McDonald's (MCD) fell below its late March entry area.Minutes from the Federal Reserve’s April meeting showed policymakers are close to raising benchmark interest rates again next month, surprising Fed watchers who priced in an increase later in the year. But before raise rates for a second time, the Fed wants to see signs growth is picking up in Q2, along with stronger labor markets and inflation heading for the 2% target.New York Fed President William Dudley said the next day a rate hike in the June-July timeframe is reasonable, unless the economy stumbles. He said a June rate hike is ""definitely live."" Other policymakers made similar comments. The next meeting will be held June 14-15, followed by another on July 26-27.April consumer prices had their biggest monthly gain in three years. Weekly jobless claims fell sharply after spiking to the highest since February 2015 in the prior week. Industrial production was strong in April, but manufacturing surveys for May from the New York Fed and Philly Fed showed unexpected deterioration.Existing-home sales and housing starts rose for April, while builder sentiment was steady in May.Mega-investors piled into Apple. Warren Buffett disclosed on Monday May 13 that Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) bought 9.8 million shares of Apple last quarter, valued at about $1.07 billion at quarter’s end. Midweek, Greenlight Capital disclosed it raised its stake in Apple 30.7% to 8.2 million shares, and billionaire George Soros' Soros Fund Management said it took a 3,100-share stake in Apple. Buffett's investment reflects confidence in Apple's pipeline of products, including future iPhones or even a rumored Apple Car. But it also suggests a shift in Apple's lifecycle from a growth company to a value play.Apple stock rose 5.2% for the week after hitting a 23-month low in the prior week.Playing catch-up, Alphabet's Google introduced a voice-activated Wi-Fi speaker system with built-in search. Google Home, expected to ship in 2016, will compete with the Amazon.com (AMZN) Echo. Google’s new “Allo” messaging app features artificial intelligence, like Facebook's new “chat bot.” Google’s upcoming Android N upgrade to its mobile operating system will feature a virtual reality mode. However, Google did not unveil a VR competitor to Facebook’s Oculus Rift. Apple rival Xiaomi plans to ship its Android-based TV set-top box to the U.S. in 2016.Both home improvement chains topped estimates on strong housing market growth and favorable spring weather, raising guidance. But Home Depot fell 2.5% on Tuesday and 1% for the week, as same-store sales growth cooled from 10.2% in Feb. to 6.7% in March and 4.3% in April. Meanwhile, Lowe’s shares climbed 6.4% to an all-time high, breaking out of a nearly four-month long consolidation.Salesforce.com reported Q1 EPS and revenue that topped views as the business software provider signed more big deals with enterprise customers. Billings rose 31% year over year, accelerating from 28% in Q4. Salesforce.com increased its full-year revenue guidance slightly to $8.2 billion. On its earnings call, management touted a new cloud alliance with Amazon Web Services. Salesforce stock jumped 6.1% for the week, breaking out of a base and nearly hitting an all-time high.Cisco Systems reported a 6% adjusted EPS gain for its fiscal Q3, with revenue up 3%, both edging past analyst forecasts. Profit and sales guidance was also bullish. Analysts had lowered expectations ahead of Cisco earnings due to the growing number of companies outsourcing to cloud computing service providers such as Amazon Web Services, reducing demand for Cisco’s networking gear. The lowered expectations also reflected lower spending on information technology overall.Well aware of the trends, Cisco is diversifying into newer, higher-growth segments such as software, data centers, security, wireless and the Internet of Things market.Cisco stock rose 5.4% for the week.The Energy Information Administration reported a domestic stockpile increase of 1.3 million barrels vs. a 3 million barrel decline expected by analysts. The American Petroleum Institute reported a drawdown of 1.14 million barrels. U.S. production continues to fall while gasoline demand ramps up.Oil prices hit fresh seven-month highs during the week. U.S. futures closed the week at $47.75 a barrel, up 3.3%.Goldman Sachs said that oil could hit $50 per barrel later this year as the market “likely shifted into deficit in May,” earlier than Goldman expected.

But Oxy said it didn’t “have any knowledge” about an offer. In November, Anadarko (APC) withdrew a bid to buy Apache, which had rejected the offer.Wal-Mart and Target moved in opposite directions after issuing their quarterly earnings reports.Target’s Q1 EPS increased 17% to $1.29, beating views for $1.19. But sales dropped 5% to $16.2 billion, missing estimates. Same-store sales grew 1.2%, short of predictions for a 1.6% gain. Target’s Q2 EPS guidance of $1 to $1.20 widely missed expectations for $1.36.Shares plunged 7.1%, hitting their lowest levels since late 2014.Wal-Mart’s Q1 profit fell 5 cents to 98 cents a share but beat estimates by 10 cents. Sales rose 0.9% to $115.9 billion vs. forecasts for a drop to $113.2 billion. U.S. same-store sales climbed 1%, the seventh straight gain. For Q2, Wal-Mart sees EPS of 95 cents to $1.08, with the midpoint above estimates for 98 cents.Shares popped 7.6% for the week, retaking their 200-day and 50-day lines after gapping down in sympathy with Target on Wednesday.Outshining its ailing department store peers, TJX (TJX) Q1 EPS and sales rose 10% to 76 cents and $7.54 billion, comfortably topping. Comps rose 7%. The off-price retailer guided full-year EPS up to $3.35-$3.42, still shy of estimates. Off-price peer Ross Stores edged past Q1 EPS views with a 6% gain, but revenue's 5% gain to $3.09 billion missed. Comps grew 2%. Q2 and full-year EPS guidance fell short of consensus. Ross Stores fell 3.4% for the week, while TJX climbed 3.7%.General Motors acquisition Cruise Automation confirmed that its self-driving technology was being tested on Chevy Bolts after photos of the all-electric cars surfaced online. Uber on Thursday also posted a photo of a hybrid Ford (F) Fusion outfitted with self-driving technology that it said would be undergoing testing.GM and Lyft plan to road-test autonomous Bolt taxis in the coming months, and Ford has established a subsidiary focused on autonomous-car technology and ride-sharing. But the carmakers face stiff competition from the likes of Toyota (TM), Tesla (TSLA) and Alphabet, which recently inked a tech deal with Fiat Chrysler (FCAU).Red Robin Gourmet Burgers (RRGB) plunged 21% this week to a 3-year low on weak sales and slashed revenue guidance. Sonic (SONC) said it would miss its own fiscal Q3 same-store sales target, triggering an 8.65% weekly stock loss. The reports, which followed a weak May 11 sales outlook from Wendy’s (WEN), intensified fears about burger competition as both value and upscale offerings spread. Wendy’s stock fell 2.8%. Shake Shack (SHAK), which popped on solid results earlier this month, slid 6.9%. McDonald’s lost 4.9%.Campbell Soup (CPB) and Hormel (HRL) reported disappointing quarterly results, perhaps indicating that sluggish consumer spending is spilling over into the foods group. Hormel, the parent of Spam lunch meat, Skippy peanut butter and other leading brands, plunged xx% for the week to a 2016 low. Q2 earnings growth was strong as sales in 4 of 5 product groups rose, Hormel also raised guidance. But its Q2 profit margin shrank to 11.9% before interest and taxes, down from 14.4% in the prior quarter. Campbell said fiscal Q3 EPS rose 5% to 65 cents, beating by a penny. But sales fell 1.6% to $1.87 bil, missing Wall Street’s target. Shares fell 6.4% Friday and 9.4% for the week, falling to a 3-month low.

460,O,"Proofpoint (PFPT) smashed Wall Street's first-quarter expectations late Thursday, thanks in part to a $5 million billings pull-through, and boosted 2016 guidance by $5 million at the midpoint, prompting shares to rocket Friday.In early trading on the stock market today, Proofpoint stock jumped as much as 8% before paring the advance to a 2.5% gain in mid-morning trade, near 55. Shares are down more than 15% this year, but they have recovered 50% from a Feb. 8 bottom at 36.60 on concerns of a slowdown in IT spending.For Q1, Proofpoint reported $79 million in sales, up 37% year over year, and a 9-cent loss per share ex items vs. a 14-cent loss in the year-earlier quarter. Billings came in at $98.3 million, up 48%.All three metrics topped the high end of Proofpoint's guidance. The analyst consensus, meanwhile, had modeled $76.3 million in sales and a 14-cent loss per share.During Q1, Proofpoint's protection and advanced threat segment -- which represents 71% of sales -- grew 47% year over year, CFO Paul Auvil said on the late Thursday conference call. TAP (targeted attack protection) nearly doubled and accounted for half of all new add-on business, he said.Pacific Crest analyst Rob Owens called it a ""sign o' the times (as) momentum continues,"" and maintained his overweight rating and 66 price target on Proofpoint stock.""Proofpoint remains in the winners' camp relative to our bifurcation thesis, as results meaningfully outpaced expectations for the quarter,"" he wrote in a research report. ""Q1 was demonstrative of the multiple layers of potential upside for Proofpoint.""Current-quarter guidance for $83.5 million to $84.5 million in sales and $94 million to $96 million in billings would be up a respective 32% and 26% year over year.

461,O,"Until the recent rally began, it's been a tough market. But Hennessy Focus Fund (HFCSX) -- which is an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 award winner -- keeps outperforming by making big bets on its three portfolio managers' best ideas.The $2.2 billion mutual fund's 0.27% return year-to-date, going into Tuesday, tops 90% of its midcap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. That pack averaged a 3.83% loss. The S&P 500 is up 0.20%. And the fund is in the top 1% of its peer group over the past five years and top 7% over the past three years.Hennessy Focus aims to keep 60% to 80% of its assets in its top-10 holdings. The mutual fund's top 10 accounted for 63.5% of assets as of Dec. 31. And with its focused approach, the portfolio held only 21 names.The average IBD Composite Rating of the portfolio is a strong 75. Eleven of the fund's stocks have Comp Ratings of 80 or higher.Two holdings, Alphabet (GOOGL) and O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY), are in the IBD 50.Car-parts store chain O'Reilly is the fund's top holding, with a 9.8% weighting. O'Reilly illustrates another one of Hennessy Focus' key traits -- sticking with its bets. O'Reilly has been in the portfolio for more than 10 years. The company had about 1,300 stores when the fund opened its current stake, says manager Brian Macauley. Now it has more than 4,400, a lineup that could expand to as many as 7,000, Macauley says.In addition, the company has a lot of buying power compared with many of its smaller competitor. Its distribution system can provide faster delivery of critical parts. Same-day delivery enables repair shops to complete repairs that day, leading to customer satisfaction and faster billing, Macauley adds.EPS had grown over 20% annually over the past 10 years as of Dec. 31, with the stock appreciating at a similar pace, he says, adding, ""We also like company management.""Macauley, David Rainey and Ira Rothberg have run the fund since about mid-2009. The fund has held its stake in American Tower (AMT) since Q2 1998.Trading around 100, now-No. 2 holding American Tower is forming a potential handle with a 103 buy point.For years it has benefited from demand for more wireless bandwidth and for improved connectivity. Demand continues to grow. ""As the largest cell tower operator, they are well-positioned to facilitate that capacity growth,"" Macauley said.Earnings per share grew 6%, 14% and 15% in the past three quarters.The fund first bought specialty insurer Markel (MKL) in April 1997, at fund inception, adding since then.Most insurers lose money on their underwriting and aim for a profit from investments. Markel also profits on its underwriting, Macauley says.""Markel is sometimes referred to as a baby Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA),"" Macauley said, referring to the diversified company run by legendary investor Warren Buffett. ""Like Berkshire, Markel invests a lot of its float (from insurance premiums) in public companies instead of just plain-vanilla fixed income. It also invests in privately owned businesses, as does Berkshire Hathaway. So the business is very thoughtfully run, and it is a fraction of the size of Berkshire, so they don't have the law of large numbers working against them. They have a lot of opportunity in front of them because of relatively small scale.""Markel EPS grew 39% and 76% in the past two quarters. The stock is forming a new base after a failed breakout.

462,O,"When oil bulls are cheering the commodity's rebound, here's what investors in leveraged ETFs are likely to say: Supersize it.A short-term energy rally is a big-time opportunity for investors in these exchange traded funds.Take, for instance, Direxion Daily S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production Bull 3X Shares (GUSH). GUSH vaulted 76% in the past month ended March 24. Over the same period, United States Oil (USO), the largest energy commodity ETF, jumped 17%.Traders and investors aren't just looking to oil and gas stocks to generate alpha. They're also looking to emerging markets -- many of which are major oil-producing nations whose fates are intertwined with the commodity.Direxion Daily Russia Bull 3X (RUSL), Direxion Daily Emerging Markets 3X (EDC) and Direxion Daily India Bull 3X (INDL) are up 41%, 32% and 31%, respectively, in the past month.""These funds have been highly impacted by trends in the crude oil market,"" said Sylvia Jablonski, a managing director at Direxion. They're also benefiting from a more dovish Fed stance of late that has weakened the U.S. dollar (in which oil is globally priced), she added.There are 243 inverse and leveraged ETFs on the stock market today, up from 103 in 2008, according to Morningstar Inc. Assets in leveraged ETFs totaled $18.71 billion in 2015, up 58% from 2008.  Investors poured $5.81 billion in new money into leveraged ETFs in 2015.Investors can use geared -- leveraged and inverse -- ETFs to both express a bullish or bearish view of the markets and to offset risk in their portfolios.The key to successful investing with these products is to start with a fact-based, confident view of what's going to happen in the markets, said Michael Sapir, president of ProShares.""They're not for mom-and-pop investors,"" Sapir said. ""They're for more knowledgeable investors who want to enhance returns or hedge portfolios.""ProShares Ultra Oil & Gas Exploration & Production (UOP) allows an investor to increase portfolio returns in a rising energy market. It offers performance that is two times (2x) the daily performance of the underlying index.The converse holds true with an inverse ETF. ProShares Short Oil & Gas (DDG), for example, gives investors a return when the energy market is going down.An inverse ETF such as DDG can also be used to protect a portfolio or part of a portfolio. An investor can combine it with a long position in, say, Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) to mitigate risk.Leveraged and inverse ETFs come in different multiples. DDG has a negative one (-1x) correlation to the benchmark. Other inverse products are 2x or 3x, which means that when their index goes down 1%, they're up 2% or 3%.""It's important to note that the opposite is true, too,"" Sapir said. ""These funds go down in the same proportion (when the market is up) as they go up when the market is down.""Keep in mind that leveraged and inverse ETFs are not set-it-and-forget-it types of investments. They require a proactive approach to investing.Investors should understand how these funds work. The vast majority have a one-day investment objective. They seek returns that are either 3x, 2x, -1x, -2x or -3x the return of an index or other benchmark for a single day.The actual performance for periods greater than a day can vary from the daily multiple.With GUSH for example, if you have a bullish one-month view of the energy sector, ""you shouldn't expect to receive three times the performance of that (one-month) period,"" Jablonski said.Due to the compounding of daily returns, a geared ETF's returns over periods other than one day will likely differ in amount and possibly direction from the benchmark return for the same period, according to ProShares.However, the daily rebalance and compounding mechanisms mean that these ETFs perform extremely well in trending markets.""You're essentially benefiting from the additional exposure,"" said Jablonski.On the flip side, a volatile or nontrending market can be a challenge.""Range-bound volatility tends to decay the fund,"" Jablonski added. ""The investor has to be very cautious and actively manage the fund. Trades tend to be shorter term.""Traders and investors may also want to monitor these specialized funds' liquidity. For example, UOP and DDG are thinly traded funds with meager assets.USO was falling on the stock market today and seems to be losing recent momentum.Image provided by Shutterstock.

463,O,"If you ever need proof of how traditional market forces can get turned upside down, look no further than the auto parts retail sector, where leaders like O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY) continue to churn out strong financial and share price growth despite what would normally be a big threat to business.Normally, one would think auto parts retailers would worry in the wake of last year's robust market for new car sales. In the past, a rise in new car sales would have been bad news for the aftermarket auto parts business. New cars require less maintenance and repair work than older ones, meaning there is less demand for the kind of parts and services supplied by O’Reilly, as well as rivals such as AutoZone (AZO), Advance Auto Parts (AAP) and Genuine Parts (GPC).But that dynamic no longer applies, analysts say.""The kinds of things that benefit new vehicle sales -- an improving economy, improving employment, higher income -- also benefit the auto parts sector,"" CRT Capital Group analyst Ali Faghri told IBD.The figures might seem daunting. In 2015, the U.S. auto industry posted sales of 17.5 million light vehicles, according to the Automotive News Data Center, breaking the previous record of 17.4 million set in 2000 and marking a 5.7% increase from 2014.But a rise in new car sales doesn’t necessarily mean older cars end up at the junkyard. Thanks to advances in technology, cars last much longer nowadays.So when someone buys a new car, chances are his old car will be resold instead of junked. It’s not unusual for vehicles with 120,000 miles or more to make their way onto used car lots.This trend has led to an ever-aging fleet of cars in the U.S. The average age of cars on the road is a record 11.5 years, according to industry researcher IHS Automotive. That figure is expected to creep up to 11.6 years in 2016.The obvious benefit to auto parts retailers is that as cars get older, they require more replacement parts, as well as repair and maintenance services. This feeds demand for the industry’s Do-It-Yourself (DIY) segment, which targets home mechanics; as well as the ""Do-It-For-Me"" segment that targets professional technicians and installers.The sector has also gotten a lift from the improving economy and job market, which have given many consumers more cash to spend on replacement parts and repairs.Meanwhile, O’Reilly and its peers have benefited from lower gasoline prices, which encourage people to drive more.""Low and declining gas prices are helping boost vehicles miles traveled -- leading to failure- and maintenance-related part sales -- and leading low-end DIY consumers to spend more on discretionary items for their vehicles,"" Wedbush analyst Seth Basham noted in a research report to clients.It all adds up to a robust market for O’Reilly. The company’s stock price trades near 269 and has been creeping back up toward the high of 277.96 set in late October. Shares have risen about 6% since the beginning of the year.Financially, O’Reilly is in the midst of a years-long streak of double-digit earnings growth, helped by a stock repurchase program that began more than four years ago. Revenue has risen in double digits the last four quarters.The company earned $2.19 a share during the 2015 fourth quarter. That was up 24% from the prior year and well above consensus estimates. Revenue gained 10% to $1.95 billion, slightly above views. Comparable-store sales increased 7.7% vs. a 6.3% rise during the third quarter.""Both our professional and DIY sides of the business were strong contributors to our comparable-store sales growth, with professional being slightly higher,"" O’Reilly Chief Executive Greg Henslee said on a conference call with analysts. ""For 2016, we expect to see positive tailwinds from continued modest improvements in total employment and low gas prices.""Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect O’Reilly to grow full-year EPS 16% in 2016 and another 13% in 2017.For all of 2015, O’Reilly’s comparable-store sales rose 7.5% -- the biggest annual gain since it grew comps 8.8% in 2010. O’Reilly opened 209 stores in 2015, bringing the total store count to 4,571 at year's end. It plans to open another 210 stores this year.""DIY market share gains have accelerated, and this is adding a new leg to same store-sales growth, which could lead to earnings upside,"" JPMorgan analyst Christopher Horvers said in a report.Many of those market share gains have come at the expense of Advance Auto, he says, especially in East Coast markets.Because the fourth quarter includes parts of the winter season -- when cars tend to undergo more wear and tear -- O’Reilly and other parts retailers benefit when the weather is severe. That wasn’t the case during much of the 2015 fourth quarter, however.""While O’Reilly noted that its retail business suffered slightly in November due to abnormally warm weather, pressuring demand for products like anti-freeze, it successfully captured this demand in December as temperatures fell,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Scot Ciccarelli noted in a report. ""Management believes winter weather has been fairly neutral to its business.""

466,O,"Taking on Amazon.com’s (AMZN) Echo, Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google previewed an artificial intelligence-powered, voice-activated home device at its Google I/O developer’s conference Wednesday.While Apple (AAPL) has Siri, its AI-based digital assistant for iPhones, it has yet to introduce a home hub device. Amazon, though, has sold an estimated 3 million Echo home hubs.“Credit to the team at Amazon for creating a lot of excitement in this space,” Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in his I/O keynote speech Wednesday.Google Home, designed for music streaming and other entertainment, features built-in search capabilities. The “virtual agent” answers simple questions and carries out basic tasks.Google did not discuss pricing. Google said it expects multiple devices to be used in homes. The Google Home product was code-named “Project Chirp.”Google Home apparently was not developed by Nest Labs, the smart-home-device startup that it bought in 2014. Google Home, however, is expected to communicate with Nest products and Android-based devices.Google also unveiled a new messenging app called “Allo” at the developer’s conference, which runs through Friday at the Mountain View, Calif., Shoreline Amphitheater, near Alphabet headquarters.In a recent letter to Google shareholders, Pichai touted plans for artificial intelligence.While Apple and Google have dominated in the world of mobile apps, there could be more competition down the road. Facebook (FB) recently introduced “chatbots,” while Microsoft (MSFT) launched its “Bot Framework” software tools for developers. Both rely on AI.Wednesday, Google did not unveil a virtual reality headset to compete with Facebook’s Oculus Rift, as some observers had speculated. But Google did introduce a VR headset and controller reference design, called Daydream, for third-party developers.Google said Android N,  the new version of its mobile operating system, will have a VR mode. And the company said Samsung, HTC and Xiaomi will sell Daydream-ready mobile phones.Google stock was down a fraction, near 718, in afternoon trading in the stock market today, and shares have traded below the key 50-day moving average since the company posted disappointing Q1 earnings in late April

467,O,"Oil could hit $50 a barrel in the second half of the year as crude has swung from near saturation to a supply deficit, though it should swing back to a surplus next year, Goldman Sachs said, clouding the outlook for a recovery in drilling.The switch happened ""much earlier than we expected,"" according to a note issued late Sunday. It also marks a big turnaround for Goldman, which predicted last year oil could hit $20 a barrel. Other analysts were even more bearish, with Britain’s Standard Charter warning earlier this year that oil could hit $10 a barrel.But Goldman now says the market ""likely shifted into deficit in May"" in a ""sudden halt to the oil market surplus.” It lifted its Q2 U.S. crude price outlook to $45 a barrel from $35 forecast in March and sees it reaching $50 later this year, up from an earlier prediction of $45.U.S. crude climbed 3.3% to settle at $47.72 a barrel, the highest since early November. Brent crude rose 2.4% to $48.97.Exxon Mobil (XOM) shares closed up 1% on the stock market today. BP (BP) shares rose 1.9%. Chevron (CVX) added 1.5%. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) jumped 2.8%.The analysts said stronger vehicle sales and a larger harvest is boosting demand in Russia and India. Supply disruptions out of Nigeria are also supporting prices and easing market saturation, though that will be offset by increased production out of Iran and Iraq.But the oil supply deficit Goldman now sees is expected to be short-lived, as analysts expect inventories will fall more gradually than previously expected and see oil swinging back to surplus in the first quarter of 2017.For 2017, Goldman sees West Texas crude at $45 per barrel in the first quarter, down from $55 a barrel in estimated in March, but still hitting $60 per barrel in the fourth quarter.While the prospect of a return to oil at $50 this year may make drilling profitable again, another oil surplus and dip in prices could keep producers on the sidelines for another year.Oil companies have said in recent months they want prices to stay at $50 or $60 consistently before they resume drilling. Continental Resources (CLR) CEO Harold Hamm said on the earnings call earlier this month it “will be some time before we think about bringing on more rigs.”At an industry conference in March, EOG Resources (EOG) CEO Bill Thomas said that the company won’t be in a rush to boost production when oil hits $60.Shares of Continental finished up 2%, and EOG added 2.6%.And even an uptick in prices this year is a little too late for some oil companies as more file for bankruptcy protection.Breitburn Energy Partners LP (BBEP) and SandRidge Energy both filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, joining Magnum Hunter Resources, Energy XXI, Goodrich Petroleum and others that haven't been able to survive the lower oil prices. Breitburn filed Chapter 11 on Sunday, while SandRidge did so early Monday.

470,O,"As an investor, you know the stock market is cyclical. But intellectually understanding that bull markets are followed by bears is not the same as actually living through a Wall Street crash and watching the value of your portfolio decline, sometimes sharply.That’s when a mutual fund investor’s discipline and patience can get tested -- but also rewarded over time, as the performance of the Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards recipients shows.The 2008 bear market was a prime example. Following a powerful bull cycle that began in March 2003, the financial and housing crisis triggered a downturn that saw the S&P 500 decline 58% from the peak in October 2007 to the bottom in March 2009.The top-performing stocks in the prior bull market suffered similar fates. Apple (AAPL) fell 61% from the end of December 2007 through January 2009, while Google, now known as Alphabet (GOOGL), lost 67% of its value from November 2007 until finding its footing in November 2008.When you buy and sell individual stocks, you are your own fund manager. It’s up to you to actively manage risk and reduce your exposure in a market downturn since the leaders in the prior bull cycle typically do not bounce back to lead in the next one.The cardinal rule for protecting your positions in individual stocks is to cut all losses at no more than 7%-8%.But when you invest in mutual funds, you’re relying on a professional money manager to oversee and adjust the portfolio as needed over time.So when investing in a fund to achieve a long-term goal, such as retirement or college savings for a young child, your best bet is to buy right and sit tight.As IBD founder William J. O’Neil wrote in his classic book, “How To Make Money In Stocks,"" ""a well-selected, diversified domestic growth-stock fund run by an established management organization will, in time, always recover from the steep corrections that naturally occur during bear markets. The reason mutual funds come back is that they are broadly diversified and generally participate in each recovery cycle in the U.S. economy.”The table, below, listing the 10-year returns of the top five growth funds from 2006 to 2015 proves that point.As you would expect in a severe bear market, even these long-term, top-performing funds showed a decline in 2008 –  from 25% to 46%.But look at the cumulative 10-year returns. Investors who sat tight in 2008 saw overall gains of 205% to 240% from 2006 to 2015, more than making up for the 2008 decline and more than doubling the S&P 500’s 102% rise during the same period.As a fund’s prospectus always says, past performance is not a guarantee of future results. But checking a mutual fund’s long-term track record – through both bull and bear markets – gives you insight into the management team’s ability to manage risk while also generating growth.Take for instance the Eaton Vance Atlanta Capital SMID-Cap I Fund (EISMX), which had the smallest decline in 2008 among the top 5 growth funds.Fund co-manager William Bell told IBD, “We prepare for a bear market before it happens. … Our entire process is basically built around finding companies that are going to grow at an above-average rate, but also provide a lot of downside protection when things fall apart.”Bell added that he looks for stocks like O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY) that have a “counter-cyclical component” to them. Key to that is checking the company’s long-term earnings record, particularly during weak economies.“If a company is able to grow through a recession,” Bell said, “we have pretty good confidence that the stock is also going to do better than the rest of the market during a recession.”The strategy of Bell and his co-managers and their focus on so-called “steady-Eddie” companies is reminiscent of a certain legendary investor. “If you look at what we do,” Bell noted, “it’s almost exactly what Warren Buffett does, just in the small- and mid-cap space.”Dollar cost averaging – i.e., regularly investing a set amount of money in a mutual fund regardless of market conditions – can be an effective way for investors to protect themselves against market fluctuations.Rather than try to time the market and make a large investment in one lump sum at just the right moment, you increase your holdings incrementally, typically on a monthly basis.So during a bear market, you’re buying shares in the fund at a lower price, helping to hold down your average cost-per-share and increase your returns over time.Image provided by Shutterstock.

473,O,"When James Madison rose to address the Virginia Ratifying Convention in June 1788, he must have looked like a 98-pound weakling going up against a heavyweight boxing champion.His opponent: Patrick Henry -- legendary patriot, fiery orator and unwavering opponent of the new federal Constitution. The delegates had assembled in Richmond to decide whether Virginia, then the nation’s largest state, would join America's new central government.Henry’s fierce opposition to the Stamp Act tax that Britain tried to force on its North American colonies in 1765 made him famous. A decade later, his “Give me liberty, or give me death!” speech in favor of American independence made him a legend.In contrast, the voice of Madison (1751-1836) barely carried a room, never mind a convention hall. At the convention in Richmond, one of the 168 delegates who took notes commented several times that the future president was inaudible when speaking.“His voice did not carry well,” Richard Brookhiser, senior editor at National Review and author of “James Madison,” a 2011 biography, told IBD. “One person described it as croaking.”In contrast to the intense Henry, Madison -- who was born on March 16, 265 years ago -- was seen as reserved and withdrawn, though his close friends described him as warm, witty and a great teller of bawdy jokes in private. A bookworm, he was more comfortable studying law and history than speaking to crowds or schmoozing with fellow politicians.Addressing the delegates, Henry gave impassioned speeches, warning them that the Constitution risked trampling on the liberty for which so many Americans had given their lives in the War of Independence against Britain.“I see great jeopardy in this new government,” Henry said. “I see none from our present one.”He continued: “This Constitution is said to have beautiful features, but when I come to examine these features, sir, they appear to me horribly frightful. Among other deformities, it has an awful squinting. It squints toward monarchy, and does not this raise indignation in the breast of every true American?”A strong central government, commanded by a chief executive, would lead to dictatorship, oppression and tyranny, he argued.“Away with your president!” Henry bellowed. “We shall have a king. The army will salute him monarch; your militia will leave you, and assist in making him king, and fight against you. And what have you to oppose this force? What will then become of you and your rights? Will not absolute despotism ensue?”In contrast, Madison, at 5 feet 4 inches, was hardly a towering figure. But he had one huge advantage: He was prepared.“He doesn’t try to beat Henry on rhetoric,” Brookhiser said. “The way he makes his mark is by his mastery of detail.”An expert on ancient history, constitutions of the past and recent history, Madison was one of Virginia’s representatives in the Continental Congress from 1780 to 1783. He saw firsthand the failings of the Articles of Confederation, America's first try at a national government.Congress had no taxing power. It could only ask the states for money, and they often refused to pay up -- even to support America’s military during the Revolutionary War. In 1783, the last year of the conflict, Madison and other congressmen were forced to flee the national capital of Philadelphia for Annapolis after angry veterans mutinied, demanding payment for their war service.Each state -- large or small -- had one vote in Congress. There had to be unanimous agreement for the government to take action, making obstructionism all too easy.Squabbles between states over trade, boundaries and even their own currencies left the nation dangerously exposed to divide-and-conquer tactics of hostile foreign powers. Even worse: Debts to these foreign powers went unpaid.After Shays' Rebellion, a 1786 tax revolt against state and local governments in Massachusetts, Madison and others acted. He helped convince retired Gen. George Washington to lend his immense prestige to founding a new government.At the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in 1787, Madison drafted the Virginia Plan, a strongly nationalist agenda that put all the power in Congress. It called for a bicameral legislature based on proportional representation. Both houses elected the president and picked the judiciary. Congress also had the power to veto state laws.His plan wasn’t adopted. He was disappointed in the Great Compromise that led to proportional representation in the House of Representatives and two votes per state in the Senate. Yet his ideas set the convention’s overall agenda.Madison also was one of the few Philadelphia delegates to attend every day. He was a voracious note-taker during the convention, resulting in him being the most informed delegate. (Henry boycotted the Philadelphia convention, saying he “smelt a rat.”)Nine of the 13 states had to ratify the Constitution in order for it to become law. The document called for state conventions to ratify it, circumventing state governments, which were suspicious that the document was a power grab at their expense.In 1787-88, as a member of the lame-duck Continental Congress in New York, Madison, along with Alexander Hamilton and John Jay, anonymously wrote “The Federalist Papers.” This was a vigorous defense of the Constitution to persuade New York to ratify it over the opposition of its powerful governor, George Clinton.Though Hamilton wrote most of the papers, Madison penned the influential “Federalist 51,” which explains the checks and balances between the different branches of government.Madison originally intended to skip the Virginia Ratifying Convention, but he changed his mind after learning that Henry had whipped up powerful opposition to the Constitution.Standing before the Virginia delegates in that midpoint of 1788, Madison overcame his shortcomings and took the fight to Henry.“He informs us that the people of the country are at perfect repose, that is, every man enjoys the fruits of his labor peaceably and securely, and that everything is in perfect tranquility and safety,” Madison said. “I wish sincerely, sir, this were true. If this be their happy situation, why has every state acknowledged the contrary?”Pushing ahead, Madison showed that the national government as it then stood was deeply flawed -- and the nation needed change.“Why were deputies from all the states sent to the general convention?” he continued. “Why have complaints of national and individual distresses been echoed and reechoed throughout the continent?”Point by point, clause by clause, Madison firmly and calmly defended the document he had helped create, exposing Henry’s arguments as emotional, irrational and unsound.After several weeks of debate, Virginia narrowly voted, 89-79, to become the 10th – and largest – state to back the Constitution.“Madison was able to win because the bulk of the undecided voters found him trustworthy and found his arguments more compelling,” said Michael Signer, mayor of Charlottesville, Va., and author of “Becoming Madison: The Extraordinary Origins of the Least Likely Founding Father.”Defeated, an embittered Henry got his revenge: In 1789, he convinced Virginia’s legislature to block Madison’s election to the U.S. Senate. Instead, Madison won a seat in the House of Representatives, defeating future President James Monroe.Henry later spurned offers to become secretary of state, attorney general and a Supreme Court justice, though he eventually supported the Constitution toward the end of his life.Madison’s work wasn’t done. Initially he was skeptical about the need for a Bill of Rights, but after hearing complaints from Henry and others, including close friend Thomas Jefferson, Madison changed tack.In 1789, during the first Congress, Madison introduced 12 amendments to the Constitution, including ones protecting free speech, free exercise of religion and a prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures.A legislative wizard, he pushed them through Congress, and by 1791 the states had ratified 10 of these amendments, now known collectively as the Bill of Rights.But in those crucial days when he fought for the law of the land, Madison’s ultimate triumph as Father of the Constitution can be summed up this way: Do your homework.“You’re talking about a guy who was always prepared,” said David O. Stewart, author of “Madison’s Gift.” “He was never outworked. He always was ready. That was a huge part of what success he had.”Father of the Constitution, fourth U.S. president.Overcame: Lackluster public speaking skill.Lesson: Outwork your opponents by doing your homework well ahead of time.“Knowledge will forever govern ignorance; and a people who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives.”

476,O,"Yes, photo ops have been evolving since the camera's invention. The advent of television news added movement. But fake ""news events"" designed simply to attract news cameras and garner free publicity have come to dominate and deteriorate American politics more every year, draining most semblance of serious substance.Barack Obama used photo ops endlessly when he was president, often flying four hours round-trip at $210K an hour for a 20-minute photo-op to inform workers that hundreds of thousands of jobs were due any minute due to his trillion-dollar stimulus program.If not run right, however, photo ops can suddenly turn on a politician and bite their South Side -- in front of the same leering cameras. Ask Hillary Clinton after her awkward Thursday experience attempting to enter the New York City subway.Clinton's had Secret Service chauffeurs for 23 years now. She hasn't driven a car this century. She prohibits traveling press from photographing her boarding chartered private jets.But with the New York primary just 11 days away and another elderly ex-New Yorker undermining her sure-fire, now lame nomination campaign by winning six of the last seven contests, millionairess Clinton wanted to look like a regular person. So, she shunned the limo and charter jet.The former first lady, former Arkansas first lady, former senator, former failed presidential candidate and former secretary of State planned to take a well-guarded ride on the No. 4 train from 161st Street in the Bronx. Key words: well-guarded.Such events are -- or should be -- pre-planned by advance people with the candidate fully briefed on what to do and expect. Everything must run smooth and normal like a Rolex watch, not a Clinton trademark this cycle.So, Clinton walked up to the subway turnstile holding the MetroCard someone bought for her. She swiped it at the fare reader. And.......nothing. Again. Nothing. Again. Nothing. Again. Nothing.Cameras captured the painful scene as the woman who jokes about wiping her private email server with a cloth looked like a puzzled yutz.Finally, on the fifth try Clinton gained entry, confident in the knowledge her straight face would appear in this photo, not her five tries.Clinton waited on the platform, just like you would, except for all the guards. A train arrived. The woman who earned a minimum quarter-million per speech boarded with her entire entourage and went for a ride.Had this been one of those obviously disconnected, rich Republican candidates stumped by apparent ignorance of an everyday experience we'd be hearing about the hilarious, mortifying, disastrous scene all weekend. And well beyond.You'd be treated to endless talk-show jokes about the GOP candidate seeking an F train to tee time at the country club.Remember all the mocking of President George H.W. Bush in the 1992 campaign against another Clinton when the chief executive asked a proud showroom clerk how this newly-invented grocery scanner worked? Or the non-stop laughter five years ago when Sarah Palin noted, accurately, that a captured Paul Revere also notified the British that the Minutemen were coming.Don't hold your breath for late-night laughs at this Democrat's expense.Tag-along media did cover the Bronx ineptness Thursday, but quickly added all kinds of helpful excuses and distracting details. Politico, for instance, noted her struggle with ""those flimsy New York subway cards."" But reassured readers that Clinton pressed on ""undeterred."" Impressive courage under pressure.Then, quickly, the story switched to how Bernie Sanders, who lives in Vermont, didn't know New York's subway abandoned tokens 13 years ago. Which presumably proves something.Yahoo News helpfully explained for Clinton that other New Yorkers have had trouble with those darned subway cards and even dragged in vocal opposition to Ted Cruz' Bronx visit. Which had nothing to do with the subway, but shifted the subject off Clinton onto a Republican.You won't be surprised now to learn that the classic, modern photo op seemingly gone bad also centered on a Republican, Vice President Dan Quayle. He was photographed in an inner-city classroom holding up a spelling-bee sign mis-spelling the word ""p-o-t-a-t-o-e.""What a dummy, all the reporters reported eagerly. And the photo proved it.Trouble was, the mis-spelled word card was written by the teacher. Rather than embarrass the woman, Quayle took the hit.RELATED:

478,O,"EOG Resources (EOG) has been injecting cheap natural gas into some of its existing wells as the shale producer looks to extract more oil at low costs amid the prolonged slump in crude markets.The top oil producer in Texas said in its first-quarter conference call Friday that it had successful trials of its natgas process in 15 mature horizontal wells in the Eagle Ford in south Texas. EOG plans to add another pilot project later this year that includes 32 producing wells.Management expects the method to increase recoveries from oil reservoirs and reduce the rate of decline in production, while keeping operating costs low. But the company cautioned that the new method may not work in other shale plays with different geologic properties.EOG shares closed down less than 0.1% in the stock market today, as crude futures fell.The company has been working on the new process for three years but management wouldn't go into detail about how exactly it works.James Williams, an economist at WTRG, said that the enhanced recovery process is likely similar to a water or CO2 flood, where liquid or gas is pumped in a well, mixes with oil to add pressure, and pushes oil toward wells at the other end of a field to be pumped out.""What they are effectively doing is using natgas to push more oil out to the surface, which is more valuable than the gas,"" he said.Natgas is three and a half to four times cheaper than oil and enjoys low transport costs, because it's already produced near oil wells. Water, meanwhile, is more expensive, and water floods don't work that well in shale formations, Williams said.Even when natgas comes off its historically low prices, EOG thinks it would still see ""incremental benefit and good economics"" up to $5 per million BTUs for natgas, which is currently trading at about $2.10 per million BTUs.The new process comes as companies like EOG look to delay new drilling until oil prices recover. Despite a 20% rally in oil prices last month and a 60% gain from lows reached earlier this year, drilling activity continues to slump.Continental Resources (CLR) CEO Harold Hamm said last week the company wouldn't start drilling again until oil hits $60. EOG said it would take sustained oil prices of $60-$65 per barrel and 12 months of lead time for the industry to modestly grow production. Management said on the call that the company could produce more at a lower price but didn’t give a level at which it would resume drilling.Continental Resources shares dipped 0.1%.

His dreams were often met with naysayers.“People often ask me if I know the secret of success and if I could tell others how to make their dreams come true,” Disney said in “The Quotable Walt Disney.”  “My answer is, you do it by working.”And he knew exactly where he wanted to apply his work: bringing joy to people through entertainment. “Most of my life I have done what I wanted to do,” he said. “I have had fun on the job. I have never been able to confine that fun to office hours.”Emerging out of Disney’s imagination came Mickey Mouse and other cartoon characters, then the first full-length animated movie, ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,” setting the standard for all others to come.Then came his landmark, utopian theme parks, Disneyland and Walt Disney World.Among his many honors, Disney received seven Emmys and 22 Academy Awards. In 1964 he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom.In the half-century since his death, Disney’s philosophy is still paying dividends, on screen and in the parks: “We keep moving forward -- opening up new doors and doing new things -- because we’re curious. ... We’re always exploring and experimenting. We call it Imagineering -- the blending of creative imagination with technical know-how.”For example, a roughly 14-acre ""Star Wars""-themed land was announced last year and is currently under construction at Disneyland Resort and Walt Disney World.“If Walt had one great gift, it was that he kept his head down and kept trying,” nephew and longtime senior Disney executive Roy Disney said in “How to Be Like Walt,” by Pat Williams with Jim Denney. “Over the years, he was told that his ideas were impractical, impossible and would never work.... Walt proved the only way to get things done is by sticking to your ideas and your beliefs.”Walt Disney’s wife, Lillian, with whom he had two daughters, said, ""(He) just wouldn’t give up if he thought he was right.”“Above all, Walt was one of the great storytellers ever to walk on the face of the earth,"" Williams told IBD. ""He could get his people, his staff, so excited with his pure ability to tell stories about upcoming projects, like his movies or theme parks.”Walter Elias Disney was born in Chicago and raised in Missouri.His mother and father instilled a solid work ethic in him. But early on, when Walt showed in interest in drawing, his dad called it a waste of time.“He scoffed at me” and contended that wanting to become a commercial artist was foolish, Disney recalled. His dad said he should get a “real job,” suggesting an opening in a jelly factory.Another naysayer was Walt’s fourth-grade teacher, who admonished him during a class sketching assignment, “Flowers do not have faces!”But they did to Walt, and his imagination could not be bridled or discouraged.After graduating from high school, he then spent a year in art school before joining the Red Cross during World War I as an ambulance driver in France.He returned to Missouri and became a working commercial cartoon artist. When he was introduced to animation, his career focus changed. Instead of drawing stationary cartoons, he immersed himself in the study of making ones that moved.In 1922, Disney started Laugh-O-Gram Films, raising $15,000 -- over $150,000 in today’s money -- from investors. Disney secured an $11,000 contract to produce cartoons; but after six of them, the client went bankrupt. Disney’s company was close to folding, too, but stayed afloat with a smaller client.Walt reinvested his money into developing his own series, called “Alice Comedies,” which featured a live-action little girl in a cartoon world.“In order to crack the field, I said, 'I’ve got to get something a little unique,’ ” Disney recalled.But he ran out of money and had to file for bankruptcy protection. He was able to keep a movie camera and his unfinished Alice film as he headed to a new start in Los Angeles in 1923.There he opened a studio and connected with film distributor Margaret Winkler. She liked the Alice film and offered a contract for six of them at $1,500 (worth $21,000 now) apiece.Realizing that he needed additional startup capital and financial business guidance, Walt turned to his older brother, Roy, who invested what money he had and persuaded an uncle to contribute some, too. What would become Walt Disney Co. was founded in October 1923 as Disney Bros. Studio.Walt fired himself as an animator in 1925, seeking out better artists. He focused on his talents for producing, directing and leading his company.“Walt’s enthusiasm made overachievers of us all,” said Disney film editor Norman Palmer, who joined Disney in 1940. “If it hadn’t been for Walt, there would have been a lot of times we would have settled for less than our best. But Walt made us believe we could do better.”In 1927 Winkler’s husband, film distributor Charles Mintz, approached Disney for a cartoon series featuring a rabbit. Disney and animator Ub Iwerks created “Oswald the Lucky Rabbit,” but Walt unknowingly signed away ownership of the character.The series was a hit, then Mintz drastically cut Disney’s pay for the cartoons. He threatened Disney that if he didn’t agree to the new terms, he’d raid Disney’s animators.Disney refused and came up with a new cartoon character that would trump Mintz and everyone else.Disney created and owned Mortimer Mouse. After Lillian frowned on the name, Mortimer became Mickey.Within eight months, Mickey Mouse was on his way to becoming a worldwide cartoon phenomenon, and Disney and his studio were on top.“No matter how bad things seemed, Walt believed in himself, his product and his future,” Williams said.Said Disney: “I thought of (Mickey) from the first as a distinct individual, not just a cartoon type or symbol going through a comedy routine.”Mickey’s legions of fans included President Franklin Roosevelt and England’s King George V. Disney received a special medal from the League of Nations in 1935, recognizing Mickey as “a symbol of universal goodwill.”After conquering the cartoon world with Mickey, then the musical cartoon series “Silly Symphonies,” Disney in 1934 decided to make the Brothers Grimm fairy tale, “Snow White,” into the first animated feature film.It was considered a huge financial gamble that could bankrupt the studio. Roy and Lillian tried to talk him out of it.They couldn't budge Walt, who mortgaged everything to see his dream through.His overriding message to his animators was always: “Until a character becomes a personality, it cannot be believed.... Unless people are able to identify themselves with the character, its actions will seem unreal. And without personality, a story cannot ring true to the audience.”Disney spared no effort or expense in providing his animators everything they needed to make the film visually stunning.Orlando Ferrante, a Disney theme park designer, said, “Walt has a simple philosophy: 'Get the job done, but never sacrifice quality.’ He often told us, 'You worry about the quality. Let me worry about the cost.’ ”“Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs” came out in 1937 and was a smash hit, artistically and commercially. Now the Disney name had even more magic, and animated feature films “Pinocchio,” “Fantasia,” “Dumbo,” “Bambi” and “Cinderella” followed. Not all were financial successes, but that didn’t stop Disney from continuing to make them artistic ones.While the brand was strong, the studio was again deep in debt by 1948. What to do?Another idea had been germinating in Disney’s head, something that would become his most lasting legacy: a utopian theme park.Again, he was met with naysayers, including Roy, who called it a “screwball idea” that would take the company down.Disney forged ahead anyway, again mortgaging everything. He sold his dream to the American Broadcasting Company, which became an investor and sponsor.The result was Disneyland, which opened in July 1955 in Anaheim, Calif.“Walt was a risk-taker at the highest level,” Williams said. “He would have been bored to death if he wasn’t taking these highflying risks. He had thought them through, yet everyone around him said they were going to be disasters.”“Almost everyone warned us that Disneyland would be a ... spectacular failure,” Disney said. “But they were thinking about an amusement park, and we believed in our idea -- a family park where parents and children could have fun -- together.... Disneyland is a work of love. We didn’t go into Disneyland just with the idea of making money.”He put it this way: “We are selling happiness.”The next huge theme park was Walt Disney World, which opened in Orlando, Fla., in 1971, five years after Walt died. As for ABC? Disney now owns it.Disney encouraged everyone to pursue dreams, no matter how overwhelming they may be. He offered a perspective about all he had done and where he began: “I only hope that we never lose sight of one thing -- that it was all started by a mouse.”Opened Disneyland in 1955.Overcame: Numerous setbacks and naysayers.Lesson: Follow your heart.“Get a good idea and stay with it.... Work at it until it’s done, and done right.... All our dreams can come true -- if we have the courage to pursue them.”""Courage is the main quality of leadership. Courage to initiate something and keep it going, a pioneering spirit, an adventurous spirit, the courage to blaze new ways.”“All the adversity I’ve had in my life, all my troubles and obstacles have strengthened me.”“If you can dream it, you can do it.”“I must explore and experiment.... I am never satisfied with my work.”“I still look at the world with uncontaminated wonder, and with all living things I have terrific sympathy. It was the most natural thing in the world for me to imagine that mice and squirrels might have feelings just like mine.”Related News:Walter Knott Had A Berry, Berry Good Idea For A Theme ParkDisney Reanimated: How Eisner Brought The Magic BackUb Iwerks Co-Created Mickey Mouse, Won Academy Awards

482,O,"In his classic 1960 book, “How I Made $2,000,000 In The Stock Market,” Nicolas Darvas takes readers on his journey from professional dancer to savvy investor. With an honest look at his own mistakes and missteps, he also reveals how he developed the “box theory” he used to time his buys and sells as he traveled the world from gig to gig.More than five decades later, Darvas' strategy remains an effective way to reduce your risk and increase your returns.After following the conventional wisdom of Wall Street with limited success, Darvas took a deep dive into the study of stock charts, leading to an epiphany that would dramatically change his fortunes and also influence a young William J. O’Neil, future founder of IBD and creator of the CAN SLIM Investing System.“I started to realize that stock movements were not completely haphazard,” Darvas wrote. “Stocks did not fly like balloons in any direction. As if attracted by a magnet, they had a defined upward or downward trend which, once established, tended to continue. Within this trend stocks moved in a series of frames, or what I began to call ‘boxes.’”The Darvas box is based on the concept of support (the bottom of the box) and resistance (the top of the box).As Darvas wrote, the stock “could bounce between the top and bottom of the box and I was perfectly satisfied. Once I had decided on the dimensions of the box, the stock could do what it liked, but only within that frame.”In other words, as long as the stock doesn’t materially fall through the bottom of the price range, the box remains intact.Darvas would then continue to track the stock, waiting for a “pop-goes-the-weasel” moment, where the stock punches through the top of the box to signal a buying opportunity.As long as the stock stayed within the price range outlined by the box, things were normal. But if the stock jumped out of that box in volume that was well above average, that showed a change was afoot.Darvas used a colorful analogy to make that point:“If a tempestuous beauty were to jump on the table and do a wild dance, no one would be particularly astonished. That is the sort of characteristic behavior people have come to expect from her. But if a dignified matron were suddenly to do the same, this would be unusual and people would immediately say, 'There is something strange here – something has happened.'”In September and October 2014, O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) formed a Darvas box, which could also be called a flat base. The depth of the pattern was just 8%, with a decline from 158.60 to 146.22.The auto parts retailer bolted out of that box on weekly volume that spiked 89% above average, launching a 75% gain over the next 12 months while forming additional boxes (AKA, bases).E-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) is no stranger to shipping boxes and its stock has formed a few as well.From April to May 2015, the stock formed an 11-week long consolidation, also with a depth of 8%.Like Darvas' matron-gone-wild analogy, Amazon punched through the top of the box on daily volume 56% above average, followed by another up day in trading 85% higher than normal.From there, Amazon rose over 50% in less than eight months.Excerpt from IBD Extra Newsletter.

489,O,"Bulked up with acquisitions along with favorable financial results, Hormel Foods is whetting the appetite of investors seeking juicy returns.The stars are aligned in favor of Hormel (HRL) on a few fronts. Low hog prices in its core pork business have helped lift profit margins. Demand for protein products is strong.Plus, Hormel has made a number of acquisitions that have broadened its reach, such as the 2015 purchase of Applegate Farms, the No. 1 brand in the natural and organic value-added prepared meats category. The buy has helped the company tap into growing demand for natural and organic foods from millennials to aging baby boomers, and expanded its retail channel scope.Add to that double-digit profit gains in all but one of the past 10 quarters and you have a tasty recipe for success for the maker of Skippy peanut butter, Spam lunch meats and Jennie-O Turkey. Hormel has seen its stock price soar more than 45% since its Sept. 22 low of 29.93. After a recent breakout, it now hovers in the low 40s.""The stock is performing well,"" S&P Global Market Intelligence analyst Joseph Agnese told Investor’s Business Daily, noting he has a hold rating on the stock. ""The commodity environment overall is very favorable with feed costs very low for the turkeys they raise and prices for hogs are down significantly. And they’re very well positioned in the food market (where there’s) strong demand for protein.""BB&T Capital Markets analyst Heather Jones added: ""A key driver of earnings upside and, thereby, the shares has been very significant margin expansion primarily driven by favorable input cost trends in their core pork business, their biggest segment, which sells fresh pork; bacon; pepperoni, etc. into retail and food service; and in their grocery products business with products like Spam.""Although Hormel’s turkey business was negatively impacted by the avian flu last year, it did a ""phenomenal"" job shifting products and selling them at a high margin as a result, Jones added.Recent acquisitions have helped buoy results. They include the $700 million purchase of the Skippy peanut butter business from Unilever (UL) in 2013 and the $450 million purchase of CytoSport Holdings, the maker of Muscle Milk products in 2014.Its latest buy, the $775 million purchase of Applegate Farms, was Hormel’s biggest to date.""The acquisition was perfectly aligned with our interest in adding brands that resonate with consumers that are younger and more socially engaged,"" said Chairman and Chief Executive Jeffrey Ettinger on the first-quarter conference call with analysts. ""This acquisition has also expanded our distribution into the natural and specialty foods channel that’s provided a faster path to creating a significant presence in this high growth, high margin segment.""Jones says the acquisition will help the bottom line.""But what’s important is the acknowledgment that a certain segment of the population is now focused upon where their food is coming from and how those animals were raised,"" she told IBD. ""The wellness trend, in a holistic sense, is not going away. To change a culture and build a brand and credibility in that space would have taken a lot of time and money. It was more expedient to buy a company in that space than to do it on a greenfield basis.""Agnese says, however, the Applegate buy wasn’t a game changer as much as a milestone marking where Hormel is headed.""The game changer is the company has shifted to making acquisitions of value-added products to diversify away from the historical pork and turkey commodity business and more toward a diversified packaged foods company with more stability,"" he added. ""With wider margins and more stability comes a bigger valuation multiple.""Applegate’s products are sold mostly through natural and organic foods specialty stores such as Whole Foods Market (WFM) while Hormel products are sold through traditional outlets.""Hormel can leverage the newly acquired relationship (with Applegate) to try to sell products in the natural and organic foods specialty channel,"" said Agnese. Having the Applegate brand under its umbrella will help Hormel sell products like Muscle Milk and the Hormel brands in the specialty channel, he adds.Hormel has been serving up some tasty financial results, though not all has gone smoothly. For its fiscal 2016 first quarter ended Jan. 24, earnings climbed 23% from a year earlier to 43 cents a share. Profits were up in all segments except its Jennie-O Turkey Store, which saw operating profit slip 2% from a year earlier as it continued to recover from the impact of the highly pathogenic bird flu that hit Hormel farms in Wisconsin and Minnesota midway through 2015, the company said.Total company revenue for the quarter fell 4% to $2.3 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect full-year earnings to rise 18% to $1.56 a share. They see a 5% gain in 2017 and a 9% rise in 2018.Agnese expects full-year 2016 revenue to rise 4.7% from 2015, on benefits from recent acquisitions, including Applegate Farms, he noted in a report. He estimates Applegate sales will total over $350 million in 2016.In a recent report to clients, Jones projected “relatively modest” earnings growth in 2017.""Barring a sizeable acquisition, we have difficulty discerning what factors could drive more substantial earnings growth,"" she noted.But Jones told IBD she expects Hormel to do more acquisitions.""I think they're very disciplined allocators of capital,"" she said. ""I don’t think they'll do an acquisition just to grow. It has to fit into their strength and it has to be the right price. They have challenges in growing volumes in their core business and have an excellent balance sheet. I think they'll do more acquisitions over the next few years.""

491,O,"Walt Whitman is often celebrated as America’s finest poet. But it was a different story when he was alive.Whitman (1819-92) was ridiculed and ostracized during his lifetime. His seminal work -- ""Leaves of Grass,"" a collection of free-verse poems -- was called by many obscene for its overt sexuality.Even Whitman’s family was unimpressed with his work. When he brought the first copy home, his brother George dismissed it: “I saw the book -- didn’t read it at all -- didn’t think it worth reading -- fingered it a little.""But Walt didn’t care. He was writing for those who believed, as he did, that “whatever satisfies the soul is truth.”Whitman had abandoned several occupations -- printer, teacher, editor, shopkeeper and house builder -- because he felt called to writing, in particular to writing poetry that explored nature and the self.Whitman published the first edition of ""Leaves of Grass"" with his own money in 1855, then printed, distributed and promoted it himself. He knew the poetry was shocking, but he also knew that its bluntness was the source of its power. As he once said, “All faults may be forgiven of him who has perfect candor.”Whitman was born in Huntington on Long Island. His parents had nine children, in whom they instilled many of the principles of Quakerism. Later in life, Walt would say that he accepted all faiths but believed in none.The Whitmans soon left for Brooklyn. Although Walt loved New York (and would rarely leave it until later in life), he did not see his childhood as a particularly happy one, in large part because his family struggled financially due to bad investments by his father.Walt’s formal schooling ended at age 11, when he became an office boy at a law firm. The partners there helped the youngster with his handwriting and composition and introduced him to novels and poetry. He then worked at a printing office, learning the craft of writing.At 17, he became a teacher. But though Whitman was a gifted educator, he didn’t enjoy it much; he once wrote a short story titled “Death in the School-Room (a Fact).”For the next two decades, Whitman worked at a series of teaching, editing and writing jobs in New York. He even founded his own newspaper, the Long Islander, where he performed all the jobs -- writer, editor, publisher; he even delivered the paper himself. By 1845, he had worked for at least 10 newspapers. All the while, he wrote poetry and submitted some of it to periodicals.Whitman always claimed he wasn’t really cut out to be a journalist. “My opinions are all, always, so hazy -- so slow to come,” he once said. “I am no use in any situation which calls for instant decision.”In his early 30s, Whitman decided to focus on his poetry and began writing what would become ""Leaves of Grass,"" a collection of poems using free verse with a cadence based on the Bible. He quickly printed 795 copies.Karen Karbiener, who teaches liberal studies at New York University and is a scholar of 19th century American literature with a special interest in Whitman, told IBD: “When 'Leaves of Grass' was first published in 1855, his readers didn't know what to make of Whitman's unheard-of informality with the reader (‘Listener up there!’-- he gestures toward the end of ‘Song of Myself’) and his shockingly raw, revolutionary subject matter. ... He was criticized with breaking every rule of good form and good taste -- of course, this was all intentional on his part.”It wasn’t long before the work was being criticized for celebrating love and sex in explicit and personal ways. Critics tried to get ""Leaves of Grass"" banned from libraries, and in some cases they succeeded.Whitman’s poetry also won him acclaim, especially from intellectuals, other writers and Europeans. Ralph Waldo Emerson called ""Leaves of Grass"" “the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed.”Despite creating a stir, ""Leaves of Grass"" didn’t put much money in Whitman’s pocket. So he returned to writing articles for newspapers.What was Whitman like? He had a striking physical appearance, standing 6 feet tall with graying hair and a long beard. He often wore shirts that exposed his hairy chest. He has been described as a radical egalitarian. He was well-mannered, friendly and open to learning new things. Although his poetry was enjoyed most by intellectuals, his closest friends were laborers.During the Civil War, Whitman moved to Washington, D.C., to volunteer as a Union nurse. In 1862, he traveled to the front lines to take care of his brother, Lt. Col. George Whitman, who had been wounded at Fredericksburg, Va.Whitman's work in a field hospital became some of the most important of his life, profoundly shaping his view of humanity. He nursed and ministered, he later figured, to nearly 100,000 sick and wounded soldiers in 600 hospital visits and tours.He became attached to the soldiers he nursed, mourning the loss of the many who died and staying in touch with those who survived. Whitman was fiercely against war, which he called “999 parts diarrhea to one part glory. The people who like the wars should be compelled to fight the wars.”Whitman was an abolitionist who supported the Union -- some of his poems presented equality among races -- but he didn’t think emancipation was worth the loss of so many men.""Leaves of Grass"" would be republished eight times throughout Whitman’s lifetime, each with additional poems and increased fanfare.“O Captain! My Captain!” -- perhaps Whitman’s most popular and well-known poem -- commemorated the death of Abraham Lincoln in 1865 and appeared in ""Leaves of Grass"" beginning with its fourth edition in 1867.Although the poem brought him more fame, he sometimes regretted having written it. “It’s My Captain again; always My Captain,” he said when a publishing house inquired about reprinting it in a schoolbook. “My God! When will they listen to me for whole and good?”Whitman suffered a stroke in 1873 and was forced to move in with his brother in Camden, N.J.Despite being partially paralyzed and suffering other ailments, he continued to work and published several new versions of ""Leaves of Grass.""Whitman died of bronchial pneumonia at age 72. His funeral was a public spectacle, with 1,000 attending.Whitman is considered the father of free-verse poetry. But he was much more than that. He introduced readers to previously forbidden topics -- sexuality, the human body and its functions -- and incorporated unusual themes, such as debris, straw and leaves, into his work.Matt Cohen, a professor of English at the University of Texas, notes that part of what made Whitman special was that he broke the rules of poetry, which at the time meant “writing in rhyme and meter, in stanzas with traditional shapes.” Instead, Whitman wrote in “long, unrhymed lines, with a sort of conversational cadence rather than iambic pentameter or some other meter, and played fast and loose with stanzas and other sorts of organization.”More broadly, NYU's Karbiener believes, Whitman “woke us up regarding what American poetry could look like, say and do. … His aim was to set free the American imagination, to awaken and encourage the development of uniquely American art. And he actually spoke directly to his potential heirs about their role in making this happen.”Whitman’s innovations went even deeper. He broke the boundaries of poetry that he believed restricted freedom. In a sense, Cohen believes, by choosing free forms, “Whitman built democracy into his very style.”Free-verse poet who authored ""Leaves of Grass.""Overcame: Criticism of his poetry.Lesson: “All faults may be forgiven of him who has perfect candor.”“Re-examine all that you have been told. … Dismiss that which insults your soul.”

492,O,"The market has been advancing since the Feb. 17 follow-through day, but it's been disappointing for CAN SLIM investors. The rally has been led by defensive stocks, such as utilities, food, staples, tobacco and household products. The usually fast-moving growth stocks have been left at the gate. That raises questions about the validity of the rally. If money managers won't…
"
493,O,"Americans are often passionate about things, about people, about ideas. Sometimes it seems silly because, well, it is silly. When it comes to politics though, especially the quadrennial orgy of talking and yelling over a potential president, it is far from silly.Yes, there are over-the-top expressions and acts and goofy hats. And egos to awe. But there can also be inspirations by people who offer themselves up as possible leaders, people willing to endure withering criticism and mocking because they think that somehow just maybe they can help. We do not have to agree with many or any of them to appreciate that.And we should not allow understandable cynicism over some public figures in recent years to metastasize within our community spirit so that we harden our hearts to these hardy volunteers and their volunteers. Some strutters would divide us into winners and losers. Or, more accurately, a winner and losers.We had a football coach once, a very long time ago, who after one day's heartbreaking loss said, ""I want to see what you do with defeat."" He was an idiot obviously. Because as a teenager, what is there to do with defeat but wallow in it, aim blame and get angry?Within a week, we learned, in fact, there is much more to do with defeat than with victory, as good as that feels for a while.So, we were struck Tuesday night by the remarks of young Florida Sen. Marco Rubio following his first election loss, a crushing Republican primary defeat at the hands of a man who'd mercilessly mocked him and predicted the overwhelming victory. It's easy for such statements to fly by with little notice.We have often posted here commentary along with the entire texts of remarks by people that we find worthy and/or revealing so that readers can make their own judgments and evaluations. We're doing that once more today with one difference: No commentary.Reading or viewing the video below of what Rubio chose to say to disappointed supporters in Miami, you can make your own judgment on whether this loser's perspective is all about himself, as so many concession statements are, or whether his words contain thoughts -- and perhaps a worthwhile warning -- for our larger country, even at this time of noisy, divisive, passionate arguments.Following is the text of remarks made by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio on March 15 in Miami:MARCO RUBIO: First of all, thank you all for everything. I want to begin — I haven't had a chance to speak to him yet, but I want to congratulate Donald Trump on his victory, big victory in Florida.(Crowd boos.) No No. No. No. No. We live in a republic and our voters make these decisions and we respect that very much and it was a big win.I want to begin by thanking all of you here today. And, I want you to know that I am the beneficiary of the best group of supporters, the hardest working people I have ever been associated with and I'm so grateful to you guys, thank you. Not just here in Florida. Not just here in Florida, but around the country.I want you to know that you worked as hard, not just here, but all over the country. I want to talk to people in Iowa and New Hampshire and South Carolina and in the great state of Minnesota, where I won and territory of Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C. All over. We have a great team.I'm so grateful for all the help that you guys have given us. I just want you to know that there is nothing more that you could have done. You worked as hard as anyone could have worked. I want you to know, we worked as hard as we ever could.America is in the middle of a real political storm, a real tsunami, and we should have seen this coming.Look, people are angry, and people are very frustrated. It really began back in 2007, 2008 with this horrifying downturn. People are very frustrated about the direction of our country. People are frustrated. In 2007 and 2008, there was a horrible downturn in our economy and these changes to our economy that are happening are disrupting people's lives. And people are very upset about it.And they’re told that, you know, people are angry, they are frustrated, they’re being left behind by this economy and then they are told, look, if you’re against illegal immigration that makes you a bigot. And if you see jobs and businesses leaving to other countries, you have no right to be frustrated.They see America involved in the world and Americans spending money and losing their lives and they see that there is very little gratitude for all the sacrifice America makes.And quite frankly, there’s millions of people in this country that are tired of being looked down upon. Tired of being told by these self-proclaimed elitists that they don't know what they are talking about and they need to instead listen to the so-called smart people.And I know all these issues firsthand. I’ve lived paycheck to paycheck. I grew up paycheck to paycheck. I know what it's like to have to figure out how to find the money to fix the air conditioner that broke last night. I know my parents struggled and I know millions of people that are doing that.I know immigration in America is broken. No one understands this issue better than I do. My parents are immigrants. My grandparents were immigrants. Jennette's parents were immigrants. I live in a community of immigrants. I’ve seen the good, and the bad, and the ugly. I’ve battled my whole life against the so-called elites, the people who think that, you know, I needed to wait my turn or wait in line or it wasn't our chance or wasn't our time. So, I understand all of these frustrations.And yet, when I decide to do run for president, I decided to run a campaign that was realistic about all of these challenges. But also one that was -- one that was optimistic about what lies ahead for our country. I know that we have a right to enforce our immigration laws, but we also have to have a realistic approach to fix it.I know that we are living through this extraordinary economic transformation that is really disruptive in people's lives. Machines are replacing them. Their pay is not enough. I know it's disruptive.But, I also know this new economy has incredible opportunity. I know America can't solve all of the world's problems. But I also know that when America doesn't lead, it leaves behind a vacuum and that vacuum leads to chaos.And most of all, I know firsthand that ours is a special nation because where you come from here doesn't decide where you get to go. That's how a 44-year-old son of a bartender and a maid, that's how I decide that, in fact, I too can run for president of the United States of America.So, from a political standpoint, the easiest thing to have done......
"
494,O,"......in this campaign is to jump on all those anxieties I just talked about, to make people angrier, make people more frustrated. But I chose a different route and I'm proud of that.That would have been -- in a year like this, that would have been the easiest way to win. But that is not what's best for America. The politics of resentment against other people will not just leave us a fractured party, they are going to leave us a fractured nation.They are going to leave us as a nation where people literally hate each other because they have different political opinions.That we find ourselves at this point is not surprising, for the warning signs have been here for close to a decade. In 2010, the Tea Party wave carried me and others into office because not enough was happening and that Tea Party wave gave Republicans a majority in the House.But nothing changed.In 2014, those same voters gave Republicans a majority in the Senate and, still, nothing changed.And I blame some of that on the conservative movement, a movement that is supposed to be about our principles and our ideas. But I blame most of it on our political establishment.A political establishment that for far too long has looked down at conservatives, looked down at conservatives, as simple-minded people. Looked down at conservatives as simply bomb-throwers. A political establishment that for far too long has taken the votes of conservatives for granted, and a political establishment that has grown to confuse cronyism for capitalism, and big business for free enterprise.I endeavored over the last 11 months to bridge this divide within our party and within our country because I know that after eight years of Barack Obama, this nation needs a vibrant and growing conservative movement and it needs a strong Republican Party to change the direction now of this country or many of the things that are going wrong in America will become permanent.And many of the things makes us a special country will be gone. America needs a vibrant conservative movement, but one that’s built on principles and ideas, not on fear, not on anger, not on preying on people’s frustrations.A conservative movement that believes in the principles of our Constitution, that protects our rights and limits the power of government.A conservative movement committed to the cause of free enterprise, the only economic model where everyone can climb without anyone falling.A conservative movement that believes in a strong national defense and a conservative movement that believes in the strong Judeo-Christian values that are the formation of our nation.But we also need a new political establishment in our party, not one that looks down on people that live outside of the District of Columbia, not one that tells young people that they need to wait their turn and wait in line, and not one that's more interested in winning elections than it is in solving problems or standing by principles.And this is the campaign we’ve run, a campaign that is realistic about the challenges we face but optimistic about the opportunities before us. A campaign that recognizes the difficulties we face, but also one that believes that we truly are on the verge of a new American century.And a campaign to be president, a campaign to be a president that would love all of the American people, even the ones that don't love you back.This is the right way forward for our party. This is the right way forward for our country.But after tonight it is clear that while we are on the right side, this year, we will not be on the winning side.I take great comfort in the ancient words which teaches us that in their hearts humans plan their course, but the Lord establishes their steps.And so yet, while this may not have been the year for a hopeful and optimistic message about our future, I still remain hopeful and optimistic about America.And how can I not? How can I not? My mother was one of seven girls born to a poor family. Her father was disabled as a child. He struggled to provide for them his entire life. My mother told us a few years ago she never went to bed hungry growing up, but she knows her parents did, so they wouldn't have to.She came to this country in 1956 with little education, no money, no connections. My parents struggled their first years here. They were discouraged. They even thought about going back to Cuba at one point. But they persevered.They never became rich. I didn't inherit any money from my parents. They never became famous. You never would have heard about them if I had never run for office. And yet I consider my parents to be very successful people. Because in this country, working hard as a bartender and a maid, they owned a home and they retired with dignity.In this country, they lived to see all four of their children live better off than themselves. And in this country, on this day, my mother, who is now 85 years old, was able to cast a ballot for her son to be the president of the United States of America.And so while it is not God's plan that I be president in 2016 or maybe ever, and while today my campaign is suspended, the fact that I have even come this far is evidence of how special America truly is, and all the reason more why we must do all we can to ensure that this nation remains a special place.I ask the American people: Do not give in to the fear. Do not give in to the frustration.We can disagree about public policy. We can disagree about it vibrantly, passionately. But we are a hopeful people, and we have every right to be hopeful.For we in this nation are the descendants of go-getters. In our veins runs the blood of people who gave it all up so we would have the chances they never did. We are all the descendants of someone who made our future the purpose of their lives. We are the descendants of pilgrims. We are the descendants of settlers. We are the descendants of men and women that headed westward in the Great Plains not knowing what awaited them. We are the descendants of slaves who overcame that horrible institution to stake their claim in the American Dream.We are the descendants of immigrants and exiles who knew and believed that they were destined for more, and that there was only one place on earth where that was possible. This is who we are, and let us fight to ensure that this is who we remain. For if we lose that about our country, we will still be rich and we will still be powerful, but we will no longer be special.And so I am grateful to all of you that have worked so hard for me. I truly am. I am grateful to my family, to my wife, Jeanette, who has been phenomenal in this campaign. To my four kids who have been extraordinary in this campaign.And I want you to know that I will continue every single day to search for ways for me to repay some of this extraordinary debt that I owe this great country.And I want to leave with an expression of gratitude to God in whose hands all things lie. He has a plan for every one of our lives. Everything that comes from God is good. God is perfect. God makes no mistakes. And he has things planned for all of us. And we await eagerly to see what lies ahead.And so I leave tonight with one final prayer, and I use the words of King David because I remain grateful to God:“Yours O Lord is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty, indeed everything that is in the heavens and the earth. Yours is the dominion, O Lord, and you exalt yourself as head overall. Both riches and honor come from you and you rule over all. And in your hand is power and might and it lies in your hand to make great and to strengthen everyone.”May God strengthen our people. May God strengthen our nation. May God strengthen the conservative movement. May God strengthen the Republican Party. May God strengthen our eventual nominee. And may God always bless and strengthen this great nation, the United States of America. Thank you and God bless you all. Thank you very much. ####RELATED:

498,O,"MFS Mid Cap Growth Fund (OTCIX) keeps a steely eye fixed on its prize. The $1.8 billion fund seeks stocks of companies best poised for growth several years into the future.When the market retreats, as it did in from December through early February, and investors favor defensive names rather than growthier ones, that hurts a fund like the MFS portfolio. Its three-month trailing performance going into Tuesday was mired around the middle of its midcap growth peer group of mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc.That lags the pace it's more accustomed to. Over the past five years its 9.51% average annual gain topped 81% of its direct rivals, which averaged a 7.56% yearly return. The S&P 500 galloped ahead at an 11.21% yearly pace.Nvidia (NVDA) is Mid Cap Growth's type of stock. The fund increased its stake and weighting in each of its three most recent monthly disclosures, for November through January.Up 28% since a Feb. 11, the stock is nearing its 34.04 entry in a cup-shaped base.Earnings per share rose 13%, 18% and 21% the past three quarters. The company designs graphic processing units that are used in computers, mobile devices and game consoles.The stock has a Composite Rating of 99 from IBD. The Composite Rating combines IBD’s five stock-performance ratings, including EPS and RS Ratings, with 99 being the highest. The stock also has a 1.4% dividend yield.Five Below (FIVE) runs a chain of teen-targeted discount stores that sell a variety of goods, ranging from apparel to consumer electronics, games and candy.The stock, which sports a 99 Comp Rating, is up 41% since a 27.68 low on Dec. 2. The uptrend began when Five posted second-quarter earnings, showing 33% EPS growth, reversing a 13% prior-quarter decline.The company opened its first store in Miami on March 4. The stock is in the IBD 50 list of leading growth stocks.Payment processor Vantiv (VNTV), another IBD 50 name, is up 22% since a 43.20 low on Jan. 21. Accelerating, EPS rose 15%, 19%, 20% 23% the past four quarters.Trading around 52 in a cup-shaped base, the stock shows a 53.56 buy point.Vantiv has a 97 Comp Rating. The company benefits from merchants' and financial firms' switch to chip cards and their terminals. Vantiv's other cybersecurity products also help the stock's climb.Henry Schein (HSIC), with a 97 Comp Rating, is up 14% since Feb. 8.The stock's climb began a day before the company announced record fourth quarter and full-year 2015 results. The company also affirmed its EPS guidance for 2016.EPS for the global provider of health care products and medical equipment grew 8%, 8%, 16% and 7% the past four quarters.O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) has a cup-shaped base with a 278.06 entry. An alternative earlier entry is at 266.33.An early entry crops up when a stock crosses an area of price resistance within a base in unmistakably strong volume. The volume is a sign that funds are behind the stock's move.The stock is benefiting from low gasoline prices. Those encourage more driving, which leads to more maintenance. Some analysts recently raised price targets or buy-sell-hold recommendations. Last month, the company reported better-than-expected Q4 results and added $750 million to its share buyback plan.
"
499,O,"Stocks chalked up losses in early afternoon trading as the market shifted the focus of its worries.The Nasdaq and S&P 500 each fell 0.6%, while the Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.2%. The small-cap Russell 2000 flopped 1.7%, though small caps had been outperforming the major indexes recently.Volume in the stock market today was running slightly lower on both major exchanges.The indexes have recently patched over some worries. Strong jobs numbers last week eased concerns about a possible U.S. recession. Crude oil prices are working on their fourth consecutive week of gains. This has eased fears that job losses in the oil industry will offset any boost lower gasoline prices give to consumer spending.However, weak trade data from China thrust the Chinese economy back to the top of the worry list. Data for February showed that exports fell 25.4% from a year earlier.Oil, steel and mining stocks led the downside. In the S&P 500, Devon Energy (DVN) took the biggest hit, with the oil and natural gas explorer falling almost 9% in heavy volume, though there was no news specific to the stock.Meanwhile, semiconductor stocks also skidded. The chip groups have rallied about 20% off their February lows and were probably due for some profit-taking.Blue chips were mostly down. However, Coca-Cola (KO) popped almost 1% to a new 52-week high.Among other Dow stocks,  the best performers included Nike (NKE), up 1.7%; McDonald's (MCD) up 1.3%; and Home Depot (HD), up 1.1%.
"
500,O,"Many top names have been building bases as the market repairs, and as the major indexes move solidly higher today, it's a good time to take a look at stocks that are nearing potential buy points.Five stocks on the IBD 50 list, a computer-generated ranking of stocks with superior fundamentals, are getting close to buy zones: Nike (NKE), O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY), Smith & Wesson (SWHC), Nvidia (NVDA) and Ryanair (RYAAY).Nike finished 2.2% higher in soft volume Tuesday. The athletic shoe and apparel leader is trading just 2% below a double-bottom base with a 63.60 buy point. Shares hit their lowest level since August about a month ago, but have steadily powered higher to retake the 200-day and 50-day lines.Nike, which has an IBD Composite Rating of 85 out of 99, has seen light trading volume. Look for a strong pickup in volume when the stock breaks out; high trading volume indicates institutional support.O'Reilly Automotive is trading 4% below its November high and a 278.06 buy point from a four-month-long base. The auto parts retailer's shares gained 4.6% Tuesday in above-average volume, rising in sympathy as peer AutoZone (AZO) issued view-topping quarterly results.O'Reilly also announced a $500 million bond offering Tuesday. The stock has a highest-possible Composite Rating of 99.Gun maker Smith & Wesson also has a 99 Composite Rating. The stock is trading 3% below a cup-base buy point of 26.64. Smith & Wesson came well off of its all-time high reached in January, but was able to find support near the 50-day line as it moved higher.Shares closed up 1.6% Tuesday in above-average turnover. A breakout from the base would put shares at an all-time high.Tesla Motors (TSLA) supplier Nvidia, which earns a 99 Composite Rating as well, issued estimate-beating earnings on Feb. 18. That sent the stock 8% higher to recapture its 50-day line.Shares have moved higher since, up 4.4% Tuesday, and are trading 4% below a cup-base buy point of 34.04.European budget airline Ryanair has been trading along its 50-day line as it works on the handle of a cup-with-handle base with an 84.97 pivot.

The meat products industry has jumped to No. 15 out of 197 as of Wednesday's IBD, up from No. 101 six weeks ago. The group is up about 14% over that span and 17% higher for the year, easily outpacing the S&P 500.

509,O,"Tyson, the biggest U.S. chicken producer, has also been on the upswing despite a mixed quarterly earnings report on Nov. 23. Investors looked past a greater-than-expected 5% decline in profit for the fiscal fourth quarter ended in September and focused instead on a strong outlook on rebounding chicken production and a solid contribution from its 2014 acquisition of Hillshire Farms, which makes sausages and lunch meats.
"
510,O,"Tyson says the acquisition fits with its strategic growth plan to shift toward higher-margin foods, a segment that Hormel is also pursuing with acquisitions such as its 2014 purchase of Muscle Milk producer CytoSport International Holdings. Tyson's annual pretax margin climbed to 4.9% in the latest fiscal year, the highest in at least eight years, though it's still well behind group leader Cal-Maine's 15.6% and Hormel's 11.9%.

512,O,"Meanwhile, egg producer Cal-Maine fell sharply in post-session trading Wednesday after its fiscal second-quarter profit rose 197% to $2.26 a share on a 44% gain in sales to $546 million. Both results missed Wall Street forecasts.

Investors looked past a greater-than-expected 5% decline in profit for the fiscal fourth quarter ended in September and focused instead on a strong outlook on rebounding chicken production and a solid contribution from its 2014 acquisition of Hillshire Farms, which makes sausages and lunch meats.Tyson says the acquisition fits with its strategic growth plan to shift toward higher-margin foods, a segment that Hormel is also pursuing with acquisitions such as its 2014 purchase of Muscle Milk producer CytoSport International Holdings. Tyson's annual pretax margin climbed to 4.9% in the latest fiscal year, the highest in at least eight years, though it's still well behind group leader Cal-Maine's 15.6% and Hormel's 11.9%.Jefferies initiated coverage of Tyson on Dec. 15 with a buy rating, citing a ""long-term, value-added growth strategy, which will result in a higher and more stable earnings stream over time."" It put a price target of 61 on the stock, a 13% premium to Wednesday's close.Meanwhile, egg producer Cal-Maine fell sharply in post-session trading Wednesday after its fiscal second-quarter profit rose 197% to $2.26 a share on a 44% gain in sales to $546 million. Both results missed Wall Street forecasts.Cal-Maine CEO Dolph Baker said egg prices fell amid a rebound in the population of egg-laying hens following the bird flu outbreak. The stock has underperformed its peers lately, falling below its 50-day and 200-day lines after a failed breakout past a 60.20 buy point on Oct. 16.
"
514,O,"AutoZone (AZO) topped quarterly earnings views early Tuesday and delivered another solid same-store sales gain as the No. 1 U.S. auto parts retailer benefited from upbeat industry trends and higher margins.Reporting before the open, AutoZone earned $7.43 a share for its fiscal second quarter, which ended in February. That was up 14% from the prior year and comfortably above consensus analyst estimates for $7.28.Net sales rose 5% to $2.26 billion, matching views. Same-store sales climbed 3.6% from a year earlier after rising 3.5% during the first quarter.Gross profit as a percentage of sales widened to 52.7% from 52.2% the prior year, driven by higher merchandise margins.AutoZone shares closed up 2.1% on the stock market today.The company continues to benefit from strength in the auto parts industry’s do-it-yourself (DIY) segment, which targets home mechanics. That segment has gotten a leg up from several favorable trends -- including lower gasoline prices and an aging fleet of cars on the road -- and helped boost business at rivals such as O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY).“Low and declining gas prices are helping boost vehicles miles traveled (leading to failure- and maintenance-related part sales) and leading low-end DIY consumers to spend more on discretionary items for their vehicles,” Wedbush analyst Seth Basham noted in a recent report.More than 80% of AutoZone’s sales are to consumers rather than professional mechanics, he says, making it the “best positioned to take advantage of the relative strength in the DIY segment.""AutoZone also has gotten a lift from a new “mega hub” distribution strategy designed to improve inventory coverage through increased shipping frequency from its distribution centers to its retail stores.The company continues to roll out the strategy to more stores. About 1,300 of its 5,200 U.S. stores were serviced by the new strategy at the end of Q2, with about 2,000 stores expected to be serviced by the end of the fiscal year.“Our results to date continue to meet or exceed our expectations, further confirming our new inventory deployment strategy,” AutoZone CEO Bill Rhodes said in a statement. “While we continue to strategically invest in our business in order to support our growth, we remain committed to our disciplined approach to growing operating earnings and utilizing our capital effectively.”While AutoZone and O’Reilly continue to pump out robust revenue and earnings growth, other auto parts retailers have seen a recent slowdown in business.Advance Auto Parts (AAP) reported lower sales and earnings during its 2015 fourth quarter -- the first time in more than three years that both metrics dipped during a single quarter.Meanwhile, Genuine Parts (GPC) has logged three straight quarters of flat earnings and two straight quarters of lower revenue. 
"
515,O,"Stocks swung into firm early gains Friday, as an upward revision to GDP growth, oil prices and earnings reports buoyed investor confidence.The Nasdaq jumped to an early lead, up 0.6%. The S&P 500 added 0.5% and the Dow tacked on a 0.3% gain.The stock market today  entered Friday's session with the Nasdaq up 1.7%. The S&P 500 opens ahead 1.8% and back above its 50-day moving average. Holding that level of support, and finishing out the week without incurring any distribution days, would be a nice feather in the cap of the market's young uptrend.Distribution days occur when an index declines in rising volume. Accumulation occurs when markets advance in rising volume. One shows institutional investors are selling, the other shows them buying. Market conditions are generally better for individual investors when the big funds are in a buying mode.Another encouraging point: Small caps are outpacing the general market. The Russell 2000 starts Friday up 2.1% for the week. But both the Russell 2000  and the Nasdaq are less than 2% below their 50-day lines and still face possible resistance at that level.Oil prices, for all their volatility, were also a positive this week. Oil traded up more than 1% Friday morning, above $33 a barrel and up almost 13% for the week. Baker Hughes (BHI) reports its weekly rig count data at 1 p.m. ET. Gold dipped slightly, holding above $1,237 and up less than 1% for the week.The economy expanded 1% in the fourth quarter, according to revised estimates from the Commerce Department. That was up from an initial guess of 0.7% and comfortably above consensus projections for a downshift to 0.4%. The outlook on prices also improved slightly, with the Q4 GDP price index up 0.9% -- up from 0.8% and a slice above expectations for no change.The University of Michigan reports its final consumer sentiment reading for February at 10 a.m. ET.Nearly all of the Dow stocks advanced in premarket action, but gains were mild. Home Depot (HD) led with a 1% increase.Kraft Heinz (KHC) kicked up more than 5%, outpacing energy and mining issues to lead the S&P 500. The ketchup, Jell-O and Velveeta giant reported Q4 earnings slipped less than expected. Revenue outpaced analyst forecasts and declared a quarterly dividend of 57.5 cents.Stamps.com (STMP) spiked 21% after a big fourth-quarter beat. Shares ended Thursday below their 50-day moving average in the ninth week of a possible cup base. Premarket action implies an open above that pattern's potential buy point of 114.36. Premarket moves in futures do not always carry through into regular trade.Other notable premarket moves driven by earnings reports included 15% from  Splunk (SPLK), 13% from Herbalife (HLF) and 10% each from Baidu (BIDU) and J. C. Penney (JCP).On the downside, Universal Display (OLED) crashed 15% after unexpectedly weak Q4 results. Both earnings and revenue missed consensus estimates, and management's full-year revenue guidance was far below expectations.Overseas markets moved modestly higher. The FTSE 100 and the CAC 40 were tracking toward gains of around 2% for the week. The DAX showed a gain of less than 1%.China's Shanghai Composite added 1% Friday, narrowing its loss for the week to 3.3%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index surged 2.5%, ending the week up 0.4%. In Japan, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 eked out a 0.3% advance Friday. That gave it a 1.4% gain for the week and putting the index 9% above its Feb. 12 low.Image provided by Shutterstock.

516,O,"Nicole Bennett wanted to pull cash out of her house in Antioch, Calif., to reduce a growing mound of debt. When Bennett's mortgage lender, Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC), refused the social worker because her credit score was too low, she turned to a technology startup called Point Digital Finance.
"
517,O,"In October, Bennett got the almost $40,000 she needed to pay down debt that was costing her more than $1,900 a month in car, personal-loan and credit-card payments. In return, Palo Alto, Calif.-based Point — which is backed by investors including Greylock Partners, Andreessen Horowitz and Vikram Pandit, the former chief executive officer of Citigroup Inc. (C) — wanted to own a piece of her property.
"
518,O,"""I have all this equity in my house, but I couldn't use it because of my credit score,"" said Bennett, whose FICO score was less than 600, on a scale of 300 to 850. ""I can breathe now because all my money isn't going out the door.""
"
519,O,"Financing to homeowners is loosening up after a 30% increase in property values nationally since the 2012 trough. While many lenders have been letting the most credit-worthy borrowers tap their homes' equity, Point is targeting customers who have been largely unable to trade accumulated wealth for cash or don't want to take on the additional monthly payments associated with traditional loan s.
"
520,O,"In the years leading up to the real estate crash, easy financing helped people buy homes they couldn't afford and then borrow against their equity as property prices rose. The collapse in home values ripped through banks that bought mortgage securities, helping trigger the U.S. recession. At Citigroup, CEO Charles O. ""Chuck"" Prince was ousted in 2007 in the face of mounting losses tied to subprime mortgages and replaced by Pandit, who himself left three years ago.
"
521,O,"Since home prices bottomed in 2012, banks have reduced the percentage of cash that borrowers can take out when refinancing and tightened credit standards for home-equity lines of credit, HELOCs — requiring higher FICO scores and full documentation.
"
522,O,"A typical HELOC is a second mortgage, repaid monthly with interest, that homeowners can use in full or draw on as needed. Point is making an investment in the form of equity, so customers have no obligation to pay the firm back until they sell or refinance their homes, for as long as a decade.
"
523,O,"That type of funding could ultimately cause financial issues for the homeowner, said Sarah Edelman, director of housing policy at the Center for American Progress.
"
524,O,"The Risk For Consumers
"
525,O,"""While it may be appealing to get an upfront lump sum of cash, the risk here appears to be that a consumer could end up with a more expensive product with harsher repayment terms than they would with a more conventional loan,"" said Edelman, whose Washington-based policy institute promotes economic mobility.
"
526,O,"Many Americans with high debt-to-income ratios and low credit scores have limited financing options. For personal loans, both LendingClub (LC) and Prosper Marketplace customers have average credit scores of 700 or above. And the traditional home-equity lending market has been open primarily to borrowers with good credit.
"
527,O,"""The home-equity market is still very restrictive,"" said Greg McBride, senior financial analyst for personal-finance data provider Bankrate (RATE), adding that FICO scores are a key factor in determining whether a person qualifies for financing. ""It starts getting tougher below 680. Below 620 it is both really hard and really expensive.""
"
528,O,"With Point, credit scores can be less than 620, but homeowners must have at least 25% to 30% equity in their houses. Point adjusts the cost of its investment based on the owner and the property, taking a larger percentage of price appreciation from riskier customers. Should the homeowner not pay Point, the firm has the right to sell the home to recoup its investment and take its portion of the gains.
"
529,O,"Those deciding not to sell their homes have to pay Point back at the end of the 10-year period, similar to a loan, with an annual effective interest rate that's capped at about 15%, comparable to rates on some credit cards or unsecured consumer debt. Annual rates at LendingClub range from 5.32% to almost 30% on three-year personal loans.
"
530,O,"Selective About Properties
"
531,O,"Point is investing in properties it expects to appreciate in value, initially focusing on California, with plans to fund homeowners in other states next year, according to a company marketing document. Home prices nationally are set to rise about 5.5% this year and may increase an additional 5.9% in 2016, according to CoreLogic (CLGX).
"
532,O,"""If your home does well, we both do well,"" Point CEO Eddie Lim, who previously co-founded a payments platform acquired by Visa (V), said in an interview. ""If your home doesn't do that well, then this was one of the cheapest sources of financing that you could have obtained.""
"
533,O,"For investors, the firm is trying to unlock some of the equity in residential real estate and make it a more liquid asset class that can be traded, Lim said. He's raised money from investors — separate from the company's venture-capital backers — to fund the equity products. The firm already is selling them to family offices and hedge funds that buy residential-mortgage bonds and has plans to securitize them as well.
"
534,O,"Seeking Financial Stability
"
535,O,"Part of Point's plan is to improve the financial stability of its customers because the firm transfers funds directly to pay off their debts, according to the marketing document. Other backers of the company, which Lim started in January, include Ribbit Capital, SV Angel and Bloomberg Beta, the venture-capital arm of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News.
"
536,O,"Point's customers, aside from Bennett, include homeowners such as an Apple (AAPL) employee who makes $128,700 a year and owns a Mountain View, Calif., house appraised at $1.38 million, according to the firm's marketing document. The logistics program manager, who owes about $715,525 on the property and has a credit score of 644, wanted $85,000 from Point to pay off debt from home renovations, the document shows.
"
537,O,"In addition to Point, two firms — San Diego-based EquityKey Services and San Francisco-based FirstREX Agreement — are back in the equity-sharing business after they stopped doing deals when property values collapsed.
"
538,O,"Restrictive lending standards are driving investors to come up with more creative solutions for people to leverage home equity, said Daren Blomquist, vice president of RealtyTrac.

547,O,"President Obama signed the 2016 spending bill Friday, including a provision that would allow the export of U.S. crude for the first time in more than 40 years.The bill passed through Congress quickly, with politicians eager to start their holiday vacations, even though some Democrats were upset it included the provision to lift the crude export ban and didn't allow Puerto Rico to declare bankruptcy. But the legislation, which included a tax credit for wind and solar energy, included enough for Democrats to push it through.First Solar (FSLR) shares fell 1.7% to close at 63.41 in the stock market today. SunPower (SPWR) shares closed up 3.5%. SunEdison (SUNE) share jumped 4.2% after making large gains earlier this week.The $1.1 trillion omnibus budget got President Obama's signature late afternoon Friday, even though he threatened to threatened to veto legislation lifting the ban.Now Continental Resources (CLR), EOG Resources (EOG) and other shale players, along with oil majors like Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX), can start exporting crude extracted from U.S. oilfields.The ban started in the 1970s as an attempt to protect Americans from price spikes, some of which were caused by Middle Eastern countries using oil as a political weapon.But shale producers have long argued the ban is outdated, and since oil prices have plunged, they have also said allowing exports would help support continued drilling activity.The Energy Department also has said lifting the ban would boost the U.S. economy and could help lower gasoline prices, echoing what economists have being saying for years.Oil prices have been falling on worries over a supply glut, and U.S. crude futures settled down Friday.Continental shares plunged 6% to 22.71.

548,O,"IBD's chief goal is to help investors identify and buy top-notch growth stocks just as they begin their big advances.Stocks typically enjoy their biggest gains within the first several years after their initial public offerings. That's why IBD launched the IPO Leaders screen in January 2014, which focuses on stocks that have listed their shares in the past three years. Published on Tuesday and Thursday, IPO Leaders features up to 16 minicharts and a column highlighting stocks showing the most promise. Be sure to read the market analysis at the bottom of each chart.WhiteWave Foods (WWAV),  a maker of plant-based beverages and dairy products under brands such as Silk, Horizon Organic and Land O Lakes, was among the big winners flagged in the screen before its breakout. Others included Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Ambarella (AMBA) and Vipshop Holdings (VIPS).These stocks have all offered innovative products or services that have either created new niches or taken market share away from competitors.WhiteWave went public at 17 on Oct. 26, 2012, as a spinoff from Dean Foods (DF). It has benefited from acquisitions that have helped it meet growing demand for healthier food.The stock was featured several times as it shaped a long base from November 2014 to January last year.  In fact, it appeared in the IPO Leaders screen on Feb. 10, 2015, just two days before WhiteWave cleared a 36.67 double bottom buy point, gapping up 7% in volume that jumped 159% above average. At the time, the chart analysis noted that the stock had just retaken its 10-week line. The stock's Composite Rating was decent at 88, and its 91 Earnings Per Share Rating reflected strong earnings growth.Over the next six months, WhiteWave ran up 43% to a peak of 52.53 on Aug. 5.Investing in IPO stocks can be tricky, especially with those that have little price or volume history. IPO bases can be shorter than a typical flat base or cup-shaped base, which must form over a minimum period of at least five weeks and six weeks, respectively.Because they're short, IPO bases can also be hard to notice, and they also carry more risk than conventional bases because many have little or no history of price and volume action. Some also have little earnings history on which to evaluate their fundamentals and determine fair value for the shares.Examining SEC filings such as the 424(b) document submitted ahead of a company’s IPO provides a description of the company’s business, earnings data, risk factors and other key information. Also, by scrutinizing both the daily and weekly charts of stocks that have shaped IPO bases, investors can get a sense of price and volume trends.""The safest time to buy an IPO is on the breakout from its first correction and base-building area,"" IBD founder William J. O'Neil said in ""How to Make Money in Stocks."" ""Once a new issue has been trading in the market for one, two, or three months or more, you have valuable price and volume data that you can use to better judge the situation.”

550,O,"ConocoPhillips (COP) and other oil giants took a beating earlier this month when they reported grim quarterly results, and upcoming reports from top U.S. shale firms won't look any better.Unlike Exxon Mobil (XOM), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and other integrated oil majors, shale producers don't have downstream operations that benefit from cheap oil to help cushion profit during price slumps.Some shale firms have already reported. Cabot Oil & Gas (COG)  swung to a loss below analyst views as oil prices stay lower for longer. Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) posted a better-than-expected loss but cut its spending outlook just a month after offering more bullish guidance.Continental Resources (CLR) and other bellwether shale players are on tap in the coming week.Continental, Oasis Petroleum (OAS) and Concho Resources (CXO) are scheduled to report fourth-quarter results Wednesday.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see Continental swinging to a quarterly loss of 21 cents per share from a per-share profit of $1.14 a year ago. Revenue is seen plunging 56.2% to $568.2 million.Last month, Continental guided 2016 capital spending to $920 million, down 66% from 2015. It also sees production falling during the year on lower drilling and well completion activity.Continental is one of the few large independent E&P companies that haven't issued a round of job cuts, and CEO Harold Hamm has predicted that oil could hit $60 per barrel by the end of the year.Analysts expect Oasis's quarterly EPS to plunge 83% to 6 cents. Revenue is seen falling 20.6% to $238 million.Wall Street sees Concho Resources' earnings tumbling 95.6% to 4 cents per share and revenue down 11.6% to $525.4 million.EOG Resources (EOG) reports Thursday. EOG is expected to swing to a 31 cent per-share loss down from a per-share profit of 79 cents. Revenue is expected to fall 53.2% to $525.4 million.

554,O,"Ingram Micro (IM) stock soared Thursday after China-based Tianjin Tianhai Investment said that it had reached an agreement to pay $38.90 a share, or $6 billion, for the Irvine, Calif.-based information technology company.Ingram Micro is a leading distributor of technology products and provider of technology services, with 2015 revenue near $44 billion. Its competitors include Arrow Electronics (ARW), Tech Data (TECD) and Synnex (SNX). The acquisition was announced after the market close Wednesday.Ingram Micro stock vaulted up 22.6% to close at 36.34 in the stock market today. Arrow Technologies stock closed up 1.9%, while Tech Data lifted 3.7% and Synnex 2.3%.Upon close of the merger, Ingram Micro says, it will become a subsidiary of HNA Group, a China-based company described as a leader in aviation, tourism and logistics. HNA is also the largest stockholder of Tianjin Tianhai, which is a shipping, logistics and financing company.Both Ingram Micro’s and Tianjin Tianhai's boards have unanimously approved the transaction. The offering price was a 39% premium over the average closing price for Ingram Micro's shares over the past month.The deal is expected to close in the second half of this year. Ingram Micro says that it will suspend its quarterly dividend payment and its share repurchase program prior to the closing of the transaction.After the deal was announced, Needham analyst David Rold changed his rating on Ingram Micro to hold from buy.“While difficult to tell what HNA’s ultimate intentions for the business are, we do not expect much change in near-term competitive landscape,” Rold wrote in a research note. “Our initial checks suggest business as usual for the time being.""Moody's Investors Service placed the ratings of Ingram Micro on review for downgrade following the announcement.""The companies did not announce whether Ingram's existing debt will be refinanced or assumed in connection with the closing of the acquisition,"" Moody's wrote in a research note. ""The rating review reflects the uncertainty related to the post-acquisition capital structure, liquidity position and financial policies.""Moody's will also assess Tianjin Tianhai's and HNA's financial positions and whether Ingram Micro will need to upstream dividends to help pay for the acquisition or for other corporate purposes.""While some potential sales of U.S. tech firms to Chinese buyers have raised regulatory concerns, the sale of a tech distributor such as Ingram Micro might not fall into that camp. U.S. chipmaker Fairchild Semiconductor (FCS) this week accepted a buyout bid from U.S. rival ON Semiconductor (ON) rather than a higher offer from Chinese investors, fearing a long and tricky regulatory review. An unsolicited bid for Micron (MU) by China's Tsinghua Unigroup has also withered because of regulatory concerns.Image provided by Shutterstock.

555,O,"IBD’s stock research tables innovated financial journalism from the start when the paper first rolled off the presses in 1984. It wasn’t just an alphabetical list of companies with price, volume and a few other data points.IBD's tables were designed to save readers time. As they have constantly evolved over the years,  they give an extensive fundamental overview of a company at a glance.Today, IBD sorts stocks by the strength of its specific industry sector. IBD’s studies of past market winners show they came from strong-performing sectors before making big price moves. In every weekend edition, a table of IBD’s industry groups is published with the corresponding sector.In recent days, defensive sectors like utility, mining and food/beverage rank near the top of IBD’s sector rankings, based on relative price action over a number of time periods. That will change, though, when the market correction runs its course and new institutional money comes in from the sidelines and new leaders emerge.A sector will be bordered if it houses a high-quality sector leader. To qualify as a sector leader, a stock must meet rigorous standards from a fundamental perspective. It also must be showing market-leading price performance.Underneath the sector leader area, top-rated IPOs that came public within the past 15 years are shown. Since a growth investor's focus should generally be on newer companies, this is solid area to troll for ideas. A minimum Earnings Per Share (EPS) and Relative Price Strength (RS) Rating of 80 or higher is required.Within each sector in IBD's stock tables, the stocks are sorted alphabetically. Stocks that rose 1 point or hit a new 52-week high on an intraday basis get boldfaced. A stock’s 52-week price high is boldfaced if the stock is within 10% of its high. This is a good way to home in on base-building stocks.A black circle next to a stock’s ticker symbol means there’s an archived feature story about the company at Investors.com. To find the story, enter its ticker symbol in the top right area of the home page. If a stock’s ""Volume % change"" figure is boldfaced, it means volume that day jumped at least 50% higher than its 50-day average volume.To the right of a stock’s P-E ratio, several lowercase letters indicate different things. A ‘k’ means earnings are due within four weeks; an ‘r’ means the company has repurchased stock within the past year; an ‘x’ means the stock went ex-dividend and an ‘o’ means the stock has options.

560,O,"Hormel (HRL) served tasty fiscal first quarter profit growth in all segments except its Jennie-O Turkey Store products, driving its stock to a new all-time high and lifting the food products group.Hormel's Grocery Products, Refrigerated Foods, Specialty Foods and International & Other categories all posted higher profits for the quarter. But Jennie-O Turkey Store products profit was down 2% on a 15% plunge in sales after the latest outbreak of avian flu culled turkey flocks.Overall, U.S. turkey production is expected to be up 5% to 6% this year if there are no further outbreaks of avian flu, Hormel said. The highly pathogenic bird flu hit Hormel farms in Wisconsin and Minnesota in mid-2015, impacting volumes in the back half of the year.The processed meats and shelf-stable food products maker reported $235.1 million net earnings in fiscal Q1, or 43 cents per share minus one time items, a 22.9% jump compared to the same quarter a year earlier, beating by 6 cents. EPS for the maker of Skippy peanut butter, Spam lunch meats and other products has topped profit estimates five quarters in a row. Profit growth has accelerated for the last two quarters.But revenue fell 4.3% to $2.29 billion in fiscal Q1 on the avian flu impact, unfavorable currency rates and weak global sales of pork products, below the $2.4 billion analysts expected. Sales have fallen for the last three quartesr.Hormel raised its full-year EPS guidance to $1.50 to $1.56 from $1.43 to $1.48. The revised outlook is well above analyst consensus for $1.47.Hormel shares surged 7.1% to 44.44. Its stock is up about 48.5% from a Sept. 22 low of 29.93, and it has a near-best 97 IBD Composite Rating, which means that it's outperformed 97% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales and profit growth.""They have been having strong earnings upside,"" BB&T Capital Markets analyst Heather Jones told IBD. ""Investors have flocked to their shares. They have a really good management team (and) balance sheet, and very little international exposure."" Jones has a neutral rating on Hormel, citing premium valuation for its shares.S&P Global Market Intelligence analyst Joe Agnese kept a hold rating on Hormel but raised his 12-month price target to 47 from 37, saying in a report that he expects improvement in the second half of fiscal 2016.Hormel has made a series of large acquisitions recently, including the $775 million purchase of natural and organic  meats producer Applegate Farms in July 2015.Chairman and CEO Jeffrey Ettinger told analysts on the earnings call those acquisitions are paying off. ""We  did make a couple of changes in our mentality toward acquisitions,"" he said. ""Our company is getting bigger, and in order to move the needle, we realized we needed to look at bigger opportunities.""Further spotlighting strength in the food category, Campbell Soup (CPB) late Tuesday said fiscal Q2 EPS likely was 87 cents, crushing views for 71 cents.

564,O,"Standard & Poor's cut the ratings of four regional banks, including Comerica (CMA) and Texas Capital Bancshares (TCBI), because of their exposure to the battered energy sector and low crude oil prices.Cullen/Frost Bankers (CFR) and BOK Financial (BOKF) were the other two lenders whose ratings suffered a cut late Tuesday.""We are in the early innings of the downturn, in our view, and we expect loan losses to rise over the next two years, even if energy prices rebound modestly from current levels,"" S&P said in a statement.Comerica and BOK Financial Corp were lowered to BBB+ from A-, while Cullen/Frost Bankers was cut to A- from A. Texas Capital Bancshares was lowered to BB+ from BBB-.In addition, S&P revised its ratings outlook to negative for the four banks, suggesting another downgrade is possible in the future.Shares of Comerica closed down 1.2% Wednesday but climbed 4% after hours, Texas Capital fell 2%, Cullen/Frost rallied 0.3%, and BOK gained 0.8%.Last week, Fitch Ratings said most U.S. banks can weather the cheap oil storm for now, but it warned that a prolonged slump in crude oil prices could cause problems for lenders, particularly mid-sized banks with exposure to the energy market.Last month, Wells Fargo (WFC) raised provisions against bad assets by 70%, nearly half of it for loans in the oil and gas sector. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) said its expenses related to credit losses rose 49% during the fourth quarter, mostly driven by bad energy loans.Citigroup (C) has set aside $250 million to cover energy portfolio losses, but it warned it would have to double the overall provisions if oil fell below $25 per barrel.Thanks to oversupply and weak global demand, oil prices have plunged more than 70% from their level in June 2014.

566,O,"ETF investors are betting big on oil, even as U.S. crude futures continue to plumb new lows. Prices hovered at the $30 level Monday, at roughly half their peak in the past year.U.S. exchange traded funds overall absorbed a relatively puny $348 million in new money last month. They raked in a near-record $242 billion in 2015.However, energy was a bright spot last month, with $701 million flowing into diversified energy stock ETFs alone. That's according to an S&P Global Market Intelligence report citing FactSet data.Investors have chased energy stocks on the way down, believing that oil will stabilize at some point and drive stock prices back up, says the firm's director of ETF research Todd Rosenbluth.""At some point, these investors are going to be right. They haven't been yet,"" he said.It's not all about bottom-fishing, though. Smart investors know that there are some very strong companies inside these ETFs.Phillips 66 (PSXP) has an IBD Composite Rating of 93 out of a best-possible 99. Fellow Texas pipeline firm Valero Energy (VLP) has a Comp Rating of 91. That means they rank high for both technical and fundamental strength.Institutional investors and traders are using energy ETFs in sophisticated ways too. They may bet on the market going down and achieve a return as a result.Short interest in Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) was up 9.95% in January over the previous month.  ""I think most of (the flow) is long, looking for a bottom in oil, and when things calm down they may roll out of XLE and buy some individual names they like,"" said Dan Dolan of Sector SPDR ETFs.The largest energy stock ETFs are proving most popular with investors. They dominated inflow in the past two months by a mile, even though S&P 500 energy earnings are on track to crash 75% in the latest quarter.Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) topped its category with $309.6 million in net inflow in January.This broad-based ETF has a 32% stake in integrated oil and gas firms. Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) are its two biggest holdings.It also invests in 38 other S&P 500 energy firms involved in exploration and production, equipment and services, storage and transportation, and refining.A big part of its appeal is its hefty trading volume, with a penny spread. Nearly 19 million shares are bought and sold each day.For investors who believe the sector faces near-term challenges, the ETF's cap-size skew is a plus. Deep-pocketed large caps tend to weather uncertain markets better.XLE has $10.8 billion in assets and a 0.14% expense ratio.It's given up 28% in the past year, but has produced a 5% average annual gain over the past 15 years.By comparison, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) lost 7% and gained 4% over the same periods.Vanguard Energy (VDE) absorbed $213.1 million in new money last month.This ETF also offers broad-based exposure to the sector, but invests across market-cap sizes. Small- and midsize companies make up 19% of the portfolio, according to Morningstar Inc.Smaller caps could, in theory, do better if oil were to bounce and the energy sector recovers, Rosenbluth said.The ETF holds 145 stocks. Still, it's just as top-heavy as XLE, with 66% of assets in virtually the same top 10 holdings.VDE holds $3.6 billion in assets and has a 0.10% expense ratio.It's taken a 30% hit in the past year.SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production (XOP) targets stocks in an especially battered energy patch.Its 60 stock holdings include shale oil driller Parsley Energy (PE). Its Comp Rating is a tepid 56.XOP soaked up $153.6 million in inflow in January.Oil explorers and producers are especially vulnerable to commodity prices, operational risk, regulatory scrutiny and internal competition, according to Morningstar.""This industry tends to get hurt more when there are concerns about supply, but it does better when there are expectations of a recovery,"" Rosenbluth said.The ETF has $1.67 billion in assets and a 0.35% expense ratio.It's been gutted 48% in the past year.Energy ETF inflow shows signs of moderating so far in February.

569,O,"Deere's (DE) fiscal fourth-quarter earnings blew away Wall Street estimates, and its stock gapped up Wednesday on the agriculture and construction equipment giant's upbeat comments about prospects in 2016.The company projected that its equipment sales will be down about 11% year-over-year in Q1 to around $5.31 billion, topping estimates of $4.89 billion.It sees full-year sales declining about 7% to around $23.98 billion, below Wall Street views of $24.24 billion.But Deere guided fiscal 2016 net income to $1.4 billion, a 28% dive but above consensus for $1.29 billion.""Although our forecast calls for lower results in the year ahead, the outlook represents a level of performance that is considerably better than we have experienced in previous downturns,"" Chairman and CEO Samuel Allen said in a statement.Deere closed up 4.8% Wednesday in trading on the stock market today, pushing the stock back above its 50-day average. Among other companies in the farm machinery group, AGCO (AGCO) rose 1.3% and Lindsay (LNN) was off a small fraction.Farm supply retailer Tractor Supply (TSCO) was up 0.2%. In the related construction and mining machinery group, Caterpillar (CAT) edged up 0.1%.Deere expects total industry sales for agricultural equipment in the U.S. and Canada to be down 15% to 20% for 2016. The decline, which reflects the impact of low commodity prices and stagnant farm incomes, is expected to be most pronounced in the sale of higher-horsepower models.In fiscal Q4, earnings per share minus one-time items dropped 49% to $1.08, beating analyst consensus by 33 cents a share. Deere has beaten quarterly earnings estimates for more than two years in a row. Equipment sales fell 26% to $5.93 billion in Q4, below consensus for $6.12 billion.The Q4 earnings beat came ""in the face of further weakness in the global agricultural sector and a slowdown in construction-equipment markets,"" CEO Allen said.Economic growth in emerging markets such as China has shrunk this year, and Deere cited a weak energy market in the U.S., which has led to lower purchases of construction equipment by oil and gas companies. Additionally, an unfavorable currency translation effect of 5% for the quarter and the full year impacted sales for the quarter.Deere's equipment net sales in the U.S. and Canada slid 23% in Q4. Outside the U.S. and Canada, net sales were down 31% for the quarter.Agriculture and turf sales fell 25% in Q4 to $4.66 billion. Construction and forestry plunged 32% to $1.28 billion, financial services slid 14% to $654 million, and other sales were off 19%.Still, Deere said that all of its businesses remained profitable in Q4, helped by cost management.

570,O,"Big-cap stocks have done a better job of weathering the choppy market of 2015 than have their small-cap brethren. Year to date, the Russell 1000, which represents the biggest companies in Russell's universe, gained 1.3%, in contrast to -1.3% for the Russell 2000, the smallest companies.In the second half of the year, the outperformance is even more pronounced, with the big-cap segment gaining 0.6% since June 30 and the small-cap segment losing 5.2%.So, it's no surprise to see familiar big-cap names in prominent places in the Weekly Review.IBD ranks the 60-stock Internet content industry group No. 1 among a total of 197 groups, based on six-month performance.Big-cap leaders like Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL) (both Class A and Class C, which trade separately but generally track one another) and LinkedIn (LNKD) have driven the group's advance.The group is up 21.5% for the year so far.Facebook is the top-rated group's No. 1 stock by Composite Rating.All three have reported cheery Q3 earnings. Facebook and Alphabet are extended from breakouts, while LinkedIn has set up in a deep cup-with-handle base with a 258.49 buy point.Salesforce.com (CRM) is the No. 1 stock in the enterprise software industry group, which ranks No. 6. The stock broke out of a base in October and gapped to a new high Nov. 19 after a better-than-expected earnings report.O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) is No. 1 in the No. 10-ranked auto parts group.

AutoZone (AZO) is next at $22 billion, followed by Advance Auto Parts (AAP) at nearly $12 billion.When O’Reilly reported Q3 results in late October, profit and sales growth accelerated sequentially from the second quarter, rising 25% and 11%, respectively. Same-store sales, which exclude sales at newly opened stores and are a key industry metric, rose an impressive 7.9%. In Q2, same-stores had risen 7.2%.Stern Agee on Tuesday upgraded O’Reilly to buy from neutral and with a 300 price target, saying O’Reilly’s recent pullback offered an attractive entry.Q4 results are due Feb. 10.

He has steered the $2.6 billion portfolio to a 9.11% average annual gain in that period, topping 81% of his midcap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc.For the rest of this year, as of his Sept. 30 commentary, he expects earnings growth to be harder to come by for S&P 500 companies.His team has cut earnings estimates for energy firms and regional banks.On the other hand, his team boosted estimates for autos, transportation and retail. He expects financials in general and health care to have the strongest earnings growth of all sectors for this year.Signature Bank (SBNY) looks like an exception to Parton's concerns about regional banks.On Monday afternoon the New York City metro area bank was trying to reclaim a 154.50 cup-with-handle entry point.The bank, which is on IBD's Leaderboard, serves mainly commercial and high-net-worth clients.As of Sept. 30, 721 mutual funds held the bank, up from 630 at the end of 2014.Car-parts retailer O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) is up 38% this year.The chain store has expanded from its traditional customer base of do-it-yourselfers to more professional repair shops.Earnings per share grew 20% and 25% the past two quarters.Its most recent report beat analysts' consensus expectations.Revving UpThe stock was a top contributor to the fund's recent performance.Since an intraday peak of 277.96 on Oct. 29, shares have pulled back. Closing Tuesday near267, they are still slightly north of their recent 258.25 buy point.The fund also owns strong names in other sectors.Veeva Systems (VEEV), which makes cloud-based sales and marketing software for life science companies, has IBD's Composite Rating of 95, strong on a scale of 1-99.The stock, trading around 27, is 18% below its 52-week high and working on a new consolidation with a potential 33.20 buy point.This month the company debuted a system for managing the contents and activities associated with activating websites for clinical trials. The new system aims to replace traditional approaches, which are typically slower and non-automated.ServiceNow (NOW) makes cloud-based software to help companies automate and streamline their processes.Jump In EarningsLast month the company reported third-quarter earnings per share of 15 cents, which were a 400% leap over the Q3 last year.That adjusted net income was nearly double what analysts had forecast.Revenue, which jumped 46%, was also above expectations.Also, Shebly Seyrafi, an analyst for FBN Securities, recently told IBD that the company's guidance on upcoming margins may be too cautious.Despite EPS declines in the past four quarters, Netflix 's (NFLX) share price is up 140% this year.Netflix is facing a possibly enhanced challenge to its Web video streaming service from Hulu.Hulu is much smaller than Netflix.

579,O,"The market is back in an uptrend, but the S&P 500 is still trading below its high from May. It is easy to see eight months of a struggling market reflected in IBD’s blue chip Big Cap 20 list. Fully 14 stocks on the current list qualify as defensive names.Utilities including Southern Energy (SO), Consolidated Edison (ED) and WEC Energy Group (WEC) are defensive because their prices to consumers are generally locked, and customers have little choice but to use the product. Also, the stocks typically offer healthy dividends.Another factor: Utilities are a segment into which mutual funds working to maintain minimum levels of investment rotate into during choppy markets. This demand can hold share prices steady or even drive them higher while the general market corrects.On the other hand, four stocks on the list qualify as solid growth stocks: Cognizant Technologies (CTSH),  Equinix (EQIX) and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG).McDonald’s (MCD) carries some combined traits of defensive and growth stocks, giving it an interesting leg up in the current market. The fast-food chain’s turnaround under new Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook has made the stock a growth contender with regard to a number of fundamental and technical attributes: earnings growth, same-store-sales, relative strength and accumulation/distribution.McDonald’s still falls short on the standard punch list of CAN SLIM elements. But the turnaround has made the stock much more attractive for investors looking for healthy dividend names and/or double-threat defensive plays.McDonald’s, which fell off the list Monday, was extended after last week’s bounce off its 10-week moving average, and from a breakout in October.Dollar General (DG) was a double-threat growth/defensive stock from its re-entry to public markets in November 2009 through July 2012.

Revenue growth has slowed to high single digits.O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY) torqued up nearly 1290% from October 2008 to October 2015. During that period, when the market was choppy or in a correction, auto parts chains were seen as dual growth/defensive plays because they were consolidating and gaining market share while benefiting from consumers holding on to their cars longer than they had in the past.O’Reilly, which announces its Q4 results on Feb. 10, is forecast to remain in the camp through 2015 with full EPS growth forecasts of 24%. Revenue growth is seen slowing to 8%. For 2016, analyst consensus puts EPS growth at 14% and sales growth at 7%.Big Cap 20 stocks tend to be stable, healthy performers, but they are not a list of pick-and-play buy opportunities. Investors need to look carefully at the fundamentals and make sure they understand both the company and its value proposition. Sudden changes in market direction can generate significant changes in the companies on the list.

591,O,"Big-cap stocks are sometimes like the tortoise in the Aesop's fable ""The Tortoise and the Hare,"" lumbering along while rabbit-like growth stocks speed ahead. But sometimes, as in the fable, slow-and-steady really does win the race.Just look at the charts of Starbucks (SBUX), Reynolds American (RAI) and O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) in recent years.IBD's Big Cap 20 column, which appears in IBD every Tuesday, showcases stocks that have solid growth potential. They must also have a market capitalization of at least $15 billion.These behemoths often trade millions of shares a day and yet give investors a chance to reap significant capital gains with less volatility than small-cap growth stocks, which can fall much faster.Furthermore, big-cap stocks often pay dividends, which can significantly boost returns over time.Top big-cap stocks should still have fundamental and technical characteristics similar to the strongest growth stocks. High-quality big caps should show good profit and sales growth, rising mutual- and hedge-fund sponsorship column has featured Reynolds American more than a dozen times this year.Both IBD Big Cap 20 and the Dividend Leaders screen have showcased Starbucks, which has given shareholders stellar returns for those patient enough to sit through a number of bases formed over the years. The coffee seller has risen nearly 600% in the five years since it broke out past a 13.34 buy point (adjusted for a 2-for-1 split) of a cup-with-handle base in the week ended Oct. 15, 2010.At the time, Starbucks had Composite and Earnings Per Share Ratings of 87 out of 99. The annualized dividend of 64 cents a share produces a 1% yield; the long-term dividend growth rate is 24%. And with a 3-year Earnings Stability Factor of 1 on a scale of 0 (stable) to 99 (wild), investors stand a reasonable chance of continuing to reap steady stock price and dividend gains.A number of real estate investment trusts and utility stocks have also fared well in recent years, as low interest rates reduced their borrowing costs and made it easier for them to invest in new power plants or assets such as apartments and hospitals.DTE Energy (DTE) and Omega Healthcare Investors (OHI) have been a fixture in the Dividend Leaders and REIT Leaders screens.DTE, an electricity and natural gas supplier that also operates gas pipelines, has been a slow-but-steady gainer since it cleared a long consolidation with a 49.16 buy point in March 2011.The stock briefly stumbled, triggering the 8% loss rule during the steep summer correction that year. However, DTE formed a new base with a 52.92 buy point and broke out again for good in December. Through a Jan. 28, 2015, high of 92.27, it gained 74%. DTE's long-term dividend growth rate is 5% and its annual dividend of $2.92 a share currently yields 3.6%.The accompanying table shows some big caps and dividend plays that have performed well so far this year.

593,O,"Auto-parts stores have at least three trends working in their favor.First, low gasoline prices lead people to drive more, and that means more repairs.Second, the age of the average car and light truck is expected to rise to 11.6 years in 2016, according to research firm IHS Automotive. Old also means more repairs.Third, the number of truly old vehicles -- 12 years and older -- is expected to grow 15% by 2020.Also, currency translation, a problem for many companies now, generally isn't a problem for the auto-parts chains.The stock market seems to have baked in these realities. During the market pullback, the auto parts group retreated less than the S&P 500. Six weeks ago, the group was No. 33 of 197 groups. As of Wednesday's IBD, the group was No. 32.Two stocks in the group held up especially well.AutoZone (AZO) is only 7% off its prior high. O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) is 11% off its high. The two stocks kept their consolidations fairly shallow, making a breakout from a new pattern possible.At an early December earnings call, AutoZone CEO William Rhodes said the company added 22 net new stores in the U.S.While do-it-yourself remains the chief focus, ""Our commercial business continues to gain traction, growing sales 10%, with 55 net new programs open for the quarter,"" Rhodes said.As of November, AutoZone had 5,635 stores in the U.S., Puerto Rico, Mexico and Brazil.Among top mutual funds in Q4, Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) upped its position by 10% and Fidelity Balanced Fund (FBALX) jacked up its stake about 122%. Contrafund also cranked up its position in O'Reilly by 6% in Q4.At the Oct. 30 earnings call, CEO Gregory Henslee said the company generated same-store sales of 7.9% in Q3. Earnings grew 25%, the 27th quarter in a row of EPS growth of at least 15%.O'Reilly Automotive expects to add 210 net new stores in 2016. As of Sept. 30, the company had 4,523 stores in 43 states.Q4 results will be released Feb. 10 after the close. The Street expects 18% earnings growth on an 8% revenue pop.The charts: AutoZone is working on a 14%-deep pattern. The stock is trying to retake the 50-day moving average. Previous breakouts since October 2014 led to gains of 11%, 12%, 7% and 6%. Pullbacks were in the 4%-to-14% range.O'Reilly's pattern is 19% deep and first stage. The stock is finding resistance at its 50-day line. Previous breakouts since October 2014 led to gains of 24%, 9%, 8%, 12% and 8%. Pullbacks were in the 5% to 19% range.So, if an individual investor plans to trade the stock, the standard 20%-to-25% gain is probably unrealistic. Those who plan to buy and hold through several consolidations might get a bigger profit, if the pullbacks remain minor.

594,O,"It's been a rough start for the stock market in 2016, so it's not surprising to see defensive areas of the market like utilities and real estate investment trusts setting up for possible upside moves.Both groups are known for delivering solid yields, and with growth stocks generally out of favor for now, institutional money has been quietly flowing into each group.Bullish setups abound in the utility group from the likes of American Electric Power (AEP), Scana (SCG) and WEC Energy (WEC).But the REIT group is home to compelling setups as well. Digital Realty (DLR) has emerged as the leader in the REIT group and already has cleared a buy point, but plenty of other names are attracting interest.Institutional investors were accumulating shares of DuPont Fabros Technology (DFT) late last year as it worked on the right side of a cup-shaped base. A handle area has been forming that shows a 33.72 buy point.Headquartered in Washington, D.C., the company operates 12 multi-tenant wholesale data centers in four major markets. Data centers remain in high demand as companies like Internet content providers, health care and financial firms outsource their data-management needs. Annual pretax margin (29.8%) and return on equity (8.9%) at DuPont hit multiyear highs in 2014. It currently yields around 6%.Elsewhere in the group, Realty Income (O) is holding its own as it sits just above a 52.70 buy point. Its specialty is triple-net leases, in which the tenant is responsible for paying a building's property taxes, building insurance and maintenance costs. Realty Income currently yields 4.4%.Finally, Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT) is trading tightly and still in a buy range from a 145.68 entry. The company operates retail and mixed-used properties in the Northwest, Mid-Atlantic and California.

644,O,"Best Mutual Funds 2015: October Performance Report
"
645,O,"The $1.2 billion Neuberger Berman Mid Cap Growth Fund is looking to regain the top-notch form it displayed earlier this year, before the made-in-China sell-off dragged down the overall market.
"
646,O,"The fund, run by Ken Turek for nearly 13 years, was topping 85% of its midcap growth peers over the past 12 months ended Oct. 31, with a 7.55% gain, according to Morningstar Inc.
"
647,O,"That's after the mutual fund slid 7.88% in the past three months, which included the August-September broad market tumble.
"
648,O,"Longer-term, Neuberger Berman Mid Cap Growth is a top performing mutual fund that has made a lot of money for its investors.
"
649,O,"Over the past five years, the fund's 13.42% average annual gain beat 71% of its direct rivals.
"
650,O,"And like many of his rivals, he got a boost by the October rally with IBD from his office in Chicago.
"
651,O,"IBD: Like a lot of mutual funds, your portfolio endured a challenging third quarter. October's stock market rally brought relief to you. The Q3 culprits seemed to be the China correction, the Federal Reserve delaying its long-promised interest-rate hike and political bashing of drugmakers. Does that square with your account?
"
652,O,"Turek: I think you hit it on the head. From a macro standpoint, the first two points are spot on. Issues in China, the devaluation, caused a lot of uncertainty in global growth and impact on emerging markets.
"
653,O,"It put a lot of questions on the table, especially for U.S. exports.
"
654,O,"And the Fed punting was not well taken by the marketplace.
"
655,O,"From a secular standpoint, health care affected us quite a bit. It started with (Hillary) Clinton's (critical) chatter about drug pricing (being excessive). Then there was piling on by other pundits and politicians. But pricing (criticism) is not a new thing. It's been around, and it will be around. So this too shall pass.
"
656,O,"IBD: You trimmed some health stocks due to the beating that segment was taking, right?
"
657,O,"Turek: We weren't so concerned about the health care services area, like hospitals. Where we trimmed was in a couple of areas: therapeutics and biotech.
"
658,O,"We had success in (those areas). So part of our trimming was profit-taking. Part was due to the uncertainty that the pricing risk to the industry created. We don't know how that will play out. So we more or less across the board trimmed a lot of positions.
"
659,O,"IBD: And by ""therapeutics"" you mean which types of stocks?
"
660,O,"Turek: Specialty pharmaceuticals and biotech. It does not include the Bristol-Myers Squibbs (BMY) of the world. They're too big. There aren't a lot of regular drugmakers in our midcap space. They're too big. We're interested in smaller versions of Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers.
"
661,O,"The smaller companies we focus on are specialized in one or two areas of health care.
"
662,O,"IBD: You like innovators, right?
"
663,O,"Turek: Yes, we look for that whether they're in tech, health care or consumer discretionary.
"
664,O,"We like companies that are doing something unique. If a company has a competitive advantage or a moat, so much the better. The advantage could be something like a new drug or software product. In consumer discretionary, it might be that the company is innovative, like Under Armour (UA), coming out with new products consistently, expanding rapidly as well. A couple of years ago, they only made apparel. Now they're coming out with footwear.
"
665,O,"IBD: In what sectors are you increasing your weights?
"
666,O,"Turek: In October, not much at all. We're watching. Where we're interested in doing that is in tech. And to be quite honest about it: In health care, prices have come down so much that maybe it's overdone. Prices have started to look pretty cheap in the past six to eight weeks.
"
667,O,"So perhaps in the near future, we'll be at a point where interest in that area increases quite a bit.
"
668,O,"We'll pass on some. But we'll get back to others based on fundamentals — companies that are doing something new and innovative, that deserve to be paid for.
"
669,O,"IBD: Do you still like Palo Alto Networks (PANW) despite its recent pullback?
"
670,O,"Turek: We still like it. These guys are best of breed as far as creating the next-generation firewall and security, as opposed to a single-point product provider.
"
671,O,"We don't think anything has changed. And there's still a high degree of need for security spending from all kinds of enterprises and government units as well. That's not necessarily going to abate.
"
672,O,"Competition is vigorous, but Palo Alto has done a good job of being innovative in designing and offering a suite of products to forestall hacking.
"
673,O,"IBD: Describe the attractive innovations of Ultimate Software Group (ULTI).
"
674,O,"Turek: Ultimate is a human-capital management company. Their niche is the marketplace below large companies, companies with 500 to 1,500 employees, which was their sweet spot for a long time.
"
675,O,"They offer cloud-based solutions, so you get continuous updates and upgrades for a suite of products. It makes the cost of ownership affordable, especially for midsize companies that don't necessarily have IT expertise in-house.
"
676,O,"What they've done in the past year is move down-market to companies with between 100 and 500 employees. They're starting at the high end of that. And they're having good success.
"
677,O,"That's going to add to their top-line growth. They have a high retention rate, over 95% if I remember correctly.
"
678,O,"IBD: What innovation by Avago Technologies (AVGO) interests you the most right now?
"
679,O,"Turek: Avago is a fabless semiconductor (company). They outsource manufacturing to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and others.
"
680,O,"Their big thing is called FBAR, which stands for ""film bulk acoustic resonators."" FBARs are important, as the amount of data and signals from the expansion in the number of wireless phones causes noise. FBARs smooth out the noise and prevent dropped calls.
"
681,O,"As the technology for wireless gets more complicated, more FBARs are needed in each phone.
"
682,O,"But even that won't last forever, so they've bought companies to diversify their business stream.
"
683,O,"IBD: What made IT hardware and software provider CDW's (CDW) earnings per share grow 9%, 19% and 21% the past three stanzas?
"
684,O,"Turek: CDW is a leading distributor of all things information-related. The value they add is that customers — many of which are small or midsize and don't have a lot of in-house IT expertise — rely on CDW to solve problems. They (do that by partnering) customers with their general sales reps and with sales engineers who are experts in fields like Wi-Fi and routing.
"
685,O,"IBD: If the U.S. economy is improving, and if car sales are rising, why do consumers need car parts for repairs of older cars? What's the appeal of O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY)?
"
686,O,"Turek: The average age of the U.S. car fleet hasn't changed much in recent years, even as new-car sales have risen.
"
687,O,"What's transforming the company is that they used to sell just to do-it-yourselfers. What the company did was start to sell parts to the professional or do-it-for-you channel. And they've had a lot of success in that. They're not necessarily selling to dealers, although they do. They're selling to mom-and-pop car-repair shops.
"
688,O,"IBD: What is Signet Jewelers' (SIG) innovation?
"
689,O,"Turek: We got interested when they bought a primary competitor, Zales. Signet was a better operator. So the opportunity was that Signet would overlay their management ability on Zales and improve the top and bottom lines of Zales over time.
"
690,O,"They've owned it about a year and have started to have success in those areas. Unlocking the value in Zales was important (to our decision to invest).
"
691,O,"Most recently, this quarter Signet plans their biggest new product introduction ever, a diamond ring called Ever Us, a high-quality diamond ring set that it will roll out across all of their stores. That's unusual. We hope it will be a big product for them in 2015 and into '16.
"
692,O,"IBD: You've increased your stake in Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) in recent disclosures. Why do you like them more than other cruiselines?
"
693,O,"Turek: They attract a slightly higher-end customer, who are less sensitive to price increases and economic shifts as well.
"
694,O,"NCL has a high yield on their ships. They haven't added capacity at the same pace as their competitors, so they're easier to fill for cruises. And, knock on wood, they're accident free, which helps their reputation.
"
695,O,"So recently we've liked their pricing power. It's a better offering than Royal Caribbean (RCL). And (low) oil prices have been a tailwind. Plus, they face new opportunities. They're eager to see what happens to Cuba. And now China is opening to cruisers. These should aid NCL and the industry.
"
696,O,"IBD: Why have you boosted your stake in Alaska Air Group (ALK) rather than some other airline?
"
697,O,"Turek: These guys are really good operators. They started as a West Coast airline. Now they're going transcontinental and midcontinental. They have really good financials, good return on equity, good free cash flow, good customer satisfaction levels. They're growing in the low double digits for the next couple of years. And it's a joy to listen to them talk about their business. They're having fun.
"
698,O,"IBD: Why did you start a stake in Tyler Technologies (TYL) this year?
"
699,O,"Turek: We started it in June or July, I think. It came from something my analyst had talked about. They're a leader in providing financial and ERP (enterprise resource planning) software to local and state governments.
"
700,O,"A lot of those governments are behind in technology, compared with private enterprises, so there's a need for them to modernize a lot of their systems.
"
701,O,"Tyler was a leader in the criminal justice area and has branched out into other areas like appraisal, taxes, public safety and vital records. Governments are getting that moving from legacy paper-based records to cloud-based records makes records easier to manage and makes things easier for us as consumers of public records.
"
702,O,"You wouldn't think it's a great market, but it is, even with the headwind of a lack of financing.
"
703,O,"IBD: Why have you been edging up your stake in Acuity Brands (AYI), a maker of lighting products?
"
704,O,"Turek: This is a play on energy efficiency in nonresidential areas. It's not wholly dependent on new construction. A lot of it is retrofitting. They replace a lot of old fluorescent lights with LEDs, which save energy — money — for owners of those businesses.Best Mutual Funds 2015: October Performance ReportThe $1.2 billion Neuberger Berman Mid Cap Growth Fund is looking to regain the top-notch form it displayed earlier this year, before the made-in-China sell-off dragged down the overall market.The fund, run by Ken Turek for nearly 13 years, was topping 85% of its midcap growth peers over the past 12 months ended Oct. 31, with a 7.55% gain, according to Morningstar Inc.That's after the mutual fund slid 7.88% in the past three months, which included the August-September broad market tumble.Longer-term, Neuberger Berman Mid Cap Growth is a top performing mutual fund that has made a lot of money for its investors.Over the past five years, the fund's 13.42% average annual gain beat 71% of its direct rivals.And like many of his rivals, he got a boost by the October rally with IBD from his office in Chicago.IBD: Like a lot of mutual funds, your portfolio endured a challenging third quarter.

712,O,"Chevron (CVX), Exxon Mobil (XOM) and other oil majors reported huge declines in earnings last week, and top U.S. shale producers are seen reporting equally large drops in earnings this week as oil prices remain under pressure.OPEC has kept output high to hold prices down as it competes with U.S. shale producers, hoping that cheap crude will cool their fracking activity, a more expensive method of producing oil than conventional drilling.So far, the shale industry has been more resilient than expected as it slashed costs, focused on the most productive oil fields and deployed new technology and practices. But those moves might not be enough anymore, and producers may have to follow Big Oil with more spending and job cuts.Questions have also cropped up over how shale firms will maintain cash flow with oil prices still low, banks getting tighter and investors in capital markets turning skittish.Continental Resources (CLR), a bellwether in the shale sector, announces Q3 results Wednesday. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Continental to swing to a 12-cent per-share loss from a profit of 81 cents a share in the year-earlier quarter. Revenue is seen falling 45% to $638 million.Oasis Petroleum (OAS) is also on tap for Wednesday. Analysts expect the company's EPS to sink 88.5% to 6 cents and revenue to decline 35% to $238.7 million.Carrizo Oil & Gas (CRZO) will announce on Wednesday too. The shale firm's EPS is expected to plunge 80.7% to 21 cents, and revenue is seen falling 20% to $560.2 million.Concho Resources (CXO) is slated for Thursday. Analysts see EPS diving 81% to 21 cents and revenue down 20% to $560.2 million.EOG Resources (EOG) also reports Thursday. The firm is expected to post a loss of 12 cents per share vs. an 81-cent per-share profit a year ago. Revenue is expected to decline 45% to $637.9 million.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter @IBD_GRich.

723,O,"The federal budget deficit is back on the rise — by an expected $105 billion this year — the Congressional Budget Office said Tuesday, the first increase since fiscal 2009. Deficits topping $1 trillion will be back before you know it — three years sooner than expected.The projected $544 billion deficit is also $130 billion bigger than the budget scorekeeper's estimate made in August. The CBO said the rise was primarily due to the year-end budget deal that extended, and in some cases expanded, corporate and individual tax cuts, as well as busting spending caps. The deficit-to-GDP ratio is expected to grow to 2.9% in fiscal 2016 from 2.5% last year. That would also be the first increase since 2009, with the trend getting worse in the years ahead.From 2016 to 2025, the CBO expects cumulative deficits of $8.5 trillion — $1.5 trillion more than it predicted in August.The news is jarring because of the deficit's steady retreat after hitting nearly 10% of GDP in President Obama's first year due to the deep recession and emergency spending in the financial crisis. In recent years, despite modest economic growth, the deficit has regularly come in smaller than the CBO expected.Budget 'Complacency' Over?Now, it seems that good budget news may be history, which may also mean that the days of deficit-increasing congressional deals are also at an end.Receding deficits had fed ""a sense of complacency in Washington over further borrowing,"" said Robert Bixby, executive director of The Concord Coalition, a fiscal watchdog group.But the new projections ""clearly demonstrate that recent legislation combined with the relentless fiscal pressures of an aging population add up to steadily rising debt from this point forward.""Legislation since August cut the 10-year revenue outlook by $425 billion, while boosting spending by $324 billion.A few other factors also contributed to the worsening outlook. The CBO raised its cost projections for Medicaid due to higher-than-expected spending and enrollment for ObamaCare's expansion of the program. It also expects spending for veterans' disability compensation to jump. Lastly, the CBO said it now expects slower economic growth, which will add $437 billion to deficits.Economic Forecasts CutThe agency said its latest estimates call for real GDP to be nearly 3% lower than previously expected a decade from now amid slower productivity gains. The CBO now sees 2.7% GDP growth in 2016, down from its August estimate of 3.1%.The estimates were made before the latest data suggesting that the U.S. only grew about 1% in Q4 2015. The CBO expects three more quarter-point rate hikes from the Federal Reserve this year and four in 2017.Trillion-dollar deficits are now expected to return in 2022 vs. 2025 in August's forecast. The deficit is projected to reach $1.4 trillion in 2026.Those figures still assume that discretionary spending will fall from 6.5% of GDP in 2015 to just 5.2% in 2026. The deals to delay sequester spending curbs underscore how difficult that would be.Meanwhile, mandatory spending, primarily on Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, will rise from 12.9% of GDP to 15%. Interest outlays will more than double as a share of the economy, to 3% from 1.3%, amid higher debt levels and more normal interest rates. O utlays of 23.1% of GDP would exceed revenue of 18.2%, leaving a deficit equal to 4.9% of GDP in 2026.Public debt as a share of GDP is expected to rise from 73.6% at the end of fiscal 2015 to 75.6% this year and 86.1% in 2026.Changing the debt trajectory is critical because of what is forecast to happen beyond the next decade. Three decades from now, if current laws remain in place, the budget agency says debt would reach 155% of GDP.""Such high and rising debt would have serious negative consequences for the budget and the nation,"" the CBO warned.

"
746,O,"Bridgestone paid the premium even though Pep Boys has underperformed for most of this decade. The company's annual revenue has barely budged over the last three years, and it hasn't grown annual earnings since 2011. The fact that Pep Boys brought such a rich buyout offer says a lot about how much auto parts retailers are valued right now, analysts say.
"
747,O,"""It certainly signifies the health and strength of the industry when you see a company pay that much for Pep Boys, which historically has been a laggard in the industry,"" Sterne Agee CRT analyst Ali-Ahmad Faghri told IBD. Faghri follows several auto parts stocks, including O'Reilly and AutoZone, but not Pep Boys.
"
748,O,"The industry's strength is the result of several dynamics, analysts say. One is the average age of cars on U.S. roads: a record 11.5 years, according to research firm IHS Automotive.

"
749,O,"The aging fleet has also put more vehicles on the road — a record 250 million, according to Bloomberg. More cars lead to higher demand for auto parts and services.

772,O,"Microchip Technology (MCHP) has won an eight-year battle to buy chipmaker Atmel (ATML), ousting British Apple (AAPL) supplier Dialog Semiconductor with a $3.5 billion ""superior proposal.""
"
773,O,"Dialog said Thursday that it wouldn't up its $4.6 billion offer for San Jose, Calif.-based Atmel. In September, Dialog bid $10.42 per share — equating to $4.65 in cash and 0.112 of a Dialog American depositary receipt for each share of Atmel owned.
"
774,O,"Under Microchip's offer, Atmel shareholders will receive $7 in cash and $1.15 per share in Microchip stock for a total bid of $8.15 per share. The offer is Microchip's second for Atmel. In 2008, Atmel rejected a $2.3 billion unsolicited Microchip offer. The 2008 bid was a joint offer with ON Semiconductor (ON).
"
775,O,"Atmel's board determined that Microchip's bid was superior on Tuesday, according to a press release from Microchip. Now, Atmel will be required to pay a $137.3 million break-up fee to Dialog.

784,O,"The meat products industry group has emerged as the No. 1 group out of 197, as of Thursday's IBD. The rise could be partly defensive, with money managers shifting to companies showing steady growth in the belief they will hold up better than high fliers as the market turns lower.But companies in the group have seen have seen solid earnings and sales growth in recent quarters. Five of the nine stocks in the group have Composite Ratings of 90 or above.Supply and demand have driven the story in several of these stocks. Commodity prices have been falling, making feed cheaper. Cattle herds are growing after several years of declines. One factor is the years of Western drought, which forced cattle ranchers to reduce herds but now may be coming to an end as El Nino brings rains.The No. 2 stock in the group by Composite Rating is Hormel (HRL), the maker of Spam, Jennie-O Turkey, Skippy peanut butter, Black Label Bacon and Muscle Milk. The company noted in recent presentations and in its most recent earnings report that its grocery products and refrigerated foods products business were benefiting from input-cost deflation.Growth in China has also been a factor.Tyson Foods (TSN), the nation's largest meat packer by sales, forecast another year of record profits in its Nov. 23 earnings report.""Our chicken business is strong, pork continues to do well, and we think the worst is behind us in beef,"" Chief Executive Donnie Smith said in a conference call.Chicken producers have weathered an outbreak of avian flu that forced the destruction of large flocks.Hormel reported sales declines of its Jennie-O turkey because of bird flu, but it said the product has become the ""clear category leader"" and is being embraced by health-conscious millennials.While that hurt some producers, it helped Cal-Maine Foods (CALM), the nation's largest egg producer and top-ranked in the meat products industry group, which was unscathed in the disease outbreak.It benefited as the price of eggs soared. Over the last two quarters, year-over-year earnings growth was triple-digit, while sales grew at 71% and 44% clips. After-tax margins were north of 40%. But analysts see the good times coming to an eventual end. They forecast a 31% EPS decline in fiscal 2017.Cal-Maine's stock has given up ground in recent weeks and is now trading below its 200-day moving average.Acquisitions have also been a factor in the industry group. Tyson recently bought Hillshire Brands, which has given it a bigger footprint in the packaged food business.Hormel Foods last year paid $775 million to buy organic processed meats maker Applegate Farms. Hormel says it's the No. 1 organic and natural producer by market share in value-added proteins.

795,O,"How can a 141-year-old water heater maker like A.O. Smith (AOS), with 30% of sales from a struggling China, qualify for IBD's New America? The New America feature identifies entrepreneurial companies changing the way we live or do business. These innovators often lead the next stock-market advances.By those measures, A.O. Smith easily qualifies.In the mid-1990s, A.O. Smith generated about $1.6 billion in sales annually and hadn't entered China yet, BB&T Capital Markets analyst Kevin Maczka told IBD. ""More than half of its business was related to automobile components, and water products were only 15% to 20% of sales,"" he said.It gradually sold off parts of its auto business.Big ShiftIn August 2011, the company underwent a dramatic transformation to become a leading global water-technology company.That month, it sold its electric motors business to Regal Beloit (RBC) for about $875 million and bought high-tech boiler maker Lochinvar for $418 million.Lochinvar mainly makes what are called condensing boilers, high-efficiency machines that trap waste heat from gases used for heating water and re-use it to preheat cold water entering the boiler.Today, A.O. Smith is the No. 1 seller of water heaters in China. It's also No. 1 in the U.S., where it has more than a 40% market share.It sells under its own name as well as American Water Heaters, GSW, Lochinvar and other brands.A.O. Smith is ""doing a terrific job if compared to recent results of most industrial companies,"" Maczka said. ""They have strong growth drivers to outperform the market.""BB&T initiated coverage of A.O. Smith on Sept. 22 with a buy rating and an 80 price target.A.O. Smith's annual revenue grew from $1.49 billion in 2010 to $2.36 billion last year, and it's on track to record roughly $2.5 billion this year.The company has reported double-digit revenue growth for the last three quarters in a row.Over that period, it saw earnings per share grow 23%, 20% and 20% again last quarter vs. the same quarters a year earlier. Analyst consensus is for EPS to climb 34% in the current quarter.KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Jeff Hammond credits management, led by Ajita Rajendra, who took the reins as chief executive in January 2013 and was named chairman in April 2014.""Ajita ... has done a fantastic job,"" Hammond said. ""They've been able to continue to drive top-line margin growth, and they've been disciplined capital allocators.""Hammond put an overweight rating and an 80 price target on A.O. Smith.The company's stock, which is on the IBD 50 list of top-rated issues, rose to an all-time high at 77.43 on July 23 before consolidating amid the market correction.On its second-quarter earnings call on July 23, the company raised its 2015 EPS guidance by 30 cents, to $3.04 to $3.09. The midpoint of the updated guidance represents a 26% increase over its 2014 EPS.A.O. Smith sells and distributes in more than 60 countries, and from its own stores in some of them.Rajendra told analysts on an earnings call that ""We continue to expect strong, profitable growth in China,"" where A.O. Smith is seen as an aspirational brand.The company competes in China against Hong Kong-based Haier, German manufacturing giant Siemens (SIEGY) and others. A.O. Smith is sold via more than 7,000 outlets in China, about a quarter of them A.O. Smith specialty stores. Hammond said that A.O. Smith plans to open 400 more stores there in the next few years.In the U.S., it competes with privately held Rheem and Bradford White.Rajendra said that he expects continued global ""market share gain, expanded distribution, improved product mix and significant water-treatment product growth.""In the U.S., sales are rising as consumers replace aging water heaters with more efficient models, including tankless water heaters that continuously provide hot water, generally at a lower cost than traditional tank water heaters.The federal government is spurring the move to energy-efficient water heaters. In April, the government enacted revised standards under the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act (NAECA).A.O. Smith offers products such as its Voltex hybrid electric-heat pump water heaters, designed ""to dramatically decrease the cost of operation, which translates into significant savings for the homeowner,"" the company said.Noted Hammond: ""With those higher-efficiency water heaters come higher prices. So, on average, based on higher input costs, bigger units and more technology, they have increased prices,"" leading to higher profits, he said.Room To GrowIn 2009, the company entered the water purification industry with a new venture, A.O. Smith (Shanghai) Water Treatment Products. That company supplies reverse osmosis water treatment and filtration products in China and exports them throughout the world.Hammond says that A.O. Smith has a long growth runway in the U.S., China and other markets.In the U.S., for example, ""homebuilders built a lot of homes in the five years leading up to 2007. Water heaters typically last 12 to 14 years, so many of them are starting to hit that point where they need to be replaced,"" he said.To keep up with growing demand, on Aug. 25, A.O. Smith broke ground on a 20,000-square-foot addition to its Florence, Ky., plant, which will increase the size of that facility by 40%.""If you look at the data,"" plant manager Glenn Pfendt said, ""our output has been increasing 15.3% per year since 2000, or a 638% overall increase.""And that growth is expected to continue for at least the next three to five years, he said.

800,O,"What a difference a week makes. Not long ago, scores of stocks saw their breakouts fizzle, if not trigger sell signals, amid the recent market downturn. Now, with the market back in a confirmed uptrend, many leaders have recovered and broken out to new highs or are setting up for potential breakouts.In fact, a few IBD 50 stocks such as Epam Systems (EPAM), Global Payments (GPN) and Universal Insurance (UVE) are already well out of reach from their buy points.Some other leaders are still within the 5% buy zone from their recent breakouts.Bank of the Ozarks (OZRK) cleared a 45.25 cup-with-handle buy point Tuesday. Note that volume was only 15% above average, short of the 40% minimum threshold that's ideal at a breakout. The base was also late stage, which carries higher risk than early-stage patterns. Ozarks reports Q3 earnings Tuesday after the close.On Thursday, Starbucks (SBUX) recrossed a 59.06 buy point that it initially climbed past Monday. It remains 1% above the entry. Turnover was below average both days. An up-down volume ratio above the neutral 1.0 level, however, indicates demand for shares.Total System Services (TSS) on Friday cleared an early 48.18 buy point of a cup with handle in average trade. The conventional entry is just ahead at 48.77. The stock has advanced in eight of the past nine sessions. Its relative strength line is in new high ground, a bullish sign.The Georgia-based company leads the credit card and payment processing group with a 99 Composite Rating. The group also includes Global Payments and Blackhawk Network (HAWK).Blackhawk rose past a 46.23 entry intraday Friday before closing slightly below the entry. Excluding the Aug. 24 flash crash, the correction in the base was 18%, normal for a proper pattern. The provider of gift cards and payment service reports Q3 results Tuesday after the close.Other IBD 50 stocks nearing their buy points and setting up potential breakouts across a broad range of sectors include Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), which is 3% below a 758.71 flat-base buy point.O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) is close to a 258.25 entry, also from a flat base, and Paycom Software (PAYC) is slightly below a 41.68 buy point.All the stocks in this column were in the Oct. 5 issue.

814,O,"Embattled drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) tumbled nearly 40% Wednesday to a two-year low and closed down 19.2%, as short-selling outfit Citron Research charged it with a complex fraud involving multiple specialty pharmacies. Valeant responded that the report was based on erroneous assumptions.Citron referred to a report from the Southern Investigative Reporting Foundation (SIRF) probing a lawsuit by the small California-based R&O Pharmacy against Valeant that alleges Valeant had charged it for drugs it had not actually bought.SIRF said in its piece that while R&O apparently hadn't done business with Valeant, it had done business with Philidor, another specialty pharmacy about which SIRF could find little information. SIRF eventually concluded that Valeant is the sole provider of drugs to Philidor and had an economic relationship with Philidor that it had not disclosed, and this led to Valeant's lawyers seeking payment from R&O on its behalf.On the conference call with analysts discussing Monday's Q3 earnings, Valeant CEO J. Michael Pearson said the company normally didn't discuss its relationship with specialty pharmacies because it's a ""competitive advantage that we did not disclose to our competitors."" However, he did say ""we have a contractual relationship with Philidor, and late last year we purchased an option to acquire Philidor if we so choose,"" which Citron found mighty suspicious.Wrote Citron: ""An option? To acquire a company to which you are the only customer? Why would Valeant, a major big-cap pharma, a darling of the hedge-fund crowd, a suitor of Allergan (AGN) and an aggressive acquirer of pharmas like Salix, Bausch & Lomb, etc., etc., be secretly maneuvering to buy a little-known pharmacy with a dubious ownership structure?""Citron said it dug through the paperwork and had concluded that Philidor actually owns R&O, and said it found several other small pharmacies whose website domains were all registered on the same day and who share the same Privacy Officer phone number. Citron concluded that they were all set up by Valeant ""for the purpose of phantom sales or stuff(ing) the channel, and avoid(ing) scrutiny from the auditors.""Valeant Fires BackIn the early afternoon Wednesday, Valeant issued a press release disputing several points of Citron's report.Valeant said that the reason why the pharmacies use the same phone number is that Philidor provides ""back-end services, including call center, claims adjudication, IT and logistics support, as well as compliance/HIPAA regulation guidance, to other pharmacies, including R&O Pharmacy.""Valeant also said that it does not record shipments to Philidor and other specialty pharmacies as revenue until the drugs are dispensed to the patient, implying that it is therefore not using this to stuff its channels. It said the $69 million that it had charged R&O was also not recorded as revenue.""The timing of our revenue recognition by selling through the Philidor pharmacy network is actually delayed when compared to selling through the traditional wholesaler channel,"" Valeant said.In afternoon trading on the stock market today, Valeant stock fell almost 40% to as low as 88.50. That's more than 66% below its all-time high of 263.81, touched on Aug. 6. Valeant closed at 118.61 Wednesday, 19.2% below Tuesday's closing price.Other specialty drugmakers were also affected. Endo International (ENDP), whose CEO used to be president of Valeant and who has been re-creating Valeant's business model at Endo over the last two years, fell 13.3%. Allergan released a statement saying that only 3% of its sales go through specialty pharmacies. Allergan stock closed down 1.7%.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter @IBD_Areeves and on Facebook.

Last week's Big Cap 20 column focused on beverage stocks, but four of the leading stocks in this week's screen come from travel-related sectors. Several are rising ahead of their quarterly earnings reports.Priceline.com (PCLN), an online travel service, is approaching a 1394.10 buy point of a first-stage cup-type base. Its relative strength line is rising, which is a good sign.The company is due to report Q3 results Nov. 9. Profit for the period is expected to rise 9% from the same period last year, which would be the biggest increase in three quarters. Revenue for the period is seen rising 8%, picking up from the prior quarter's 7% gain.Priceline provides online travel services to consumers in over 200 countries through its namesake brand and others such as Booking.com, Kayak, agoda.com, rentalcars.com and OpenTable.Priceline is the leading stock in the highly rated travel booking industry.Auto parts retailer O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) is trying to clear a 258.25 buy point of a base-on-base. It's a riskier later-stage pattern that formed after the stock already enjoyed a strong advance.O'Reilly and other auto parts retailers have benefited from cheaper gasoline, which has prompted consumers to drive more, leading to an increase in repairs. Also, the average age of vehicles on the road continues to hover near a record high, another source of demand for replacement parts.O'Reilly is scheduled to report Q3 earnings Oct. 28. Profit is seen as rising 16%, which would mark the third straight quarter of decelerating profit growth. Sales are forecast to rise 8%, slowing from 10% gains in each of the past two quarters.Airlines are also showing strength, thanks to lower fuel costs and an increase in air travel.Discount carrier Southwest Airlines (LUV) is back above its 10-week moving average as it works on the right side of a new base.Its Q3 profit is expected to climb 67% to 92 cents a share, accelerating from the prior quarter's 47% gain.

"
832,O,"That was the third worst Q3 decline by the group in 10 years. It was the sixth worst decline by the group in any quarter the past decade.
"
833,O,"In a quarter marked by investor jitters, the top-performing U.S. diversified mutual funds were dedicated short-bias funds. They surged 16.47%.
"
834,O,"That same group also led in September, advancing 4.73%.
"
835,O,"Among just the major market-capitalization-and-style categories, large-cap growth did best in Q3 by losing the least for investors: 6.30%.

"
838,O,"But they lagged U.S. diversifieds in Q3, losing 11.24%.
"
839,O,"All in all, the market drubbing was a setback for any investor's retirement planning.
"
840,O,"Last month and in Q3 overall, investors' anxiety was cooked up in China, with sour seasoning thrown in by the Federal Reserve.
"
841,O,"""China was the No. 1 reason,"" said Bob Doll, chief equity strategist of Nuveen Asset Management. ""The Fed was No. 2. No. 3 was general concern about the pace of economic growth.""
"
842,O,"Rich Weiss, senior portfolio manager of American Century's target-date One Choice Portfolios, said, ""China's growth is decelerating.""
"
843,O,"No one outside the Chinese government knows the exact size and pace of the slowdown or whether it has bottomed, he said. ""That uncertainty makes the market nervous. And it creates more uncertainty about China's ability to manage the slowdown so it does not become worse than it is.""
"
844,O,"How much China's ills will affect America is what investors want to know. ""How bad can it get? In September the market was very frightened by that question,"" said Jim Swanson, MFS Investment Management's chief investment strategist.

851,O,"Outlook
"
852,O,"So what lies ahead?
"
853,O,"Investors are looking for signs that China's slowdown has leveled off. Finding reliable signs is dicey.
"
854,O,"Many investors believe that the Chinese government cooks its numbers for political reasons. ""Official data comes through a filter,"" said Weiss. ""And there are questions about their integrity. Is the government trying to make things look better than they might (really) be?""
"
855,O,"To compensate, investors watch data that are harder for the government to fudge. ""Investors watch indicators of economic activity, such as electricity consumption, car sales and transportation industry data,"" Doll said.
"
856,O,"Swanson keeps an eye on China's monthly retail sales data, which have been improving. He also watches the purchasing managers' index. ""If that keeps falling, it shows their economy is still getting worse,"" he said.
"
857,O,"As for the U.S., despite the stock market's doldrums the economy is in good shape — for the moment.
"
858,O,"Signs of improvement could emerge in mid-October as the third-quarter earnings report season starts. Investors are expecting mixed to good results, Doll says. Anything less would likely have a chilling effect on the market.
"
859,O,"Swanson notes that the Q2 GDP estimate was revised upward in late September to a strong 3.9%.
"
860,O,"""New housing starts have accelerated,"" he said. ""Retail personal consumption numbers show Americans making more money and spending it. Week by week, even through this whole period of (stock market) sell-offs, unemployment claims fell and the composite picture you get is that, so far, the U.S. hasn't missed a beat due to China.""
"
861,O,"Investors generally expect the Fed to act in December, says Swanson. Investors will take additional foot dragging as a clue from the Fed that the economy is not strong enough to withstand a rate hike.
"
862,O,"""The market wants (the Fed) to raise rates,"" he said. ""Like taking a patient off antibiotics, it will indicate that the patient is healthy.""
"
863,O,"Mindful of macro events in China and the U.S., American Century's asset allocation team has begun adjusting its funds' holdings.

865,O,"He added: ""We're not bracing for a recession. We haven't moved into utilities and financials, but we've taken some cyclical positions off the table.""
"
866,O,"In sectors, his group has trimmed consumer discretionary to a market weight and trimmed its tech overweight.
"
867,O,"In fixed income, his group has boosted its allocation to TIPS, especially shorter-term TIPS, ""directly in response to a rate-hike prospect,"" he said. ""We're replacing some diversified bonds with TIPS.""
"
868,O,"He added: ""We've battened down the hatches.""
"
869,O,"Sectors In Focus
"
870,O,"Real estate funds topped sectors in September, gaining 2.22%, one of the few sectors up last month.
"
871,O,"As the market sold off, many investors shifted money to REIT funds for the sake of dividend yield. Utility funds, seen by many investors as even more of a proxy for bonds, did not fare as well. They lost 1.09%.
"
872,O,"Weiss likes U.S. defensive sectors best, given slowing global demand.
"
873,O,"Global Market Outlook
"
874,O,"The only happy story in foreign stock funds in September was the 1.35% gain by India region funds.
"
875,O,"All others lost ground.
"
876,O,"Latin American funds lost 6.64%, easily the worst laggards among foreign stock funds.
"
877,O,"For Q3, no nation or region gained ground.
"
878,O,"Latin American funds lost the most, 21.69%. That left them down 27.44% for the year.

"
880,O,"""My view is that we've seen the worst of the decline,"" said Nuveen's Doll, referring to the overall market's tumble, much of which was made in China. ""But that doesn't mean the market is prepared yet to go back up.""
"
881,O,"He added, ""The breakout to new highs probably won't be until next year.""
"
882,O,"Swanson's outlook is brightest for developed markets, which stand to benefit from low prices on input commodities like oil.
"

887,O,"The consumer credit score can be a badge of honor or a scarlet letter. Equifax (EFX) is among the leaders in checking up on people you're not sure about, namely anyone asking to borrow money, purchase on credit, rent property or take a job.
"
888,O,"Equifax has ridden customers' prudence to record highs in the stock market, trading above 100 since Oct. 5. Its shares have climbed 31% so far this year, far outperforming the S&P 500, which just broke even Friday.
"
889,O,"The economy's slow growth since 2009 has prompted more credit score requests for homebuyers, car buyers and job seekers. Banks are healthier and are more willing to lend to consumers, but only after that credit check.

It also has expanded beyond its original credit information business to credit-risk consulting, fraud detection, credit card marketing and data-crunching services.
"
896,O,"Equifax grew Q3 sales 9% to $667.4 million, it reported Thursday, noting that growth looked like 12% before foreign exchange adjustments. Those sales beat analysts' expectations by $2.7 million.
"
897,O,"Core domestic sales rose 12% to $312.3 million, including online information services up 13% to $233.3 million, mortgage services up 12% to $31.7 million and financial marketing services up 6% to $47. 3 million.
"
898,O,"Total international revenue reached $148.8 million, up 14% on a local currency basis but flat after foreign exchange. Europe sales grew 5% after adjustment to $63.6 million. Likewise, Latin America sales rose 5% to $51.8 million. But Canada revenue slipped and adjusted 13% to $33.4 million, or up 5% in Canadian dollars. Equifax cited strength in debt management and analytics overseas.

"
902,O,"Sales for the entire year should reach $2.65 billion to $2.66 billion, up 10% to 12% on a local currency basis, though foreign exchange may nick growth by 3%, the company says. Full-year adjusted EPS may rise to $4.46-$4.48, up 17% to 18% on a local currency basis.

909,O,"Equifax's acquisitions include Talx, the employment and income verification company that it purchased for $1.4 billion in 2007. Last year, it bought TDX Group, a British debt management firm for $327 million. Forseva, a Chicago-based cloud-computing application developer that manages risk assessment, was another Equifax purchase last year, for an undisclosed sum.

"
912,O,"Smith joined the company in 2005 after 20 years at General Electric (GE). Some other senior executives have been there for decades. Smith has pushed Equifax to innovate in-house and expand through acquisitions.
"
913,O,"""We believe that Equifax's progression in the last decade, from its slower-growth credit bureau roots to being a broader, more dynamic and faster growth information services/analytics provider, warrants a superior valuation today,"" Gary Bisbee, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in an Aug. 4 report.
"
914,O,"RBC gave Equifax stock an outperform rating, affirming it Friday.
"
915,O,"Enough To Raise Dividends
"
916,O,"Mortgage activity was strong during the first half of 2015 but is expected to rise only slightly as the year winds down. Refinancing shouldn't be as robust after the Federal Reserve raises interest rates, so a rate rise should affect Equifax.
"
917,O,"Exquifax's share buybacks and regular dividends have kept investors interested. It currently pays a cash dividend of 29 cents a share, up 16% from its 2014 level. In May, it authorized the repurchase of $550 million shares, less than one year after it bought back $400 million in shares.
"
918,O,"""They've done a really nice job of developing new products or new-use cases that leverage their data, capabilities and client relationships,"" said Jeffrey Meuler, an analyst at Robert W. Baird.
"
919,O,"Reaching Into Headwinds
"
920,O,"But headwinds include difficult comparisons to earlier years, a reduction in mortgage refinancings and macroeconomic cycles. Credit bureaus are pretty mature in the U.S., so it's tough for competitors to move in, but maturity also makes growth difficult to achieve.
"

Full-year adjusted EPS may rise to $4.46-$4.48, up 17% to 18% on a local currency basis.""We continue to be optimistic about 2016 as we continue to execute well on our new product innovation and enterprise growth initiatives,"" Chairman and CEO Richard Smith said Thursday.In its Q2 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Equi-fax predicted ""long-term average organic revenue growth ranging between 6% and 8%, with additional growth of 1% to 2% derived from strategic acquisitions consistent with o ur long-term business strategy.""Among its initiatives, Equifax recently launched Cambrian, a data and analytics platform that quickly delivers the company's Decision 360 consumer credit scores provided from an array of sources. They include property information, debt-to-income ratios, modeled income and IRS-verified tax transcripts.Equifax's ObamaCare-related platform enables companies to know their level of compliance with the mammoth 2010 health insurance overhaul.Partners And PurchasesIt has partnered up with Credit Karma, a San Francisco-based online credit service, to provide consumer credit scores and reports. Another partnership includes Jumio, a Palo Alto, Calif.-based company that provides identification scanning for mobile and Web transactions.Equifax's acquisitions include Talx, the employment and income verification company that it purchased for $1.4 billion in 2007. Last year, it bought TDX Group, a British debt management firm for $327 million. Forseva, a Chicago-based cloud-computing application developer that manages risk assessment, was another Equifax purchase last year, for an undisclosed sum.""We're well down the path of changing Equifax from a credit bureau into a truly diversified information solutions company,"" Smith said recently.Said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Shlomo Rosenbaum: ""They have a culture of not resting on their laurels.""Smith joined the company in 2005 after 20 years at General Electric (GE). Some other senior executives have been there for decades. Smith has pushed Equifax to innovate in-house and expand through acquisitions.""We believe that Equifax's progression in the last decade, from its slower-growth credit bureau roots to being a broader, more dynamic and faster growth information services/analytics provider, warrants a superior valuation today,"" Gary Bisbee, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in an Aug. 4 report.RBC gave Equifax stock an outperform rating, affirming it Friday.Enough To Raise DividendsMortgage activity was strong during the first half of 2015 but is expected to rise only slightly as the year winds down. Refinancing shouldn't be as robust after the Federal Reserve raises interest rates, so a rate rise should affect Equifax.Exquifax's share buybacks and regular dividends have kept investors interested. It currently pays a cash dividend of 29 cents a share, up 16% from its 2014 level. In May, it authorized the repurchase of $550 million shares, less than one year after it bought back $400 million in shares.""They've done a really nice job of developing new products or new-use cases that leverage their data, capabilities and client relationships,"" said Jeffrey Meuler, an analyst at Robert W. Baird.Reaching Into HeadwindsBut headwinds include difficult comparisons to earlier years, a reduction in mortgage refinancings and macroeconomic cycles. Credit bureaus are pretty mature in the U.S., so it's tough for competitors to move in, but maturity also makes growth difficult to achieve.The headwinds make Equifax's growth all the more impressive.Equifax is part of IBD's Financial Services-Specialty industry group, where it earns a 95 Composite Rating out of a possible 99, the second healthiest issue in the 39-company category. Rival TransUnion's IBD Composite Rating is 68.

924,O,"Can we consider Barack Obama's post-State of the Union speaking trip a farewell tour? Please.With 370 days left on his White House lease, Obama left Washington Wednesday to repeat the same talking points in Omaha, only 33% shorter than his 64-minute, 5,400-word sermon to Congress the previous evening. (Followed by the GOP response of Gov. Nikki Haley.)Today, he'll repeat the repetition in Louisiana. And later this month Obama will fly out to speak and see new cars in Detroit because....shiny photo-op.Even as the Democrat professes to talk about the future, he's really trying to create a positive legacy narrative in these final 12 months. ""I have really enjoyed being President,"" he said in Omaha before uttering a perhaps accidental warning. ""And I'm going to squeeze every last thing I can get out of it over this next year.""Obama now feels the need to claim credit for saving the U.S. automobile industry, by throwing bondholders under the his bus and paying off unions. Standby for much more of this. Who's going to stop him?But it appears his countrymen are not really prepared to buy into Obama's rosy recounting of his record. A new Gallup Poll of Americans finds only 23% satisfied with the country's direction under him. That's down from 32% satisfaction one year ago.Obama's 2016 speeches look the same on paper. The same planted enthusiast shouting ""Love you!"" four paragraphs in. But he seems tired. His speaking style has slowed considerably. He now inserts long, awkward pauses in mid-sentence as if thoughtfully pondering the next words, which are actually scrolling up right before his calculating eyes.His now familiar four questions:""How do we make sure that this new economy works for everybody and not just some....How do we make sure that the spirit of innovation is used to solve some of our biggest challenges?""Number three: How do we keep America safe and lead the world without becoming the world’s policeman? Number four, and maybe most important, is how do we have a politics that reflects the best in us and not the worst?""One obvious solution would be to replace this most partisan president in at least a generation. But that's not going to happen due to Obama's impeachment insurance, a four-letter word called J-o-e.Biden's had several assignments from Obama. Remember how well that trillion-dollar shovel-ready jobs program worked in 2010? Shepherding new gun controls through Congress after Newtown? Ensuring a smooth transition to a U.S. troop-free Iraq in 2011?Now, as he announced in the State of the Union, Obama wants JB to find a cure for cancer. No, really.That's an evergreen goodie cribbed by Obama's speechwriters. President Nixon announced the same cancer assault in his State of the Union Address exactly 45 years ago this month.Like most State of the Union announcements, it didn't work. Biden's next task will be as replacement presidential candidate for Hillary Clinton if her looming criminal indictment survives a Loretta Lynch-ing.Obama has become adept at misleading claims, beyond keeping your doctor. Hailing ""the longest streak of private sector job creation in history"" without noting employment is still behind where he started. Claiming credit for cutting the budget deficit by three-quarters without admitting he was the culprit who spent it above $1.3 trillion a year.Obama once claimed the country could never drill its way to $2-a-gallon gasoline. Tuesday he sounded pretty happy, ""Gas under two bucks a gallon ain’t bad, either.""The Chicagoan has also developed a brazen habit of bemoaning adverse circumstances he helped create, like worsening income inequality. Stagnant wages. Declining small businesses.Or the ""rancorous"" political attitudes of Washington. ""I'm going to keep on trying to do better to see if I can help break the fever here,"" says the president who took 542 days to meet with Republicans' Senate leader.Obama is ducking subjects, too. He praises his own nuclear deal with Iran as avoiding catastrophic war.But when on the same day as his speech to Congress, Iran illegally captures 10 American sailors and publicly displays them on their knees to the world against the Geneva Convention, here's what the concerned U.S. commander-in-chief had to say about his troops' service and safety: ""                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           .""RELATED:

929,O,"Third-quarter corporate profits are not looking swell. According to S&P Capital IQ, earnings for the S&P 500 are expected to fall 5.1%, hurt largely by weakness in energy. But earnings for the consumer discretionary sector are slated to jump 11.8%, the best among the 10 S&P sectors.A few industry groups in the consumer discretionary space are staying stout amid a still-rocky market environment.The apparel and shoe manufacturers' group, ranked No. 3 in Wednesday's IBD, is benefiting from the athleisure trend — the use of athletic footwear and clothing in casual settings.Earlier this year, Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at NPD Group, noted that casual and athleisure is more than a trend; it's a lifestyle that's not going away in the near future.Nike (NKE), one of the highest-rated stocks in the group, posted profit growth of 19% to 27% in the past five quarters. This is an impressive feat for a company with a market cap of more than $100 billion. The Beaverton, Ore.-based firm is seeing strength across most product categories and geographies, and remains a solid industry leader.Skechers (SKX) grew its bottom line by triple digits in two of the past four quarters. In July, the Manhattan Beach, Calif.-based footwear firm posted second-quarter earnings that surged 128% to $1.55 a share. The surge marked a second straight period of acceleration.In the first quarter, Skechers overtook Adidas as the No. 2 footwear brand in the U.S., according to NPD Group.The Internet retail group is holding steady among the top rankings.According to the Commerce Department, e-commerce sales jumped 14.1% to $83.86 billion in the second quarter from the same period a year earlier. Online sales accounted for 7.2% of total sales in Q2, up from 6.3% a year ago.In July, e-commerce giant Amazon.com (AMZN) posted a surprising profit of 19 cents a share ex items. Prior to this, the company lost money in three of the past four quarters as it spent heavily on new businesses.While the company is expected to lose 14 cents a share in the current quarter, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see Amazon.com earning $1.60 for the full year. Profit is slated to surge 204% to $4.87 a share next year.The auto parts retail and wholesale group isn't known for stellar growth, but it pulled up to No. 13 in Wednesday's IBD, up from No. 23 three weeks ago.Cheap gas has boosted driving (and consequently the need for replacement parts). Also, IHS Automotive noted in July that the average age of cars and light trucks has risen to 11.5 years. Older cars need more replacement parts, maintenance and repairs.Last month, AutoZone (AZO) reported a profit of $12.75 a share, up 13% for its fiscal Q4.

947,O,"Saudi Arabia said Wednesday that it would continue to ""satisfy"" additional demand for oil, even as crude futures fell on data showing U.S. stockpiles growing. Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi told reporters at an event in Riyadh Wednesday that the world's top oil exporter won't change its ""reliable"" energy policy despite pressure on finances.""We no longer limit production. If there is demand, we will respond,"" he said.Saudi Arabia and the rest of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries have been pumping out over 31 million barrels a day in an effort to keep market share from Russia and U.S. shale producers like Continental Resources (CLR) and EOG Resources (EOG).But Saudi Arabia is paying the price for its high-production stance: It now sees a $98 billion budget deficit for 2015 and another $86.86 billion hole in 2016. It derives 90% of its revenue from oil.The Energy Information Administration said that U.S. crude inventories rose by 2.6 million barrels in the latest week. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting a decline of 2.5 million barrels.Late Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute said that U.S. crude inventories rose by 2.9 million barrels.Meanwhile, natural gas futures retreated for the first time in five days after U.S. weather forecasts for January predicted milder weather, bolstering concern that a supply glut for the heating fuel will persist.Temperatures will be above normal across the Midwest and East Coast on Jan. 4 through Jan. 8 and will linger across most of the region the following five days, Commodity Weather Group said. Previous models had shown that a surge of cold air would sweep most of the lower 48 states. That news spurred intraday prices to rally as much as 70 cents on Tuesday from the 16-year low hit on Dec. 18.""Going forward, we are going to be vulnerable to weather, and unless we see really sustained periods of cold weather, the market is going to have trouble rallying,"" said Gene McGillian, senior analyst at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Conn.Gas for February delivery slid 15.6 cents, or 6.6%, to settle at $2.214 per million British thermal units on the New York Mercantile Exchange, retreating from a six-week high on Tuesday. Futures are down 0.9% this month after losing as much as 25% of their intraday value by mid-December.The rally in January futures pushed prices above the 50-day moving average on Monday and then tested the 100-day moving average the next day. The last time prices traded above those technical levels for more than a few minutes was in August.The latest change in the forecasts ""leads to significant warming in the Midwest by the middle to end of next week and then into the early 11- to 15-day for the East Coast cities,"" Matt Rogers, president of Commodity Weather, said in a report to clients.

948,O,"Is O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) getting ready to shift into overdrive and rally again? Shares of the auto parts retailer, up more than 33% this year, are working on a new flat base with a potential 278.06 buy point.O'Reilly is outpacing most of its rivals. AutoZone (AZO) is up about 20%. Advance Auto Parts (AAP) is down nearly 5% since Jan. 1.And it's not just the stock that's outperforming. The Springfield, Mo.-based company sports the top Composite and Earnings Per Share ratings in its nine-stock group. Where O'Reilly and its rivals used to mostly rely on the do-it-yourself shopper, the growing DIFM business is providing an additional revenue stream.O'Reilly started the year off with a Feb. 5 breakout, an 8% gap up past a 196.90 flat-base buy point. It immediately went on to form a new flat base, which it cleared in mid-March. Since then, it's shaped and broken out of two more bases.At its Feb. 5 breakout, the stock boasted a 97 Composite Rating; 95 EPS; 92 Relative Strength; Sales+Profit Margin+ROE of A; and B- for Accumulation/Distribution.When it began to climb past a new flat-base entry on June 19, O'Reilly's ratings remained solid: 95 Composite, 96 EPS, 91 RS,SMR of A and Acc/Dis of B-.And when the stock cleared its latest buy point on Oct. 12, its Composite Rating had risen to 99. The 95 RS and B Acc/Dis ratings also showed improvement.Because O'Reilly already has cleared a series of bases over the past two years, its current pattern is late-stage, which tends to be riskier than earlier stage bases. Also, an up-down volume ratio below the neutral 1.0 level implies weak share demand. (See the ratio at IBD Stock Checkup, found under the ""Research"" tab on Investors.com).All the bases it's formed this year have been third stage, since the stock hasn't gained 20% from the breakouts.Aside from the October 2014 (1) and February breakouts (2), weekly volume has been rather tepid. Yet the chart shows numerous weeks of gains in heavy trade. Plus, O'Reilly has been finding support near its 10-week moving average as it trends higher. Despite the late-stage nature of its bases, the stock has offered investors chances to buy or add shares at breakouts and pullbacks to the 10-week line.The number of funds owning shares rose to 1,341 in Q3 from 1,118 in last year's Q4. Plenty of top-rated funds bought a stake or added to their position in Q3.

950,O,"Even as he golfs his way through another half-month vacation from their rented mansion in Hawaii, both Barack and Michelle Obama are asking supporters for more money.True, he can't run for the White House again. But if the murder of four Americans in Benghazi didn't keep the Big O from doing political fundraisers, why should another year of deadly ISIS rampages, including some now homegrown? Or delay another of their expensive vacations at taxpayer expense. Or Michelle Obama's costly separate trips.In a trio of strange -- even ominous -- fundraising emails this weekend, the president and first lady each asked millions of supporters for at least $10 each before the mythical year-end deadline.One Obama money missive was for the cash-strapped Democratic National Committee that's been lagging way behind its hungry Republican counterpart all year. (Feel free, the form suggested, to render larger donations. They'll spend everything they get.)The other was for his own Organizing for America outfit that has no more presidential campaigns to run but can employ Obama cronies trying to make the lame-duck's last 388 days a little less lame.Obama threatened: ""I've got 12 months left to squeeze every ounce of change I can while I'm still in office. And that's what I intend to do.""Obama has already proclaimed 2015 a great time of achievement. ""Back at the beginning of this year,"" Obama's email read, ""I made a point to tell folks to pay attention to what we do in the time we have left in the White House -- that interesting stuff tends to happen in the fourth quarter. And I like to think that 2015 has proven that point to be true.""Of course, Obama also famously likes to think ISIS is contained. ""We've done a lot of remarkable things together this year,"" he said in the email with the strangely pleading headline: ""Say you'll watch my last State of the Union.""""On January 12 I'll be giving my last State of the Union address. I want you to watch, and say you're ready to keep up the fight in 2016 -- because your voice matters just as much as mine does.""""We still have some unfinished business,"" Obama told Democrats. ""And if you want to help make sure we can do the important work of electing Democrats who will help us keep up this forward movement and protect the progress we've made, pitch in $10 or whatever you can before the end of the year to become an official 2016 Victory Donor.""Perquisites of being an Obama Victory Donor include being unable to claim such political donations as a tax deduction.Michelle Obama's donation plea for the DNC was apocalyptic. ""The future of this country is up to us,"" she warned. ""And I know it's in good hands, because I've seen the good that we can accomplish when we work together. I'm so excited to see what we'll do next.""And she really means it: ""I really mean it when I say that I can't thank you enough.""Of course, neither Obama wrote a single word of these emails. It's all done by their political people to make it seem personal. ""I know you're ready to face it all head-on. It's what folks like you have always done. You're never satisfied to sit idly by and just watch things happen,"" added Mrs. Obama, who spent Sunday on the beach of an Air Force base.Then, comes another in a long line of Barack Obama promises. ""In 2016, I'm planning to leave it all out on the field -- and I hope you'll be there alongside me. I've never been more optimistic about a year ahead than I am right now.""RELATED:The warped world of our delusional presidentWe live in a beautiful world with some very dark cornersNow, Obama is releasing drug dealers as well as terroristsAbsent a real leader, Americans turn to faith in this holiday season

Last year, it fought for control of the Olive Garden parent's board, and in October 2014 Darden shareholders voted to replace its entire board with a slate of 12 directors from Starboard.Since then, Darden shares have climbed about 40%.Advance Auto Parts shares closed up 11% to 189.53 in the stock market today, pushing above their 50-day moving average. The stock is up nearly 20% in 2015. Shares of O'Reilly Automotive ended 2.8% higher, and AutoZone dipped 0.1%.Starboard is urging Advance Auto to focus more on business-to-business sales. Currently, the retailer gets 57% of its sales from the commercial sector via garages and service station in need of parts, and 43% from direct retail sales to consumers, Starboard said.Follow Ciaran McEvoy on Twitter @IBD_CMcEvoy and on Facebook.

1030,O,"What's even better than a company's earnings report showing a strong year-over-year gain? Steady profit growth. ""Any company can report a good earnings quarter every once in a while,"" IBD chairman and founder William O'Neil wrote in ""How to Make Money in Stocks."" ""To make sure the latest results aren't just a flash in the pan, and the company you're looking at is of high quality, you must insist on more proof.""Especially given the market's recent volatility, a stable earnings track record can be one way to calm investors' nerves.Such companies' stocks tend to be more steady performers, even if they might not be the fastest growers.How can an investor find out if a company's strong earnings report is a normal event or an anomaly? Check its Earnings Per Share Stability Factor, which can be found in the detailed stock charts on MarketSmith , a sister company to IBD.The EPS Stability Factor is calculated using a company's quarterly per-share earnings over the past three to five years. A line drawn along the profit figures measures how much the earnings deviate from their core trend.The resulting stability factor runs on a scale from 0 (most stable) to 99 (least stable). If a company has a stability factor of 1, the majority of its earnings during the latest three- to five-year period fall within a 1% band around the line.So the lower the EPS Stability Factor a company has, the steadier its earnings. What is too high a number? A factor below 25 is generally considered stable.Stable profits plus steady performance — sound familiar?Those are traits often found among more established, bigger-cap companies, such as those in the Big Cap 20, published in IBD every Tuesday. The table above shows Big Cap 20 stocks with the lowest EPS Stability Factor, listed in order of highest Composite Ratings.Starbucks (SBUX) leads with a 99 Composite and a three-year EPS Stability Factor of 1. Its three-year EPS growth rate is 21%.

1033,O,"Markets reacted to a swell of manufacturing data out of China and Europe on Tuesday, while official export numbers out of South Korea flashed an early warning that China's woes were spreading.Korea's exports slipped 14.7%, year over year, in August. The country's exports have now declined for eight straight months, but the 14.7% decline was the trend's biggest, and it was the largest contraction in exports since August 2009. Most economists had expected less than a 6% slip, Bloomberg reported.South Korea's benchmark Kospi index slipped 1.4% on Tuesday, stemming a five-session advance and leaving the index effectively flat in a roller-coaster year. The Kospi had climbed 13% through April, then dived 16% through August 24.In the past week, even though South Korea edged into increasingly tense relations with its northern neighbor, its market acted as something of a safe haven as other Asian markets were battered, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.South Korea's economy is the world's 13th largest — a third the size of No. 3 Japan, as measured by dollar-denominated GDP.Exports are half of its GDP. China receives around 25% of those exports, making it South Korea's largest trade partner.Korea is a key supplier of raw materials and electronic components to foreign manufacturers.This position gives its data, generally reported before other countries' data, a sort of early warning role in the global trade picture.Korea's exports to China declined 8.8% in August vs. year-earlier levels.Export trade to the eurozone fell nearly 21% for the month.Petroleum and petrochemical products were key weak spots, declining 41% and 26%, respectively. Weakening oil prices accounted for part of those slips.But South Korea has struggled vs. export competitor Japan, the Economist reports, as a devaluing yen has given Tokyo the price advantage. Last month's move by China's central bank to allow the yuan to drift in a wider band vs. the dollar, leading to a rapid devaluation, also works against Chinese buying power for South Korean goods.A 15% decline in imports into South Korea in July accelerated to 18% in August.South Korean companies trading on U.S. markets generally outpaced Tuesday's losses on the Kospi. KB Financial (KB) was about 2% lower in afternoon trade.Telecom service provider KT (KT) fell almost 3%.Flat-panel leader LG Display (LPL) slipped 4%. Heavyweight steel producer Posco (PKX) also slid 4%.

Deere (DE), the largest tractor manufacturer, dropped 3%. AGCO (AGCO) slid 4%.""This supply shock is more bad news for farm incomes,"" said Steve Nicholson, a vice president of food and agriculture research at Rabo AgriFinance in St. Louis.

1082,O,"Theodor Seuss Geisel — Dr. Seuss of children's book fame — is loved by many readers for his whimsy. While today we may take his genius for granted, the staid children's publishing world in the 1930s was unprepared for his signature daring.He rocked the boat, in terms of his illustrations and wildly improvisational vocabulary.Today, no children's author/illustrator's work is more immediately recognizable worldwide than that of Dr. Seuss. His most popular book, ""Green Eggs and Ham,"" has sold 8 million copies since 1960.""Seuss has sold 650 million copies and counting to children and adults around the world,"" Deborah Warren, the Los Angeles-based founder of East/West Literary Agency, told IBD, ""and his franchise opened the door to kids' books being taken seriously in the industry.""His books seem effortless, as though he channeled pure fun.In fact, he was a self-driven disciplinarian who achieved success through gritty perseverance, contends Guy McLain, director of the Springfield Museums in Geisel's Massachusetts hometown.Sane After AllWhen interviewed by the New Yorker magazine in 1960, Geisel called his technique as ""logical insanity.""""What he accomplished is amazing,"" said McLain at the five-museum complex that houses the Dr. Seuss National Memorial Sculpture Garden, populated by bronzes — created by the author's stepdaughter, fine-arts sculptor Lark Grey Dimond-Cates — depicting his most iconic characters.The author initially resisted the Garden project, noted McLain: ""He was humble beneath his New England scrappiness.""McLain, a historian specializing in western Massachusetts, added, ""Of course he had natural genius, but he was also absolutely relentless in the way he perfected every detail of every single word and drawing.""McLain notes that Geisel's successful authorship was his second career. His first was in advertising during the Great Depression, when Geisel managed to make a handsome living.Geisel (1904-91) wrote and illustrated 45 children's books, the most recent being ""What Pet Should I Get?"" published just last month. The book, from a manuscript discovered two years ago, launched with an initial imprint of 1 million copies by his longtime publisher, Random House.His high productivity came after he spotted a lucrative void in children's books. They were unbearably bland, and he pounced on the chance to change that.Best-sellers for kids in the 1930s were readers in the Curriculum Foundation Series developed by educators William Gray and William Elson featuring Sally, Dick, Jane and dog Spot.In a 1957 satirical piece published in the New York Times Book Review titled ""How Orlo Got His Book,"" Geisel dismissed the tepid intellectual temperature of prevailing children's literature such as ""Bunny, Bunny, Bunny"" — and devoted his career to inspiring reading and improving literacy.The road to Seussville was hardly smooth. According to McLain, his first children's book, ""And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street,"" was rejected 27 times before its publication in 1937 by Vanguard Press.Boredom was always the enemy. The mischievous undercurrent of Seuss books such as ""The Cat in the Hat,"" where an elegantly accessorized feline wreaks havoc on the house occupied by two kids on a tedious rainy day, may have reflected the author's own mercurial streak.While at Dartmouth, he was axed as editor of the college's humor magazine, the Jack-O-Lantern, for throwing a drinking party with his fraternity brothers — verboten during Prohibition. Geisel promptly adopted his mother's maiden name, Seuss, as his nom de plume so he could keep drawing and writing material for the publication.Geisel went on to attend Britain's Oxford University, but did not gain a degree. Instead, he toured Europe and returned to America, where his verbal and visual talents were tapped by New York ad agencies to create campaigns for Standard Oil, General Electric and NBC.His academic studies did leave a telling impact. Geisel structured his verse in rhyming forms such as anapestic tetrameter. The syllabic pace, used by T.S. Eliot in his ""Practical Cats"" poems, created the rollicking beat that made the books of Dr. Seuss so much like spoken jazz, especially when read aloud.In his 2004 biographical tome ""The Seuss, the Whole Seuss and Nothing but the Seuss,"" Charles Cohen offered a neo-Freudian analysis of the author's personality and motivations. Cohen depicted Geisel's father as narrow-minded, sparking a rebellious response.Many Seussian scholars state that the young Geisel preceded his pen name with Dr. because his father wanted him to pursue medicine as a career.The Dr. came anyway, when Dartmouth awarded the alumnus an honorary doctorate in 1956.Other accolades followed, including a Peabody, a Pulitzer, Academy Awards and Emmys.Short And TastyGeisel's books were deceptively simple. His ""Green Eggs and Ham"" contains only 50 words, a challenge thrown to the author by his editor, Bennett Cerf.Yet the economy of language often was the medium for larger sociopolitical messaging. Take ""The Butter Battle Book,"" his 1984 book where clans clash over how they butter their toast, generally considered by Seuss experts as his musings on the Cold War.Amid the U.S. war effort of 1941-45, Geisel drew posters for the Treasury Department and the War Production Board and did animated training films featuring the hapless Private Snafu.While he never expressed public remorse about racist content, many of his classic children's books carry an unmistakable message of inclusion and tolerance, as well as ecological concern.Geisel's penetrating read on society, placed into frisky rhyme for beginning readers, continues to resonate with generations of parents as well as children.""He became a brand,"" said Anna Dewdney, creator of the popular ""Llama Llama"" picture books with 12 million units currently in print. ""That hadn't happened before in children's books. The branding meant that money got made, and that changed the way companies and businesses thought about children's books and their potential.""Geisel made his first fortune writing and illustrating ad campaigns for products such as Flit bug spray.All along, he was writing stories in verse for young readers.Path To AuthorshipBy Geisel's telling, he was returning from a publisher's office, dejected, when a chance encounter with an old Dartmouth classmate led to the publication of that 1937 first book by Vanguard. It saved ""Mulberry Street"" from the ash heap, since he contended he planned to burn the oft-rejected manuscript.Geisel's notoriety as a wartime cartoonist built the bridge from his adult political content to children's books, wrote Richard Minear in ""Dr. Seuss Goes to War.""Interest especially came from Random House's Cerf, who would call Geisel the only true genius on his author list — even topping William Faulkner.After Geisel left ad work for good and moved with his wife, Helen, from Manhattan to La Jolla, Calif., in the mid-1940s, he had a Yankee-style lighthouse erected on his property. It was ""a reflection of his unbroken connection with his childhood, which makes his work really resonate with young readers,"" said McLain. ""Many of his illustrations are accurate drawings of Springfield landmarks that he remembered vividly."" Such as: purple factory pipes inspired by the local gasworks, and red motorcycles depicting the town's iconic Indian brand.A frequent guest in La Jolla was cartoon legend Ralph Bakshi, whom Geisel asked to animate the TV version of ""The Butter Battle Book."" The Dr. Seuss story aired on TNT in 1989.""That lighthouse defiantly placed in the middle of San Diego really says who he was,"" Bakshi told IBD. ""He was tough and testy, and he was nobody's fool. I always called ahead and had pizzas sent, because there was never anything to eat in the house. He was a real WASP that way.""Otherwise, Bakshi, at work on his next animated feature, ""The Last Days of Coney Island,"" lauds Geisel: ""He is one of the two reasons I ever got interested in drawing, the other being Superman comic books. As a kid, I would sit in the Brooklyn Public Library and read and reread Dr. Seuss over and over and over, just like we all did with our kids. I could not get enough. I still can't.""

1083,O,"Last week BP (BP) said that it expects oil prices to stay lower for longer, potentially disrupting plans by EOG Resources (EOG) and other U.S. shale companies to start drilling again if oil hits $65 to $70 a barrel.As oil prices rallied earlier this year, several U.S. producers were upbeat about prospects for reviving activity. But prices have since come back down due to a strong dollar and the nuclear deal with Iran, which claims that it can boost output by 500,000 barrels a day within a week after economic sanctions are lifted and by 1 million barrels within a month after that.Last week, Exxon Mobile (XOM) and other oil majors reported steep drops in profit, and U.S. shale drillers are under the spotlight this week.Bellwether Continental Resources (CLR) kicks off earnings Wednesday. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect second-quarter earnings to plunge 94.7% to 4 cents per share. Revenue is seen falling 37.3% to $713.8 million.Continental CEO Harold Hamm has also been an outspoken supporter of lifting the crude export ban that has been in place since the 1970s, saying that it stifles drilling at home. Last week, House Speaker John Boehner said that he supports lifting the ban.Oasis Petroleum (OAS) is also scheduled to report results Wednesday. Analysts expect its EPS to sink 61.4% to 27 cents and its revenue to fall 25.6% to $277.2 million.Analysts expect Carrizo Oil & Gas (CRZO) to report a 57.1% drop in EPS to 30 cents when it announces results Thursday. Its revenue is seen falling 22% to $151.13 million.Laredo Petroleum (LPI) is also expected to announce results Thursday. The shale producer's EPS is seen down 64.3% to 5 cents, and its revenue is seen falling 11.4% to $162.12 million.Rice Energy (RICE) will wrap up Thursday's results. Analysts forecast a loss of 4 cents per share vs. a 3-cent per-share profit in the year-earlier quarter. Revenue is seen rising 34.3% to $123.43 million.EOG ends the week, reporting results Friday.

1084,O,"Several auto parts retailers advanced this week as two highly rated ones, O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) and auto parts provider LKQ (LKQ), delivered outsized quarterly earnings reports.O'Reilly stock hit a high of 247 Thursday following second-quarter results that beat sales and profit views late Wednesday, but closed Friday at 240.31, closer to where shares were before the earnings report.LKQ hit a high of 32.25 on Thursday after it posted forecast-topping earnings that morning. LKQ closed Friday at 31.46 — like O'Reilly, about where it was before its earnings report.LKQ ended the week up 2% and O'Reilly down 1%, while Advance Auto Parts (AAP) and AutoZone (AZO) each gained 4% for the week, with Advance hitting a new high in the stock market today.All are members of IBD's Retail/Wholesale-Auto Parts industry group, which ranks No. 12 out of 197 industry groups.Continuing low gas prices, which have prompted Americans to drive more, are among the factors that have fueled a strong growth in the auto parts industry.The solid quarterly reports from O'Reilly and LKQ prompted analysts to issue upbeat reports on both companies.Stifel analyst James Albertine issued a report on LKQ on Friday, where he rated the stock a buy.""Yesterday, (Thursday) LKQ reported 2Q15 EPS of 39 cents ... ahead of our 37 cents estimate (vs. the Street's 36 cents), primarily driven by better European revenues, and improved gross margin and expense leverage vs. our model,"" he wrote in the report. ""We also note management's updated guidance, which among tightened revenue and EPS ranges, suggests a $25 (million) boost to expected net cash generated from operations.""Albertine raised some estimates, though he's still below Wall Street's forecasts. In his new model, he maintained his Q3 2015 EPS estimate of 34 cents a share vs. Wall Street's estimate of 35 cents. But he raised his full-year 2015 EPS estimate to $1.40 a share from $1.38. He noted the Street's estimate for 2015 is $1.41.Albertine raised his 2016 EPS estimate to $1.60 from $1.58, noting the Street's estimate is $1.65, and also raised his 2017 EPS estimate.RBC Capital Markets analyst Scot Ciccarelli issued a positive report on O'Reilly on Thursday.""O'Reilly continues to prove itself as a net share gainer in a favorable retail sector, posting yet another strong beat,"" he wrote. ""We remain constructive on the company's long-term growth outlook.""Ciccarelli noted the quarter's results suggest trends ""remain healthy.""He raised his 2015 EPS estimate to $8.92 from $8.75 on same-store sales growth of 6.1%. He also increased his 2016 estimate to $10.25 a share from $10.05.O'Reilly has an IBD Composite Rating of 96 out of a possible 99. Advance has a 94 and LKQ a 92.Advance Auto Parts will report second-quarter results on Aug. 13.

1114,O,"Auto-parts wholesalers and retailers have been stellar performers during the long economic recovery, delivering steady earnings growth and mostly solid stock appreciation.Two stocks in the group, Advance Auto Parts (AAP) and Monro Muffler Brake (MNRO), offered contrasting responses Thursday to earnings reports.Earnings from Advance Auto Parts, which operates more than 5,200 stores, missed analysts' estimates on earnings and revenue, and the company lowered fiscal 2015 guidance.""Our first quarter results were softer than we expected primarily driven by the change impacts of our integration activities,"" said CFO Mike Norona.The stock opened 3% lower, but quickly reversed and traded higher for the rest of the day. The stock is carving out a flat base. Going back to February, the chart shows several ominous, red-volume spikes that denote institutional selling, but in recent days those have been replaced by blue spikes, signs institutions are getting interested.A buy point would be at 165.10.Monro wasn't quite so lucky with its earnings miss. The stock traded as much as 12% lower in the morning. Although it staged a comeback later in the day, it still left a gap on the daily chart. The stock did, however, find support at its 200-day line. The base it was building is now seriously damaged.In its latest report, Advanced Auto's EPS rose 6% from a year ago. Revenue rose 2%. That was the first time in four quarters that earnings weren't north of 28% and revenue wasn't above 47%. In the next report, analysts are forecasting a 12% EPS increase from a year earlier.The five-year annualized EPS growth rate is 17%.Monro's earnings rose 8%. The previous quarter's earnings were 4%, which marked a deceleration over several quarters.Revenue also rose 8%, the fifth straight quarter of year-over-year revenue increases in single digits.In the next quarter, analysts expect earnings to rise 19%.

Both stocks are near highs and have been riding along their 50-day moving averages.O'Reilly's EPS rose 28% in its most recent report. Analysts forecast an 18% increase in its next report.

"
1126,O,"Currency influences returns of stocks or markets when in the case of large exporters that derive much of their sales from foreign markets. There are a number of ways currency can flow through to company sales or other accounting metrics:  Revenue translation from foreign functional currencies is different than revenue from U.S. dollars. If a U.S. company keeps its prices constant in local currency terms, a declining euro or yen means less revenue translated back into U.S. dollars. If firms raise their local prices to try to keep their U.S. dollar revenue the same, they face the risk of becoming less competitive, of lowered demand and declining revenue.  Cash Held Abroad: If companies keep cash in foreign markets without any hedges in place, they can see a decrease in the cash on their balance sheets. There were 24 companies that saw a 7% loss in the total value of their cash in the first quarter of 2015.4 
"
1127,O,"o Some examples: Mondelez saw its total cash balance decrease year-over-year by 27% as of Q1 2015 due to currency moves—the greatest percentage decline of any S&P 500 firm—and Philip Morris International (which derives all its revenue from abroad) saw its cash balance decline by 20%. Also notable is McDonald's, which saw its total cash decline by over 10% due to currency moves.3

1134,O,"The U.S. dollar has become one of the critical macro drivers of the markets. A weakening Japanese yen started some of this latest macro trade in 2012—as the yen weakened and Japanese stocks1 soared over the last two-and-a-half years. Currency influences returns of stocks or markets when in the case of large exporters that derive much of their sales from foreign markets. There are a number of ways currency can flow through to company sales or other accounting metrics:  Revenue translation from foreign functional currencies is different than revenue from U.S. dollars. If a U.S. company keeps its prices constant in local currency terms, a declining euro or yen means less revenue translated back into U.S. dollars. If firms raise their local prices to try to keep their U.S. dollar revenue the same, they face the risk of becoming less competitive, of lowered demand and declining revenue.  Cash Held Abroad: If companies keep cash in foreign markets without any hedges in place, they can see a decrease in the cash on their balance sheets. There were 24 companies that saw a 7% loss in the total value of their cash in the first quarter of 2015.4 If the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen, this is likely to provide a continued headwind for the companies with meaningful revenue and business exposure in foreign markets. By contrast, if the U.S. dollar reverses, these firms will benefit.

1140,O,"Oil prices are nearing a magic number that could spur shale producers — who have become more efficient — to pump more, but Saudi Arabia will likely keep prices from rising much higher so it can defend its market share.
"
1141,O,"The world's top oil exporter has shown no signs of easing up on its strategy of keeping prices low to drive out higher-cost producers like U.S. shale firms. Saudi crude production hit a fresh record high last month: 10.3 million barrels a day.Saudi Arabia could put another million barrels a day or more on the market, said James Williams, an analyst at WTRG Economics. It would come in addition to the 2 million barrels a day in surplus output already coming from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.That means that the oil prices preferred by U.S. shale firms, which have become the swing producers that rebalance world oil markets, will be more pivotal.""OPEC's role shifted to allow U.S. shale producers to determine the maximum price for oil,"" Williams told IBD.Continental Resources (CLR) CEO Harold Hamm has said that a U.S. crude price of $70 per barrel would spark more production growth. Whiting Petroleum (WLL) recently said that it would add drilling rigs if crude prices hit $70.Hitting A Ceiling?Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) plans to add rigs in July if prices continue to stay around the low 60s or higher, and EOG Resources (EOG) said that it would boost production if prices stay around $65 per barrel.Markets have taken notice. Doubts are growing about whether oil's strong rally since April can be sustained. On Friday, U.S. crude futures dipped 0.3% to $59.69 a barrel, adding to a retreat from more than $61 a barrel, reached days earlier.Meanwhile, the collapse in U.S. oil rigs is starting to bottom out. Baker Hughes (BHI) said that the rig count dropped by eight in the last week, the smallest decline since December. And Energy Department data show that U.S. oil output has already peaked and is now tilting lower.WTRG's Williams said that there isn't a single magic number that would work across all shale companies, because production costs vary by play and within zones in each play. But he said that a U.S. price of about $75 per barrel would be enough to start increasing production.Any ramp-up in U.S. output could happen quickly. Even as prices plunged last fall and winter, shale companies continued drilling wells but held off on completing them. As a result, they can keep the oil in the ground in order to store it until prices rise enough for them to extract it profitably.Sitting On A 'Fracklog'A recent analysis by Bloomberg Intelligence puts this so-called ""fracklog,"" or backlog of wells, at 4,731, with 322,000 barrels a day underground.With this looming fracklog, and with oil prices nearing a green-light threshold for U.S. producers, OPEC members will likely maintain production levels at their next meeting June 5.In addition to forcing U.S. firms to cut production, the cartel's other goal is to stimulate the world economy with lower oil prices, according to Williams. Customers in key markets like Asia would then boost demand, helping OPEC and Saudi Arabia grow their market share.But as fracking becomes more efficient, the breakeven price for shale could get much lower, potentially pushing the Saudis to take the long-term threat of U.S. producers more seriously.U.S. firms have narrowed their focus to the most productive areas of a shale play, a practice called high grading. Oilfield-services companies have had to lower prices. Technology and techniques are still improving. For example, drillers have been ""zipper fracking"" — to tap multiple wells from a single drilling pad — to keep costs down.""There has been a lot of skepticism on (the Saudis') part regarding the long-term viability of U.S. shale,"" said Tamar Essner, energy analyst at Nasdaq Advisory Services. ""It just seems that they don't really believe in it as a long-term thing.""But she added that Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members are waiting to see what shale producers will do next as they become more efficient.

1165,O,"War On Terror: Another Islamist extremist has slaughtered unarmed American troops on home soil. Will this, too, be declared ""workplace violence"" — just like the last act of terrorism committed against our disarmed military?Here's what we knew at press time: An apparent lone gunman shot a barrage of gunfire at two military facilities in Tennessee, killing at least four Marines and wounding a soldier and a police officer. The shooter was killed, and the media quickly identified him as Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Kuwait.Far be it from us to rush to judgment, but just before the shooting an ISIS-linked Twitter account tweeted out: ""O Americans Dogs soon YOU Will see wonders #Chattanooga #USA #ISIS.""According to Jihad Watch, this tweet is similar to one sent out just before the attack on the ""Draw Muhammad"" cartoon event in Garland, Texas, last May, where two ISIS-linked gunmen opened fire.So this was almost certainly a terrorist attack by an Islamic extremist.But there's one key difference between this attack and the one in Garland: In Texas, the attack failed when an off-duty traffic cop took down the rifle-toting, body-armored Islamists Nadir Soofi and Elton Simpson with a single Glock pistol.That didn't happen in Tennessee. According to a screen grab posted on the Internet, Thursday's attacks were made on a gun-free military facility. Perhaps if the victims had been themselves carrying weapons, they would have been able to defend themselves.By the way, this is tragically similar to the 2009 Fort Hood attacks by Major Nidal Malik Hasan that left 13 dead and 30 wounded. The Obama administration then termed the slaughter of unarmed U.S. soldiers an instance of ""workplace violence"" — not terrorism.As at Ft. Hood, the Marines in Tennessee didn't appear to have any weapons. They were disarmed not by their attacker, but by a foolish federal policy that put them in danger. If even one of them had been armed, perhaps he could have stopped the attack.If our troops are going to be serially targeted by terrorists, as it now appears, shouldn't they at least be able to carry side arms to protect themselves?While we're at it, it would be an outrage to insult the American public and dishonor our four dead Marines by declaring this another instance of ""workplace violence,"" or any other such euphemistic nonsense.The name for this is terrorism.

Because oil contracts are largely denominated in dollars, the currency's appreciation puts downward pressure on crude prices.But the severity of the Greek crisis, like China's stock collapse, wasn't expected by markets and therefore not priced in, said Flynn, adding that the ripple effects of Greece leaving the eurozone are unknown.""Markets were caught by surprise that Greece has gotten to this point,"" he said.The prospect of Iranian oil returning to world markets, however, was priced in, and any nuclear deal that clears the way for oil exports still has to pass political hurdles, like getting congressional approval.""People have a sense that if an Iran deal is done we are going to be flooded with oil,"" Flynn said.

1191,O,"It's been an interesting week for anyone keeping an eye on the oil supply scene. On Wednesday, a tentative cease-fire began in the fighting between Saudi Arabia and Houthi rebels in Yemen.

"
1192,O,"Also on Wednesday, the International Energy Agency released its Oil Market Report for May, saying global supply continued to grow by 3.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in April.

1242,O,"""Designing for Driving"" should spotlight Android Auto, introduced at Google I/O 2014. Google's Web-connected car infotainment system is intended to bring to autos the features and apps that users already expect to find on their smartphones. Those features include navigation, music and, yes, even telephone service.
"
1243,O,"The system delivers the Android smartphone's features into their car dashboard displays and lets drivers use hands-free operation through voice commands or touchscreen controls.

1245,O,"Is Ara Nigh?
"
1246,O,"While Project Ara is not on the agenda, Google announced in January that it will launch its lower-cost, modular smartphone, known as Project Ara, later this year in a small pilot program in Puerto Rico.
"
1247,O,"Google wants Project Ara to lower the entry barrier for phone hardware manufacturers so there could be ""hundreds of thousands of developers"" instead of the current handful of big manufacturers, since anyone would be able to build a module without requiring a license or paying a fee.Look for thousands of tech pros to pack Google's (GOOGL) annual I/O extravaganza for Android app developers later this week, anticipating that the search leader will break out new products and put on workshops to help them create more uses for its popular mobile operating system.Historically, Google also takes the wraps off its newest version of Android during the event, and this I/O — being held in San Francisco Thursday and Friday — should be no exception.Google executives might even discuss a rumored ""buy button"" intended to streamline the sales process on Google's site and springboard the company into lucrative online shopping territory now controlled by e-commerce heavyweights Amazon.com (AMZN) and eBay (EBAY).While Google never completely pulls back the covers early, the company's agenda for this year's I/O shines some light on what to expect.Virtual Reality UpdateBoth the ""Designing for Virtual Reality"" and ""Make Believe"" sessions pledge to explore the virtual reality experience, an area where Google and Facebook (FB) are in a faceoff.Google reportedly has a virtual reality version of its Android mobile operating system under development to compete with Facebook, Samsung's Gear VR, Microsoft (MSFT)'s HoloLens, Taiwanese smartphone maker HTC's Vive and others, according to the Wall Street Journal.Last year, Google was lead investor in a $542 million round of funding for Magic Leap, a Florida-based startup creating an eyeglasses-like device that projects computer-generated images over a real-life setting. Separately, Google has another team testing a special electronic tablet that uses multiple cameras to ""augment reality"" by projecting images onto real-world objects, the WSJ report said.At I/O, expect a rundown of best practices in the rapid prototyping in virtual-reality development, and an update about what Google's virtual reality team has learned from creating its VR applications.Facebook, which spent $2 billion in 2014 to buy Oculus Rift virtual reality goggles-maker Oculus VR, has called virtual reality — an immersive, artificial world that consists of images and sounds created by a computer that is affected by the actions of the user — ""the next major computing platform that will come after mobile.""Skybox Rising?At ""The Earth in Real Time"" session, look for an update on the company's efforts to use Skybox to find ""the next step forward in satellite imaging and find new ways to help people use data from space to solve problems on Earth.""Google bought satellite imaging startup Skybox for $500 million last June, looking to Skybox's satellites to help keep Google Maps up-to-date. The company says it's also banking on Skybox's technology to help improve Internet access and disaster relief.Others companies, notably Facebook, also are looking for ways to bring the Internet to remote parts of the globe.Google's efforts include Project Loon, in which the company in 2013 launched 30 balloons to deliver 3G-like speeds to regions of New Zealand without Internet connection. The company said subsequent tests in New Zealand, California's Central Valley and northeast Brazil have been staged ""in preparation for the next stages of the project.""With its search business getting nipped by rivals, Google is moving into superfast fiber-optic broadband and video network service. Google has built out a fiber-optic network in parts of Kansas City, Mo.; Kansas City, Kan.; Austin, Texas; and Provo, Utah. Google Fiber provides 1 gigabit per second Internet service — roughly 100 times faster than the U.S. household average. Google also sells TV service via its fiber links.The Internet search leader has been in talks with many local governments to expand Google Fiber, although doing so would hike its capital spending.Executing 'Moonshots'""Helping Moonshots Survive Contact With the Real World"" features Google X, the search leader's hush-hush research facility that's backing development of the Google Glass wearable computer, glucose-monitoring contact lenses and other tech advancements designed to have major and lasting impacts.Google X leader Astro Teller will discuss what it takes to drive the innovation process by sharing lessons learned from such initiatives as Google's Project Loon high-altitude Wi-Fi balloons, driverless cars and Makani wind-energy kites.Feathering A 'Smart' Nest""Working With Nest to Build a Thoughtful Home Together"" promises to look beyond talk of the Internet of Things to opportunities arising from smart-home devices ranging from ceiling fans to security systems. Google bought Nest, the smart thermostat and smoke alarm company, in 2014 and later created the ""Works with Nest"" program to help other companies' devices operate with Nest products.The session description focuses on what can be done ""working behind the scenes"" to make homes ""safe, more energy efficient and more aware.""Last week, The Information reported that Google plans to launch software named ""Brillo"" for low-power embedded/wearable devices, including those in the Internet of Things category. Google is ""likely to release the software under the Android brand,"" The Information says.Web-Connected Cars""Designing for Driving"" should spotlight Android Auto, introduced at Google I/O 2014.

""A lot of naysayers have said that it wouldn't have worked in the $100 oil price environment because the cost of the wells were way too high.""Goodrich's stock price issues come from its weak balance sheet and concerns about its ability to weather the oil price drop, not from its wells in Tuscaloosa, he added.The company said it still has the ability to ""enhance liquidity by pursuing a potential joint venture or sale of its Eagle Ford Shale asset.""Shale producers held off on completing drilled wells to wait for oil prices to recover.

1291,O,"Management at Store Capital has had plenty of cause to celebrate since its IPO. Store Capital (STOR), which went public in November, provides real estate financing in single-tenant properties including chain restaurants, supermarkets, drugstores and other retail, service and distribution facilities.It's an internally managed real estate investment trust. The REIT acquires single-tenant properties directly from customers in sale-leaseback transactions, where customers sell Store Capital their operating properties and simultaneously enter into a long-term triple net lease with the company to lease the property back.It focuses mainly on middle-market companies, with annual gross revenue between $20 million and $300 million, but some are bigger. Among its customers are electronics retailer Conn's (CONN) and casual dining eatery operator O'Charley's.Sale-Leaseback DealsA sale-leaseback transaction ""frees up"" the original owner's capital, while allowing it to keep possession and use of the property, Store Capital's website notes. It ""takes the place of"" the debt and equity capital that a company would otherwise require to finance its real estate.""They're basically monetizing their real estate so they don't have to have a significant amount of capital tied up in real estate,"" SunTrust analyst Ki Bin Kim told IBD.A triple net lease is a lease structure in which the tenant is responsible for all expenses on the property, including taxes, insurance and maintenance, in addition to the rent.Since its IPO, Store Capital stock has risen 23% from its offering price of 18.50. Contributing to investor enthusiasm is the point that the company has delivered financial results beyond expectations.In the fourth quarter, its first quarterly report to shareholders as a public company, Store Capital logged net income of 18 cents a share, topping the consensus forecast of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for 11 cents. Rental revenue was $53 million. Total revenue rose 65% to $55.2 million. The REIT reported adjusted funds from operations of 35 cents a share for the quarter and $1.39 a share for the year.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect 2015 net income to slip 3% to 59 cents a share. But they see an 18% gain in 2016.""The triple net lease space is a very vibrant subsector in REITs,"" said Kim. ""We've seen a tremendous amount of transactions occur in the past couple of years. There's no sign of that slowing down for an acquirer with the right cost of capital. The business model continues to work for the triple net lease.""In 2014 the company invested $1.1 billion in 341 properties at an initial weighted average capitalization rate (a measure of return) of 8.3%.""This significant level of volume speaks to the important need we address in the marketplace as companies increasingly focus on managing capital more efficiently,"" said Store Capital CEO Christopher Volk in a statement.As of December 2014, the company's real estate portfolio totaled $2.8 billion in gross investment, representing 947 property locations, substantially all of which are profit centers for the company's customers, in 46 states. A hefty 97% of its properties are under triple net leases, which will serve to lessen its property cost, Volk added. In the fourth quarter, it originated $289.5 million of gross investments in 105 properties at an initial weighted average cap rate of 8%.""In their first earnings report (as a public company), they closed on more than expected acquisitions at a very healthy percentage yield,"" said Kim in commenting on the quarter. ""They did pretty well coming out of the gates.""Store Capital's assets have three payment sources, while other commercial real estate assets have just two, noted Volk on the fourth-quarter conference call.""The differentiator lies in the primary payment source, which is embedded in the profits produced at the properties that we own,"" he added. ""The remaining two payment sources reside in tenant credit quality and real estate residual values, which are payment sources that are common to all commercial real estate investments.""Fine In Dining And ShoppingThe service sector, which includes restaurants and fitness centers, is the company's biggest target market at 47%. Retail represents 37% and industrial is at 16%.The company invests primarily in retail properties, says Stifel analyst Simon Yarmak. He says its top industry is the restaurant sector, which accounts for 28% of Store Capital's rental revenue.How does Store Capital profit?""They hope to earn a spread on their cost of capital,"" said Yarmak. ""Say they're getting an initial 8% yield on the purchase. They hope to fund the acquisition with a cost of capital below that yield.""Here's how he explains it: ""Say the cost of capital is 6.5% and the yield is 8%. The company would earn an initial 150-basis-point spread on the transaction. If the lease is locked in for the next 15 to 20 years, Store Capital knows it's getting at least a 150-basis-point spread on the leases for the next 15 to 20 years.""Store Capital differs from its peers, which include REITs such as Realty Income (O), in a few ways.One way it differs is in the credit quality of its tenants, says Kim. ""It's not chasing investment-grade tenants,"" he said. ""To gain conviction and understanding regarding the tenant credit risk, it obtains information on the profit/loss details of the tenants they work with.""It also differs from its peer group in terms of the length of its leases, he adds. He says Store Capital's average lease term is 15 years vs. 11 years for its peer group.In terms of the outlook for Store Capital and its peers, ""the direction of interest rates will be an important determinant,"" said Kim.Store Capital is in IBD's Finance-Property REIT industry group, which also includes Simon Property Group (SPG) and Kimco Realty (KIM). Store Capital has an IBD Composite Rating of 93 out of a possible 99.

1351,O,"War On Terror: The administration reveals that a flawed U.S. drone strike left a 72-year-old American hostage of al-Qaida dead. Meanwhile, al-Qaida makes gains in destabilized Yemen. Enhanced interrogation, anyone?The global war on terror is not a video game. But the Obama administration is waging it like one — that is, when it's waging the war at all.Drones are a very useful military tool and will become even more so in the years ahead. Their ""pilots"" sit safely at consoles half a world away from the kill. Their computerization and robotics permit a level of accuracy and patience impossible for flesh-and-blood pilots.But it's like the too-common illusion that visual and audio technology has rendered on-the-ground intelligence gathering, conducted by actual human agents, obsolete. In fact, oversubstituting drones for soldiers, Marines or special forces can spell trouble.President Obama on Thursday told the nation, ""I take full responsibility for all our counterterrorism operations, including the one that inadvertently took the lives"" of Warren Weinstein, an elderly contractor for the U.S. Agency for International Development, and Italian Giovanni Lo Porto.They were ""tragically killed in a U.S. counterterrorism operation"" in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region in January, as the president described it.Weinstein's being a Jew apparently had much to do with the Islamist terrorist group taking him hostage and boasting publicly of it.""I profoundly regret what happened,"" Obama added, revealing that he ""directed that the existence of this operation be declassified and disclosed publicly ... because the Weinstein and Lo Porto families deserve to know the truth"" and ""because even as certain aspects of our national security efforts have to remain secret in order to succeed, the United States is a democracy committed to openness in good times and in bad.""Obama blamed ""the fog of war"" for such ""deadly mistakes,"" and actually exploited the tragedy to claim to embrace what he himself rarely does:""One of the things that makes us exceptional,"" he said, ""is our willingness to confront squarely our imperfections and to learn from our mistakes.""But this administration rarely learns from its mistakes. The ""hundreds of hours of surveillance"" that led the U.S. to the false belief ""that no civilians were present and that capturing these terrorists was not possible"" didn't result from the fog of war but from the fog of this president's certainty in his own faulty thinking.If the U.S. would do more to capture rather than ""take out dangerous members of al-Qaida,"" as the president put it Thursday, we might be able to glean information from them that would prevent blunders that leave Americans or other Westerners dead.And one key method of doing so is by getting tough on captured terrorists via enhanced interrogation techniques (EITs) — a useful way that Obama has forsworn.Obama's own CIA director, John O. Brennan, only last December stressed, ""There was information obtained subsequent to the application of EITs from detainees that was useful in the bin Laden operation."" He added, ""As a matter of fact, the information that they provided was used"" in the Navy SEAL assault that took out Osama bin Laden nearly four years ago.Enhanced interrogation, wrongly characterized as torture, could also have provided timely intelligence that would help stop al-Qaida from seizing power in a destabilized Yemen, where Iranian-backed Houthis have a weak hold on power.Instead, in this country where the whole objective of U.S. policy was to constrain al-Qaida, the terrorist group this month seized a major airport, a sea port and an oil terminal. So our policy has failed.Unfortunately, whether on domestic or foreign policy, this is a dronemaster-in-chief who can't learn from his mistakes, because neither he nor those who surround him believe he makes any.

1397,O,"Iran Deal: President Obama confirms that he is flexible as Jell-O on getting a nuclear weapons agreement. Meanwhile, a key senator warns that even Iran's negotiators may not know the regime's true intentions.It should have been clear a very long time ago to all but the most starry-eyed that Iran's approach to the nuclear weapons talks is that it's nothing but a game.These are not straightforward negotiations, where both sides consist of reasonable people. And if the theory put forth by Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker is correct — that even Tehran's negotiators have been kept ignorant of their regime's intentions about building nukes so they can appear to negotiate in good faith — they go beyond even the duplicity of U.S. dealings with the Soviet Union.Corker told CNN over the weekend that the Iranians who sit across the table from Secretary of State John Kerry in Switzerland may know so little, they ""could pass a lie detector test."" Corker, R-Tenn., then asked: ""If the negotiators don't even know on behalf of Iran all the things Iran has been doing, how are we going to know?""Corker and his Democrat counterpart on the foreign relations panel, Ben Cardin of Maryland, want Congress to have 52 days to vet the deal-not-a-treaty that's supposed to be finalized before a June 30 deadline. He pointed out that the Ayatollah Khamenei's account of what has been agreed to regarding the removal of sanctions and United Nations inspections of Iranian facilities is completely different from what the Obama administration has claimed.But President Obama himself is now saying that the ""fact sheet"" he put out a few weeks ago may soon have far different facts. On Friday, he suggested lifting sanctions at the time a nuclear deal is reached, rather than phase out those punitive measures. How? Through ""creative negotiations."" Oh, and by the way, Obama hasn't changed his position.You can add it as an absolute, alongside death and taxes, that once sanctions are lifted, there is no re-imposing them. When — not if — Tehran cheats, the decision will go to a new international bureaucracy, which will take forever to make a decision.And all the while, Russia and China will be insisting that the wrong decision be made on the Islamist power whose nuclear program and missiles exist only because of Moscow and Beijing's decades of assistance.Obama has practically accused of treason those senators who wrote to the ayatollah last month warning him that, as far as the U.S. Constitution goes, a deal may not really be a deal at all.Yet here he is ""creatively"" bending over backwards for an agreement — any agreement, it seems — with an enemy so threatening that he simultaneously sends an aircraft carrier and a guided-missile cruiser to prevent Iranian arms shipments to Yemen this week, where pro-Iranian Houthis have taken over.This clearly is a game, not a serious negotiation. And in this game, Iran is checkmating America into a corner.

1408,O,"President Obama insists Islamic State terrorists have ""twisted"" the teachings of Islam, drawing ""selectively from the Islamic texts."" But the president is doing some twisting of his own.
"
1409,O,"In fact, he regularly misquotes Islamic scripture to make his case the terrorists don't represent Islam.
"
1410,O,"For example, while hosting last week's ""Summit on Countering Violent Extremism,"" Obama recited a verse from the Muslim holy book like so: ""The Quran says whoever kills an innocent, it is as if he has killed all mankind.""
"
1411,O,"He held the sacred passage up as proof Islam condemns killing and ""calls for peace.""
"
1412,O,"It wasn't the first time Obama has trotted out that phrase. He used it most notably during his 2009 speech to Muslims in Cairo, when he said: ""The Holy Quran teaches that whoever kills an innocent, it is as if he has killed all mankind; and the Holy Quran also says whoever saves a person, it is as if he has saved all mankind.""
"
1413,O,"A beautiful passage — if only it were as he states it.
"
1414,O,"The Quranic verse the president quotes — 5:32 — actually condones killing those who ""murder"" Muslims, ""wage war against Allah"" or spread ""mischief in the land.""
"
1415,O,"Mischief is defined as ""treason against Allah,"" and the very next verse — 5:33 — calls for guilty infidels to be beheaded. Obama glosses over all of this in his version.
"
1416,O,"Here's the full text of the relevant verse (5:32), according to even the watered-down translation of the Quran approved and distributed by American Muslim groups, including the Council on American-Islamic Relations.
"
1417,O,"Note the key section that Obama omits from his speeches:
"
1418,O,"""(I)f anyone slew a person — unless it be for murder or for spreading mischief in the land — it would be as if he slew the whole people. And if anyone saved a life, it would be as if he saved the life of the whole people. Then although there came to them our Messengers with clear signs, yet, even after that, many of them continued to commit excesses in the land.""
"
1419,O,"The hammer comes down in the next verse, 5:33: ""The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger, and strive with might and main for mischief through the land is: execution, or crucifixion, or the cutting off of hands and feet from opposite sides, or exile from the land: That is their disgrace in this world, and a heavy punishment is theirs in the hereafter.""
"
1420,O,"In the Quran's footnotes, widely respected translator Abdullah Yusuf Ali, who died in 1953, interpreted ""mischief"" as ""treason against Allah."" Ali defined ""execution"" as ""cutting off of the head.""
"
1421,O,"The clause starting with ""unless"" can be, and is, cited by IS jihadists to justify their atrocities, along with countless other violent injunctions in the Quran. And the penalties plainly prescribed by the Quran are precisely the ones they are carrying out against Christians and Jews they believe are ""warring against Allah,"" and against Muslim ""apostates"" they've sentenced as traitors against Allah.
"
1422,O,"To be clear, Christians are not spared this brutal Islamic ""justice."" They are not among Obama's ""innocent"" any more than the Jews. Just 15 verses earlier, in 5:17, the Quran states: ""In blasphemy indeed are those that say that Allah is Christ the son of Mary.""
"
1423,O,"Later in the same chapter, or surah, the Quran instructs believers to take ""life for life, nose for nose, ear for ear, tooth for tooth, and (inflict) wounds equal for equal"" while fighting Jews and Christians. ""O ye who believe! Take not the Jews and Christians for your friends.""
"
1424,O,"So the context is clear. It's also clear that it's Obama who's drawing selectively from the Islamic texts. He is mistaken when he claims Muslims are commanded to respect all human life. And he is misleading the American people when he says such things with the full force and authority of his office.
"
1425,O,"It's odd that a student of Islam would misquote a core passage in the Muslim holy book. Obama has Muslim family roots and studied the Quran as a student in Indonesia. Is he dissembling? Or is he naively parroting the white lies he gathers from Islamic apologists and Muslim Brotherhood leaders posing as moderates?
"
1426,O,"One of his top Islamic advisers, ex-Islamic Society of North America President Imam Mohamed Magid, is known to gloss over the violent parts of that same sacred text in defending Islam.
"
1427,O,"""The Quran says whoever takes one life, it is as if he has taken the life of all of humanity,"" Magid recently told reporters. A member of Obama's Homeland Security Advisory Council, Magid had a prime seat at last week's summit.
"
1428,O,"Muslim reformers say misleading politicians and media about Islamic scripture is a common trick employed by Muslim leaders to create a facade of moderation and protect Islam from due scrutiny. They count on non-Muslim pundits never reading the Quranic text for themselves and independently verifying the interpretations they are fed.
"
1429,O,"Irshad Manji, for one, says Muslim scholars and clerics perform a ""fancy dance of evasion"" when they maintain that nothing in the Quran authorizes killing people.
"
1430,O,"""Post-September 11, I repeatedly heard this mantra from Muslims: The Quran makes it absolutely clear when jihad can and can't be pursued, and that terrorists unquestionably broke the rules,"" says Manji, author of ""The Trouble With Islam Today: A Muslim's Call for Reform in Her Faith.""
"
1431,O,"""To quote one such voice, Allah 'says in unequivocal terms that to kill an innocent being is like killing entire humanity.'""
"
1432,O,"But that is ""wishful whitewashing,"" she says. ""You know the chapter and verse that's cited as 'unequivocal'? It actually bestows some wiggle room. Here's how it reads:
"
1433,O,"""Whoever killed a human being — except as punishment for murder or other villainy in the land — shall be regarded as having killed all mankind.' Sadly, the clause starting with 'except' can be deployed by militant Muslims to fuel their jihads.""
"
1434,O,"It's extremely telling that the apologists — including the president — can cite only one verse in the Quran to dispute the growing belief that Islam is inherently violent, and then they have to dishonestly abridge that verse to disguise its underlying violent meaning.
"
1435,O,"""It's a lie,"" Obama asserts, that the Islamist enemy is getting its ideas from Islam. He says that while lying by omission about the scriptural source of those ideas.
"
1436,O," Sperry, formerly IBD Washington bureau chief, is author of ""Infiltration: How Muslim Spies and Subversives Have Penetrated Washington.""President Obama insists Islamic State terrorists have ""twisted"" the teachings of Islam, drawing ""selectively from the Islamic texts.""

1471,O,"Retailers hit a rough patch in March as severe winter weather, an economic speed bump and merchandise delays resulting from the West Coast port disruptions dragged down results, leading to the month's sales gains falling below views.
"
1472,O,"Even amid the headwinds, L Brands (LB), Stein Mart (SMRT), Cato Corp. (CATO) and PriceSmart (PSMT) came shining through with same-store sales that sailed past views, according to data out Thursday.
"
1473,O,"March sales at stores open at least a year rose 0.5% vs. a year earlier, according to Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics. Analysts expected a 1% gain.
"
1474,O,"The results were weighed down by a big miss from warehouse club giant Costco Wholesale (COST), Perkins says. The company saw March same-store sales slide 2% from a year earlier, short of views for a 0.3% decline.
"
1475,O,"That was the typical top retail performer's first decline in monthly same-store sales since August 2009, Perkins says.
"
1476,O,"Fuel And The Freeze
"
1477,O,"Costco's core U.S. same-store sales, ex gas and the effects of foreign exchange rates, were up a ""much healthier"" 4%, said Perkins. Still, they were below views for a 5.5% gain.
"
1478,O,"""Costco was a huge drag on the month,"" Perkins told IBD. ""Part of that was attributable to them having lower year-over-year gas prices, and foreign currency translations also weighed on their sales.""
"
1479,O,"The month's results were a mixed bag.
"
1480,O,"Harsh winter weather conditions in parts of the U.S. such as the Northeast ""weighed on sales"" in those areas, said Perkins.
"
1481,O,"Consumers weren't in the mood to buy seasonal goods like patio furniture and bathing suits or apparel when they were ""freezing,"" he said.
"
1482,O,"But Jacksonville, Fla.-based Stein Mart and Charlotte, N.C.-based Cato, located in the South, where the weather was better, posted double-digit gains in March same-store sales, he adds.
"
1483,O,"""Weather clearly played a big role overall (on the March results), both positive and negative,"" Perkins said.
"
1484,O,"Another factor weighing on March sales was a slowdown in the economy in the first quarter, he adds. Perkins notes retailers also missed sales opportunities because of delays from late shipments due to the West Coast labor dispute.
"
1485,O,"""Overall I would not read too much into the March numbers,"" Perkins said. ""The jobs market stands on pretty solid footing, and with warmer temperatures I would expect May, June and July sales to show significant improvement from the first quarter.""
"
1486,O,"April Outlook
"
1487,O,"This month is apt to be weak, Perkins says, mainly because the early Easter this year, on April 5, pushed holiday-related sales into March.
"

1501,O,"Michael Niemira, chief economist at the research firm Retail Economist, calculates March same-store sales rose 0.2% vs. a year earlier.
"
1502,O,"He called the month's sales performance ""dismal.""
"
1503,O,"Why? ""At the end of the day, the flat reading doesn't pick up any Easter lift to the numbers, and (the month) was weaker than the January and February performance,"" he told IBD.
"
1504,O,"He expects April same-store sales to rise 1% vs. a year earlier amid tough comparisons with last year, when April same-store sales rose 6.2%.
"
1505,O,"But overall, retailers should see better days, Perkins says.
"
1506,O,"""I don't think you can extrapolate where the consumer stands from the March results and the related speed bumps (during the month),"" said Perkins. ""Consumer confidence is near the cycle high, gas prices remain low, interest rates remain low and the labor market is on solid footing. I think those factors should bode well for better economic growth in the second and third quarters, which should lead to better retail sales.""
"
1507,O,"Still, he cautions that the vast majority of lower- and midincome consumers are not really seeing rising pay.
"
1508,O,"""The ability for consumers to spend is still tied to significant wage gains, which haven't materialized,"" he said.
"
1509,O,"Perkins said the high-end consumer is ""driving the lion's share of spending.""
"
1510,O,"And they're buying a lot of cars. Perkins says the auto segment is doing better than other retail segments. That bodes well for auto parts retailers such as O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY), AutoZone (AZO) and Advance Auto Parts (AAP).
"
1511,O,"High-end retailers such as Tiffany & Co. (TIF) and Kate Spade (KATE) are among the luxury retailers Perkins cites as doing well. He says off-price apparel retail operators such as Ross Stores (ROST) and TJX Cos. (TJX) are also faring well.
"
1512,O,"Niemira, looking toward the summer, expects apparel will be one of the stronger retail categories, driven by ""pent-up demand.""
"
1513,O,"Overall, he sees an improvement in the pace of same-store sales growth for the broad retail industry to around 2.5% vs. a 1% to 1.5% pace in the first quarter.Retailers hit a rough patch in March as severe winter weather, an economic speed bump and merchandise delays resulting from the West Coast port disruptions dragged down results, leading to the month's sales gains falling below views.Even amid the headwinds, L Brands (LB), Stein Mart (SMRT), Cato Corp. (CATO) and PriceSmart (PSMT) came shining through with same-store sales that sailed past views, according to data out Thursday.March sales at stores open at least a year rose 0.5% vs. a year earlier, according to Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics. Analysts expected a 1% gain.The results were weighed down by a big miss from warehouse club giant Costco Wholesale (COST), Perkins says. The company saw March same-store sales slide 2% from a year earlier, short of views for a 0.3% decline.That was the typical top retail performer's first decline in monthly same-store sales since August 2009, Perkins says.Fuel And The FreezeCostco's core U.S. same-store sales, ex gas and the effects of foreign exchange rates, were up a ""much healthier"" 4%, said Perkins. Still, they were below views for a 5.5% gain.""Costco was a huge drag on the month,"" Perkins told IBD. ""Part of that was attributable to them having lower year-over-year gas prices, and foreign currency translations also weighed on their sales.""The month's results were a mixed bag.Harsh winter weather conditions in parts of the U.S. such as the Northeast ""weighed on sales"" in those areas, said Perkins.Consumers weren't in the mood to buy seasonal goods like patio furniture and bathing suits or apparel when they were ""freezing,"" he said.But Jacksonville, Fla.-based Stein Mart and Charlotte, N.C.-based Cato, located in the South, where the weather was better, posted double-digit gains in March same-store sales, he adds.""Weather clearly played a big role overall (on the March results), both positive and negative,"" Perkins said.Another factor weighing on March sales was a slowdown in the economy in the first quarter, he adds. Perkins notes retailers also missed sales opportunities because of delays from late shipments due to the West Coast labor dispute.""Overall I would not read too much into the March numbers,"" Perkins said. ""The jobs market stands on pretty solid footing, and with warmer temperatures I would expect May, June and July sales to show significant improvement from the first quarter.""April OutlookThis month is apt to be weak, Perkins says, mainly because the early Easter this year, on April 5, pushed holiday-related sales into March.The month's standouts are L Brands (which owns Victoria's Secret), value-priced apparel seller Cato and regional discount retail operator Stein Mart.L Brands posted a 9% increase in same-store sales for March, topping views for a 5.8% gain.

1519,O,"An ax can be either a useful tool or a dangerous weapon. In stock charts, the 50-day moving average has a similar dual nature. The 50-day moving average takes a stock's prior 50 closes and averages them. Do this every day in an upward-trending stock, and you'll get a line on a chart that runs below the stock's price bars while smoothing out the jumps and buckles.
"
1520,O,"The line serves a startling number of uses. When a stock is basing, a cup base with more than half of its bulk above rather than below the line is a sign of health. Another sign of a stock's strength: a flat base that finds ""support"" at its 50-day line.
"
1521,O,"What is support? Institutional investors often use the 50-day or 10-week line as a reference point, stepping in to add shares to their positions when a stock pulls back to the moving average. This buying creates upward pressure — or price support — to help keep the stock's prices above that moving average.
"
1522,O,"This is why rising stocks often rebound from their 50-day lines, turning brief pullbacks into follow-on buying opportunities. It is also why 50-day and 10-week moving averages tend to cradle advances that can run across many months.
"
1523,O,"On the dangerous side, a rallying stock that collapses below 50-day support in heavy volume is often sending a sell signal. Once below that line, institutional investors may use the 50-day line to mark a sell level. Short sellers may use the line as a level at which to sell shares short.
"
1524,O,"These forces create a level of resistance. Stocks often need a large boost of buying power to muscle back above their 50-day lines after losing that level of support.
"
1525,O,"There are other, similar moving averages. Most common is the 10-week moving average. This line tracks a stock's weekly closes over the prior 10 weeks. It generally tracks fairly close to the 50-day line. So if you are reading a daily chart, use the 50-day line. If you're analyzing a weekly chart, use the 10-week.
"
1526,O,"There is a similar relationship between the long-term 200-day and 40-week averages. On a daily chart, use the 200-day. On a weekly chart, it's the 40-week line.

It would ""reunite Kraft's global grocery brands (e.g. Philadelphia) and give Heinz's international business needed scale.""But combining brands might not always be the best strategy, as a recent PwC report cautions.""It's no longer an asset-based game. Large, diversified food companies are struggling to compete with smaller, more focused enterprises,"" noted authors J. Neely and John Potter. ""These companies need to be thinking beyond scale about what it is they do better than anyone else.""

1663,O,"IBD 50 companies of all kinds are expected to report solid quarterly results in the coming week, potentially an indication that the gears driving our tech, retail, auto, medical and defense sectors are moving more freely. Here's a look at what analysts expect.NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) — the security chipmaker that helps keep your Apple Pay transactions safe — reports fourth-quarter results after the close on Wednesday.The Netherlands-based company, which recently introduced technology allowing drivers to lock and unlock their cars via their phones, owes much of its success to the immense popularity of Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 6, of which NXP is a supplier.Analysts expect NXP's EPS to springboard up 33% to $1.32 — the strongest gain of any of the IBD 50 stocks reviewed here. Revenue is seen increasing 17% to $1.51 billion.NXP shares emerged from a first-stage flat base this month but have rattled around near their 50-day line, where investors will often buy shares if they have faith in the company. The stock has ascended 82% since 2014.Shares slipped 0.7% on the stock market Friday but are still holding above a buy point and are in buy range.Medical-device maker Edwards Lifesciences (EW) reports on Tuesday. The company's artificial heart valve, Sapien, has helped keep gains aloft in recent quarters.Analysts expect earnings per share to rise 4% from a year earlier to 95 cents. Revenue is expected to rise 14% to $610.5 million.Edwards' Q3 results in October indicated to analysts that growth in the global transcatheter aortic valve replacement market continues to exceed expectations.The stock is up about 86% in the last year but in recent weeks has converged with its 50-day line. Shares fell 3% Friday to below that key level of support.As more business adapts to so-called omnichannel retailing — in which customers might use a combination of online and in-store outlets to buy products — Manhattan Associates' (MANH) supply-chain-management software helps them keep track of the orders.When the company reports Q4 results on Tuesday, analysts expect to see EPS rise 16% to 28 cents and revenue elevate 10% to $118.9 million.Since July 2012, the last time the stock spent any extended time below its 200-day line, Manhattan shares have risen more than 300%.Shares tripped up last November after trying to clear a cup-with-handle base begun in March. But they ricocheted up off their 50-day line in early January and have remained above it since.Car-dealer operator Asbury Auto (ABG) has thrived in recent years on the auto industry's rebound. Analysts expect the company, which reports Q4 results on Wednesday, to grow EPS by 15% to $1.01, though that would mark the slowest growth since Q3 2011. Sales are seen increasing 8% to $1.48 billion.Shares entered into a sixth-stage consolidation from July through November and have been seeking support at their 50-day line for most of January. The later the stage, the greater a stock's chance of topping out, IBD research finds. Still, shares are up 48% since 2014.O'Reilly Auto Parts (ORLY) also reports Q4 results Wednesday. With more cars lasting longer, the company has benefited from part replacements. As the months get colder, O'Reilly could also see sales pick up from repairs to winter-ravaged cars.Spirit Aerosystems (SPR) — a company whose propulsion, fuselage and wing systems go into military aircraft and passenger jets — reports Q4 results Tuesday. Analysts see EPS increasing 17% to 76 cents. Revenue is expected to rise 12% to $1.674 billion.Spirit serves such companies as defense contractor General Dynamics (GD) and aerospace giant Boeing (BA), which this week both reported estimate-topping Q4 results.Spirit shares cleared a flat base and have found support at their 50-day line.Apparel retailer Under Armour (UA), whose 'athleisure' wear continues to attract the athletic and the leisured alike, reports Q4 results Wednesday after the close.Analysts see EPS escalating 30% to 39 cents and revenue rising 24% to $849.63 million, which would continue a slight deceleration in sales gains over the past three quarters.Citigroup this month upgraded Under Armour to buy, citing the company's domestic and international prospects. But that upgrade came a day after Jefferies downgraded the stock, citing ""few near-term catalysts and valuation that accurately reflects the company's long-term growth prospects.""Under Armour stock cleared a fourth-stage cup-with-handle base on Thursday but struggled for momentum Friday as they slipped 1%.

1664,O,"Adm. Hyman Rickover was not a fan of neat formulas.Leadership to him meant so much more than coloring by the numbers.He openly dissed hidebound Navy brass and infuriated defense contractors, resulting in repeated efforts to end his career.Those moves to ax him backfired, as allies in Congress and the public saw him as a hero, standing up to corruption and incompetence.Their backing helped him serve 63 years of active duty, a record.""He didn't think case studies in schools, books or seminars, designing a grand strategic theory, hiring consultants and relying on formal organizational charts had any meaning,"" Tim Foster, a former Rickover senior staff member, told IBD.The Rickover Direction""These, he believed, tended to limit individual creativity, initiative and personal responsibility, and the only thing that counted was the experience that would help form good judgment, which needed to be honed with constant training,"" said Foster, author of ""Technology and Leadership: Hyman G. Rickover"" in the volume ""The Art of Command,"" edited by Harry Laver and Jeffrey Matthews. ""Rickover was arguably the most significant technical leader in U.S. military history.""Rickover drove the creation of the nuclear Navy, whose submarines served as a gun to the head of any Soviet leader who might be tempted to incinerate America.Rickover (1900-86) was born Chaim Godalia Rickover to a Jewish family in Makow Mazowiecki, Poland, then ruled by Russia.The Rickovers fled persecution in 1906, arriving in New York City and soon moving to the Chicago suburb of Lawndale, where the patriarch worked as a tailor.As a Western Union messenger during high school, Hyman got to know his congressman, who recommended him to the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md.But Rickover was not ready for the entrance exam, so he paid for a preparatory class. He quickly realized that it was over his head, dropped out and did his own intensive study, passing the algebra portion by one-tenth of a point.Graduating in 1922, he was commissioned as an ensign and assigned to a destroyer, learning every facet of its operation. Then he served on five other ships, his only command being on a minesweeper in 1937.He was allowed ashore to earn a master's degree in electrical engineering from Columbia University in 1929. Two years later, he married fellow student Ruth Masters, and they would have one child. After Ruth's death in 1972, he married Eleonore Bednowicz.A big break came in 1939, when he was promoted to lieutenant commander and made assistant chief of the electrical section of the Bureau of Ships in Washington, D.C. He immediately demonstrated his disregard for fiefdoms, rules and politics, implementing crucial responsibilities for the officer in charge of each system and component. Superiors who admired him helped him bypass the bureaucracy and get things done.Sparking DefenseRickover inspected the wreckage at Pearl Harbor in December 1941 and oversaw repairs to the electrical plant. This experience convinced him that the Navy needed tougher equipment. He was promoted to commander and captain the same year, as he became the scourge of the Pentagon's cozy relationship with contractors. In 1945, he was awarded the Legion of Merit for the dramatic improvement of his section.""In his first two decades with the Navy, he hadn't performed well in the two roles the Navy valued most, command at sea and performance under fire, which is why he wasn't given any direct military responsibility during the war,"" said Dave Oliver, a former nuclear submarine commander under Rickover and author of ""Against the Tide: Rickover's Leadership Principles and the Rise of the Nuclear Navy."" ""But as it turned out, he was a late bloomer as a great leader.""In 1946, a year after World War II ended, Rickover was assigned to the Manhattan Project to determine atomic applications for the Navy. He persuaded his superiors that a specially designed reactor could power ships.Wearing two hats as head of the Navy's new nuclear program and director of the Atomic Energy Commission's naval reactor division, he had the clout to cut through red tape and produce the USS Nautilus, the world's first nuclear submarine, in just eight years.High GearOver 200 subs and a couple of dozen carriers and destroyers, all powered by nuclear engines, would be constructed — some with strategic ballistic missiles and, later, cruise missiles for combat.""His attention to detail, commitment to excellence, almost round-the-clock availability, insistence on thorough vetting of issues, quick and decisive actions with documented rationale and the directness with which he leveled criticism, with no punishment for those who argued with him, help explain why so many found working with him so fulfilling, despite his reputation for being a tough boss,"" said Foster.Rickover believed that personal responsibility, absolute integrity and constant training were necessary to make sure that this dangerous fleet was kept 100% safe.He refused to delegate interviews with applicants to the program, conducting thousands of often tense discussions in which he tested their ability to handle pressure.As the Soviets ramped up their nuclear sub program, their scientists did a good job creating ships that were fast and quiet, building twice as many as all other nations combined. But America maintained the lead on stealth — turning subs invisible to sonar and thermal imaging — which forced the Soviets to spend heavily in an ultimately unsuccessful effort to locate them.The U.S. also never had a serious accident; the Soviets had 14 known major nuclear naval disasters.Rickover's domestic enemies made sure that he was passed over for promotion in 1951 and 1952. That should have ended his career, according to Navy rules. But his fans in the Senate held up confirmation of 39 admirals to keep him on. In 1958 he was raised to vice admiral and received the first of two Congressional Gold Medals.""He was protected by every president, since they knew this was our only answer to Russia and a matter of our survival, more than the public realized,"" said Oliver. ""His program of continuous technical improvement produced submarines that were so advanced, they could penetrate all underwater defenses and were essentially invulnerable, controlling what moved on the surface of oceans and deep beneath.""In the 1960s, Rickover testified to Congress about how defense contractors were bilking taxpayers. He asserted that those who were crooked about financial matters would also cut corners in safety and technology. Congress responded with the Cost Accounting Standards Board in 1970.In 1973, President Nixon finally awarded Rickover his fourth star.The Navy man continued to make waves, targeting the nation's three largest shipbuilders, which had filed $3 billion in cost overruns. He argued that the system rewarded contract winners that low-balled estimates and expected the government to bail them out.The EndThe admiral resigned in January 1982 and died four years later at age 86. His burial site at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia overlooks President Kennedy's Eternal Flame. The admiral had given JFK a fisherman's prayer that landed on a plaque in the Oval Office and read: ""O God, thy sea is so great and my boat is so small.""""The pressure on the Soviet leaders, who knew their nuclear-assured second-strike capability was placed at risk by the American submarines, finally affected their psyche,"" said Oliver. ""In December 1989, off Malta, when President Bush met with President Gorbachev, Bush was handed the Soviet leader's morning intelligence report by Marshal Akhromeyev, who said, 'We have read every one of your submarine messages for 10 years and have been unable to find or kill even one of them. We quit.'""

1675,O,"When a stock falls in heavy volume, it's not always a bad sign.
"
1676,O,"In fact, it can be healthy, depending on the stock's action by the week's end and where that sharp decline happens within the stock's base.
"
1677,O,"One element of a great base is a positive reversal, in which a stock falls in heavy volume but bounces back, ending up for the day or week. Or it finishes in the upper 60% of its trading range.
"
1678,O,"A stock that's able to recover most or all of its lost ground after, say, disappointing earnings news or an analyst downgrade is showing bullish action. That's especially true if volume on the reversal is heavy.
"
1679,O,"That volume tells you institutions are helping to prop up the stock as others sell.
"
1680,O,"Sometimes a positive reversal can be a buying opportunity, such as when a stock reverses higher after getting support at its 50-day or 10-week moving average. In such cases, volume should be above average or at least up from the previous week or day.
"
1681,O,"O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY), an auto parts retailer, began shaping a base-on-base pattern in July 2011. Both structures showed tight trading with weekly trading ranges of less than 10%, another sign of institutional support.
"
1682,O,"The left side of the first pattern, a cup base, shows five straight weekly declines, including three in heavy volume. In two of those weeks, the stock ended in the lower half of its weekly range. Such action early in the base-building process is normal.
"
1683,O,"What happens at the bottom of the base is very important. O'Reilly's action was positive, as the stock staged an upside reversal after hitting bottom in the week ended Aug. 5 (1). Volume was heavy as the stock rebounded off its low to end in the upper 60% of its weekly range.
"
1684,O,"The following week was also an upside reversal in heavy volume that marked the start of a six-week run during which the stock cleared a 66.62 buy point.
"
1685,O,"O'Reilly sported Composite and Earnings Per Share ratings of 97 and 89 respectively when it broke out Sept. 6.
"
1686,O,"Furthermore, the Retail/Wholesale-Auto Parts industry group had jumped 72 places in six weeks, to No. 11 out of 197.
"
1687,O,"The company was faring well as cost-conscious consumers began keeping their cars longer, pushing up the average of vehicles on the road to record highs. However, volume on O'Reilly's breakout was below average and failed to pick up as the stock rose to a high of 72 on Sept. 19.
"
1688,O,"Investors could have been forgiven for refraining from buying despite the stock's strong fundamentals and the fact that the market was in a confirmed uptrend.
"
1689,O,"In such cases, patience is often rewarded. That was the case with O'Reilly, which pulled back to its 10-week line as it formed the second part of the pattern — a flat base with a buy point at 72.10 (2). The bottom of that base shows another positive reversal, albeit in light volume.
"
1690,O,"The breakout came Oct. 27, with O'Reilly gapping up 8% in volume that was 96% above average. From there, O'Reilly began a steady climb to a peak of 107.13 in the week ended April 27, 2012 — 61% above the 66.62 cup buy point and 49% above the flat base entry.

1691,O,"The stock then began a yearlong consolidation before moving on to new highs.When a stock falls in heavy volume, it's not always a bad sign.In fact, it can be healthy, depending on the stock's action by the week's end and where that sharp decline happens within the stock's base.One element of a great base is a positive reversal, in which a stock falls in heavy volume but bounces back, ending up for the day or week. Or it finishes in the upper 60% of its trading range.A stock that's able to recover most or all of its lost ground after, say, disappointing earnings news or an analyst downgrade is showing bullish action. That's especially true if volume on the reversal is heavy.That volume tells you institutions are helping to prop up the stock as others sell.Sometimes a positive reversal can be a buying opportunity, such as when a stock reverses higher after getting support at its 50-day or 10-week moving average. In such cases, volume should be above average or at least up from the previous week or day.O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY), an auto parts retailer, began shaping a base-on-base pattern in July 2011. Both structures showed tight trading with weekly trading ranges of less than 10%, another sign of institutional support.The left side of the first pattern, a cup base, shows five straight weekly declines, including three in heavy volume. In two of those weeks, the stock ended in the lower half of its weekly range. Such action early in the base-building process is normal.What happens at the bottom of the base is very important. O'Reilly's action was positive, as the stock staged an upside reversal after hitting bottom in the week ended Aug. 5 (1). Volume was heavy as the stock rebounded off its low to end in the upper 60% of its weekly range.The following week was also an upside reversal in heavy volume that marked the start of a six-week run during which the stock cleared a 66.62 buy point.O'Reilly sported Composite and Earnings Per Share ratings of 97 and 89 respectively when it broke out Sept. 6.Furthermore, the Retail/Wholesale-Auto Parts industry group had jumped 72 places in six weeks, to No. 11 out of 197.The company was faring well as cost-conscious consumers began keeping their cars longer, pushing up the average of vehicles on the road to record highs. However, volume on O'Reilly's breakout was below average and failed to pick up as the stock rose to a high of 72 on Sept. 19.Investors could have been forgiven for refraining from buying despite the stock's strong fundamentals and the fact that the market was in a confirmed uptrend.In such cases, patience is often rewarded. That was the case with O'Reilly, which pulled back to its 10-week line as it formed the second part of the pattern — a flat base with a buy point at 72.10 (2). The bottom of that base shows another positive reversal, albeit in light volume.The breakout came Oct. 27, with O'Reilly gapping up 8% in volume that was 96% above average. From there, O'Reilly began a steady climb to a peak of 107.13 in the week ended April 27, 2012 — 61% above the 66.62 cup buy point and 49% above the flat base entry.The stock then began a yearlong consolidation before moving on to new highs.

"
1734,O,"Ray Kroc steered McDonald's to the top of fast food. His winning recipe? He was flexible, nurtured franchisee relationships and reacted to business challenges with an open mind.""Just as Henry Ford's idea was brought to reality through hard work, perseverance, just plain doggedness and above all faith, so McDonald's astounding success was achieved through those same qualities,"" Kroc wrote in a 1969 company newsletter. ""We can never rest on our laurels. We must always keep our ideal dream before us and work with faith so that we can accomplish ever more than we have.""Despite initial low profit, Kroc (1902-84) used an entrepreneurial spirit to grow McDonald's, revolutionizing the fast-food industry through a standardized approach to restaurant franchises and an openness to new ideas.Today, McDonald's (MCD) is still cooking. 2014 sales hit $27 billion, a 29% rise since 2006. Its stock has climbed 640% in the past 12 years.Kroc drove himself from the start. A high school dropout in Oak Park, Ill., he lied about his age in 1917 to sign up as an ambulance driver for the Red Cross as World War I raged in Europe.The war ended before his training did. So he steered to various jobs: piano player, paper cup salesman, milkshake machine salesman.Life Begins At 50Kroc was in his 50s during his milkshake mixer career, but he was just getting started.The big turn came in 1954, when a large order for Prince Castle Multimixers, which could mix five milkshakes at once, came from a San Bernardino, Calif., restaurant owned by brothers Dick and Mac McDonald.Kroc flew to California to meet the brothers and was amazed by their booming operation, which focused on a few key items — burgers, fries and drinks.The duo's emphasis on quality set them apart from competitors.Kroc was hooked. He shared with the brothers his vision of opening McDonald's restaurants all over the country. Then he cut a deal with the duo and started McDonald's Corp. in 1955.Now head of the operation, Kroc laid out the strategy: From its headquarters in Oak Brook, Ill., the company would sell franchises to individual restaurant owners for the low price of $950 and in exchange receive 1.4% of all sales. Also in the mix, the McDonald brothers would receive 0.5%.In 1961, Kroc purchased the exclusive rights to the McDonald's name and bought out the duo for $2.7 million.Now running the operation, he initiated an enterprise that grew from that one restaurant into more than 7,700 at his death in 1984.Today, McDonald's is the world's leading global food-service retailer, with over 36,000 locations in over 100 countries.Paul Facella, a longtime consultant at McDonald's and the author of ""Everything I Learned About Business I Learned At McDonald's,"" notes that Kroc had a slogan that epitomized his unique relationship with the franchisees: ""You make the first buck, I'll make the second buck.""When Kroc first opened for business in 1955, contenders in the fast-food arena were A&W, Dairy Queen, Tastee-Freez and Big Boy.""Kroc took great pains to differentiate McDonald's from these players. ... The crucial difference between Kroc and his rivals was one of world view. He saw franchises as business partners, not mere customers,"" wrote Daniel Gross in ""Forbes Greatest Business Stories of all Time."" ""In his travels selling the multimixer, he had observed the way franchisers milked franchisees for profits without concern for their long-term viability. Kroc vowed not to fall into that lucrative, but ultimately unproductive, trap,"" wrote Gross.Facella added: ""Kroc understood the franchises were a long-term relationship. He wanted to make sure the franchises were successful, because the success of the franchise would ultimately make the company successful. In the beginning years, if a franchise was struggling, if he had to help, he would work with it. He realized it was to the company's advantage as opposed to saying, 'Hey you missed your franchisee payment.' ""Ultimately, Kroc left his competition in the dust as he expanded his operation while focusing on quality every step of the way.Three Legs, Sturdy CompanyKroc promoted a philosophy of a three-legged stool in which one leg was McDonald's, the second the franchisees and the third McDonald's suppliers and vendors.""He understood the need for all three to be strong. That principle was a hallmark of Ray Kroc,"" Facella told IBD.Mike Bullington, corporate archivist at McDonald's, said that Kroc stressed that the firm ""would only be as successful as its franchisees.""Being flexible was crucial in propelling Kroc toward mammoth success. In the early years, even though the number of restaurants expanded fast, company earnings were minimal due to the original deal of low franchising fees.""Through 1960, when the chain's restaurants raked up $75 million in sales, McDonald's earnings were a mere $159,000,"" wrote Gross.Shifting gears, Kroc began to focus on real estate as a potential profit center, with the idea that McDonald's could make money by leasing or buying restaurant sites.From that concept came Franchise Realty Corp., which bought or leased properties that it would then sublease to franchises at a 20%, and later 40%, markup.""Franchisees would then pay McDonald's either a minimum rate or a percentage of sales, whichever was greater,"" wrote Gross. ""As sales and prices inevitably rose over the years, the company would collect more and more rent as its costs remained virtually constant.""Quality FirstMcDonald's progress came with Kroc's commitment to quality, no matter how large the operation became, said Usha Haley, a West Virginia University professor of management. ""He reduced making a good burger to a common denominator that could be replicated everywhere,"" Haley said. ""Everything was put into an equation, including how many ounces goes into a burger.""Kroc pointed to QSCV, which stood for quality, service, cleanliness, value. ""This was the basic DNA building block of McDonald's,"" said Haley. ""He tried to make the product of a burger into a production line, but still had quality, service and cleanliness.""Barb Schmidt, who observed that Kroc approach while she ran six McDonald's restaurants in Florida, before selling them in 1996, said: ""He was so passionate about serving the customers the highest quality food in a reasonable amount of time at an affordable price. He wanted every customer to have the same experience each and every time they came to McDonald's. He always took great pride in the service, cleanliness and friendliness of his company. I believe that is what led to the extraordinary success of McDonald's — his consistent attitude of greatness.""Kroc instituted strict quality control and guidelines for franchisees. He also gave the restaurants a certain amount of autonomy, with the idea of lifting their entrepreneurial spirit. ""He was open to listening to franchisees' ideas,"" said Haley.Some of those concepts involved new products. ""Franchises came up with Filet-O-Fish, the Big Mac and Egg McMuffin,"" said Haley.Kroc liked such results rather than being hung up on resumes.""Ray never graduated from high school,"" said Facella. ""McDonald's was about meritocracy. It didn't matter if you went to college; it was about if you could make things happen. If you were very good at what you do, you could move up.""On top of all that was Kroc's humanity, said Schmidt: ""What I remember most about this amazing man was his ability to give you his full attention when he spoke with you. I felt like I was the only person in the room.""When Facella was a midlevel manager in New York City during his 34-year career at McDonald's, he met Kroc for the first time: ""He popped out of his limo and walks up to me: 'Hi Paul, how are you today?' I said, 'It is nice to meet you, Mr. Kroc,' and he looked at me and said, 'I'm Ray. Don't call me Mr. Kroc.'""From there, the two got into an old-style limousine with a flip seat. ""Naturally, I sat in the flip seat,"" recalled Facella. ""But Ray said, 'Paul, you are my guest; you sit in the comfortable seat.' There was humility about the man. He just cared about treating people right and making them feel good, which is part of his legacy. He is someone who is truly in the top five people I will ever meet in my life.""

1848,O,"U.S. tech industry officials say President Obama's executive actions on immigration don't go far enough in helping tech companies hire skilled workers from other countries.Obama late Thursday announced executive orders aimed at addressing immigration. The orders provide more resources to secure the borders and provide a path to citizenship for millions of illegal aliens.The president's actions also will extend a program letting foreign students who graduate with advanced degrees from U.S. universities work temporarily in America.""I'll make it easier and faster for high-skilled immigrants, graduates and entrepreneurs to stay and contribute to our economy, as so many business leaders proposed,"" Obama said in his speech.He pledged to ""expand and extend"" the Optional Practical Training program that lets foreign-born students and recent graduates in STEM fields — science, technology, engineering and math — remain in the U.S. for up to 29 months. The details of that expansion will be worked out by the Department of Homeland Security as it goes through a rule-making process, the Washington Post reported.""Are we a nation that educates the world's best and brightest in our universities only to send them home to create businesses in countries that compete against us, or are we a nation that encourages them to stay and create jobs here, create businesses here, create industries right here in America? That's what this debate is all about,"" Obama said.Obama also will direct DHS to make it easier for entrepreneurs to get approval to work in the U.S.""DHS will expand immigration options for foreign entrepreneurs who meet certain criteria for creating jobs, attracting investment and generating revenue in the U.S., to ensure that our system encourages them to grow our economy,"" a White House fact sheet said. This directive likely falls under the O-1 visa program, the Post said.Obama's immigration rules changes are unlikely to satisfy Silicon Valley, which has long sought more visas and faster green cards for tech workers.Obama did not address increasing the number of H-1B visas for highly skilled workers, one of tech's top priorities.The program is capped by Congress at 85,000 workers, including 20,000 H-1B visas set aside for people with advanced degrees.Employers must apply for those visas, which let foreign-born workers stay in America for up to six years. Tech companies have sought to get the cap raised.Tight SpotsIn the latest filing period, 172,500 people applied for new H-1B visas, InformationWeek reported.Instead of focusing on visas, which are for limited periods, the U.S. government should focus on getting educated foreign workers green cards for permanent residency, says Russ Harrison, government relations director for the U.S. chapter of the Institute of Electrical & Electronics Engineers.Obama could effectively double the green card program by exempting spouses and children of applicants from the allocation cap, Harrison told IBD.If Obama wants to bolster the U.S. economy through immigration, he needs to focus on fast-tracking tech-savvy immigrants to permanent residency status, Harrison said.Foreign college students in master's and Ph.D. STEM programs should be able to get a green card within 12 months of graduating, he said: ""That would be a game changer. That's how you add workers to our economy. You give them a green card and let them become Americans.""Obama says he wants to foster entrepreneurship among foreign workers in the U.S., but that's hard to do with temporary visas, Harrison said. Financiers don't like to give money to people who could get deported. ""For the foreign entrepreneur, the green card is absolutely essential,"" he said.Other tech industry officials are encouraging Obama to work with Congress on more permanent, sweeping immigration legislation.""The preferred and lasting path to high-skilled immigration reform must be for Congress and the White House to work together to introduce and pass legislation that addresses an insufficient number of temporary work visas and employment-based green cards,"" Elizabeth Hyman, executive vice president of public advocacy for industry trade group CompTIA, said in a statement . ""Additionally, such legislation must recognize the role that foreign-born entrepreneurs play in our ecosystem and encourage them to thrive and create new businesses and jobs.""

Distribution days occur when the major averages fall at least 0.2% in higher volume than the prior session. A high distribution count — say, five or six or more — could be a sign that the market's uptrend is getting tired or due for a pullback.
"
1898,O,"An excessive number of distribution days and poor action by leaders may mean that a serious correction has arrived. At that point, investors should raise cash and sell stocks, especially ones that aren't performing well or that have a small profit cushion.The S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite serve as guideposts to the market's health. Ignore them at your own peril.Every day, IBD analyzes the action of these major stock averages to determine whether the market is in an uptrend (healthy) or a correction (not so healthy or very weak).Why should investors know the status of the overall market in deciding when to buy or sell a stock? The best stocks tend to break out of bases with success during a confirmed uptrend. Conversely, most stocks fall during a correction, no matter how strong their recent fundamentals.Failure to heed the market's trend could make the difference between racking up a nice profit or taking a significant loss on your investments.The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq help distill the action of thousands of publicly traded stocks. The S&P 500 is generally broader-based than the Nasdaq in terms of industry sectors. Yet many big winners hail from the Nasdaq market. So watch both.S&P 500 membership consists solely of big-cap stocks. The Nasdaq is weighted more toward technology issues and is broader in terms of market capitalization; it offers a large helping of small-cap and midcap stocks.IBD readers can track the action of both the S&P and the Nasdaq each day with charts on the What's The Market Trend? page (today on B2). IBD also provides a chart of the Dow Jones industrial average, but its value as a market barometer is limited; it tracks only 30 large-cap stocks.The daily Big Picture (today on B3) provides a roundup of daily market action and discusses leading stocks that moved in heavy volume. The Market Pulse box accompanying the column gives a quick snapshot of the day's action and describes the market's status.The market's status changed on Oct. 21, when the Nasdaq jumped 2.4% (1) and the S&P 500 climbed 2% in volume that was higher than the previous day. It marked a fourth-day follow-through that changed the current outlook from ""correction"" to ""market in confirmed uptrend.""Growth stocks thrive during a confirmed uptrend. The IBD 50 jumped 3.1% on Oct. 21; the small-cap Russell 2000 rose 1.6%. The action of these growth-oriented indexes supported the birth of a new uptrend.Drugmakers Akorn (AKRX), Lannett (LCI) and Celgene (CELG), insurance firm AmTrust Financial (AFSI) and auto parts retailer O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) were among the growth stocks that broke out of bases soon after the new uptrend began. Not every breakout will work. But the market's biggest winners often emerge early in an uptrend.In Wednesday's paper, the Market Pulse shows one distribution day for the Nasdaq and the S&P 500.

1925,O,"Accountability: The buck is supposed to stop on that desk where the president likes to rest his feet. But when asked by ""60 Minutes,"" Obama passed the blame for the Islamic State's rise onto others.There have been many instances pointed to as Barack Obama's emperor-has-no-clothes moment: ""If you like your plan you can keep your plan"" exposed as a lie; the first 2012 presidential debate; even last week's disgraceful ""latte salute"" to Marines.But the exchange shown to the world on Sunday between the president and his favorite, friendliest interviewer, Steve Kroft of CBS' ""60 Minutes,"" ends whatever doubt there may have been that this most underqualified of presidents is proving to be way out of his depth.Asked about how he could have missed the rise of a terrorist organization with tens of thousands of foot soldiers, Obama flailed like an unprepared law student zeroed in on by Professor Kingsfield, and pathetically tried blaming others.You could see it all in his bitter half-smile as he said, ""Our head of the intelligence community, Jim Clapper, has acknowledged that I think they underestimated what had been taking place in Syria.""As IBD pointed out years ago, Clapper became director of national intelligence to ""Obamacize"" America's spy operations, replacing Adm. Dennis Blair, who, as former House Intelligence Committee Chairman Pete Hoekstra, R-Mich., charges, was ""cut off at every turn by a White House"" treating terrorism as a law-enforcement problem. Clapper may, in fact, be little more than the underling of CIA Director John O. Brennan.You could also see it all in the venom that accompanied Obama's laying the blame on former Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki for not producing ""a government that had built a sense of national unity.""New Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, says Obama, ""so far at least has sent all the right signals."" And so ""it goes back to"" that ""we can't do this for them"" — the familiar Democrat rationale for pulling troops out prematurely from Iraq. These countries that have never known representative government must ""think about what political accommodation means, think about what tolerance means,"" according to Obama.To see the president squirm as he tried to explain the IS disaster to a sympathetic interviewer, reduced to hurling blame this way and that, reveals the essence of the Obama administration. Here is the leader of the free world fidgeting before the cameras because a country infested with terrorists didn't end up following a script his party wrote purely to win elections.Meanwhile — also 100% politics — he has scrapped enhanced interrogation and considering ground forces to fight these terrorists, instead assuring us that having drones kill sources of information about other terrorists is winning what he refuses to call the war on terror.The golf outings, fundraisers and skipped national security briefings are catching up to President Obama, who uses ""we,"" ""they"" and ""you"" when it comes to failure — instead of the ""I"" he so loves when taking credit.

Lannett plans to report after the close on Nov. 3.Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) gapped up and gained 6% to a new high after beating views and raising guidance. Thursday's surge left the stock 7% above the 173.80 buy point the stock has been fighting to decisively clear since August. But 179.69 also is a reasonable entry.O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) gapped up and motored 6% to an all-time high in reaction to late Wednesday's quarterly results.

1974,O,"Google (GOOGL) on Wednesday rolled out new software aimed firmly at Internet-enabled devices for living rooms, cars and people's wrists, a sign the company has learned a thing or two from Apple. Here are some key takeaways from the spate of software announcements during the keynote at Google I/O.
"
1975,O,"1. Universal Android Design
"
1976,O,"Google has always struggled to make its Android mobile software's visual design consistent across all devices. Part of the problem stems from the fact that Android is open-source, meaning there are lots of cooks in the kitchen.
"
1977,O,"Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, has been great at universal design for mobile devices because it keeps tight control over its iOS software.
"
1978,O,"Google on Wednesday took a step toward creating a more Apple-like experience for Android, with a new design feature it's calling ""Material Design."" What that actually means is that Google is making an attempt to standardize Android's look and feel for smartphones, tablets, PCs, TVs, car dashboard screens and any other place it might land (and it hopes to land in lots of places).
"
1979,O,"Google wants developers to use a ""unified set"" of design guidelines , said Matias Duarte, director of user experience for Android.
"
1980,O,"""Android ubiquity was the overall message/theme"" at I/O, says Rosenblatt Securities analyst Martin Pyykkonen in a research note.
"
1981,O,"2. Car Software As Battleground
"
1982,O,"Google and Apple seem to be running on roughly the same timeline with their in-car technology. Apple announced its in-the-car CarPlay software back in March, and Google introduced its Android Auto software on Wednesday.
"
1983,O,"The software is similar. Both focus on letting users connect their smartphones to in-dash screens. Once connected, users of either software can use voice commands to play music, make phone calls, send text messages or get turn-by-turn navigation.
"
1984,O,"The key for both Google and Apple is that once you buy a car with one of these systems, you might be locked in to Android or iOS mobile software for years.
"
1985,O,"""Android auto could make it difficult to switch to an iPhone as long as you own your car,"" Alex Davies wroteon Wired.com.
"
1986,O,"3. Ahead With Android Wear
"
1987,O,"Apple reportedly is readying an iWatch smartwatch for this fall. But that expected announcement is still months away, while Google is already marketing and selling watches running on its Android Wear software.
"
1988,O,"Google's early release gives Google developers more time to create apps vs. Apple, says Global Equities analyst Trip Chowdhry.
"
1989,O,"Apple has released software that hints at some of the possible features of its iWatch hardware. Notably, there's the HealthKit software, which signals that the iWatch will have health-tracking features.
"
1990,O,"""We expect the Health app that collects and passes along vitals to caregiving professionals will be linked to a wearable measuring device, given the fashion and health care experts Apple has been hiring,"" UBS analyst Steven Milunovich wrote in a research note earlier this month.
"
1991,O,"But being able to see the hardware for the Android smartwatches gives Google developers a big leg up vs. notoriously secretive Apple.
"
1992,O,"4. Google Ads Everywhere
"
1993,O,"Google executives rarely talk about advertising at events like I/O, but there were hints about ads on some new devices.
"
1994,O,"The company's new Android TV software, for example, could bring more YouTube advertising to TVs, notes analyst Pyykkonen.
"
1995,O,"""Voice-based and other search should yield incremental ad revenue share via Android mobile and YouTube clips with ads which play from consumers' search interests,"" Pyykkonen wrote.
"
1996,O,"While demonstrating Android Wear software on Wednesday, Google Engineering Director David Singleton gave a run-through of how a pop-up alert would work on the phone. (Singleton didn't say that the alert function could — or would — be used for ads.)
"
1997,O,"If, say, a user has an app for food-delivery service Eat24, a small alert — or ad — could pop up on the face of the watch at the time when the user usually orders food.
"
1998,O,"Google stock was down a fraction in afternoon trading in the stock market today, while Apple stock was flat.

"
2011,O,"The term smart beta is becoming more and more popular in describing indexes that, in short, diverge from a typical market capitalization-weighted approach. With such indexes, we believe that it is critical to understand the different tilts and biases introduced by the stock selection and constituent weighting rules of each index. Today, we're taking a deeper look into our broad-based international smart beta indexes and examining how our smart beta (aka fundamentally weighted) approach has performed internationally. Specifically: 
"
2012,O," Did these indexes tend to increase or decrease sensitivity to movements of the market?  Did they tend to tilt more toward larger or smaller stocks?  Were they more value-oriented, more growth oriented or somewhere in between?  Was there a similar anti-momentum bias as seen in the U.S., intuitively coming from our annual rebalance? 
"
2013,O,"Thanks to data published regularly on the Kenneth French Data Library, we are able to do a returns-based analysis that seeks to quantify answers to these questions through the process of regression.

2014,O,"For definitions of terms and Indexes in the chart, visit our glossary. 
"
2015,O,"Market Factors Takeaways: In our U.S. factor analysis, discussed in an earlier blog post, the dividend-weighted indexes showed lower ""market factor"" sensitivity or market factor loadings. On the international front, the market sensitivity factors more closely resembled the traditional market cap-weighted indexes with readings close to 1.0. One reason for this is that the U.S. is an outlier country in terms of dividend payout ratios. Internationally, the indexes provide greater representation and coverage of international markets. The indexes therefore provide market sensitivity close to the broad-market indexes. 
"
2016,O,"Value Factor Takeaways: All WisdomTree-related strategies listed above weight securities by their Dividend Stream®. These strategies tend to tilt more toward the value segment of the markets. However, for the broad WT DEFA Index, the value loading is almost identical to that of the MSCI EAFE Index. Furthermore, the WT International LargeCap Dividend Index had a value loading lower than that of the MSCI EAFE Index. One reason for this is country allocations. Japan, for instance would show a low price-to-book value ratio and may represent considerable weight in the value factors, whereas on a dividend basis, Japan is under-weighted compared to a market cap-weighted index. This would lead to a natural bias in dividend strategies away from loading to the value factor that has greater exposure to Japan on a price-to-book value basis. o The value factor is particularly strong in dividend strategies focused on small- and mid-cap segments. Although the small-cap segment has a much stronger value tilt than the mid-caps, both have a much larger tilt to the value spectrum than the broad market strategies. o Note that the market cap-weighted valueMSCI EAFE Mid Cap Value and MSCI EAFE Small Cap Value Indexes were more value-tilted than the dividend-weighted approach. The dividend weighting therefore was between the traditional market cap-weighted indexes and the value segments of those indexes when measured on sensitivity to this value factor. 
"
2017,O,"Size Factor Takeaways: In terms of size tilts, WT DEFA, WT DEFA Equity Income and WT International LargeCap Dividend have the biggest large-cap tilts when compared with all other strategies listed above. In other words, the three strategies have the ""purest"" large-cap return attribution in the developed international space. When we look at the WisdomTree strategies focused on the small-caps, we cannot describe these Indexes as solely exposed to the small-cap premium. Instead, the WT International SmallCap Dividend Index has an equally notable tilt to the value segment, through a methodology that weights its constituents by dividends. 
"
2018,O,"o The capability to access multiple tilts within one indexing strategy is an important point to note. As we have previously discussed, Fama/French 1 has shown the persistence of both a small-cap and a value premium, both of which can be accessed by the WT International SmallCap Dividend Index. 
"
2019,O,"Momentum Factor Takeaways: While dividend strategies in the U.S. tend to display strong anti-momentum tendencies, it is less clear in the developed international space. Many of the WisdomTree strategies still have a small tilt toward being anti-momentum.

2021,O,"Knowing these factor loadings, in our opinion, is only a first step. The critical question regards how to apply this information to portfolio construction.

2027,O,"James Kraft saw opportunity and challenged it.The founder of what became Kraft Foods (KRFT) learned from working in the industry that cheese was a wild card in quality and shelf life.Cheddar in particular got moldy. Kraft (1874-1953) devoted himself to making a better product.The result is a firm that today sells an array of grocery products — from Jell-O to Oscar Mayer wieners to Capri Sun juice — and has annual revenue of more than $18 billion.In 1903 in Chicago, Kraft sold the best cheese he could find on the market by day. By night, he went through trial and error to come up with something that was consistent in taste and expiration time.At the boardinghouse where he lived, Kraft, with a new copper kettle, began to put his dairy-farm background to use. He thought that if he could blend cheese with pasteurized milk and package it in sterile containers, the result would meet his goal and criteria.His first attempts proved to be failures, but he refused to give up.Years went by before his breakthrough in 1915. He discovered that instead of heating the cheese to the point that its protein and fat separated, he needed to cook it only long enough for it to become sterile, while stirring it quickly.He poured the liquid cheese into clean containers and hermetically sealed them. As the cheese cooled, it reverted to its solid state.Solid StampIn June 1916, Kraft received a patent for the ""process of sterilizing cheese and an improved product produced by such process.""""James Lewis Kraft's 1916 patent was the pivotal moment in the history of the company,"" wrote Melanie Villines in ""The Greatest Thing Since Sliced Cheese: Stories of Kraft Food Inventors and their Inventions."" ""Processed cheese took Kraft from a commodity business with many competitors to an innovator with a unique food product. The invention laid the foundation for the wide variety of processed cheese products now available throughout the world.""By 1923, Kraft had turned his enterprise into the largest cheese company in the world.Kraft created the firm that bears his name in 1909. His taste for innovation led him to introduce products such as Velveeta cheese and Kraft macaroni and cheese dinner, Kraft Deluxe pasteurized processed cheese slices, Cheez Whiz and Miracle Whip.He further revolutionized the industry through his use of packaging with developing reusable Swanky Swigs glass containers and by embracing advertising.Born around Stevensville, Ontario, on his parents' dairy farm, Kraft was the second of 11 children.He and his siblings were brought up on the teaching of their Mennonite parents. A devotion to religion stayed with Kraft, and he donated heavily to philanthropic causes.It was on the farm and working as a grocery store clerk at age 18 that Kraft learned about the spoilage problems associated with cheese.A decade later, he was involved in a small cheese business when his partners moved him out. Kraft was living in Chicago and managing their local branch.After his ouster, he had only $65 and his industry experience. Rather than pout, he aimed to create the largest cheese firm in the world.Kraft took notice that store proprietors went to Chicago's wholesale warehouse district to buy cheese. He quickly rented a horse and wagon and reversed the process for the merchants' convenience: He bought the best cheese available wholesale, then delivered it to the merchants for good measure (and profits).""Customers came to rely on young Kraft as a vendor who offered only the highest-quality cheese,"" Villines said.Kraft had found traction. He brought four brothers in to join him, and in 1909 his company was incorporated as J.L. Kraft & Bros., with James L. Kraft as president.They initially were wholesaling 30 types of cheese under the Kraft and Elkhorn labels nationally.All the while, Kraft had been working to create a processed cheese that wouldn't eat into profit due to its perishable nature.With World War I raging in Europe, he saw the need for such a product for the Allied fighting men — and created canned cheese.Now the largest customer for Kraft's processed cheese was the military. Uncle Sam purchased 6 million pounds in cans until the war ended in November 1918.""The product was the perfect ration — a highly nutritious food that remained fresh during long-distance shipping under adverse conditions but did not require refrigeration,"" Villines wrote.World War II brought more business, and Kraft came through with preserved butter spread and canned cheese for the armed forces, devoting the entire capacity of his Freeport, Ill., plant to the effort.The industry did not applaud the initial success of Kraft's processed cheese. ""The product incurred the anger of dealers, farmers, cheese makers, as well as newspaper editors and politicians,"" Villines said. ""There seemed to be no end to the negative comments. It was called embalmed, imitation, moonshine, made over and renovated.""The public called it delicious.A 1932 study conducted by two University of Wisconsin professors reported that two-thirds of consumers preferred the taste of the processed cheese. ""During the coming years, the critics would eat their words — as per capita cheese consumption continued to rise, driven mostly by the sale of processed cheese,"" Villines wrote.Kraft got out ahead of criticism by providing facts. In 1927, he funded research at Rutgers University to examine the digestibility and nutrition of a processed cheese product in development: Velveeta.When he brought it to market in 1928, ads touted the study's results: The product was as ""digestible as milk itself, an excellent source of riboflavin and a good source of vitamin A and high-quality protein.""Villines noted: ""From the start, Americans loved Velveeta because of its superior meltability — a quality that quickly made the product the country's No. 1 cooking cheese.""In 1931, the American Medical Association gave Velveeta its seal of approval — the first time a cheese product had such a recommendation.The rise of Kraft and his company caught the attention of Thomas McInnerney, founder of National Dairy Products. In 1930, he bought Kraft's firm, by now named Kraft-Phenix Cheese, while letting it operate as an independent subsidiary for many years.That lasted until it became Kraftco in the late 1960s and went under direct control of the parent firm.Marketing ManBesides developing a slew of innovative products, Kraft was among the first in the cheese industry to recognize the value of advertising.In 1911, Kraft products were promoted on Chicago elevated trains, outdoor billboards and circulars mailed to grocers.In 1919, color ads for Kraft cheese appeared in Good Housekeeping and Ladies' Home Journal magazines.In the 1930s, his company sponsored a two-hour musical and variety show on the radio called ""Kraft Musical Review."" It later became ""Kraft Music Hall,"" which showcased top performers.Kraft introduced products such as Miracle Whip sandwich spread, Kraft macaroni and cheese and Parkay margarine on the music shows, and the products became favorites with the public. The brand name also gave credibility to Kraft caramel, marshmallows, jam and jelly.In 1947, the firm got out front with TV, sponsoring ""Kraft Television Theater."" It ran 11 years, produced 700 plays and featured many movie stars and one future president, John Kennedy, who hosted a dramatization of his book ""Profiles in Courage"" in 1956, three years after Kraft died.Kraft's website notes: ""The company's 'hands' commercials, showing a pair of hands preparing recipes using Kraft products, became a symbol of the company's advertising success.""When Kraft died at age 78, he left behind wife Pauline, his daughter Edith and a legacy that endures.

2038,O,"Steel Dynamics is on a roll, thanks to renewed demand for steel and its plan for a transformational acquisition that would expand its presence in the southern U.S., bolster its production capacity and broaden its exposure to growth industries.The Fort Wayne, Ind.-based steel maker and metal recycler on July 21 said it would buy Mississippi-based Severstal Columbus from OAO Severstal in a $1.63 billion deal. If the cash acquisition closes late this year as planned, Steel Dynamics (STLD) says, its annual steel shipping capacity will increase by 40% in 2015, to 11 million tons. The acquisition is expected to be immediately accretive to earnings.The deal would provide Steel Dynamics a bigger presence in the lucrative energy and automotive industries, as the Severstal Columbus mill produces steel in demand by those sectors. Domestic oil and natural gas production has been strong in Texas and neighboring states in the South, analysts say, boosting demand for steel used to build equipment for that sector.Auto sales nationwide, meanwhile, have been solid in 2014. The annualized selling rate of 16.48 million autos in July represented a notable jump from 15.76 million a year earlier, according to Autodata, lifting demand for steel used to build cars and trucks.""Those two industries have been the main drivers of demand for domestic steel, so that should continue to drive growth"" for Steel Dynamics, said Andrew Lane, a Morningstar analyst who covers several steel producers.Steel Dynamics' stock is up about 25% since the trading day before the acquisition announcement. ""Investors welcomed the deal,"" Lane said, ""and I think it makes a lot of sense for them.""The acquisition aside, Steel Dynamics is on solid footing, Lane says. The company in July reported strong second-quarter results that reflected a broad recovery in domestic demand for steel and lower costs for raw materials used to produce steel, he says, both of which are favorable trends that are expected to continue.Steel Dynamics reported second-quarter net income of $72 million, or 31 cents per diluted share. It marked a rise in net income of $34 million from the first quarter, when results were hampered by harsh winter weather, and a jump of $43 million from a year earlier. Second-quarter net sales of $2.1 billion were up 13% and 15%, respectively, from the first quarter and from a year earlier. Raw material prices decreased, the company said, boosting operating income by $51 million from the first quarter, to $132 million.Demand RecoversCommercial demand for steel dried up in the wake of the 2007-08 financial crisis, as major construction and development projects were put on hold. This drove down prices for steel producers. At the same time, a surge in major construction projects in China, the world's largest consumer of steel, put upward pressure on the cost of raw materials globally, analysts say. This, in turn, hurt operating margins for U.S. steel producers, including Steel Dynamics.But as the U.S. economy has healed over the past couple years, the construction industry has gradually recovered, adding to demand for steel, Raymond James Chief Economist Scott Brown said in an interview. He said the domestic steel industry ""for the most part tracks alongside the overall economy, which has been growing, modestly, but growing.""Meanwhile, the Chinese economy has begun to slow and construction has started to shift from big commercial endeavors to smaller residential projects that require less steel there, lessening demand for raw materials in China and lowering costs for U.S. producers, Brown says.""So there is not that upward pressure on (costs) and I don't think there's an expectation for that to change soon,"" he said.Analysts on average forecast third-quarter earnings of 37 cents per share for Steel Dynamics, according to Thomson Reuters. The Street expects sales to again top $2 billion.During a call to discuss second-quarter results in July, Steel Dynamics CEO Mark Millett told analysts that the Severstal Columbus acquisition would not only ramp up production capacity and broaden exposure to surging industries, but the expansion into the South should also deepen Steel Dynamics' ties to industrial markets in Mexico, where he expects ""significant growth.""Millett also said the broad U.S. economic recovery is expected to continue, as is strength in the oil and auto sectors, driving continued steel consumption growth. In the second quarter, Millett said, ""all our reporting segments achieved meaningfully higher profitability compared to the first quarter, improving well beyond the bad weather impact experienced in that quarter. The meaningful improvement ... supports our continued optimism, as does the positive sentiment from our customers.""'Strengthening Trends' SeenThe company's director of investor relations, Marlene Owen, told IBD this week that Steel Dynamics' view of market conditions remains upbeat nearly two months into the third quarter. She said macro indicators of steel industry health, from construction spending to indexes that track planning of new projects, show ""strengthening trends.""Lane said the company's optimism is warranted, but he also said Steel Dynamics is burdened by one lingering headwind: a multiyear project at its Minnesota iron production facility that, to date, has failed to generate returns. The company has invested about $500 million in the facility, Lane estimates, in an effort to develop a cutting-edge production operation. Although the quality is up to par, he said, the quantity of the refined iron ore generated by the Minnesota project has ""fallen short of expectations.""Steel Dynamics said the negative impact of the Minnesota operation on earnings totaled about $18 million in the first half of 2014. Lane said the company hinted earlier in 2014 that it might scrap the project, but now plans to continue investing in it in hopes of fine-tuning operations and benefiting future earnings. Lane said he and many on Wall Street remain skeptical.The company said it anticipates losing money in Minnesota in the third quarter, though at a slower rate than in the first half of the year.""There remains this concern that they will continue to funnel money to this with no real results,"" Lane said. ""It's been a drain on earnings for many quarters. It's a major misstep for them.""That noted, the analyst added, Steel Dynamics has an ""excellent management team"" with a long track record of wise investments. The Minnesota project ""is really management's one black eye."" He called it a ""one-off"" problem that, while significant, is not enough to undercut the firm's strong overall growth and favorable outlook.Lane said Steel Dynamics posted an operating margin of 6.4% in the second quarter. By 2018, he expects it to expand to 11%, as steel sales and prices continue to rise and as Steel Dynamics integrates and capitalizes on its planned acquisition. With the much larger base it can spread out its fixed costs over greater production volumes to boost the margin and, by extension, profitability.It's ""a good story overall,"" he said.Steel Dynamics is the seventh-largest company by market cap among 20 in IBD's Steel-Producers industry group, after POSCO (PKX), Tenaris (TS), Arcelor Mittal (MT), Nucor (NUE), Gerdau (GGB) and Companhia Siderurgica (SID), and before United States Steel (X). The group is currently ranked No. 18 of 197 tracked.

"
2048,O," Dividend Payers Outperform: Over the three-year, five-year and since-inception periods, WT Int. Small Dividends outperformed the MSCI EAFE Small Cap Index. In a strong market during the one-year time frame, the dividend payers definitely kept pace—a feat we believe impressive because dividend-focused strategies frequently do not capture the full upward moves of bull markets.  Dividend Payers Lower Risk across All Periods: One way to consider risk is through the beta statistic, a measure of the relative volatility between two indexes. The MSCI EAFE Small Cap Index, serving as the benchmark in this case, will therefore have a beta of 1.00 in every period. Since WT Int. Small Dividends is less than 1.00 over every period shown, this indicates that risk was reduced over these periods. o For those thinking in more absolute terms, WT Int. Small Dividends also had a lower standard deviation than MSCI EAFE Small Cap Index over each of the periods shown.3

2059,O,"Politics: More than two dozen House Democrats are pushing the Senate to revive and ratify the nomination of Dr. Vivek Murthy to a critical post, but helping to fight deadly disease is not what they have in mind.The question of the day is why we have or need an Ebola czar in the form of political operative/hack Ron Klain when we have an unfilled surgeon general's position that physician emeritus serving as America's doctor is supposed to fill.We have an acting Surgeon General, Rear Admiral Boris Lushniak, but he is seemingly just a placeholder instead of the force that a confirmed Surgeon General can and should be.The surgeon general could be a respected face and voice in the fight against Ebola, a role that has defaulted to Dr. Tom Frieden of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), he of the protocols etched in Jell-O who is probably still rethinking his approach to the disease.The answer from Democrats is — wait for it — it's the Republicans' fault, since President Obama's nominee to the post, Dr. Vivek Murthy, president and co-founder of Doctors for America, was stopped in his tracks by Senate Republicans and vulnerable red-state Democrats.On Sunday, CNN host and 2012 part-time debate coach for President Obama Candy Crowley grilled Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz. She repeated the now-debunked myth of CDC budget cuts and blamed the National Rifle Association's opposition to Murthy's nomination for the vacancy amid the Ebola fight.""Of course, we should have a surgeon general in place,"" Cruz responded. ""And we don't have one because President Obama, instead of nominating a health professional, nominated someone who is an anti-gun activist."" Cruz conceded Crowley's point that Murthy is also a doctor but noted that he was a ""crusader against Second Amendment rights.""Some 29 House Democrats, led by California Reps. Barbara Lee, Judy Chu and Ami Bera, have written a letter calling on the Senate to approve Murthy's nomination swiftly so he can be the point person in calming public fears about Ebola.We suspect that they, in light of the stated belief that a crisis is a terrible thing to waste, want to use the Ebola crisis to score a victory for gun control and the shredding of the Second Amendment.""The American public would benefit from having a surgeon general to disseminate information that is desperately needed,"" the Democrats wrote. ""The surgeon general can also work to amplify the Center for Disease Control's actions, reassure the American people and combat misinformation here at home.""What we need is a travel ban here at home, something Murthy isn't about to advocate and on which the CDC's Tom Frieden has been the Baghdad Bob of health misinformation. We need a surgeon general, but we don't need one who thinks gun ownership is as deadly as Ebola and that the only ban we should have is a gun ban.At his confirmation hearing, Sen. Lamar Alexander inquired about Murthy's social media comments on firearms, such as this tweet before the 2012 presidential election: ""Tired of politicians playing politics w/ guns, putting lives at risk b/c they're scared of NRA. Guns are a health care issue.""His group, which has been dubbed ""Docs vs. Glocks,"" has pushed Congress to ban ""assault"" weapons and ""high-capacity"" magazines. In a letter to Vice President Biden, Murthy outlined his group's position: ""Medications and medical devices are pulled from the market when their risks outweigh their benefits. So too should we rethink the weapons that we allow on our streets.""Never mind that as gun ownership has risen and concealed carry has spread, crime rates have fallen, proving that gun ownership is a vaccine against crime.

2086,O,"In 2013, equity markets in Europe, Japan and the United States delivered strongly.1 Emerging markets EM, on the other hand, were disappointing. 2 However, it is at precisely these times—after being disappointed—when emerging market equities probably warrant a closer look.

2087,O,"Mapping Emerging Markets with WisdomTree's Indexes 
"
2088,O,"During 2013, WisdomTree launched two broadly focused emerging market equity Indexes: 
"
2089,O,"1. WisdomTree Emerging Markets Dividend Growth Index (Dividend Growth): This Index was designed to focus on dividend payers within emerging markets that exhibit relatively strong earnings growth potential as well as relatively higher quality metrics. 2. WisdomTree Emerging Markets Consumer Growth Index (Consumer Growth): This Index was designed to focus on profitable companies within emerging markets that have the potential to benefit from consumer growth in emerging markets, rather than focus on emerging market multinationals that tend to export to developed countries. 
"
2090,O,"Gauging the performance of these Indexes, in addition to theWisdomTree Emerging Markets Equity Income (EM Equity Income) and WisdomTree Emerging Markets SmallCap Dividend (EM Small Dividends) Indexes, can allow us to better understand what components of emerging market equities are tending to perform best (or worst) over different periods. For reference we included the MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MSCI EM), the most widely followed benchmark for the performance of EM equities. WisdomTree Broad EM Equity Scorecard for 2014 
"
2091,O," Dividend Growth & Consumer Growth Outperform MSCI EM YTD and Since the February 5 Low3 o Dividend Growth: A greater than 9.5% average over-weight to Indonesia and a greater than 8% average over-weight to Thailand were primary drivers of outperformance. Both of these markets had a tumultuous 2013 but have been on the comeback trail in 2014. Surprisingly, even a 7.8% average over-weight to Russia contributed to outperformance by focusing on the combination of growth and quality. Exposures in South Africa and India saw positive total returns, but being under-weight in India and poor stock selection in South Africa hurt relative performance. o Consumer Growth: This Index is actually the only one shown that is not weighted by dividends, but rather by earnings. As a result, instead of being under-weight to India compared to the MSCI EM, it maintained an approximate over-weight of 2.6% when India's market was roaring. Additionally, the fact that the Materials and Energy sectors are ineligible leads to very small weight within Russia. The largest average country weight was to China, and exposure here was positive, but not as positive as that of the MSCI EM, causing it to contribute negatively to relative performance. 
"
2092,O," WT EM Equity Income and EM Small Dividends Still Positive4 o EM Equity Income: Of the Indexes shown, this one can be characterized as the valuation hunter. Some of the least expensive, largest payers of cash dividends within emerging markets are those within the Russian Energy sector, which was hit with negative headline risk in March 2014 and then again in July 2014. It's worth noting the positive performance shown within the chart for this diversified Index even with those exposures. o EM Small Dividends: A dividend-weighted approach to emerging market small caps has tended toward a large weight in Taiwanese small caps and barely any weight to India's small caps. This year, India's small caps have been on fire, and Taiwan's have been lackluster. Still, a year-to-date return of 9% is strong.

2166,O,"""I love you too, Wisconsin!""Sounds like Barack Obama's standard speech opening after someone in the adoring audience on cue shouts, ""We love you, Barack!""Except these days it isn't Barack. It's the other Obama, Michelle, the one who became suddenly so proud of America back in 2008 when her husband was first running for the White House.To be sure, she's still doing the goody-goody, Tide-clean first lady stuff that they all do with students and moms and kids' TV shows.But Mrs. Obama has also again taken on an aggressive political schedule leading up to the Nov. 4 midterm elections when, history and polls indicate, her husband and party are scheduled to endure another shellacking at the hands of voters dissatisfied with him, the economy, the scandals, the high-living vacations and fundraising. You name it.Today alone Michelle Obama will campaign in Boston for Democrat gubernatorial candidate Martha Coakley. You remember her as Republican Scott Brown's failed Senate opponent back in 2010, when Obama's last-minute campaign appearance didn't help.Then also today, Mrs. Obama flies up to Bangor, Maine to campaign for another Democrat gubernatorial candidate, Mike Michaud.Then, next Tuesday, Mrs. Obama is back out in Wisconsin again to try to help Mary Burke knock off incumbent GOP Gov. Scott Walker. And then Mrs. O goes south as the star attraction at a Chicago campaign event for embattled incumbent Democrat Gov. Pat Quinn, who had the president in for a $50K per person campaign event Thursday.Notice Mrs. Obama is doing mostly state races, presumably because like any Chicago pol worth her wind, she holds grudges and values paybacks -- in this case against Dem senators she sees as insufficiently supportive of her anti-fat-kid work. (Of course, who said these days any Dem Senate candidate wants someone named Obama ""helping out""?)There's much more to come in the 31 remaining days. The cover story is both Obamas are dutifully trying to help Democrats. Because of his own unpopularity and that of his programs and scandals, the president's not being invited to do the hands-in-the-air joint campaign appearances that Mrs. Obama has.He's bent on fundraisers, usually high-priced events ($32,400 on up to $100,000 per person) tacked on to to some official presidential appearance to help split the travel costs of Air Force One.All first ladies do some political work, even if just introducing their spouse or decorating the stage. During her husband's terms, for instance, Laura Bush did scattered fundraisers for select political friends.But Mrs. Obama has been politically involved since being hired into the Chicago mayor's office by -- wait for it -- the same Valerie Jarrett who now accompanies Barack Obama everywhere but the men's room. Mrs. Obama campaigned heavily in 2007-08 and again in 2012, often at fundraisers.The president's wife even gave her own address to troops returning at the end of the Iraq war.Like her husband, Mrs. Obama can sometimes sound tone deaf. Last year she chided many lazy black youths for not working hard and taking advantage of higher education. But her puzzled audience was black youths just minutes from receiving their hard-earned college diplomas.Then, last spring Mrs. Obama was forced to cancel and relocate one speech over student protests.However, Michelle Obama is no political neophyte working a ""Fired up!"" crowd and recalling what a terrible mess her husband inherited from you-know-who-so-she-won't-mention-his-name. She boasts of her husband's great achievements and urges loyalists to get 10 friends to vote so the progressive fight can continue.Mrs. Obama's heavy political schedule this year and the almost-looming end of her husband's White House tenure (839 days, in case anyone's counting) have raised suspicions that she might be honing skills and connections for her own political career in a couple of years.Illinois Dems like Quinn and Mayor Rahm Emanuel always repay political help and the Obamas have maintained their Illinois residence on Chicago's South Side. In fact, the president slept there Wednesday night.For now, of course, Mrs. Obama must demur on any ambitions. But it could make sense. After all, Hillary Clinton, another Chicago native, rode into the Senate on name recognition from her first lady tour of duty.Championing literacy is a standard first lady cause few oppose. However, Mrs. Obama chose nutrition, physical fitness and childhood obesity. She's helped drive new restaurant regulations and told parents what they should feed their families, unsolicited nanny advice not always appreciated. Her revised school lunch menus have also drawn opposition amid reports of increased garbage as a result.But Mrs. Obama's approval ratings have hovered around 60%, always higher than her hubby. Her daughters are growing up, both soon in high school and beyond. Meanwhile, Mrs. Obama's mother is always on hand as the first full-time resident mother-in-law since Harry Truman's White House days.Oh, and lookee here. There's a U.S. Senate race conveniently scheduled for 2016 in Illinois when Republican Mark Kirk's first term expires. He resumed a full work schedule last year after suffering a major stroke in 2012.Perhaps you recall that's the exact same Senate seat once held briefly by the other Obama.RELATED:Chicago plaque marks spot where Barack first kissed MichellePolls show Michelle Obama is much better liked now than Barack'Barack and I see our own daughters' in the Nigerian girl kidnappingsEbola strikes the homeland quite quickly; Could it be Obama's Katrina?

2198,O,"WisdomTree's Top-Performing Broad Developed International Index 
"
2199,O,"The top-performing broad developed international Index at WisdomTree for the year-to-date period ending July 15, 2014, was the WisdomTree International Dividend ex-Financials Index (WT Int. Div. ex-Financials). Why? We believe that this Index best answered the call for yield in these developed market regions. The following table illustrates the critical factors in play. As an important point of reference, we compare the WT Int. Div. Ex-Financials to the MSCI EAFE Index (EAFE). EAFE does not require constituents to be relatively higher-yielding dividend payers, but it is a broader, widely followed performance benchmark for developed international equities.

2200,O,"Connecting Dividend Yield to Equity Performance in 2014
"
2201,O," Approximately 50% Exposure to Defensive Sectors: We consider the defensive sectors to be Utilities, Telecommunication Services, Health Care and Consumer Staples. In both EAFE and WT Int. Div. Ex-Financials, Utilities and Telecommunication Services are among the highest-yielding sectors. A critical difference regards the weighting — in the WisdomTree Index, approximately 10% more weight was allocated to each of these sectors, as of July 15, 2014. o Beyond that, we can call attention to the methodology behind WT Int. Div. Ex-Financials. On an annual basis3, outside of Financials, the 300 largest constituents from the WisdomTree DEFA Index are selected. From there, the 10 highest-yielding stocks from each of the remaining nine sectors are selected. These are weighted on the basis of their dividend yields. EAFE is simply weighted by a function of float-adjusted market capitalization. We believe that WisdomTree's focus on yield is the critical factor behind this Index's strong performance during this period. 
"
2202,O," Nine out of 10 Sectors Contribute Positively to Relative Performance: The attribution column of the table is also informative. The biggest contribution to WT Int. Div. ex-Financials' outperformance of EAFE came from the Utilities sector. We're not surprised by this—Utilities are a common starting point for people seeking potentially stable dividend income from equities, as they tend to have stable cash flows and slow but incremental growth, and, in this sector, it is difficult for new entrants to upset the balance of established competitors. The fact that the attribution was positive in every other sector except Health Care, however, is a strong sign and really speaks to WT Int. Div. ex-Financials' preference for higher-yielding stocks across nearly all sectors. o It's worth noting that, even though Health Care was the lone detractor from relative performance, it was still one of the top-performing sectors, as its defensive, income-generating nature was in favor. It just so happens that EAFE had the greater weight to the sector, which gave it the advantage.

2204,O,"It's worth remembering that, at the end of 2013, there was a widespread consensus that interest rates would continue to exhibit a rising trend in 2014—something that has, thus far, turned out to be incorrect, especially when measured using the U.S. 10-Year Treasury note.4 This unexpected behavior has brought higher-yielding dividend payers into favor as potential sources of income replacement. Should rates begin to rise, we might change our view of WT Int. Div. ex-Financials as the most favorably positioned Index, but so long as developed market interest rates remain low, we think it has the potential to zero in on dividend-yield opportunities across developed markets outside the United States.

"
2239,O,"India's finance minister, Arun Jaitley, outlined targets to reign in India's government debt, encourage foreign direct investment (FDI) and ramp up infrastructure expenditure. Below are some key reform proposals and the sectors that might benefit: 
"
2240,O," Ramping Up Local Investment Efforts: In the area of infrastructure build-out, the Indian government reaffirmed its commitment to step up efforts to expand rural electrification, irrigation and affordable housing. o Bank Lending Incentives: To encourage banks to extend loans related to infrastructure projects, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will exempt banks from CRR (cash reserve ratio) and SLR (statutory liquidity ratio) requirements in relation to funds deployed for use on longer-term infrastructure projects. This measure already went into effect and should have an immediate impact to ease the burden of infrastructure loans, which have long-term horizons and were hard for banks to hold on their balance sheets with the capital requirements. o Smart Cities: To spur real estate growth, the Indian government announced a slew of measures, including developing 100 smart cities, extending incentives for housing loans and upping the allocation for affordable housing in the budget. These smart cities will be equipped with high-tech communication capabilities and next-generation infrastructure in order to facilitate rapid urbanization and job creation in India. o Reform Beneficiaries: The beneficiaries of this infrastructure build-out are notably the banks (Financials sector), real estate (Financials sector), infrastructure (Industrials sector), and power (Energy sector) industry groups.  Encouraging FDI: Given how much capital India needs to raise to build out its economy, liberalizing previously protected sectors of the market is highly encouraging. Beyond the budget proposals, more will need to be done across the board to attract foreign capital. o Liberalizing Defense and Insurance: The government upped the cap on FDI from 26% to 49% in two major areas of the Indian economy: defense and insurance. Freeing up these areas of the economy not only facilitates equity investments, it also helps with technology transfers. o Building Out Railway Infrastructure: In a separate railway budget, proposals were made to introduce FDI and promote private-and-public partnerships to build out railway infrastructure in India. o Industry Beneficiaries: These policies, if implemented properly, can buoy the insurance (Financials sector) and infrastructure (Industrials sector) industry groups in India.  Fast-Tracking of Projects: The Indian government has conveyed a sense of urgency in accelerating project execution by committing to an 8,500 km build-out of national highways, awarding 16 new port/harbor projects and completing the master planning of three smart cities and seven industrial smart cities, all during the current financial year. As a result of a pickup in investment demand, banks, infrastructure and power companies will stand to benefit.  Reigning in India's Government Deficits: Fiscal consolidation is a strong takeaway from the Indian budget. The government intends to reduce its deficit from 4.1% to 3% by 2016—17, and an important step in achieving its target is to deregulate diesel and gas prices and reduce subsidies in the current fiscal year. As a result of deregulation, the oil and power (Energy sector) companies may stand to benefit from a continued hike in diesel and gas prices.  Overhaul of Complicated Tax System Still Pending: One of the policies much discussed ahead of the budget was a reform of the tax system, which is quite complicated and includes both state and national taxes. A comprehensive goods-and-services tax (GST) that was alluded to would apply one national tax and remove the ability for states to levy their own taxes. This is one big policy that I hope to see come to fruition over next few years, as it could encourage a more efficient allocation of resources in the economy. 
"
2241,O,"While this budget has no single magic bullet that will accelerate growth in India, it does address many of the key issues India faces. When markets appreciate as much as India has in a short period of time, I believe it becomes more important to employ a disciplined investment approach that focuses on relative valuations. The WisdomTree India Earnings Index will rebalance its holdings—as it does annually—in September. The tilt to low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stocks at the last rebalance has been one of the prime drivers of returns this year. 
"
2242,O,"With Modi improving sentiment and valuations, I believe that India remains an attractive place to invest, and the steps taken in the budget reaffirm this outlook.

While this budget has no single magic bullet that will accelerate growth in India, it does address many of the key issues India faces. When markets appreciate as much as India has in a short period of time, I believe it becomes more important to employ a disciplined investment approach that focuses on relative valuations. The WisdomTree India Earnings Index will rebalance its holdings—as it does annually—in September. The tilt to low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stocks at the last rebalance has been one of the prime drivers of returns this year. With Modi improving sentiment and valuations, I believe that India remains an attractive place to invest, and the steps taken in the budget reaffirm this outlook. 1 Source: WisdomTree, Bloomberg; India ranks eighth out of the 23 countries in MSCI Emerging Markets Index.

2251,O," Currency Exposure: As a baseline, we know that the MSCI EAFE Index has 30% to 33% exposure to the euro, and about 19% to 21% exposure to both the yen and the pound3. In terms of divergences of interest: o Japanese yen: The WT International MidCap and WT International SmallCap Dividend Indexes have clear over-weights to the yen, compared to the MSCI EAFE Index, whereas the other Indexes represent significant under-weights. o Euro: The WT International Dividend ex-Financials Index is interesting for its nearly 36% exposure to Eurozone. This Index has performed strongly in 2014, helped by its significant weight in European Utilities. o WT International Hedged Dividend Growth Index: This is the only Index shown that is actually currency-hedged. Each of the other Indexes will be impacted by the movements of their underlying currency exposures versus the U.S. dollar, but this Index will not, making it very interesting for those thinking that the macroeconomic picture suggests the potential for a strengthening U.S. dollar relative to other developed-market currencies.  Cyclicals vs. Defensives: As one looks from the WT International LargeCap Dividend Index down the continuum of the size spectrum to the WT International SmallCap Dividend Index, there is a notable ramp up — almost 25% (from 60.8% in large caps to 84.5% in small caps) — in terms of exposure to cyclical sectors. This fits with an important theme: those bullish on the prospects for an economic recovery should consider small caps. o It's also worth noting that the most ""defensively positioned"" index is the WT International Dividend ex-Financials Index. We'll be examining this Index more closely in a future blog post, but suffice it to say that as defensive sectors, such as Utilities, have tended to outperform in 2014, this Index has definitely benefitted.

2260,O,"This summer President Obama has attended a bumper crop of political fundraisers, now more than 400 since taking office. He claims he wants to work with the House Republicans he mocks as ""hatin' on"" him. And, of course, Obama boasts of creating new jobs.In his weekly remarks last Saturday and almost every other week, Obama has declared something like: ""Our economy created over 200,000 new jobs in July. That’s on top of about 300,000 new jobs in June."" He asserts there would have been even more had it not been for those you-know-who's in the House.The economy is by far the most important factor controlling Obama's weakening job approval, still underwater at 41%. Approval of his economic job is even worse. So, he grabs at any seemingly positive job news, hoping to mitigate damage in November's midterm elections.Those new monthly job figures he cites are true, as far as they go.But as usual with this Chicago pol's declaratory statements, there's much more hidden than revealed.Obama does not mention that July's unemployment rate ticked up to 6.2%. He does not mention that July's new employment figure was lower than expected. And, of course, he will never recall that this is the fifth straight summer of the 2010 Recovery Summer that turned out to be as invisible as this administration's transparency.That 2010 summer was when both Obama and Joe ""That Three-Letter Word J-O-B-S"" Biden promised that their nearly trillion-dollars of stimulus spending -- that vast sum that went straight to enhance the national debt -- would be creating ""hundreds of thousands"" of new jobs in the very next month. Or the one after that. Or maybe in three months. Surely, in four.That bunk was what made ""Shovel-ready jobs"" such an embarrassing laugh line.Those two recovering senators, Obama and Biden, have danced around the jobs issue better than Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers ever could.Here's the pathetic truth about jobs under these guys:According to the latest figures from their own Department of Labor, since Jan. 20, 2009, that chilly first inauguration day, 11,472,000 Americans have left the workforce.That's as if every living human being in the state of Ohio was working and then wasn't. Or the entire population of four Chicago's. Or 14 San Francisco's. Or almost 18 Washington, D.C.'s went jobless.Put another way, ever since Aretha Franklin's huge hat sang-in Obama's era of ""Hope & Change,"" 5,682 Americans were out of a job every single day of every single week -- even the weeks Obama was vacationing. As he will be again later this week for half the month. After again promising to do everything he can to boost the economy.So, around the clock for 2,019 days every hour another 237 additional job-holders stopped earning money they could spend to employ other job-holders.And they each stopped paying income and Social Security taxes. Not to mention falling behind in pursuit of that dream of middle-class life that the Democrat professes to assist so ardently.But wait, there's more. The new EPA regulations designed to strangle the coal industry will snuff out an estimated 800,000 additional jobs.And ObamaCare has yet to take full effect in the workplace. For some strange reason, its authors wrote in requirements perversely discouraging employers from keeping full-time workers, by exempting the need to pay healthcare coverage for anyone working less than 30 hours.Take this June, for instance. Obama boasts the economy under his administration helped to create ""about 300,000 new jobs."" (Actually, 288,000.)OK. Let's look inside those numbers. During that month the United States, in fact, lost 523,000 full-time jobs. They were replaced by 811,000 new jobs.That might look good, until you realize that only 12,000 of those new jobs -- 1.4% -- were full-time. The other 799,000 ""new jobs"" -- nearly 99% -- that Obama's claiming credit for were only part-time.Apparently, in his remarks President Obama can't find time to go into such detail. We're pleased to help him out.RELATED:Two more costly losses for public unions

2319,O,"An interesting aspect of the WisdomTree annual rebalance process is identifying trends in aggregate regional Dividend Streams® of major markets.

2320,O,"The headline figure: Europe's Dividend Stream grew 12.4% compared to the 2013 annual screening.1 Let's look at how this has changed over time and the drivers of this year's growth. Figure 1: Behavior of Europe's Dividend Stream—Two Consecutive Years of Growth! 
"
2321,O," Unlike the Dividend Stream of the United States,2 which has been hitting new record highs recently, Europe's Dividend Stream of $388.3 billion still must grow 22% to reach its 2008 peak (or similarly put, currently we are 18% lower than 2008 levels). Yet clearly, the Dividend Stream is off its 2010 lows, up more than 34%, signaling positive momentum.  Financials experienced the greatest decline from 2008, going from approximately $160 billion in 2008 to approximately $86 billion in 2014. Financials must grow more than $72 billion (nearly 84%) from 2014 levels to surpass their 2008 peak. To delve into this difference in the dividends of European Financials from 2008 versus 2014, we'd like to note that in 2008, about 220 firms qualified as dividend payers in the European Financials sector, compared with 170 firms today. Royal Bank of Scotland3 is perhaps the most notable dropout, contributing more than $10 billion to the Dividend Stream in 2008 but not paying a dividend since. Factors Driving Dividend Growth

Broadly speaking, there are two drivers of Spain's dividend growth:4 o Companies Re-initiating Payments: Telefonica SA5 and Endesa SA6 are two examples of this phenomenon. Both failed to make their dividend payments leading up to the 2013 screening date, so they were not eligible to contribute to Spain's Dividend Stream. In 2014, Endesa SA had a Dividend Stream of over $2 billion, and Telefonica re-initiated an annual Dividend Stream to contribute more than $4.6 billion. o Companies Growing Dividends Significantly: Repsol SA7 is an example of a firm that was included in Europe's Dividend Stream in 2013, but that nearly doubled its dividend per share for this year's screening date.

2358,O,"Top brand builder Christine Day has simple advice for corporate managers and executives:
"
2359,O,"Once you've reached the top of your game, don't flaunt it while on the job. Never act like you've earned it.
"
2360,O,"Instead, she says, become a ""servant leader,"" one who inspires employees toward the top while turning customers into repeat shoppers.
"
2361,O,"That principle has helped Day shine at Starbucks (SBUX) — where she joined the coffeehouse giant in the mid-1980s as employee No. 3 — and at Lululemon Athletica (LULU), where she served as the company's first woman CEO from July 2008 to the end of 2013 and oversaw a stock rise of 3,700%.
"
2362,O,"Now she's trying to cook up a winner as CEO of food maker Luvo.
"
2363,O,"At Starbucks, Day knew a senior executive who took an expensive limousine car to the airport and meetings, rather than a simple taxi. When the exec went on business trips, he stayed only at five-star hotels.
"
2364,O,"It was obvious to Day that her colleague felt the status of the hotel and other perks properly telegraphed his status within the company. But ""this mattered more than the quality of the work and the quality of the relationships he was generating,"" Day, 52, told IBD. ""He treated it as his due rather than understanding he served the organization and the people.""

2365,O,"The Day Way
"
2366,O,"She tried to greet each workday with humility.
"
2367,O,"Her first job: office manager of Howard Schultz's new five-store company. Over a 20-year stint through the mid-2000s, she rose all the way up to president of Starbucks' Asia-Pacific group.
"
2368,O,"By 2007, the company operated several hundred stores across China, Thailand, Australia, Japan and Singapore.
"
2369,O,"Throughout that journey, Day made a point of learning vital skills from mentors.
"
2370,O,"At Starbucks, she had three major ones — current CEO Howard Schultz, former CEO Orin Smith and former Starbucks International head Howard Behar. Day took the first letter of each man's first name and called them her H-2-O.
"
2371,O,"Schultz taught her how to create a vision, how to build a brand and how to develop a product ""that is so good and combining it with a purpose so that it causes market disruption,"" she said while attending the Expo West natural products industry show this past March in Anaheim, Calif.
"
2372,O,"Smith gave Day lessons on how to turn a business model into delivering 20% growth in return on capital and 5% increases in same-store sales quarter after quarter.
"
2373,O,"He taught her how to run business units and maintain disciplined accounting at overseas units.
"
2374,O,"Behar brought Day on board with the concept of the servant leader.
"
2375,O,"Day said that along the way she grasped the importance of becoming an ""effective people coach"" and ""how to develop internal talent by creating mentoring programs.""
"
2376,O,"In 2008, Day made her most dramatic career move when she took over Lululemon. Fulfilling her dream of heading a high-growth company, she helped build the yoga-inspired firm, started by Chip Wilson in 1998 in Vancouver, British Columbia, into a multinational powerhouse in athletic apparel.
"
2377,O,"The company's results were as fit as its products.

2378,O,"From fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2014, ended in January, Lululemon's earnings per share jumped 730%. Sales rose 489% over the same time frame, from $270 million to $1.6 billion. Along the way, its stock soared from a 2009 low of 2.17 to as high as 82.50 in June 2013.
"
2379,O,"Born in Northern Ireland, Day moved to Western Canada in 1964 after her father, a former pro soccer player, changed course after a sports injury and pursued a career in mechanical engineering.
"
2380,O,"Going to America for college, Day got a business degree at Central Washington University in 1984 and quickly joined a firm in the Evergreen State that specialized in private placement investments.
"
2381,O,"While working in a state that would turn into America's coffee hub, she met Starbucks' Schultz on the job and joined his fledgling company, then known as Il Giornale, in 1986. A year later, Schultz acquired the Starbucks company.
"
2382,O,"At Lululemon, Day worked hard on brand-building campaigns that inspired professional yoga instructors and world-class athletes to work for the company as product ambassadors.
"
2383,O,"""They have an incredible sponsorship program that radiates their self-improvement culture out into the community and impacts the best athletes' lives in a huge way,"" Chandra Crawford, a Canadian gold medalist in women's cross-country skiing at the 2006 Turin Winter Olympics, told IBD.
"
2384,O,"Crawford met Day in the late 2000s, when the skier became one of what Lululemon calls their elite ambassadors. That tag gave Crawford and fellow athletes a chance to join Lululemon-hosted retreats and share ideas for product innovation. She paddled a two-woman kayak with Day through the inlets of Vancouver Island and developed a strong personal relationship.

2385,O,"Top Training
"
2386,O,"""I learned two things (from Christine): One, we share practices like yoga to balance and sustain our drive. Two, the level of understanding people in order to be successful in business is equivalent to multiple Ph.D.s,"" said Crawford, who now runs Fast and Female, a nonprofit organization based in Alberta that promotes well-being through sport for girls 9 to 19.
"
2387,O,"Day grasps that good store managers have a huge impact on building brand loyalty among customers.
"
2388,O,"With Lululemon, she made sure a store-based community was more than where staff talked with customers or gave free yoga lessons.
"
2389,O,"She wanted managers to have unparalleled knowledge about the product — be it yoga pants featuring high-tech fibers, a tank top for exercise or a cold-weather running jacket — and customer needs.
"
2390,O,"Day resisted excessive shifting of store managers among locations, as it would undermine continuity at a store. So she created rules:
"
2391,O,"• 1. A store manager had to work at Lululemon at least six months before opening a new store on his own at a different location.
"
2392,O,"• 2. Assistant managers should be promoted in their store if the top gun moves to a new store.
"
2393,O,"Homey
"
2394,O,"""Your store is a community,"" Day said. ""When a manager moves too often, it breaks down the relationships with the community, the staff and the operating results of the store."" The firm's in-house studies showed that having the same manager for two years increased profitability by 20% on average.
"
2395,O,"Two weeks ago, on June 12, Lululemon shares dropped 16% in heavy volume after the company reported quarterly earnings and sales that reflected an ongoing slowdown in growth. Earnings beat the consensus estimate, but rose just 6% year over year.
"
2396,O,"The stock has rebounded in recent days, but analysts have shaved their full-year profit estimates.
"
2397,O,"When Day announced she would leave Lululemon in 2013, Stephen Sidwell, the founder of Luvo, pounced. He contacted Day and asked her to take the CEO post. His goal: Find the right person to take the young firm to the next level.
"
2398,O,"""She had had two phenomenal brand-building experiences,"" he said. ""At Starbucks, she really helped Howard (Schultz) build the organization to what it is today. What she did for beverages is what we're doing for food.""
"
2399,O,"Sidwell, a former investment banker, says it was easy to convince Day about his company's mission. The harder part: asking Day to give up plans to take a year off from the corporate grind. She signed up, taking the new CEO post on a full-time basis this past April 1.
"
2400,O,"""She is an incredibly collaborative leader and has a really wonderful demeanor when it comes to leadership,"" Sidwell said. ""She really gets the vision of what we're trying to do, and has been able to put that vision into plans and organize it in an efficient way. People can see it and understand it.""
"
2401,O,"Luvo, which has drawn an investment from New York Yankees superstar Derek Jeter, aims to raise the quality of frozen food by using ingredients such as quinoa, kale and whole grains.
"
2402,O,"Luvo's frozen chicken chile verde won a Best of the West press award at this year's Expo West.
"
2403,O,"In January 2013, the firm started distribution to 91 grocery stores owned by Safeway (SWY). That has swelled to 6,500 stores, including top retailers Kroger (KR), Target (TGT) and Publix, plus the Home Shopping Network. Also, Luvo meals are featured on select Delta (DAL) flights.Top brand builder Christine Day has simple advice for corporate managers and executives:Once you've reached the top of your game, don't flaunt it while on the job. Never act like you've earned it.Instead, she says, become a ""servant leader,"" one who inspires employees toward the top while turning customers into repeat shoppers.That principle has helped Day shine at Starbucks (SBUX) — where she joined the coffeehouse giant in the mid-1980s as employee No. 3 — and at Lululemon Athletica (LULU), where she served as the company's first woman CEO from July 2008 to the end of 2013 and oversaw a stock rise of 3,700%.Now she's trying to cook up a winner as CEO of food maker Luvo.At Starbucks, Day knew a senior executive who took an expensive limousine car to the airport and meetings, rather than a simple taxi. When the exec went on business trips, he stayed only at five-star hotels.It was obvious to Day that her colleague felt the status of the hotel and other perks properly telegraphed his status within the company. But ""this mattered more than the quality of the work and the quality of the relationships he was generating,"" Day, 52, told IBD. ""He treated it as his due rather than understanding he served the organization and the people.""The Day WayShe tried to greet each workday with humility.Her first job: office manager of Howard Schultz's new five-store company. Over a 20-year stint through the mid-2000s, she rose all the way up to president of Starbucks' Asia-Pacific group.By 2007, the company operated several hundred stores across China, Thailand, Australia, Japan and Singapore.Throughout that journey, Day made a point of learning vital skills from mentors.At Starbucks, she had three major ones — current CEO Howard Schultz, former CEO Orin Smith and former Starbucks International head Howard Behar. Day took the first letter of each man's first name and called them her H-2-O.Schultz taught her how to create a vision, how to build a brand and how to develop a product ""that is so good and combining it with a purpose so that it causes market disruption,"" she said while attending the Expo West natural products industry show this past March in Anaheim, Calif.Smith gave Day lessons on how to turn a business model into delivering 20% growth in return on capital and 5% increases in same-store sales quarter after quarter.He taught her how to run business units and maintain disciplined accounting at overseas units.Behar brought Day on board with the concept of the servant leader.Day said that along the way she grasped the importance of becoming an ""effective people coach"" and ""how to develop internal talent by creating mentoring programs.""In 2008, Day made her most dramatic career move when she took over Lululemon. Fulfilling her dream of heading a high-growth company, she helped build the yoga-inspired firm, started by Chip Wilson in 1998 in Vancouver, British Columbia, into a multinational powerhouse in athletic apparel.The company's results were as fit as its products.From fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2014, ended in January, Lululemon's earnings per share jumped 730%. Sales rose 489% over the same time frame, from $270 million to $1.6 billion.

2426,O,"Unlike other major retailers hit by the harsh winter season, auto-parts retailers continue to perform strongly, with AutoZone (AZO) reporting Tuesday that its third-quarter earnings climbed 16.4%.AutoZone's Q3 EPS of $8.46 beat estimates by a penny and marked the company's 31st consecutive quarter of double-digit growth.Sales rose 6.2% to $2.34 billion, just past estimates of $2.3 billion. The company's gross-profit margin rose to 52% compared with 51.8% in the year-earlier quarter.A tough winter season contributed to higher industrywide sales of replacement parts, and AutoZone is not alone in its growth. Advance Auto Parts (AAP) and O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) also had quarterly earnings that beat projections. Advance Auto Parts' EPS jumped 36.4% and O'Reilly's rose 18.4% in their latest reports.AutoZone's same-store sales climbed 4% in the quarter. It opened 30 new stores in the U.S. and seven new stores in Mexico, bringing its tally to 5,279 stores total.""I would say that our sales performed a little bit better in the third quarter than our expectations, particularly when the winter subsided and the taxes refunds were flowing, we had some tremendous weeks in that period of time,"" said CEO Bill Rhodes in a post-earnings conference call with analysts. ""It rebounded quicker, and we've been encouraged by the deferrable maintenance categories and how they've continued to perform within the quarter.""As detailed in an IBD Industry Snapshot, the demand for replacement batteries, starters and alternators rises seasonally as snow and ice affect driving conditions.

2440,O,"Rayonier Inc. (RYN  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 pro forma net income per share of 31 cents, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 16 cents. Further, the bottom line surpassed the prior-year quarter figure of 27 cents.Total sales for the first quarter came in at $203 million, up 4.4% year over year, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $191 million.Results reflect decent performance of the Pacific Northwest and New Zealand Timber segments, backed by rise in sawtimber prices, as well as 12% higher harvest volumes. In the Real Estate segment, the company increased its dispositions and also enjoyed higher average pricing.  However, performance in the Corporate segment was disappointing.Moreover, shares of the company gained nearly 1%, and closed at $37.92 on May 3, 2018.Rayonier Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Rayonier Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Rayonier Inc. QuoteSegmental PerformanceDuring the reported quarter, pro forma operating income at the company’s Southern Timber segment declined to $12.2 million from $13.9 million recorded in the year-ago quarter.The Pacific Northwest Timber posted pro forma operating income of $4.7 million against operating loss of $0.9 million incurred in first-quarter 2017.New Zealand Timber reported pro forma operating income of $16 million, significantly up from the prior-year quarter figure of $10 million.Real Estate’s pro forma operating income was $28.1 million, lower than the year-ago figure of $29.7 million.Trading segment’s pro forma operating income was $0.1 million, down from the year-ago figure of $1.1 million.Lastly, pro forma operating loss at the Corporate and Other segment was $4 million compared with a loss of $4.8 million incurred in first-quarter 2017.LiquidityRayonier ended the first quarter with $92.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, down from $112.7 million recorded at the end of first-quarter 2017.

2442,O,"Ushering in good news for its shareholders, Realty Income Corporation (O  -  Free Report) recently announced its 97th dividend hike since the company’s NYSE listing in 1994. The company will now pay 22 cents per share compared with the 21.95 cents paid earlier.Realty Income will pay the dividend on Jul 13 to shareholders on record as of Jul 2, 2018. The latest dividend rate marks an annualized amount of $2.64 per share versus the prior rate of $2.634 per share. Based on the company’s share price of $52.85 on Jun 19, this results in a dividend yield of around 5%, which is marginally ahead of the industry’s yield of 4.94%. This is likely to draw investors’ attention to the stock, to some extent.Admittedly, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT investors and Realty Income remains committed to boosting shareholders’ wealth. The company enjoys a trademark on the phrase “The Monthly Dividend Company” and the July 2018 dividend payment will mark its 83 consecutive quarterly increases, as well as payment of more than $5.5 billion throughout the company’s 49-year operating history. In fact, this retail REIT has generated a compound average annual dividend growth of around 4.7% since its listing on the NYSE. Given its financial position and lower debt-to-equity ratio compared to the industry, the latest dividend rate is likely to be sustainable.Notably, dwindling mall traffic, amid shift of consumers toward online channels, store closures and bankruptcy of retailers have emerged as pressing concerns for most retail REITs, including Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM  -  Free Report), GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report) and Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report). However, Realty Income has been able to differentiate itself by deriving 90% of its annualized retail rental revenues from tenants belonging to service, non-discretionary and low-price retail business. Such businesses are less susceptible to economic recessions and competition from Internet retailing.The company’s solid underlying real estate quality and prudent underwriting at acquisitions has helped maintain high occupancy levels consistently. In fact, since 1996, the company’s occupancy level has never been below 96%. Moreover, in first-quarter 2018, it attained the highest quarter-end occupancy in more than 10 years. Additionally, its same-store rent growth underlines limited operational volatility.Moreover, Realty Income adheres to a conservative capital structure. It has modest leverage, robust liquidity, and continued access to attractively priced equity and debt capital. In addition, it has a well-laddered debt maturity schedule.Nonetheless, the company’s substantial exposure to single-tenant assets raises risks associated with tenant default. Further, generation of notable rental revenues from assets leased to drug stores and rate hike add to its woes.Shares of Realty Income have outperformed the industry it belongs to, in the past three months. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 5.9%, while the industry reported growth of 5.5% during the same time frame.

2443,O,"Realty Income’s (O  -  Free Report) solid property acquisition volume is expected to keep the company on the growth curve. This freestanding retail real estate investment trust (REIT) derives majority of its retail rental revenues from tenants, belonging to service, non-discretionary and low-price retail businesses. Such businesses are less vulnerable to economic recessions as well as competition from Internet retailing.The company’s portfolio is well diversified with respect to tenant, industry, geography and property type. Itss properties are located in 49 states and Puerto Rico. Further, tenants operate in 47 different industries. In addition, beside retail properties, Realty Income’s portfolio comprises industrial, office as well as agricultural properties. This diversification helps the company mitigate risk associated with a particular industry, geography or asset type.Moreover, Realty Income is focused on external growth by exploring accretive acquisition opportunities. During first-quarter 2018, the company invested $509.8 million in 174 new properties and properties under development or expansion, situated in 27 states. The assets are fully leased, with a weighted average lease term of around 14 years and an initial average cash lease yield of 6.2%.Around 85% of rental revenues, from acquisitions reported during the quarter, came in from investment grade-rated tenants. Moreover, based on prevailing market conditions and strength in its investment pipeline, the company continues to expect acquisition volume of $1.0-$1.5 billion for 2018.Additionally, Realty Income’s solid underlying real estate quality and prudent underwriting at acquisition have helped it maintain high occupancy levels consistently. In fact, since 1996, the company’s occupancy level has never been below 96%. Moreover, in first-quarter 2018, the company attained its highest quarter-end occupancy in more than 10 years. Also, its same-store rent growth depicted limited operational volatility.Furthermore, in March 2018, the company announced a hike in its common stock monthly cash dividend, denoting its 96th dividend increase since its NYSE listing in 1994. The company enjoys a trademark on the phrase “The Monthly Dividend Company”. In fact, the company has generated a compound average annual dividend growth of around 4.7% since its listing on the NYSE. Given its financial position and lower debt-to-equity ratio compared with the industry, this dividend rate is likely to be sustainable.In six months’ time, shares of Realty Income have outperformed the industry it belongs to. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have declined 6%, narrower than the industry’s loss of 7.3%.Nevertheless, despite Realty Income’s effort to diversify the tenant base, its tenants in the drug store industry accounted for around 10.5% of its rental revenues in first-quarter 2018. This makes the company’s results susceptible to any adverse changes in this industry because a downturn in the industry or a change in the legislation — relating to prescription drugs, could substantially affect Realty Income’s tenants and in turn, affect the revenue stream of this REIT. Moreover, the choppy retail real estate environment and tenant credit issues remain concerns. Further, rate hike adds to its woes.Also, Realty Income has a substantial exposure to single tenant assets. In fact, of the company’s 5,326 properties in the portfolio, as of Mar 31, 2018; 5,298 or 99.5% are single-tenant properties and the remaining are multi-tenant assets. However, single-tenant leases involve specific and significant risks associated with tenant default. Thus, in case of financial failure of, or default in payment by, a single tenant, the company’s rental revenues from that property as well as the value of the property suffers significantly.Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks from the REIT space include Park Hotels & Resorts Inc. (PK  -  Free Report), LaSalle Hotel Properties (LHO  -  Free Report) and Arbor Realty Trust (ABR  -  Free Report). While Park Hotels & Resorts sports a Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy), LaSalle Hotel and Arbor Realty carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $3.16.Our TakeRealty Income’s high occupancy of its properties in the first quarter looks impressive.

2446,O,"Outfront Media, Inc. (OUT  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted funds from operations (FFO) per share of 27 cents, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Further, the figure came in lower than the year-ago quarter tally of 28 cents.Results reflected weakness in the national advertising market. Further, operating expenses rose on a year-over-year basis. However, these were partially offset by higher billboard and transit revenues.Revenues in the reported quarter came in at $337.9 million, marginally surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $337.6 million. Further, revenues rose 2.2% from the year-ago figure.Moreover, the company’s share price increased 1.78% to $19.39 during Thursday’s regular trading session.Quarter in DetailBillboard revenues of $239.3 million in the reported quarter indicated a year-over-year increase of $3.3 million. Results primarily benefited from an increase in revenues from the conversion of digital billboards, acquisition of digital billboards in Canada and higher average revenues per display (yield) in U.S. Media. However, these were partially offset by lower proceeds from condemnations.Transit and other revenues of $98.6 million increased 4.2% from the prior-year quarter. This was due to the impact of new accounting standards on Sports Marketing operating segment and rise in digital transit displays.Operating expenses of $197.1 million inched up 2.7% year over year, mainly due to higher billboard property-lease costs, relating to New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) billboard agreement, impact from the acquisition of digital billboards in Canada and elevated expenses associated with the Sports Marketing operating segment.Adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization inched up 1.2% year over year to $81.2 million.Net cash flow, resulting from operating activities for the year ending Mar 31, 2018, came in at $62.1 million, down from $32.2 million recorded in the comparable period last year. Results were affected primarily due to the improvement in working capital items and the timing of payments made under the MTA agreement.As of Mar 31, 2018, Outfront Media’s liquidity position comprised cash of $52.5 million, as well as $331.5 million of availability under its $430 revolving credit facility, net of $88.5 million of issued letters of credit against the revolving credit facility.Our TakeOutfront Media is making diligent efforts to expand its digital-display portfolio. It resorted to acquisitions, swaps and conversion of traditional static-billboard displays to digital-billboard displays to focus on this low-cost out-of-home (OOH) platform. These strategic efforts bode well for its long-term growth.However, the dreary environment in the national advertising market remains a risk.

Core FFO per share improved 5.1% from the year-ago quarter figure of $2.94.Results reflect growth in net operating income (NOI) and high occupancy level.Total revenues of $347.3 million in the quarter grew 3.5% year over year. However, the figure narrowly missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $347.5 million.Quarter in DetailDuring the reported quarter, Essex Property’s same-property gross revenues grew 3.3% from the prior-year quarter, while same-property net operating income (NOI) improved 3.6% year over year. Financial occupancies of 97.1% expanded 60 basis points (bps) year over year.Essex Property exited first-quarter 2018 with cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, of $139.1 million, up from $61.1 million recorded at the end of 2017.Notably, in January 2018, the company made an amendment to its unsecured line of credit facility, thereby enhancing the maximum amount available for borrowing from $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion, as well as lengthening the maturity to December 2021. As of Apr 27, 2018, the company had around $1.2 billion in undrawn capacity on its unsecured credit facilities.During the reported quarter, the company repurchased 16,834 shares of its common stock for a total of $3.8 million (including commissions), at an average price of $224.13 per share.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $12.43.The current-year projection is backed by expectations for same-property revenue growth in the band of 2.3-3.0%, denoting a 15-basis-point (bps) increase at the mid-point, and same-property NOI growth in the 2-3.4% range, marking 20-bps growth at the midpoint.For second-quarter 2018, the company projects core FFO per share of $3.00-$3.10. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $3.10.ConclusionWe are encouraged with the stellar Q1 performance of Essex Property, in terms of FFO per share. However, the company’s revenue miss remains a disappointment. With a strong property base and solid balance sheet, Essex Property is likely to leverage on favorable demographic trends in its markets.The company’s substantial exposure to the West Coast market, which is home to several innovation and technology companies, offers ample scope to boost its top line over the long term. Nonetheless, aggressive rental concessions and moderate pricing power amid high supply remain concerns. Also, rate hike adds to its woes.Essex Property currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Such businesses are less susceptible to economic recessions and competition from Internet retailing.Additionally, Realty Income’s solid underlying real estate quality and prudent underwriting at acquisition has helped the company maintain high occupancy levels consistently. In fact, since 1996, its occupancy level has never been below 96%. In 2018 too, the company projects occupancy to remain at approximately 98%. Additionally, its same-store rent growth underlines limited operational volatility.The company continues to maintain a conservative capital structure. It has modest leverage, robust liquidity, and continued access to attractively priced equity and debt capital. Moreover, it has a well-laddered debt maturity schedule.Furthermore, in January 2018, the company announced a hike in its common stock monthly cash dividend, denoting the 95th dividend increase since its NYSE listing in 1994. The company enjoys a trademark on the phrase “The Monthly Dividend Company” and the February 2018 dividend payment not only marked its 571 consecutive monthly dividend payouts throughout its 49-year operating history, but also 81 consecutive quarterly increases.The company has maintained the same dividend rate for the March 2018 payout as well. In fact, it has generated a compound average annual dividend growth of around 4.7% since its listing on the NYSE. Given its financial position and lower debt-to-equity ratio compared to that of the industry, this dividend rate is likely to be sustainable.Nevertheless, despite Realty Income’s effort to diversify the tenant base, its tenants in the drug store industry accounted for around 10.6% of the company’s rental revenues in fourth-quarter 2017. This makes the company’s results susceptible to any adverse changes in this industry because a downturn in the industry or a change in legislation relating to prescription drugs, could substantially impact Realty Income’s tenants and in turn, dampen the revenue stream of this REIT. Also, the choppy retail real estate environment and tenant credit issues remain concerns. Further, rate hike adds to its woes.Shares of Realty Income have outperformed the industry it belongs to, in a month’s time.

2452,O,"Shrinking footfall at malls amid shift of consumers toward online channels, store closures and bankruptcy of retailers emerged as a pressing concern for majority of the retail REITs. But not all are equally facing the brunt, and some have managed to book gains even in this environment, thanks to the business models.On such stock is Realty Income Corporation (O  -  Free Report), shares of which have outperformed the industry in the past three months, gaining 2.5% against 1.9% increase of that of its industry.The company’s portfolio is well diversified with respect to tenant, industry, geography and property type. Its properties are located in 49 states and Puerto Rico. Further, tenants operate in 47 different industries. In addition, besides retail properties, the company’s portfolio comprises industrial, office, as well as agricultural properties. This diversification helps mitigate risks associated with a particular industry, geography or asset type.Importantly, this freestanding retail REIT derives more than 90% of its annualized retail rental revenue from tenants with a service, non-discretionary, and/or low price point component to their business. Such businesses are less susceptible to economic recessions, as well as competition from Internet retailing. Moreover, the company targets industrial properties leased to Fortune 1000, mainly investment grade rated companies. These efforts boost the stability of the rental revenue generated from the properties.Also, the company’s solid underlying real estate quality and prudent underwriting at acquisition has helped the company maintain high occupancy levels consistently. In fact, since 1996, the company’s occupancy level has never been below 96%. In 2017 too, the company projects occupancy to remain at approximately 98%. Additionally, its same store rent growth depicted limited operational volatility.The company continues to maintain a conservative capital structure. It has modest leverage, robust liquidity, and continued access to attractively priced equity and debt capital. Moreover, it has well-laddered debt maturity schedule.Also, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT shareholders, and Realty Income remains committed to that. The company enjoys a trademark on the phrase “The Monthly Dividend Company.” To date the company has hiked its dividend 92 times since its public listing in 1994 and declared 566 consecutive common stock monthly dividends in its 48-year operating history.However, despite Realty Income’s effort to diversify the tenant base, its tenants in the drug store industry accounted for around 11.0% of its rental revenue in second-quarter 2017. This makes the company’s results susceptible to any adverse changes in this industry.Further, the company has a substantial exposure to single tenant assets. In fact, of the company’s 5,028 properties in the portfolio, as of Jun 30, 2017, 5,000, or 99.4%, are single-tenant properties and the rest are multi-tenant assets. However, single-tenant leases involve specific and significant risks associated with tenant default. Thus, in case of financial failure of, or default in payment by, a single tenant, the company’s rental revenue from that property as well as the value of the property suffers significantly.Realty Income currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the real estate space include American Assets Trust, Inc.

However, the figure compared unfavorably with the year-ago number of $492.2 million.Behind the HeadlinesHCP experienced 0.2% year-over-year decline in the three-month cash SPP NOI. Though there was growth of 0.4% in life-science cash NOI, 0.5% increase in senior-housing triple-net and 1.6% rise in the Medical office portfolio, the positives were offset by 6.4% decrease in senior-housing operating portfolio (SHOP) cash NOI.During the quarter under review, HCP completed the sale of six assets, totaling $275 million to Brookdale Senior Living.In March, the management of 24 senior-housing communities, owned by HCP, were being transitioned to Atria Senior Living. 13 have already been transitioned and others, which await a few regulatory approvals, are expected to be transitioned by the second quarter.HCP closed the prior-announced $112 million sale of Tandem mezzanine loan investment that resulted in an impairment recovery of $3 million.HCP had cash and cash equivalents of around $86 million as of Mar 31, 2018, up from $55.3 million recorded at the end of 2017.

Strategic divestitures, efforts to lower the Brookdale portfolio concentration and a focus on deleveraging augur well for long-term growth. In March, in sync with its strategic efforts, the company announced the shift in its operator for 24 senior living communities owned by them, from Brookdale to Atria Senior Living.Nevertheless, the softness in the seniors’ housing fundamentals amid new supply is anticipated to thwart the company’s pricing power.

2458,O,"The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report) — a retail real estate investment trust (REIT) — is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 2, after the market closes. Its funds from operations (FFO) per share and revenues are anticipated to decline year over year.In the last reported quarter, the company posted FFO per share of $1.13, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.8%. Results underscored a contraction in portfolio occupancy and total revenues.Over the trailing four quarters, Macerich beat estimates in two occasions for as many misses, resulting in an average beat of 1.2%. This is depicted in the chart below:Macerich Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Macerich Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Macerich Company (The) QuoteFactors That Might Influence Q1 ResultsMacerich has a secure portfolio of premium malls in vibrant U.S. markets. We anticipate the company to have enjoyed stable source of rent in the to-be-reported quarter from its tenants that include several well-capitalized retailers.Additionally, Macerich’s omni-channel distribution model, steadily rising demand and aggressive capital-recycling program amid modest supply are expected to have been conducive to the company’s Jan-Mar quarter performance.Amid prevalent challenges in the retail real estate sector, during the quarter, Macerich formed a joint venture with Hudson Pacific Properties to transform the iconic mall — The Westside Pavilion  — into an office space.Although the company is resorting to different strategies, mall traffic continues to remain considerably depressed with consumers increasingly opting for online purchases. This has led to a rising number of retailers joining the dot-com bandwagon. In fact, the first few months of the year witnessed several preeminent retail bankruptcy filings and record-high defaults by retail corporates.Subsequently, the company’s minimum rental revenues are expected to have registered a fall from the prior-year quarter. The company realizes minimum rents on a straight-line basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first-quarter minimum rental revenues is currently pegged at $142 million. This indicates a sequential decline of 6%.  Percentage rents, realized when tenants' specified sales targets have been met, is also anticipated to witness significant year-over-year drop due to the tepid retail environment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.7 million reflects a 10% dip from the prior-year quarter.  Prior to the first-quarter earnings release, there is lack of any solid catalyst for raising optimism about the company’s business activities and prospects. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share in the soon-to-be-reported quarter was revised 2.4% downward to 81 cents, over the past week. Further, this indicates a decline of 6.9% year over year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $214.8 million, indicating a year-over-year fall of 13.1%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Macerich will likely beat estimates this season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

2459,O,"GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 5, before the market opens. Both its funds from operations (FFO) per share and revenues are anticipated to improve year over year.This retail real estate investment trust’s (REIT) fourth-quarter 2017 FFO per share of 48 cents beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a cent. The figure was also higher than 43 cents posted in fourth-quarter 2016. Also, results reflected 1.3% year-over-year growth in same-store net operating income (NOI).Over the preceding four quarters, the company surpassed estimates in two occasions and met in the other two, the average positive surprise being 4.1%. This is depicted in the graph below.General Growth Properties, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  General Growth Properties, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | General Growth Properties, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderOn Mar 26, GGP accepted the revised acquisition offer extended by Brookfield Property Partners, per which Brookfield will acquire the GGP shares, it doesn’t own yet, for nearly $15.3 billion, gaining complete ownership of the second-largest U.S. mall owner.Notably, GGP continues to bear the brunt of the lackluster retail real estate market. In fact, recent data from real estate research firm — Reis — states that U.S. retail real estate vacancies persisted at the 10% levels for first-quarter 2018. Additionally, mall traffic continues to suffer as e-commerce has been increasingly capturing market share from the traditional brick-and-mortar stores, compelling retailers to resort to online options or file bankruptcy. In fact, the first few months of the year witnessed several preeminent retail bankruptcy filings and record-high defaults by retail corporates.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $368 million for minimum rents underscores a decline from the prior-quarter figure of $393 million. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for overage rents of $6.53 million highlights a steep sequential plunge of nearly 70%.Nonetheless, GGP has a solid portfolio of high-quality retail properties across attractive locations in the United States. In addition, it has been making efforts to counter retail pressure through various initiatives. The company is focusing on omni-channel retailing to generate higher sales. Moreover, it is focused on offering mall visitors with access to retail, dining and entertainment hubs in some of the best trade areas in the nation.The above-mentioned moves are expected to boost the shopping experience and enhance sales volume at tenant stores, consequently raising demand for the company’s assets.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $603 million, indicating projected growth of 6.5% from the year-ago period.Furthermore, GGP’s activities during the quarter could not gain analyst confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share remained unchanged at 37 cents over the past month. This indicates estimated rise of 2.8% year over year.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that GGP will likely beat FFO estimates this time around. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

2461,O,"EPR Properties (EPR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 8, after the closing bell. The company’s funds from operations (FFO) per share and revenues are anticipated to increase year over year.In the last reported quarter, this real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a negative surprise of 10.42% in terms of FFO per share.Over the trailing four quarters, the company surpassed estimates in one occasion and missed in three others. This resulted in an average negative surprise of 3.21%. The graph below depicts the surprise history of the company:EPR Properties Price and EPS Surprise EPR Properties Price and EPS Surprise | EPR Properties Quote Factors to ConsiderEPR Properties is a specialty REIT that focuses on investments in properties across three primary market segments — Entertainment, Recreation and Education. Strategic investment in each of its segments, a diversified tenant base amid an improving economy and upbeat consumer confidence are likely to drive the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.Particularly, growth in the millennial generation is likely to aid its Entertainment segment as millennials constitute the major part of frequent movie-goers. This group has grown considerably over time. Further, renovation works, along with new food and beverage concepts introduced in megaplex theatres, are aimed at improving the consumer experience. This will likely improve attendance and drive revenues in the quarter under review. Moreover, during the fourth-quarter 2017 earnings release, the company announced that 2018 witnessed a strong start with a few movies, recording phenomenal revenues at the box-office. The company expects 2018 box-office revenues to return to positive growth.Further, with solid demand for properties amid an economic recovery backed by job growth, the Recreation segment too promises a decent performance. Notably, during the second quarter of 2017, the company substantially expanded its portfolio of ski properties and attractions with the casino lifestyle properties transaction.Furthermore, investments in the Education segment are anticipated to boost its performance. The company is expected to experience growth in enrolment as there is a healthy demand for quality education and associated facilities amid modest supply.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $126.7 million, marking an expected increase of 18.4% year over year.Moreover, in a month’s time, the company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the first quarter remained unchanged at $1.24. This denotes a projected increase of 7.8% from the prior-year period.However, the company has a substantial development pipeline, which increases its operational risks. Further, increase in interest rate can add to its woes.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that EPR Properties will likely beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for EPR Properties is 0.00%.

2462,O,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season Realty Income Corporation (O  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Realty Income is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat.

This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for O, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.91% heading into earnings season.Realty Income Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Realty Income Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Realty Income Corporation QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

2463,O,"Realty Income Corp. (O  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results after the market closes on May 8. The company’s funds from operations (FFO) per share and revenues are estimated to have witnessed a rise year over year.In the last reported quarter, this monthly-dividend-paying real estate investment trust (REIT) posted a negative surprise of 1.3%, in terms of FFO per share. It witnessed modest year-over-year growth in same-store rents and had exited the quarter with lower liquidity.Notably, Realty Income has a mixed surprise history. The company surpassed estimates in two occasions, missed in one and met in the other, over the trailing four quarters, resulting in an average positive surprise of 0.34%. This is depicted in the graph below:Realty Income Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Realty Income Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Realty Income Corporation QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderRealty Income’s portfolio is well diversified with respect to tenant, industry, geography and property type. Besides retail properties, the company’s portfolio comprises industrial, office as well as agricultural properties. Further, it derives more than 90% of its annualized retail rental revenues from tenants with a service, non-discretionary, and/or low price point component to their business. Such businesses are less susceptible to economic recessions, as well as competition from Internet retail. This is expected to have helped the company enjoy higher retail revenues in the Jan-Mar quarter. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the company’s retail segment for first quarter is pegged at $303 million. This reflects a robust 6% increase from the prior-year quarter.Also, the company targets industrial properties leased to Fortune 1000, mainly investment grade-rated companies, which ensures stable revenues from these properties.Encouragingly, Realty Income’s FFO per share estimates witnessed positive revision. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter FFO per share has been revised upward by a cent to 79 cents, over the last 30 days, reflecting bullish analyst sentiment. This also reflects 3.9% year-over-year increase from the prior-year quarter.Additionally, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $321.6 million, indicating a year-over-year rise of 7.9%.However, the retail real estate market remained turbulent amid retailer bankruptcies and store closures. Particularly, mall traffic has been affected, and retail landlords, including GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), Regency Centers Corporation (REG  -  Free Report) and Kimco Realty Corporation (KIM  -  Free Report), have felt the heat due to consumers’ preferences increasingly shifting toward e-retail. In addition, the company has substantial exposure to single-tenant assets which raises its risks associated with tenant default.Amid these, growth in revenues from tenant reimbursements is expected to have been modest. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for tenant reimbursements of $11.31 million reflects around 1.2% increase from the prior quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Realty Income has the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which increases the odds of an earnings beat in the first quarter.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Realty Income is +1.91%Zacks Rank: Realty Income has a Zacks Rank of 3.

Results reflect better-than-expected revenue numbers for the quarter. The company also reaffirmed its 2018 guidance.Reflecting positive sentiments, shares of Mack-Cali climbed nearly 4.4% to $18.10 during regular trading session on May 3.In fact, total revenues of around $139 million comfortably exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $130.2 million.However, on a year-over-year basis, core FFO per share fell 10.7%, while revenues declined 7.3%.Quarter in DetailAs of Mar 31, 2018, Mack-Cali’s consolidated core office properties were 85.2% leased, which shrunk 240 basis points (bps) from the prior-quarter end. Same-store cash revenues for the office portfolio descended 2.8%, while same-store cash net operating income (NOI) fell 8.7%.  During the reported quarter, Mack-Cali executed 41 lease deals, spanning around 265,885 square feet of space, at the company’s consolidated in-service commercial portfolio. This comprised 21% for new leases, and 79% for lease renewals and other tenant-retention deals.Further, for the core portfolio, rental rate roll up for first-quarter 2018 deals was 5.1% on a cash basis. For new transactions, rental rate roll up was 4% on a cash basis, while for renewals and other tenant retention deals, it was 5.3% on a cash basis.Moreover, for the company’s residential same-store portfolio, which comprised 3,156 units and 97.3% leased at the quarter’s end, NOI inched up 1.3% in the quarter.Portfolio ActivityMack-Cali completed dispositions of 20 properties, comprising 1.7 million square feet of space, for $232 million.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $1.84.The company projects office occupancy (year-end % leased) of 84-86% and dispositions of $375-$425 million for full-year 2018. This will mark completion of the company’s major disposition program. Sales in future will occur on a select one-off basis.Our TakeWe are encouraged with the better-than-expected performance of Mack-Cali in Q1. The company has been making solid progress with respect to the 2015 strategic plan, aimed at focusing on waterfront and transit-based office holdings, and luxury multi-family portfolio growth. Nevertheless, such plans involve significant upfront costs, which might drag down the company’s profit margins. In addition to these, it has been aggressively disposing assets. While such measures are a strategic fit for the long term, the dilutive impact on earnings from huge asset sales cannot be bypassed in the near term. Rate hike also remains another concern.Mack-Cali currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Mack-Cali Realty Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Mack-Cali Realty Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Mack-Cali Realty Corporation QuoteWe now look forward to the earnings releases of other REITs like Apartment Investment and Management Company (AIV  -  Free Report), EPR Properties (EPR  -  Free Report) and Realty Income Corporation (O  -  Free Report).

2465,O,"Delighting its shareholders, retail REIT Realty Income Corporation (O  -  Free Report) has announced a hike in its common stock monthly cash dividend. This is the company’s 96th dividend increase since its NYSE listing in 1994. The company will now pay 21.95 cents per share compared with 21.90 cents paid earlier.Realty Income will pay the dividend on Apr 13 to shareholders on record as of Apr 2. The latest dividend rate marks an annualized amount of $2.634 per share versus the prior rate of $2.628 per share.Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT investors and Realty Income remains committed to boosting shareholders’ wealth. The company enjoys a trademark on the phrase “The Monthly Dividend Company”. The April 2018 dividend payment not only marks its 573 consecutive monthly dividend payouts throughout its 49-year operating history, but also 82 consecutive quarterly increases as well as payment of more than $5.3 billion.In fact, the company has generated a compound average annual dividend growth of around 4.7% since its listing on the NYSE. Given its financial position and lower debt-to-equity ratio compared to the industry, this dividend rate is likely to be sustainable.Apart from Realty Income, some other REITs which announced dividend hikes in recent months are Digital Realty (DLR  -  Free Report), Prologis Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report) and Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report).Realty Income is well poised to grow and reward shareholders backed by its superior business model. This freestanding retail REIT derives more than 90% of its annualized retail rental revenues from tenants belonging to service, non-discretionary and low-price retail business. Such businesses are less susceptible to economic recessions and competition from Internet retailing.Additionally, Realty Income’s solid underlying real estate quality and prudent underwriting at acquisitions have helped the company maintain high occupancy levels consistently. In fact, since 1996, its occupancy level has never been below 96%. For 2018 too, the company projects occupancy to remain at approximately 98%. Additionally, its same-store rent growth underlines limited operational volatility.The company continues to maintain a conservative capital structure. It has modest leverage, robust liquidity and continued access to attractively priced equity and debt capital. Moreover, it has a well-laddered debt maturity schedule.Nonetheless, the company’s substantial exposure to single-tenant assets raises risks associated with tenant default. Further, generation of notable rental revenues from assets leased to drug stores and rate hike add to its woes.Shares of Realty Income have outperformed the industry it belongs to, in the past month. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have gained 4.4% while the industry inched up 0.6% during this time frame.

2466,O,"Recently, Prologis Inc.’s (PLD  -  Free Report) board approved a 9% hike in its annualized dividend rate to $1.92 from the $1.76 paid earlier. As a result, the company will now pay 48 cents per share as against 44 cents paid in the prior quarter.The new dividend will be paid on Mar 29 to shareholders of record on Mar 15, 2018. Based on this hiked value, annualized yield comes in at about 3.2%, considering Prologis' closing price of $59.94 on Feb 22.We believe Prologis has an adequate capacity to support its dividend policy. Last month, the company reported decent fourth-quarter 2017 core funds from operations (FFO). It experienced solid operating results and higher net promote income. Net effective rent change improved in the quarter, while period-end occupancy also remained at a record high.Notably, the industrial real estate market has been enjoying elevated demand for logistics infrastructure amid an e-commerce boom, recovering economy and job market, as well as healthy manufacturing environment. This has been providing Prologis ample scope to tap growth opportunities.In addition, Prologis’ build-to-suit activity remained solid in 2017. The company completed 33 build-to-suit projects, covering more than 12 million square feet of space, in the year. It also started 38 projects, which have a total expected investment of nearly $1.1 billion, in 2017. Furthermore, the company’s ratio of built-to-suit activity to overall development starts achieved the highest level since 2013. This high number of build-to-suit development projects highlights the advantageous location of the company’s rich land bank and the robust network of multi-site customers which is increasingly focusing on e-commerce.Prologis is also focused on bolstering its liquidity. The company continues to have significant liquidity of $3.6 billion. In addition, for the full year, the company reported a 340-basis-point contraction in leverage to 23.7% on a market capitalization basis and debt-to-adjusted EBITDA improved around 0.2x-4.6x. Given its balance-sheet strength and prudent financial management, the company remains well poised to capitalize on growth opportunities and reward shareholders accordingly.However, a whole lot of new buildings are slated to be completed and made available in the market in the near term, leading to higher supply, and lesser scope for rent and occupancy growth. Also, rate hikes have added to the company’s woes.Prologis currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The stock has dropped 10.6% in the past three months, outperforming the 12.5% loss incurred by the industry it belongs to.Solid dividend payouts remain arguably the biggest enticement for REIT investors. Apart from Prologis, some other REITs which announced dividend hikes in recent months include Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report), AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report) and Realty Income Corporation (O  -  Free Report).Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represent funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

2467,O,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (HST  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted funds from operations (FFO) of 43 cents per share, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 41 cents. However, the adjusted FFO per share fell shy of the year-ago quarter tally of 44 cents.Results reflect margin improvement through better productivity. However, the year-over-year decline mainly reflects increase in interest expenses and additional tax expenses. The company has also raised its outlook for full-year 2018.The company generated total revenues of around $1.35 billion, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.33 billion, but marginally (0.1%) slipped from the year-ago tally. The year-over-year decline mainly reflects the impact of dispositions of five hotels in 2017 and in early 2018.Notably, during the quarter, Host Hotels completed the acquisition of 301-room Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort, 668-room Grand Hyatt San Francisco and 454-room Hyatt Regency Coconut Point Resort and Spa for $1 billion.Quarter in DetailsDuring the reported quarter, comparable hotel revenues increased 1.5% year over year to nearly $1.3 billion. Comparable hotel revenue per available room or RevPAR (on a constant dollar basis) was up 1.7% year over year, driven by a 170 basis points (bps) expansion in occupancy, partly offset by a 0.6% decrease in average room rate. For domestic properties, comparable hotel RevPAR was up 1.6% while the same for International properties climbed 9.3%.For the first quarter, comparable hotel EBITDA increased 3.7%. Comparable hotel EBITDA margin improved 60 bps, reflecting improvement in operating efficiencies, higher ancillary revenues and a tax rebate at one property.Finally, the company exited first-quarter 2018 with around $323 million of unrestricted cash and $511 million of available capacity remaining under the revolver part of its credit facility. In addition, as of Mar 31, 2018, total debt was $4.3 billion, having an average maturity of 4.8 years and an average interest rate of 3.9%. Notably, the company has no debt maturities until 2020.Host Hotels did not buy back any shares in 2018. It has $500 million of capacity available under its current repurchase program.Capital InvestmentsDuring the first quarter, the company expended around $115 million on capital expenditures — $29 million was return on investment (ROI) capital projects and $86 million for renewal and replacement projects.OutlookHost Hotels has raised its outlook for full-year 2018. The company now expects 2018 adjusted FFO per share in the range of $1.67-$1.73, denoting a 5 cents increase at the midpoint from the earlier guidance of $1.60-$1.70. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $1.67.The company’s full-year projection includes comparable hotel RevPAR (constant U.S. dollar basis) growth of 1.5-2.5%, reflecting growth of 50 bps at the midpoint. Moreover, the company continues to expect capital expenditures of $475-$550 million for the year. This comprises $185-$220 million in ROI projects and $290-$330 million in renewal and replacement projects.In ConclusionHost Hotels is likely to gain from its solid portfolio of upscale hotels across lucrative markets. Strategic capital-recycling program and a healthy balance sheet bode well for long-term growth. Opportunistic acquisitions in top-growth markets in the United States, including Maui and San Francisco, augur well for long-term growth. Nevertheless, supply growth, specifically in the company’s key markets, remains a concern. In addition to this, dilutive impact of asset sales cannot be bypassed. Also, rate hikes add to its woes.Host Hotels currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.

2469,O,"Realty Income (O  -  Free Report) is likely to remain on the growth curve with strategic acquisitions. During the nine-month period ended Sep 30, 2017, the company invested around $956.9 million in 177 new properties and properties under development or expansion, situated in 35 states. The assets are fully leased with a weighted average lease term of approximately 14.9 years.Per a video interview at REITworld 2017 with Nareit, the company’s CEO, John Case, mentioned that the company continues to witness solid investment opportunities and expects to complete around $1.5 billion of acquisitions in 2017. In fact, according to him, a bigger number of acquisitions are backing the 6% earnings per share increase projected by the company for the year.Moreover, in December, Realty Income announced a hike in its common stock monthly cash dividend, giving shareholders another reason to rejoice. This marks the company’s 94th dividend increase since its NYSE listing in 1994. The company will now pay 21.25 cents per share against 21.20 cents paid earlier. The increased dividend will be paid on Jan 12, 2018, to shareholders of record as of Jan 2, 2018.Notably, the company enjoys a trademark on the phrase “The Monthly Dividend Company”. The January 2018 dividend not only marks its 570th consecutive monthly payout in its 48-year operating history but also is the 81st consecutive quarterly increase. In fact, the company has generated a compound average annual dividend growth of around 4.6% since its listing on the NYSE. Given its financial position and lower debt-to-equity ratio compared with the industry, this dividend rate is likely to be sustainable.Realty Income’s portfolio comprised 5,062 properties, situated in 49 states and Puerto Rico as of Sep 30, 2017, containing more than 86.4 million leasable square feet of space. These properties are leased to 251 different commercial tenants, belonging to 47 separate industries. The company leases its properties under long-term, net lease agreements.Lately, shrinking footfall at malls amid shift of consumers toward online channels, store closures and bankruptcy of retailers have emerged as a pressing concerns for most retail REITs including Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report), GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report) and Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report). However, not all are facing the brunt, as a few among these companies are still gaining even in the tepid scenario, thanks to the business models.In fact, this freestanding retail REIT, Realty Income, derives more than 90% of its annualized retail rental revenues from tenants belonging to service, non-discretionary and low-price retail business. Such businesses are less susceptible to economic recessions and competition from Internet retailing.Additionally, Realty Income’s solid underlying real estate quality and prudent underwriting at acquisition have helped the company maintain high occupancy levels consistently.

Additionally, it has a well-laddered debt maturity schedule.However, Realty Income’s substantial exposure to single-tenant assets raises risks associated with tenant default. Moreover, despite the company’s efforts to diversify the tenant base, its tenants in the drug store industry accounted for around 10.8% of its rental revenue in third-quarter 2017. This makes the company’s results susceptible to any adverse changes in this industry, because a downturn in the industry or a change in legislation relating to prescription drugs, could substantially affect Realty Income’s tenants and in turn affect the revenue stream of the REIT. Further, rate hike add to its woes.Shares of Realty Income have outperformed the industry it belongs to, in a month’s time.

2471,O,"Realty Income Corp. (O  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and 2017 results after the market closes on Feb 21. The company’s funds from operations (FFO) per share are likely to remain stable whereas its revenues are anticipated to witness a rise year over year.Last quarter, this monthly-dividend-paying real estate investment trust (REIT) reported better-than-expected performance, in terms of FFO per share. Results indicated higher-than-expected growth in revenues.However, Realty Income has a mixed surprise history. The company surpassed estimates in three occasions and met in one, over the trailing four quarters, resulting in an average positive surprise of 1.33%. This is depicted in the graph below: Realty Income Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Realty Income Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Realty Income Corporation QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderRealty Income’s portfolio is well diversified with respect to tenant, industry, geography and property type. It targets well-located, free-standing, single-tenant and net-lease commercial properties. The company generates the majority of its annualized retail rental revenue from tenants with a service, non-discretionary and/or low-price point component to their business. Thus, such businesses are less susceptible to economic recessions, as well as competition from Internet retailing.However, the retail real estate market remained turbulent amid retailer bankruptcies and store closures. Moreover, competition remained solid in the quarter. In addition, the company has substantial exposure to single-tenant assets which raises its risks associated with tenant default.Amid these, growth in same-store rent is likely to be modest. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for rental revenues for the to-be-reported quarter is currently pegged at $297 million, reflecting around 1.4% increase from the prior quarter.Realty Income’s activities during the quarter failed to gain analysts’ confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter FFO per share remained unchanged at 77 cents over the last 30 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $307.3 million, indicating a year-over-year rise of 6.8%.For full-year 2017, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is $1.20 billion, reflecting a rise of 9.1% year over year. The consensus estimate for FFO per share is $2.99, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 3.82%. Management expects core FFO per share in the range of $3.03-$3.07.Realty Income has lost 13.7% of its value in the past six months underperforming the 8.8% growth recorded by the industry.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Realty Income will likely beat estimates this season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -0.73%.Zacks Rank: Realty Income has a Zacks Rank #3. Although a favorable rank increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to deliver a positive surprise this time around:Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (HST  -  Free Report), slated to report quarterly numbers on Feb 21, has an Earnings ESP of +0.25% and a Zacks Rank of 3.

2472,O,"Vornado Realty Trust (VNO  -  Free Report) has announced a hike in its quarterly common dividend, giving shareholders a reason to rejoice. Specifically, the company will now pay a dividend of 63 cents per share, up from 60 cents paid in the prior quarter. The increased dividend will be paid on Feb 15 to shareholders of record as on Jan 29, 2018.Based on the increased rate, the 2018 annual dividend comes to $2.52 a share, resulting in an annualized yield of about 3.53%, considering Vornado’s closing price of $71.30 on Jan 17. Though this is lower than the industry average of 4.36%, the hike will likely increase investors’ confidence in the stock.Notably, Vornado has a concentration of high-quality assets, with a strategic focus on expanding its market share in New York City office and Manhattan street retail. In addition, the company owns 555 California Street, in the heart of San Francisco's Financial District, as well as theMART in Chicago's River North District, which are iconic assets in signature cities.This focus on having assets in such a few select high-rent, high barrier-to-entry geographic markets, as well as a diversified tenant base, which includes several industry bellwethers, is anticipated to drive steady cash flows and fuel its growth engine over the long term.Moreover, the company, focused on improving its core business, has been making opportunistic acquisitions and divestitures in addition to business spin-offs. In fact, well-planned sell-outs provide the company with dry powder to reinvest in opportunistic acquisitions.The 2017 spin-off of its Washington, D.C properties made Vornado a New York-based office and retail REIT. The focus on New York is a strategic fit given that the city is preferred by businesses, residents, tourists and investors. It enjoys solid long-term employment growth with a diversified employment base. In addition, the city attracts international tourists and enjoys steady tourism growth.Also, the previous spin-off of its shopping center business into a publicly-traded REIT named Urban Edge Properties (UE  -  Free Report) was an outcome of Vornado’s decision to separate two businesses, which have been together for legacy reasons but with no real operating synergies. Such efforts to streamline the company’s business are likely to drive Vornado’s long-term growth.Vornado boasts a strong liquidity position with decent leverage and well-manageable debt maturities. As of Sep 30, 2017, Vornado had nearly $1.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Additionally, in October 2017, the company announced the extension of one of the two $1.25-billion revolving credit facilities. The extended credit facility will improve the company’s liquidity position. Given its financial position and lower debt-to-equity ratio compared to that of the industry, this dividend rate is likely to be sustainable.The company is likely to benefit from improvement in the economy and the job market. However, dilutive impact on earnings from divestitures of assets cannot be bypassed in the near term. Further, intense competition and hike in interest rates remain concerns.Shares of Vornado have underperformed the industry it belongs to, in three months’ time. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have descended 4.7%, while the industry incurred loss of 4.6% during this time frame.
