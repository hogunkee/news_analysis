0,SCG,"Dominion Energy (D) will buy Scana (SCG) for $7.9 billion in a stock-for-stock deal, scooping up a utility battered by a failed nuclear project that's drawn scrutiny from federal and state regulators.The transaction is valued at about $14.6 billion including the assumption of debt, according to a statement Wednesday. Scana shareholders will receive 0.669 share of Dominion for each share of Scana, equal to about 55.35 a share as of Tuesday's close. The acquisition is expected to close in 2018 pending regulatory and shareholder approval, according to the statement.Scana made an attractive target as the company's market value plummeted after the utility halted a controversial nuclear expansion in late July. Federal and state investigators are probing the project, which triggered a review of the law that allows utilities to charge customers for unfinished or abandoned power plant projects.""Dominion acquiring Scana makes a lot of sense,"" Shahriar Pourreza, a New York-based analyst for Guggenheim Securities, said by phone Wednesday. Dominion is building a major natural gas pipeline, the Atlantic Coast line, to the South Carolina border, and state officials want it extended, he said. The line could serve Scana customers.Scana shares were trading 22% higher at 47.39 before the opening bell on the stock market today. They had dropped 47% over the past year. Dominion traded down 4.7% to 76.50 a share.The deal is the latest in a string of massive utility mergers: The industry saw a combined $68.2 billion of acquisitions in 2017, the most in a decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Stagnant electricity prices and tight profit margins have stoked the buying spree.The acquisition would include a more than $1.7 billion write-off of existing V.C. Summer 2 and 3 capital and regulatory assets, allowing the elimination of all related customer costs over 20 years.Last year's biggest utility deal was the Sempra Energy (SRE) acquisition of Oncor Electric Delivery Co., the largest transmission-line operator in Texas, for $18.8 billion. Sempra outbid Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB), which had offered $18.2 billion. In October, Dynegy (DYN) and Vistra Energy (VIST), both in Texas, agreed to merge in a transaction valued at $10.5 billion.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Should Top China Tech Stocks Alibaba, Baidu Be On Your Radar?How To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

1,SCG,"After strong 2017 gains, the S&P 500 index and other major averages rose sharply to new highs to start 2018. Chip stocks were strong even with Intel (INTC) disclosing a big flaw in many processors. Facebook (FB) and Netflix (NFLX) were among many breakouts, but often with some issues. Tesla (TSLA) struggled to get Model 3 out the factory gate while other auto stocks rallied despite U.S. auto sales capping their first annual decline since the financial crisis. Bitcoin had a relatively calm week of solid gains as rival cryptocurrencies surged ahead. Economic data were solid but shouldn't spook the Federal Reserve.X The Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 index and Dow industrials rose sharply to start 2018, with oil, steel and chip groups among the big winners, while utilities sold off. Facebook, Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) were among those breaking out, but many were in low volume or had other notable flaws. Crude futures rose to a three-year high. The Treasury yield spread continued to narrow.Intel (INTC) fell as low as 42.69 after a security issue was revealed on its PC and server processors but rallied to close down 3.1% at 44.74.  The security issue could allow hackers to gather sensitive data from the memory of computing devices, but not modify, delete or corrupt data through the exploit, Intel said. The chipmaker said it has developed and is rapidly issuing software patches and firmware updates to correct the problem. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) saw its shares rally because its processors reportedly are not vulnerable to the same security exploit.Bitcoin prices rose to above $16,000 on Friday, capping a solid weekly gain in what was a relatively calm period for the fast-moving cryptocurrency. Alternative digital currencies Ripple and Ethereum surged to new highs. Founders Fund, co-founded by early Facebook investor Peter Thiel, invested $15 million-$20 million in Bitcoin — an investment worth hundreds of millions now, according to the Wall Street Journal reported. The Journal also reported that Merrill Lynch barred its financial advisors from making trades for clients in Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) or proposing any Bitcoin related investments. Russia is looking at creating its own cryptocurrency after President Vladimir Putin meet with Vitalik Buterin, the Russia-born founder of Ethereum, to figure out how to regulate them. China is reportedly looking to regulate power usage for Bitcoin mining after closing exchanges last year to reduce spreading financial risks.Nearly all automakers saw U.S. vehicle sales fall in December despite heavy incentives and a year-end sales push, but Ford Motor (F) and General Motors (GM) topped estimates, with Ford eking out a 0.9% gain. For 2017, U.S. auto sales fell 1.8% to 17.2 million vehicles, according to Autodata, marking the first decline in eight years. Both analysts and carmakers see a drop below 17 million in 2018. Despite weak auto sales, auto stocks continue to perform well, as investors expect the momentum in higher-margin SUV and truck sales to continue. GM rose 7.4% for the week, Ford 5.7% and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) 22%.Tesla continues to struggle with production on its Model 3 sedans, with overall vehicle output stagnant in recent quarters. Tesla made 2,425 Model 3 sedans in the quarter, vs. consensus of 4,100. Tesla claimed it made ""major progress"" on bottlenecks but now expects to reach production of 5,000 Model 3s per week by the end of the second quarter, instead of the first quarter as previously planned. Tesla shares rose 1.7% but are still near seven-month lows.Shares of BlackBerry (BB) jumped 24% to their best levels since June 2013 in large part as the one-time smartphone leader signed a deal with Chinese internet giant Baidu (BIDU) to work together on automotive software for self-driving vehicles.A Goldilocks jobs report for December quieted talk that labor markets are at risk of overheating. Payrolls rose a moderate 148,000, well below the 190,000 expected, as the jobless rate held at 4.1% and average hourly wage gains remained stuck at 2.5%. The data may help Federal Reserve policymakers follow a slow pace of interest rate hikes, at least for now. Yet other indications suggest the economy ended the year with a strong head of steam. Holiday sales were strong. And the ISM manufacturing index unexpectedly rose 1.5 points to 59.7, signaling accelerating factory growth. The new orders gauge vaulted to a 15-year high of 69.4, up from a robust 64.0 the prior month.Macy's (M) Nov.-Dec. same-store sales unexpectedly rose 1.1% — the first holiday gain in three years — and J.C. Penney (JCP) comps up 2.4%. But amid more Macy's store closures, shares of both stocks nevertheless tumbled. Elsewhere, Costco Wholesale (COST) core same-store sales popped 8.8% and Zumiez (ZUMZ) comps jumped 7.9%, both topping views. Victoria's Secret parent L Brands (LB) fell short of comp forecasts and cut its earnings target. Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI) said holiday same-store sales increased 3.9% and implied Q4 EPS would edge past views.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) narrowly beat Q1 expectations with $1.28 EPS on $30.7 billion in revenue. U.S. retail pharmacy sales grew 8.9% as comps rose 4.7%. The drugstore chain lifted the bottom end of full-year EPS guidance. Shares fell 5.2% Thursday but were up a fraction for the week. Rite Aid (RAD) met views for a 2-cent-a-share loss vs. a year earlier 2-cent gain. Revenue from continuing operations fell nearly 6% to $5.35 billion, including a 3% retail pharmacy sales drop and 12% pharmacy service revenue decline. Shares dipped 1.4% on Thursday but rose for the week. CVS Health (CVS) said Q4 EPS would come in at the low end of its $1.88-$1.92 forecast, but said tax cuts would boost cash flow. Shares jumped 8.2% for the week.Delta Air Lines (DAL) tweaked its Q4 cost forecast higher, partly due to the massive outage last month in its Atlanta hub, and held to its Q4 unit-revenue and margin outlook. Delta expects a one-time hit of $150 million-$200 million in the fourth quarter due to Trump's tax bill. American Airlines (AAL), Southwest Airlines (LUV) and JetBlue (JBLU) said they'd give employees $1,000 each following the tax cuts. Southwest also said it would invest in modernizing its Boeing (BA) fleet.Winning high rollers reportedly weighed on December casino revenue, which came in light at 14.6% growth vs. Bloomberg views for 20% gains. But Macau gross gaming revenue still got a 19.1% bump for the year, in line with consensus per Reuters and the first annual gain since 2013. Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and Las Vegas Sands (LVS) fell more than 2% for the week, while MGM Resorts International (MGM), which is more Vegas-centric, climbed 1.5%.MoneyGram International (MGI) fell 6.8% for the week after the U.S. government rejected a takeover by Alibaba (BABA) affiliate Ant Financial, on national security grounds.Dominion Energy (D) agreed to buy Scana (SCG) battered by a failed nuclear project, for $7.9 billion or $14.6 billion including assumed debt.Constellation Brands (STX) unexpectedly reported a slim per-share profit rise and set a $3 billion stock buyback. But the Corona beer distributor unexpectedly missed sales. Shares fell Friday after briefly breaking out of a base in late 2017 but closed above their 50-day line.Streaming video platform Roku (ROKU) is extending its reach to smart speakers, TV sound bars and other home audio systems. It announced the Roku Connect home entertainment network, which it will show off at the CES consumer electronics trade show.Netflix reached new highs after the internet television network said its bet on big-budget movie ""Bright"" has paid off. It ordered a sequel to the fantasy cop movie, which reportedly cost $90 million and got mixed reviews.

The gain lifted shares to less than 1% below a 204.48 buy point in an 11-week flat base.Chip stocks were generally positive, following a strong performance on Tuesday. The leading exception was Intel, which pared its opening loss to 2.2%. News reports beginning late Tuesday reported discovery of a design flaw, allowing a security lapse in the central operating system for what appears to be most Intel microprocessors. Early reports said the programming fix to the flaw slows the computers significantly, and is likely to affect millions of computers. Intel has not yet released the specifics explaining the problem.Intel rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) leapt more than 6% at the open. The microprocessor developer had soared nearly 7% in weak trade on Tuesday, retaking support at its 10-week moving average for the first time since October.IBD 50 name Nvidia (NVDA) perked up more than 3% in early action. The move hoisted shares back above support at the stock's 10-week moving average for the first time since the start of December. The stock is in a six-week flat base with a 217.46 buy point.System-on-a-chip designer Ambarella (AMBA) popped 3%. Shares are in the fifth week of a flat consolidation.News of mergers and non-mergers also helped drive early trade. South Carolina-based utility Scana (SCG) jetted 23% higher at the start of trade. The company reportedly agreed to be acquired by Dominion Energy (D) in a deal valued near $14.6 billion, including debt. Dominion opened down 4%.Shares of MoneyGram International (MGI) dived more than 9% on news that a third review by U.S. regulators had ended the attempted takeover of the company by Alibaba Group Holdings' (BABA) Ant Financial unit in a proposed $1.2 billion deal. Alibaba shares edged up 0.2% in heavy early trade.In economic news, investors were trained on European markets, which traded higher as a new set of trading rules labeled MiFid II came into effect. The regulations, a reformed version of laws implemented following the financial crisis in 2007, are intended to avoid some of the transparency issues that contributed to the 2007-2009 market collapse. Frankfurt's DAX and the CAC-40 in Paris were each up 0.5%, while London's FTSE 100 fought to hold a 0.1% gain.U.S. markets are beginning to look toward Friday's payrolls report, and automakers are expected to report December and year-end sales totals throughout today's session.

33,SCG,"The utility sector is currently undergoing a transition as the primary fuel source, coal, is being replaced by natural gas, and we could notice increased usage of clean energy to produce electricity. The new U.S. administration’s coal-friendly moves will definitely lead to some of the coal-based utility plants running for a longer time period than expected.We advocate that there needs to be a balance between emission control and clean energy generation. A constructive utility rate environment, increase in electricity production from natural gas and renewables, and supporting clean coal-powered projects will enable utilities to efficiently serve a larger customer base.In the segment below, we discuss the basic strengths of the utility sector.Transition Toward Cleaner SourceUtility operators are gradually changing the source of electricity production. Abundant cheap natural gas and declining installation costs of renewable sources like solar and wind are acting as tailwinds for the sector. The regulated utilities are also getting ample support from the administration to shut down old and less profitable fossil fuel plants and replace them with more technologically sound new generation units.The U.S. Energy Information Administration’s (“EIA”) report indicates that the share of U.S. total utility-scale electricity generation from renewable sources will increase from less than 17% in 2017 to 17% in 2018 and increase to 18% in 2019. EIA expects natural gas to generate nearly 34% of U.S. electricity in 2018 and 2019, up from 32% in 2017, while coal is expected to contribute 29% in 2018 and 2019, down from 27% from 2017. The above prediction from EIA indicates the preference to or against the legislation supporting the usage of coal.Increase in Infrastructure ResilienceDue to its geographical location, the United States is battered by tropical storms, cyclones, extreme cold weather and hurricanes. Natural disaster disturbs normal day to day life including utility services.Utilities are investing steadily to upgrade and strengthen their existing transmission and distribution lines. Usage of technology for the maintenance of wide-spread electric lines helps to lower the possibility of power outages. Strengthening infrastructure will help utilities serve their expanding customer base efficiently and effectively.Extensive R&D & Extension of ITC/PTCIn their pursuit of improving the standard of services, utility operators have steadily invested in research and development (R&D). They have introduced new smart meters and strengthened their transmission and distribution lines, which helped in the efficient usage of energy.Utility operators are also benefiting from the ongoing research in the solar photovoltaic sector. Solar energy is a growing alternate energy source and the new solar cells with higher conversion rates allow operators to generate more power from fewer solar panels. This enables the operators to lower the cost of generating power from alternate sources as these are generally more expensive than fossil fuel sources.In addition, the utility friendly moves of the U.S. administration through the extension of the validity period of Solar Energy Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and Wind Energy Production Tax Credit (PTC) will help the companies. We will see more utility scale solar and wind projects coming up, which will boost green power generation.Thanks to the backing from government, EIA expects wind-generation capacity to increase to 735,000 megawatt hours per day (MWh/d) by the end of 2018 and 779,000 MWh/d by the end of 2019 from 697,000 MWh/d in 2017. EIA expects solar-generation capacity to increase to 1705,000 megawatt hours per day (MWh/d) by the end of 2018 and 198,000 MWh/d by the end of 2019 from 145,000 MWh/d in 2017.NextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report) a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has plans to make long-term investment in clean energy assets. NextEra Energy’s current renewal energy development program aims at nearly 10,100-16,500 MW of new renewable projects (including wind repowering) online over the 2017-2020 time frame.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Acquisitions & MergerUtility sector operators don’t shy away from merger and acquisition (M&A) activities to supplement organic growth. In addition to giving their operations greater scale and scope, such measures also lead to cost synergies and better utilization of resources. The larger the company, the more access it has to funds essential for vital infrastructure upgrades.We believe that in a mature energy market like the United States, M&As represent a sure way of enhancing market share. This expands market reach through the usage of transmission and distribution lines, diversifies the generation portfolio and lowers operating costs through the usage of common back office space.At the beginning of this year, SCANA Corp. (SCG  -  Free Report) entered into a merger agreement with Dominion Energy (D  -  Free Report). Per the accord, each stock holder of SCANA will likely get 0.669 shares of Dominion. Considering the assumption of $6.7 billion debt of SCANA by Dominion, the transaction is worth roughly $14.6 billion.We are noticing major deals in the water utility space. American Water Works Company (AWK  -  Free Report) entered into a few deals during the first quarter of 2018 and is in talks to acquire a few more this year. While Connecticut Water Service  has decided to merge with SJW Group (SJW  -  Free Report), citing that the union will be accretive to earnings of each company, and that there will be ample financial flexibility to expand operation and compete with water utility operators in the fragmented industry.Regular Dividend & Share BuybacksUtility operators generate more or less stable earnings unless there are severe factors disrupting their operations. The regulated nature of operations provides stability. These operators, in turn, reward their shareholders through the payment of sustainable dividends and share buybacks. This was evident during the economic crisis of 2008-2009 when utilities continued to pay dividends uninterruptedly.To Sum UpWe notice a transition in the utility sector with more focus on clean energy generation. Stable operations, highly visible revenues and cash flows, combined with the sector’s income/yield attributes are some of its key defining features.There is increasing focus on electricity storage facilities that will provide more support to the grid during a peak demand period. Already more than 700 MW of storage facility has been installed in the United States and we expect more storage facility across the country. We also expect more battery storage facility to be added to the system as utilities produce more from renewable sources and continue to let go traditional fossil fuel sources.Although price appreciation is low compared to the S&P 500 peers, these regular dividend payers can be a safe investment choice.

36,SCG,"SCANA Corporation (SCG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 earnings before the opening bell on Feb 22.Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 0.85%. Moreover, SCANA failed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters, the average negative surprise being 1.4%.  Which Way Are Estimates Treading?Let’s take a look at the estimate revision trend in order to get a clear picture of what analysts feel about the upcoming earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings of 98 cents has been stable in the last 30 days. The estimate reflects a year-over-year rise of 12.6%. Factors Likely to Influence EarningsSince 2015, the company’s long-term debt load has increased substantially, reflecting balance sheet weakness. SCANA lost 45.7% in 2017, underperforming the industry’s 6.5% gain. The underperformance was led by the company’s decision to conclude construction works of units 2 and 3 at the VC Summer Nuclear Station.   SCANA was forced to discontinue the project after the builder of the plants, Westinghouse Electric Co, went bankrupt. SCANA also filed for withdrawing operating licenses of the units as a series of delays and mounting costs became a concern for the company.Moreover, the company’s quarterly free cash flow has been negative in five of the last seven quarters, reflecting persistently weak operations.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that SCANA will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +0.26%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: SCANA carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Please note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a couple of companies which, per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: Houston, TX-based EOG Resources (EOG  -  Free Report) is an upstream company. It has an Earnings ESP of +3.61% and a Zacks Rank of 1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.WildHorse Resource Development Corporation (WRD  -  Free Report), based in Houston, TX, is also an upstream energy firm.

38,SCG,"SCANA Corporation’s (SCG  -  Free Report) principal subsidiary — South Carolina Electric & Gas Company (“SCE&G”) — has formally filed a request to withdraw the combined operating licenses (COLs) for VC Summer Station Units 2 & 3 with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).This news follows NRC’s announcement that SCANA has stopped construction activities on the VCS Units 2 and 3 sites in Jul 31, 2017. This notification is in line with the company’s strategy to abandon and qualify for a tax deduction in 2017.  The tax deduction will help the company garner about $2 billion, which will offset the costs of the nuclear project.Per the notification to the NRC, SCE&G has stated that it has permanently abandoned interests in the VCS Units 2 and 3. The company has stopped all completion and preservation activities. Operations is only restricted to putting the site in a secure state, end construction and close active permits.  SCE&G has offered to relinquish abandoned interest in the VCS Units 2 and 3 projects to Santee Cooper, for no consideration. If the company opts to become the sole licensee for the project, before the NRC approves this request to withdraw the COLs, SCE&G will forward an application to the NRC to transfer the licenses to Santee Cooper.About SCANASCANA is positioned in a positive regulatory environment, courtesy of a low risk business with outstanding customer growth and operational efficiency. These are favorable for stable cash flow generation and growth. Another positive for shareholders is SCANA’s utility business mix. The majority of the company’s total earnings come from the regulated electricity and natural gas utilities business.However, SCANA has already incurred significant costs for the construction of the VCS Units 2 and 3. Thus, future earnings growth of the company looks uncertain.Price PerformanceSCANA’s shares have lost 18.1% compared with the industry’s decline of 0.9% in the last three months. Zacks Rank & Key PicksSCANA currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

39,SCG,"Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC) recently approved the construction of The Southern Company’s (SO  -  Free Report) controversial Vogtle project. The news came as a respite for the company’s project which has been receiving much censure owing to its ballooning costs. The Vogtle nuclear reactors have been grappling with cost overruns and scheduling delays since the commencement of the construction. Bankruptcy of Westinghouse — the major construction contractor of the two nuclear reactors of the plant — aggravated the costs further and led to more delays. Since then a cloud of uncertainty has been hovering over the beleaguered plant.A couple of weeks ago, Georgia’s regulatory staff were of the opinion that the overtly expensive project should be called off unless Southern company and its subsidiary Georgia Power — which is the chief owner of the project with 45.7% stake — bear the costs. While Georgia Power wanted the customers to bear the additional costs of the project, the regulatory staff believed that such inflated cost would be a burden on customers. However, the latest verdict has allowed the company to pass on the additional cost of the project to the ratepayers.The Vogtle expansion will result in the construction of a third and fourth reactor along with the two existing reactors. The nuclear reactors are now expected to come online in 2021 and 2022.  The construction of the two new Vogtle reactors is expected to cost more than $25 billion. On a positive note, Toshiba recently paid the entire guaranteed amount of $3.68 billion which it had promised for the expansion of the project. Southern Company also received around $10-billion federal loan guarantee for Vogtle Project, emphasizing the government’s faith in the future of nuclear energy in the nation.The verdict underscores the fact that such nuclear energy projects are important in promoting economic growth and strengthening the energy and national security of The United States.With the decision to continue with the project, Vogtle plant in Georgia remains the only nuclear project which is under construction in the United States. In August, South Carolina Electric & Gas — subsidiary of SCANA Corporation (SCG  -  Free Report) — terminated the construction of $18-billion VC Summer nuclear project in South Carolina. Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) also announced the abandonment of Lee III Nuclear Generating Station in South Carolina.However, the decision to continue with the project may increase the credit risk of the company. The project which has been missing milestone dates and suffering from poor productivity rates is likely to suffer from the ballooning costs, which may hurt the already weak financials of the company.Headquartered in Georgia, Southern Company is one of the largest generators of electricity in the United States.The buyout of energy services holding company AGL Resources, Inc. has helped Southern Company to significantly increase the customer base, while diversifying its business by adding gas distribution assets.Southern Company (The) Price   Southern Company (The) Price | Southern Company (The) QuoteSouthern Company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Another top-ranked player in the energy space is Northern Oil and Gas, Inc.

40,SCG,"Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC) will take a final call regarding The Southern Company’s (SO  -  Free Report) Vogtle project on Dec 21. Initially, the hearing was scheduled for February 2018 but the PSC decided to prepone the judgment date due to changes in the tax code that could affect the company’s returns.The pending package of tax changes in Congress is set to cut federal corporate tax rates to as low as 20% effective Jan 1, 2018 which can affect how much Southern Company can recover from ratepayers in connection with the Vogtle plant expansion project.The Vogtle nuclear reactors have been grappling with cost overruns and scheduling delays since the commencement of the construction. Bankruptcy of Westinghouse — the major construction contractor of the two nuclear reactors of the plant — aggravated the costs further and led to more delays. Since then a cloud of uncertainty has been hovering over the beleaguered plant. The project is already running three years behind schedule and is over budget by more than $10 billion which is likely to go up to $20 billion by 2022.The Vogtle project has been receiving censure owing to its ballooning costs. Georgia’s regulatory staff want to call off the project unless Southern Company and Georgia Power bear part of the ballooning cost. Georgia Power is of the belief that customers should bear the additional cost of the project. This is in sharp contrast with the views of the regulatory staff who believe that such inflated cost would be a burden on customers. They believe that once the project is completed ratepayers are likely to bear higher costs with reduced benefits and hence want to pull the plug on the project.On a positive note, Toshiba recently paid the entire guaranteed amount of $3.68 billion which it had promised for the expansion of the project. Southern Company also received around $10-billion federal loan guarantee for Vogtle Project, emphasizing the government’s faith in the future of nuclear energy in the nation.Georgia Power, subsidiary of Southern Company, is the chief owner of the project with a 45.7% interest. The other co-owners include Oglethorpe Power, MEAG Power and Dalton Utilities. As of now, Vogtle plant in Georgia is the only nuclear project which is under construction in the United States. In August, South Carolina Electric & Gas — subsidiary of SCANA Corporation (SCG  -  Free Report) — terminated the construction of $18-billion VC Summer nuclear project in South Carolina. Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) also announced the abandonment of Lee III Nuclear Generating Station in South Carolina.Southern Company believes that the plant will make the United States nuclear competitive, helping the nation catch up with the likes of Russia and China.

41,SCG,"Electric utility firm The Southern Company (SO  -  Free Report) recently entered into a new agreement with Japan’s Toshiba Corporation. Per the deal, Toshiba will pay the remaining guaranteed payments worth $3.2 billion by Dec 15, 2017, for the development of two nuclear reactors at its $25-billion worth Vogtle plant in Georgia. Southern Company’s Georgia unit owns more than 46% stake in the Vogtle plant and is due to receive $1.47 billion.Westinghouse was the major construction contractor and designer of the two nuclear reactors at Vogtle. However, Westinghouse filed for bankruptcy in late March because the company’s corporate parent, Toshiba suffered huge losses due to the contractor’s projects in Georgia and South California. Therefore, Westinghouse exited Vogtle project as part of the bankruptcy proceedings. Since then, a cloud of uncertainty has been hovering over the beleaguered plant.In June, Toshiba clinched a deal with Southern Company to provide a financial assistance of $3.68 billion for the project. Toshiba was supposed to make the payments in installments between October 2017 and January 2021. Till date, Vogtle co-owners namely Georgia Power, Oglethorpe Power, MEAG Power and Dalton Utilities have received $455 million of the guaranteed payments. The latest positive development comes as a brief respite from the various controversies and challenges surrounding the project.The Vogtle nuclear reactors have been grappling with cost overruns and scheduling delays since the commencement of the construction. The bankruptcy of Westinghouse has aggravated the costs and delayed the project further. The project is already running three years behind schedule and is over budget by more than $10 billion and is likely to go up by $20 billion by 2022. Few days back, Georgia’s regulatory staff raised questions about the increasing costs of the project and wanted to call it off unless Southern Company and Georgia Power bore part of the ballooning cost.Georgia Power filed a recommendation with the Public Service Commission (PSC) on Aug 31 to carry out the construction of two nuclear reactors at Vogtle units 3 and 4.  The PSC is soon to complete the review process and take a final call regarding the expansion of the Vogtle project in February 2018.

42,SCG,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Scana Corporation (SCG  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 10.9% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Third-Quarter 2017 ResultsSCANA’s third-quarter 2017 earnings of 24 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.17, down from the year-ago figure of $1.32. The decline can be attributed to higher expenses relating to the abandonment of a new nuclear project.The company’s quarterly operating revenues decreased to $1,073 million from $1,093 million in the year-ago period. Segment PerformanceSouth Carolina Electric & Gas Company (SCE&G): Quarterly earnings from this segment, SCANA's principal subsidiary, were 29 cents per share, down from $1.43 in the year-ago quarter. Higher expenses primarily led to this decline.As of Sep 30, SCE&G was serving about 362,000 natural gas customers, up 2.9% annually and 717,000 electric customers, up 1.3% annually.PSNC Energy: This segment incurred a loss of 1 cent during the quarter, narrower than a loss of 5 cents in the prior-year quarter. The upside was driven by customer growth and improved gas margin.SCANA Energy: The segment — comprising SCANA’s Georgia-based retail natural gas marketing business — posted a recorded profit of 1 cent. It incurred a loss of 1 cent in third-quarter 2016. This was attributable to lower bad debt and reduced expenses on account of lower-activity level.Corporate and Other, Net: This business segment reported a loss of 5 cents per share and remained flat on a year-over-year basis.ExpensesDuring the third quarter, the company reported operating expenses of $956 million compared with $745 million in the prior-year quarter.GuidanceSCANA reaffirmed its 2017 GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized earnings guidance in the range of $4.15-$4.35 per share.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Analysts were quiet during the last month as none of them issued any earnings estimate revisions.VGM ScoresCurrently, Scana's stock has an average Growth Score of C, however its Momentum is doing a lot better with an A.

43,SCG,"SCANA Corporation (SCG  -  Free Report) announced approval from the board of directors to slash its second-quarter 2018 dividend.  From 61.25 cents per share paid in first-quarter 2018, the South Carolina utility will cut its dividend payments by roughly 80% to 12.37 cents. The new dividend will likely be paid on Jul 18 to stockholders of record as of Jul 10. Notably, this is the first time since 1999 that SCANA’s board of directors chose to cut dividend payments.Investors should not be surprised with SCANA’s decision as the company has been for long looking for options to resolve cost concerns associated with the futile nuclear program. In Fairfield County, South Carolina, SCANA was constructing two nuclear plants with combined capacity of 2,234 MW. However, the company decided to abandon the project since concerns related to cost overrun and delays impeded the nuclear developments.SCANA opted to cut the dividend payout immediately after The South Carolina General Assembly passed a measure for lowering the sum of money the company will be able to get from its clients for recovering costs associated with the failed developments. Although Governor Henry McMaster decided not to sign the bill, legislators of South Carolina could choose to overrule the governor’s decision.The bill has great significance since if it gets converted into law, SCANA will likely get deprived from the opportunity to merge with Dominion Energy, Inc.

House Speaker, Paul Ryan even commented that the legislation would result in more jobs, increased wages and above all, ‘better take-home pay.’ The Bill reduces the corporate tax rate to 20% from the current rate of 35%.It also reduces tax brackets to just four slabs from the current seven slabs and also revokes the estate tax system. Eventually, the United States will move to a territorial tax system, under which a company can be taxed only where income is earned.Not so surprisingly, none of the Democrats cast their vote for the Bill. Moreover, Republicans from New York and New Jersey also did not vote for the legislation. In all, thirteen Republicans refused to vote for the Bill. Such Republicans particularly did not support the abolishment of state and local income tax deductions under the Bill.Economists believe that the Bill has yet to clear the biggest hurdle. This would be Senate Finance Committee’s proposal to delay the implementation of the corporate tax cut — the most important facet of the legislation — to 2019. However, broader markets gained traction on Thursday after the Tax Bill was passed by the House.What Do the Benchmarks Say?The Dow amassed 187.08 points to close in the green on Thursday. This comes just a day after the blue-chip index posted its worst one-day drop since Sep 5. While gains for the Dow were boosted primarily by the Tax Bill being passed in the House, a surge in the shares of Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report) and Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) helped the blue-chip index post a brilliant show. This also led to the Dow gaining more than 200 points earlier in the session.Shares of Cisco gained 5.2% on Thursday after posting stupendous earnings for first quarter of fiscal 2018. Cisco Systems Inc. reported first-quarter fiscal 2018 non-GAAP earnings of 61 cents per share beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. However, the figure remained unchanged on a year-over-year basis. Acquisitions have negatively impacted earnings by a penny in the quarter. Revenues declined 1.7% year over year to $12.14 billion and were almost in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

The Arkansas-based retailer posted $123.18 billion in quarterly revenues and adjusted EPS of $1.00 per share, which both beat Wall Street expectations. Wal-Mart also raised its full-year earnings guidance to help its stock price hit a new intraday trading high of $98.01 per share.

The Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) surged 1.4%. Such gains were made possible by a surge in the shares of Cisco after posting an earnings beat.

45,SCG,"SCANA Corporation’s (SCG  -  Free Report) principal subsidiary — South Carolina Electric & Gas Company (“SCE&G”) — has announced plans to resolve issues relating to the abandoned V.C. Summer Station nuclear construction project.These plans are anticipated to reduce costs for customers and drive energy production. Total cost savings for SCE&G customers are estimated at about $4.8 billion. The solutions provided by the plan are listed below.The first step includes the rollback of residential electric rates back to March 2015 level. This will reduce rates by about $90 million per year, or 3.5%. The monthly bill of a customer using 1,000 kilowatt hours of electricity will be lowered by more than $5.In the next five decades, SCANA’s shareholders will absorb the net nuclear construction costs through lower earnings. This will lead to savings of about $2.9 billion. The plan also proposes the addition of a 540-megawatt, natural-gas-fired power plant to SCE&G’s system. This is expected to substitute more than 40% of the projected power that was to be provided to SCE&G from the V.C. Summer nuclear construction project. However, acquisition cost will be provided by SCANA’s shareholders. This will result in savings of $680 million, which includes purchase price of $180 million.A large-scale solar energy of about 100 megawatts will added to SCE&G’s system. This is expected to boost non-rooftop solar capacity by about 50%.Per the current estimates, if this proposal is implemented, an additional generation source will not be required for several years. This will be an important step to meet the growing needs of South Carolina.In a separate announcement, SCE&G has stated that it has inked an agreement in principle to acquire a 540-megawatt, combined-cycle, natural-gas-fired power plant from Columbia Energy LLC for $180 million. The company intends to complete the purchase in the upcoming weeks and regulatory approval are expected by 2018.Price MovementOver a year, the company’s shares have declined 35.4% as against the industry’s rally of 17.5%. Zacks Rank & Key PicksSCANA currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

55,SCG,"The Q1 earnings season is set to cross its half way mark by the end of this week. So far, earnings and revenue growth rates and the proportion of positive earnings surprises are above historical levels.Total earnings for the 87 S&P members that have released results as of Apr 20, improved 25% year over year on 10.7% higher revenues. The beat ratio for the bottom line was 82.8%, while that for the top line was 67.8%.Notably, we expect total Q1 earnings for the index members to rise 18.3% from the year-ago period on 7.7% higher revenues. At present, 14 out of the 16 sectors in the Zacks universe are expected to witness an improvement in earnings.Amid this backdrop, let’s see how the Zacks Utilities sector is poised for this earnings season. Earnings from the utility space are expected to improve 12.4% in the first quarter. (For more details check out our latest Earnings Preview)A Glance at the Utility SectorUtility business is known for stability and visibility of earnings and cash flow, with the primary growth driver being consistent demand for electricity and utility services. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) predicted that annual average U.S. residential electricity price will increase 2.6% in 2018. Thus the sector is expected to tread on a growth trajectory.Therefore, staying invested in fundamentally strong and domestic-focused utility stocks will provide investors with steady returns. Currently, the sector is undergoing a transition, wherein the primary fuel source — coal — is being replaced by natural gas and renewables.However, utility stocks are subject to stringent regulations, both at the federal and state levels. Moreover, being capital intensive in nature, higher interest rates dent the growth of these stocks. In March 2018, the Federal Reserve raised rates for the sixth time since December 2015 when the Federal Open Market Committee began increasing rates from near zero. This is likely to have a negative impact on the sector.Nevertheless, to maintain their performance level, utilities are undertaking cost-savings initiatives, modernizing transmission and distribution lines, upgrading infrastructure and focusing on renewable energy to generate electricity. Further, new electric rates and customer growth will help the sector to witness improvement in earnings in the first quarter.The quarter was also a witness to a colder-than-normal winter in most parts of the United States. Utilities are likely to benefit from this as it will drive heating expenditures for households, boosting the companies’ earnings.However, earnings projections for the sector hint at an unimpressive quarter, when compared to its Q4 performance.The sector’s earnings are likely to improve 12% on in-line year-over-year revenues. In the fourth quarter, earnings for this sector increased 13.3% on 4.2% sales growth.Utilities to Post Q1 Earnings on Apr 26American Electric Power Company, Inc. (AEP  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.94% in the last quarter. However, the company underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average miss of 2.25%.The company’s commercial sales were drab in the fourth quarter of 2017. Expecting this trend to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for American Electric’s first-quarter revenue estimate of $3.74 billion shows an annual decline of 4.9%.However, lower tax rates, courtesy of the latest tax reform, is expected to boost American Electric’s quarterly bottom line.Per our proven model, a stock is likely to beat earnings estimate if it has a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).

Toshiba will be liable to pay even if the project is discontinued.  If the actual cost of construction of the two units is lesser than the amount paid by Toshiba, which is the maximum amount payable under the EPC contract, Toshiba will receive a portion of the difference.We would like to remind investors that a similar deal was struck by The Southern Company (SO  -  Free Report) with Toshiba for its $20 billion Vogtle plant in Georgia.SCANA acknowledges the project completion date of Jan 1, 2021, after which the owners of the units will not be able to avail the production tax credits, under current tax rules. SCE&G and Santee Cooper are keeping this fact in mind along with the needs of the future generation and their stakeholders while evaluating the project status. Based on these concerns and their alternative choices, the owners will declare their decision regarding the Westinghouse project.Investors should know that we are concerned about SCANA’s heavy debt level and the overall business risk associated with the nuclear generation construction project. The last nuclear generation construction cycle affected the numerous electric utility stocks. This fact generates a legitimate level of investor anxiety.About the CompanyColumbia, South Carolina-based SCANA's operations include generation, transmission, distribution, and sale of electricity to retail and wholesale customers in South Carolina. The company also purchases, sells, and transports natural gas to retail customers in South Carolina and southeastern Georgia; provides energy-related risk management services; and acquires, owns, and provides financing for nuclear fuel, fossil fuel, and emission allowances. In addition, it offers fiber optic communications, Ethernet services, and data center facilities. SCANA also builds, manages, and leases communications towers in South Carolina, North Carolina, and Georgia; and services contracts on home appliances, and heating and air conditioning units.Price Performance SCANA has lost 3.7% of its value in the last six months while its industry witnessed 7.4% growth.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderSCANA presently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the oil and energy sector include Braskem S.A.

In addition to lending their operations a greater scale and scope, such favorable measures also lead to cost synergies and better utilization of resources. The larger the companies, the more access they have to capital resources, essential for vital infrastructure upgrades.We believe that in a mature energy market like the United States, M&As represent a surefire recipe of success to enhance the market share.Beginning this year, SCANA Corporation (SCG  -  Free Report) entered into a merger agreement with Dominion Energy (D  -  Free Report). Per the accord, each stock holder of SCANA will likely get 0.669 shares of Dominion.

65,SCG,"SCANA Corporation’s (SCG  -  Free Report) principal subsidiary, South Carolina Electric & Gas Company (SCE&G), has filed with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina and the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff for an overall cut in retail natural gas base rates.The company has requested the authority for a reduction of $22.6 million or 5.29% of the base rates. The lower corporate tax rate under tax reform and the company’s operating results are likely to lower the rate.The appeal was made by SCE&G under the terms of the Natural Gas Rate Stabilization Act, a South Carolina law.  The law intends to develop and maintain natural gas service infrastructure to meet the requirements of customers.If accepted, the rate decline will be effective with the first billing cycle of November. Subsequently, bills of residential natural gas customers are expected to fall about 7.4% or $4.09 per month, based on average annual usage.Based in South Carolina, SCANA is involved in generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity to retail as well as wholesale customers. The company is well positioned in a positive regulatory environment, courtesy of a low risk business with outstanding customer growth and operational efficiency. These in turn are favorable for stable cash flow generation and growth.Another positive factor for shareholders is SCANA’s utility business mix. The company’s service areas enjoy supportive legislative and regulatory environments. SCANA is a stable, relatively strong and regulated integrated electric utility, supported by favorable regional demographics and electric utility rate.

The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018 subject to the approvals of regulatory authority, major shareholders and customary closing conditions.Ormat Technologies’ GainThis definitive agreement to acquire U.S. Geothermal will enhance Ormat Technologies efficiency and capability of clean power generation. Developing projects of U.S. Geothermal, at the Geysers, California; a second phase project at San Emidio, Nevada; at Crescent Valley, Nevada; and the El Ceibillo project located near Guatemala City, Guatemala are likely to add another 115 MW of power generation capacity to the existing fleet.U.S. Geothermal is a leading renewable energy company with geothermal power projects for net output of 45 megawatt (MW). The company has been developing projects to increase production in the future.Renewable EnergyThanks to declining prices of energy generation from renewable sources and focus on lowering emission from electricity generation have increased usage of alternate sources.Per a recent release from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”), electricity generation from renewables in all sectors (including utility- and small-scale generators) will decline 3% in 2018 and improve 7% in 2019. This information clearly indicates the rising popularity and acceptance of renewable energy as a source of power generation.Electricity generated from wind, water, geothermal is reducing the demand for coal. The companies dealing with non-renewable energy are likely to grow in the near future.Mergers & AcquisitionsIn addition to organic growth, merger and acquisition (M&A) activities are common in Utility space.

67,SCG,"SCANA Corporation (SCG  -  Free Report) lost roughly 5% after Henry McMaster, Governor of South Carolina, requested for a bill that will disallow the company from charging customers for the pair of failed reactors at its V.C. Summer nuclear plant.A report from Office of Regulatory Staff claimed it is unlikely that SCANA will face bankruptcy if the ratepayers are not charged. This prompted McMaster to write to the lawmakers.  However, SCANA did not hold the same opinion about the report.When the markets thought that the proposed accord between SCANA and Dominion Energy, Inc.

69,SCG,"Dominion Energy, Inc. (D  -  Free Report) announced that it has already taken steps to lower its present debt levels. The company decided to sell its non-core assets, issue equity and go ahead with its planned capital reduction to achieve targeted leverage ratio.In February 2018, Dominion Energy borrowed $950 million under a 364-Day Term Loan Agreement that bears interest at a variable rate. In addition, the agreement contains a maximum allowed total debt to total capital ratio of 67.5%. So, the initiatives undertaken by the company will allow it to trim debt levels and meet its target.At present, the total debt-to-capital ratio of the company stands at 74.18%, much higher than its industry average of 55.03%. The decision to lower debt levels amid rising interest rates is a well-timed one by management.At 2017 end, Dominion Energy’s total interest expenses and other related charges were $1,205 million, up 19.3% from 2016 levels.  Reaffirms GuidanceTaking into consideration the initiatives to reduce its current debt levels, Dominion Energy reaffirmed its first quarter and full-year 2018 earnings per share guidance of 95 cents-$1.15 and $3.80-$4.25 per share, respectively. Dominion expects earnings to improve annually by 6-8% in the 2017-2020 time frame.The company also reaffirmed its intention to increase its annual dividend rate by 10% through 2020, subject to the approval of its board of directors.What’s in Store?Dominion Energy expects the annual growth capital to be in the range of $3.7-$4.2 billion. Dominion Energy’s portfolio realignment strategy focusing on regulated assets and more than 90% of its earnings coming from regulated assets will drive Dominion’s earnings growth.In addition to contribution from organic assets, its decision to merge with SCANA Corporation (SCG  -  Free Report), contribution from acquired assets and new growth projects are likely to drive performance of the company.Rate Hikes to Hurt UtilitiesThe Fed rate has now been raised for the sixth time since the first hike was announced in December 2015 when the U.S. economy had pulled itself out of the Great Recession. The policy makers sounded quite positive in their outlook for the U.S. economy. Quite naturally, the Fed expects to increase interest rates two more times in 2018.The capital intensive Utility sector might cringe at the thought of it for it takes recourse to external sources of financing to meet its capital requirements. In a way, rising interest rates increase this sector’s cost of capital, leaving an adverse impact on margins. The rate hikes can also comprise Utilities’ ability to consistently pay out dividend.Price MovementIn the last three months, decline in Dominion Energy’s shares was wider than the industry it belongs to. Zacks RankDominion has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Moreover, SCANAhas an average positive earnings surprise of 5.25% for the last four quarters.    Which Way Are Estimates Treading?Let’s take a look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of analyst opinion on the stock before the earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $1.14 for the third quarter has been stable in the last seven days.

Also, during the first half of 2017, SCANA’s cash balance has declined drastically, reflecting balance sheet weakness. The company’s high debt level and overall business risks associated with the nuclear generation construction project are a major concern.Moreover, the company’s free cash flow has been negative since 2015, reflecting persistently weak operations. We are also concerned about the company’s rising operating expenses since the beginning of 2017.  Price Performance in Q3During the quarter, the company lost 27.6%, underperforming its industry’s gain of 2.7%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that SCANA will beat estimates this quarter.

However, the duration or the result of this matter has not been mentioned.Abandonment Petition Withdrawn VoluntarilyIn August, SCANA had voluntarily withdrawn its Abandonment Petition from the Public Service Commission of South Carolina that was made under the Base Load Review Act (BLRA), concerning SCE&G’s above-mentioned nuclear project.This followed two weeks after the company stated that it would stop operations on the project owing to increasing expenses. Over the past two weeks, SCE&G’s management has held discussions with various stakeholders and members of the South Carolina General Assembly, including legislative leaders, to talk about the abandonment of the new nuclear project and to listen to their concerns.  SCANA and partner, Santee Cooper, already spent $9 billion on the project before deciding on its termination. The decision attracted tremendous criticism. However, last week, rumors were making rounds relating to SCANA’s withdrawal of an abandonment plan.The company’s decision to withdraw the petition is based on concerns heard from state lawmakers and others.Growth Drivers for Other Utility Electric Power CompaniesSimilar to SCANA, whose nuclear expansion project was considered a catalyst for future earnings growth, most utility electric power companies are on a modernization drive to boost their service reliability to retain customer. Some are adding new generation assets to their portfolio, while others are strengthening infrastructure through regular capital investment and acquisitions. Some companies worth mentioning here are First Energy Corporation (FE  -  Free Report), CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP  -  Free Report) and Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp (AQN  -  Free Report).Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

75,SCG,"Electric utility firm Southern Company’s (SO  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Georgia Power, recently announced plans to move ahead with the construction of its much talked about Vogtle Plant in Georgia after completing the full-scale schedule and cost-to-complete analysis of the project.  On Aug 31, Georgia Power filed a recommendation with the Public Service Commission (PSC) to pursue the construction of two nuclear reactors at Vogtle units 3 and 4.  The PSC is soon to complete the review process and take a final call regarding the expansion of the Vogtle project.The Vogtle nuclear reactors have been grappling with cost overruns and scheduling delays since the commencement of the construction. Further, the bankruptcy of Westinghouse, the major construction contractor of the two nuclear reactors of the plant, aggravated the costs further and led to more delays. Since then a cloud of uncertainty is hovering over the beleaguered plant. The project is already running three years behind schedule and is over budget by more than $10 billion. In June, Westinghouse’s parent company Toshiba Corporation agreed to provide a financial assistance of $3.68 billion for the development of two nuclear reactors. Also the owners of the project have already been granted $8.3 billion loan guarantees by the Department of Energy.Meanwhile, Georgia Power had been assessing the various feasible alternatives including the completion of one or both the reactors, termination of the project or switching to a different power source.Southern Company believes that the plant will make the United States nuclear competitive, helping the nation catch up with the likes of Russia and China. Many nuclear proponents have also supported the company’s commitment toward nuclear power with zero emissions, finding it more reliable than solar and wind energy. With the decision to continue with the project, Vogtle plant in Georgia will be the only project which is under construction in the United States.Last month, South Carolina Electric & Gas — subsidiary of SCANA Corporation (SCG  -  Free Report) — terminated the construction of $18 billion VC Summer nuclear project in South Carolina. On Aug 25, Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) announced the abandonment of Lee III Nuclear Generating Station in South Carolina.However, the rating agency, Moody’s Investors Service, believes that the company’s decision to continue with the project will increase the credit risk. Moody’s believes that the project which has been missing milestone dates and suffering from poor productivity rates is likely to suffer from more delays and ballooning costs. The decision which is likely to hurt the financials of the company, may also affect its negotiations over the acquisition of South Carolina's state-owned electric utility, Santee Cooper.Zacks Rank and Key Pick Southern Company is one of the largest and best-managed electric utility holding companies in the United States.
