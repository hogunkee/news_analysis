2,VLO,"With oil logging surging to multiyear highs, energy stocks have been leading the S&P 500 index and the broader market. Here are five energy stocks with compelling chart action: ConocoPhillips (COP), Valero Energy (VLO), Hollyfrontier (HFC), Wildhorse Resource (WRD) and Viper Energy Partners (VNOM).U.S. crude rose 0.5% Friday to settle at $67.39 a barrel, marking a weekly gain of 8.6% and hitting the highest level since late 2014. Brent crude gained 0.8% to $72.58 a barrel for a weekly increase of 8.2%.U.S. crude futures fell 1.7% to $66.22 a barrel on Monday as investors saw Syria tensions contained following U.S.-led airstrikes on Saturday. If oil prices retreat significantly, crude-related stocks will struggle to advance or even maintain current levels.But the five stocks cited here continued to rally.Small-cap shale play Viper Energy, a subsidiary of Diamondback Energy (FANG) leads the group with a near-best Composite Rating of 98. Wildhorse Resource, another shale play, earns a 97. ConocoPhillips and Hollyfrontier each have a 96 while Valero has a 94.ConocoPhilips, Valero, Hollyfrontier, Wildhorse and Viper Energy all have relative strength lines at record highs, reflecting these energy stocks' outperformance of the S&P 500 index.Wildhorse and Valero are presenting potential buying opportunities.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseValero Energy broke out of a consolidation base with a 100.05 buy point on Wednesday, though the volume was light. Still, shares popped 3.6% to 105.49, hitting a new high and now extended from that entry.Wildhorse Resource cleared a 21.53 buy point from a cup base on Thursday. Shares sprinted 6% to 23.44, now clearly extended.Wildhorse has an especially bullish RS line. Not only is the RS line at new high ground now, but it was at a new high before the stock hit a new price high. Wildhorse came public in December 2016.The three other energy stocks, ConocoPhillips, Viper Energy Partners and Hollyfrontier, are now further extended from buy range. While you never want to chase a stock more than 5% past a buy point, many leaders will pull back into buy range. Keep in mind, however, that you want to see light volume on the pullback, rather than rapid selling.ConocoPhillips rose 1.3% on Monday to 65.73, further extended from a 61.41 buy point cleared several sessions ago.Viper Energy Partners cleared a 26.29 entry point on April 5, becoming extended on Friday. Shares rose 2% to 28.71 on Monday. It also has a strong RS line. Parent company Diamondback has been trending lower since an attempted breakout in late March that ultimately failed.Hollyfrontier is continuing to rise steadily since its April 4 breakout from a cup-with-handle base with a 50.60 buy point. Shares jumped 2.6% to 57.16 on Monday. You never want to see a double-digit gain disappear, so if Hollyfrontier pulls back, be careful about round-tripping.Meanwhile, BP (BP) is at 42.72, in a cup-shaped base with a buy point at 44.72.

4,VLO,"Just how bad will the U.S.' slap-fight over trade, which escalated with China on Friday, be for S&P 500 earnings and stocks? Just how much can the U.S. economy, which delivered solid June jobs growth on Friday, still grow after a nine-year expansion?Analysts expect another blowout quarter in Q2 — 20.7% earnings-per-share growth for S&P 500 index components and an 8.1% jump in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters. Wall Street is betting on continued scorching results for the rest of the year. But they may not be as scorching if President Donald Trump's trade wars with China, Canada, Mexico, Europe and others become more heated. The quiet earnings growth next year might be even more muted.Analysts say the effects of a trade war have yet to be priced into financial forecasts.""I think the first tangible impact should start showing up in estimate revisions as these earnings results come out,"" said Sheraz Mian, director of research at Zacks.In other words, the second-quarter earnings season could offer some higher drama than CEOs' usual blanched remarks about ""headwinds"" and ""tailwinds."" Investors, even more than usual, will focus on earnings guidance and post-earnings call commentary to get some answers as to how the tariffs will affect profit, sales, prices, corporate strategy and shareholder returns.Higher costs for parts and supplies that U.S. companies bring in from overseas could mean higher costs for customers. Businesses could rethink or even uproot complex global supply chains. Higher prices on U.S.-made goods sold overseas could crimp international demand. Companies could cut or delay major investments.S&P 500 index companies, filled with hundreds of U.S. multinationals and exporters, are more exposed to tariffs and global demand than the U.S. economy itself.As for the second-quarter itself, the gains from S&P 500 companies come courtesy of President Trump's tax cuts and an enduring U.S. economy.Rebounding oil prices will lift the energy sector's Q2 earnings by around 141.5%, with sales up some 20%, according to Thomson. S&P 500 energy stocks, which include Dow Jones giants Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) as well as ConocoPhillips (COP), Valero (VLO), Marathon Oil (MRO), Schlumberger (SLB) and many others, have generally been strong performers.Analysts expect the S&P 500 financials to clock a 22% gain in earnings on a 4.5% bump in revenue, as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and other banks enjoy lower taxes and deregulation. Thomson forecasts semiconductors and internet software and services to lead the S&P 500 tech components toward 25.5% earnings growth. Tech revenue is seen jumping 12%. Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Facebook (FB) are all slated to deliver solid-to-stellar growth.As estimates stand now, Thomson Reuters is forecasting the 20%-plus earnings growth to reach into the third and fourth quarters.""The last time we had earnings growth in Q3 and Q4 like this was in 2010,"" Tajinder Dhillon, senior research analyst at Thomson Reuters, said in an email.However, looking past 2018, analysts appear to have a harder time justifying bullish expectations for S&P 500 companies.""You look at the numbers going forward, you really don't start to see a significant drop in growth until you get into 2019, when again, you'll be back to apples-to-apples on the tax rates,"" said John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet.But tougher comparisons aren't a massive concern right now, analysts say. And next year's growth still looks solid. Dhillon said that for 2019 investors can expect a 9.7% earnings growth rate, ""which is still higher than the 20-year average of 7.3%.""Wall Street also worries that the U.S. economy has fewer tools at its disposal to keep its marathon run going. The dollar is stronger. The yield curve is flatter due partly to the Federal Reserve's decisions to lift short-term interest rates.The narrowing yield curve, the gap between rates on short-term and long-term government debt, looms large for banks in particular. The flatter curve, also seen as a precursor to an economic downturn, has dragged bank stocks lower in recent months.Banks also lend money to borrowers based on long-term rates, but borrow from depositors according to short-term rates. The narrower the difference between the two, the narrower the banks' net interest margins. JPMorgan, Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) report second-quarter earnings on Friday.The three banking giants, which all announced hefty shareholder-return packages last month, are expected to deliver solid EPS growth. But JPMorgan stock, along with that of Citigroup, Wells Fargo and others, is near 2018 lows.When the Fed raises rates that affects the money flowing into global, emerging markets as well.""If U.S. interest rates are going up,"" Mian said, ""and an investor or a class of investors is scouring world markets for yield and returns, and if the yield and return is going up in a developed market like the U.S., then there's no reason to take the extra risk of going to Argentina or Turkey when you can get it in the U.S.""The U.S. on Friday lobbed tariffs at $34 billion worth of Chinese products — more than 800 types of products total. That's the first part of a $50 billion response for what Trump says are China's trade abuses against the U.S.The U.S. tariffs target aircraft parts, industrial parts and equipment, some vehicles and other machinery. The duties from the U.S. targeted products related to China's tech-focused ""Made in China 2025"" plan. Trump has said that initiative would ""hurt economic growth for the United States and many other countries.""""The United States can no longer tolerate losing our technology and intellectual property through unfair economic practices,"" Trump said in a statement last month.China on Friday responded with penalties of its own on U.S. products, including automakers and agriculture. China aimed those tariffs squarely at Trump's base.Trump has threatened to levy another $200 billion in tariffs on China, and even more. Meanwhile, Trump has threatened to impose a global import tariff on autos. That follows duties on steel and aluminum that have spurred Europe, Canada and Mexico to retaliate.Further trade discord could force companies to rethink their supply chains. Those adjustments could undo corporate America's efforts over the past two decades to more efficiently manage their inventories. Such practices over that time firmed up businesses' balance sheets.The brinkmanship has swept up some of the most iconic American businesses along the way. General Motors (GM) said as much last week, warning that more tariffs would lead to ""reduced presence at home and abroad for this iconic American company.""Harley-Davidson (HOG) said it would offer more detail, on its earnings call this month, about its plans to move some production out of the U.S. to skirt tariffs from the EU. Brown-Forman (BFB) is raising the price of Jack Daniel's in parts of Europe because of the tariffs imposed by the EU.No one knows how the Trump trade wars, and their impact on S&P 500 companies, will play out.""We expect company-specific risks from tariffs and China-trade exposures to be a central discussion topic during 2Q18 earnings calls,"" RBC analyst Deane Dray, who covers industrials vulnerable to steel and aluminum tariffs, wrote in a note last month. ""But no one has a crystal ball on how the tariff situation will ultimately play out, especially the potential knock-on effects.""He said companies like 3M (MMM) and Danaher (DHR) looked best equipped among industrials to handle the trade disputes.The trade war also threatens chipmakers like Micron (MU). A Chinese court blocked sales of some of its chips in the country, a move seen as pushback from the nation against Trump's trade salvos. China has held up approving the Qualcomm (QCOM) takeover of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). Boeing (BA) isn't subject to China tariffs, but Beijing could favor Airbus (EADSY) jets in a protracted U.S.-China trade war. The aerospace company in April downplayed worries over a trade war.Baird analyst Benjamin Hartford covers transportation and logistics companies like UPS (UPS), FedEx (FDX) and Expeditors International (EXPD). Hartford wrote in a research note last month that he'd seen no ""material evidence (yet) of freight volume weakness amid rising global trade tensions.""Some analysts, like Tigress' Ivan Feinseth, expressed optimism that strength in corporate earnings would offset any trade damage. Others wonder how much a trade war will hurt corporate travel for the likes of global carriers like American Airlines (AAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL), and cargo demand broadly. Delta Air earnings are due Thursday.""We still expect demand to grow, but those expectations are dampened with each new tariff introduced,"" Alexandre de Juniac, CEO of the International Air Transport Association, said of air cargo demand in a statement this week.

5,VLO,"Whiting Petroleum (WLL), HollyFrontier (HFC), Valero Energy (VLO) and other oil stocks surged near buy points Tuesday as oil prices rose amid prospects for increased tensions with Iran.XU.S. crude climbed 2.2% to settle at a three-week high of $63.40 a barrel as the market expects President Trump to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal and reimpose sanctions, following a meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Brent crude was up 2.1% at $67.42.""The Iran deal is coming up. It's probably another month or so, and you're going to see what I do,"" Trump told reporters Tuesday. ""But Iran has not been treating that part of the world or the world itself appropriately. A lot of bad things are happening in Iran.""Riyadh has been a vocal opponent of the Obama administration's nuclear deal with Iran, while Trump repeatedly promised to tear up the agreement during his campaign.When asked Tuesday if the U.S. should leave the deal, Salman said, ""We'll talk about that.""He also told reporters that he sees a ""stable"" oil market and that the kingdom has a 84-year supply of crude.Whiting shares rallied 3.9% to close at 30.66 on the stock market today, consolidating in a cup base near its 31.80 buy point.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe shake-up at the State Department has also increased the likelihood of harsher sanctions against Iran.Last week, former Exxon Mobil (XOM) CEO Rex Tillerson was fired as Secretary of State. Current CIA Director Mike Pompeo will replace him.""Pompeo is more likely to support sanctions against Iran than Tillerson was,"" said James Williams, an economist at energy consultant WTRG. ""One of the reasons why Trump got rid of Tillerson was that Tillerson wasn't nearly as aggressive as Trump on the issues.""Williams said sanctions with Iran would reduce Iranian oil production, noting that oil hit $100 a barrel when the Obama administration levied sanctions on Iran. While oil won't hit $100 this time, he said prices will still go higher.The ongoing unrest in Venezuela is also rattling the oil market, according to Williams.On Monday, Trump signed an order outlawing U.S. companies and citizens from using Venezuela's new cryptocurrency, the Petro, saying it's an ""attempt to circumvent U.S. sanctions.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Energy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, CoalSaudi Crown Prince Poised To Go On $35 Billion U.S. Shopping SpreeOPEC, Russia May Be Trapped By Flood Of Oil From U.S. Shale Producers

9,VLO,"Dow Jones futures rose solidly Monday morning, along with stock futures for the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100. A trio of big merger deals are making headlines, including a long-mooted combination of Sprint (S) and T-Mobile (TMUS). Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL), which reports earnings Tuesday, is still the world's most valuable company but has been decidedly mediocre for a full 12 months.The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite fell last week, though they pared losses after finding support near their 200-day moving averages. But they hit resistance around their 50-day lines Friday, as Amazon, Microsoft (MSFT), Intel (INTC) pulled back from post-earnings highs and Apple retreated.Dow Jones futures advanced 0.5% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures rose 0.5% and Nasdaq futures climbed 0.7%. The 10-year Treasury yield inched higher to 2.962% after hitting a four-year high of 3.02% last week. The 2-year yield nudged up to 2.488%.Remember that Dow Jones futures and other off-hours trading often doesn't translate into how the market or individual stock will open or close in the following session. Nasdaq futures skyrocketed early Friday, but tech gains quickly withered after the open.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAfter years of on-and-off talks, Sprint and T-Mobile agreed on a $26.5 billion combination. The obvious winners are tech writers and editors, who will no longer have to write headlines like ""Sprint, T-Mobile Said To Resume Talks"" followed by ""Sprint, T-Mobile Merger Talks On Hold.""As for investors, the T-Mobile merger with Sprint values each Sprint share at 0.10256 of a T-Mobile share. That values Sprint at 6.62 a share based on T-Mobile's Friday close of 64.52. Sprint closed Friday at 6.50.Sprint tumbled 10% to 5.85 before the open on the stock market today. That's about where it was late Friday, as buzz that a deal was imminent. T-Mobile stock fell a fraction.Deutsche Telekom, T-Mobile's parent, will get a 42% stake while Sprint majority owner Softbank will get 27%. The new company will use the T-Mobile name. T-Mobile Chief Executive John Legere will be CEO while the board will include SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son.Antitrust regulators are sure to take a close look at the deal, which would reduce the number of major U.S. wireless operators to three.Walmart will sell its U.K. grocery chain to Sainsbury's for 7.3 billion pounds ($10.1 billion), retrenching from a fiercely competitive market as it picks battles with Amazon (AMZN) at home and in many other countries worldwide. Walmart will own a 42% stake in the combined firm. U.K. regulators are likely to take a very close look at this deal.Walmart, a Dow Jones component, edged higher in the premarket.Marathon Petroleum (MPC) will buy Andeavor (ANDV) in a deal with an equity value of $23.3 billion and enterprise value of $35.6 billion. The deal values Andeavor at about $152.27 a share, a 24% premium. It would create the largest U.S. refinery by capacity, passing Valero Energy (VLO).Even as the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq eked out slim gains Friday, Apple fell 1.2%, undercutting the low of its recent consolidation. The stock is beginning to lose sight of its 200-day line.Apple's relative strength line, which tracks the stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, also sank to its worst levels since early February. The RS line offers a quick way of showing which stocks are the real leaders and laggards. Apple's RS line is about where it was exactly 12 months ago,  Since early November, it has been trending lower.The Dow Jones tech giant's earnings are expected to rise 28% to $2.69 a share as revenue grows 15.5% to $61.1 billion. That would be faster EPS growth and the 6th straight quarter of accelerating sales gains. But that's largely a reflection of the new iPhone product cycle. The growing fear, which has weighed on the stock, is that iPhone X demand is rapidly cooling. What will drive Apple's growth going forward.Apple's guidance will be key. The iPhone giant also is expected to hike its dividend and increase share buybacks.Apple shares rose slightly in premarket trading.Apple has a market cap of nearly $824 billion, still the most valuable public company. But Amazon.com (AMZN) has sprinted over the past year and is now worth $761 billion.Amazon recently surpassed fellow FANG stock Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL), which briefly grabbed that crown two years ago. Alphabet has a $717 billion market cap.Amazon has shot up 71% over the past 12 months vs. 13% for Apple and 12% for the S&P 500 index. Alphabet has risen 16%. Since the end of last year, Amazon has climbed 34% while Alphabet and Apple are modestly lower.Amazon broke out Friday following its blowout, accelerating earnings and revenue growth. But the stock fell back below the 1,617.64 cup-base entry, closing up 3.6% at 1,572.62.  Investors may want to wait for the online sales giant to move above Friday's intraday high of 1,638.10.Amazon rose 1% in premarket trading.Remember that Amazon is in a very late-stage base, after several big moves in recent years.

58,VLO,"Oil barely budged on Thursday as doubts linger over the restart of refineries that are flickering back to life in the wake of Hurricane Harvey.Futures ended the session in New York near a four-week high after the resumption of some plants on the Gulf Coast of Texas drove a rally of about 7% in four days. While millions of barrels of fuel-making capacity have been restored, the resumption of several key plants is still uncertain. Reaction to a government report showing an anticipated jump in U.S. crude stockpiles was muted.The Gulf Coast is recovering and there doesn't seem to be significant damage to infrastructure, but ""there are a lot of unknowns,"" Kyle Cooper, director of research at IAF Advisors in Houston, said by phone. ""I think people now are just sitting on the sidelines.""After slamming into the Texas coast 13 days ago and drenching thousands of square miles with record-breaking rains, Harvey left key U.S. refineries, ports and pipelines out of service or operating at drastically reduced rates. Refiners such as Valero Energy (VLO) and Citgo Petroleum have swiftly resumed operations at Texas plants, but Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA)'s Deer Park refinery on the Houston Ship Channel remains shut.U.S. crude inventories increased by 4.58 million barrels last week to 462.4 million, the most since March, according to Energy Information Administration data released Thursday. Imports into the U.S. Gulf Coast region fell to the lowest in records going back to 1990. Gasoline stockpiles slid by 3.2 million barrels to 226.7 million, the largest decline since mid-July. Crude production tumbled by the most since 2012.As refineries shut due to Harvey, ""you knew that there was going to be a build as it related to crude oil,"" said Brian Kessens, a managing director and portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors, who helps manage $16 billion in energy-related assets. ""We'll be able to get a better sense of the numbers over the next couple of weeks.""West Texas intermediate for October delivery fell 7 cents to settle at $49.09 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Refiners including Valero Energy (VLO) and Citgo Petroleum  worked to get Texas plants back on track, while Exxon Mobil (XOM) began supplying filling stations with fuel after repairs to a Houston pipeline. Even as the hardest-hit operators worked to resurrect output, traders watched another major hurricane approaching from the east that has already led to the shutdown of an oil terminal.The market was ""waiting for the refineries to restart so demand could start to pick up again,"" Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Seattle, which oversees $142 billion of assets, said by telephone. ""That's really what speculators had been waiting for.""Harvey forced refineries, pipelines, ports and offshore platforms to shut as the storm intensified before making landfall on Aug. 25. While many of those facilities are back in service, others have yet to resume production, including plants owned by Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and Total (TOT). Still, Goldman Sachs sees half of the refining capacity lost to Harvey back to work by Sept. 7. Dry weather across southeast Texas should help minimize the loss of demand for gasoline and diesel, according to the bank.Fuel makers are ""starting to put more supply into the chain — that's going to put pressure on gasoline prices,"" Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA in New York, said by telephone.

They outperformed big-time in 2016 and in four earlier years of the decade, says Christopher Lo, a manager of $3.8 billion Columbia Small Cap Index (NMSCX), the ninth-best-performing portfolio on the Best Mutual Fund Awards winners small-cap list. Those five years of outperformance more than made up for years when they stood out less, he adds.Another reason small-cap funds predominate among cap-size outperformers is that in 2016 alone, they benefited more than other cap-size groups from the election results. ""Small caps tend to have higher shares of domestic revenues,"" Lo said. ""So they benefited from the prospect of policy changes, such as lowering corporate taxes — small caps tend to pay higher tax rates — and increasing infrastructure spending.""A third reason: Small caps tend to outperform in periods of rising interest rates. When rates rise because the economy is strengthening, that often coincides with strengthening fundamentals for U.S. small caps, Lo said.In addition, coming out of economic downturns — such as in 2010 — small caps tend to outperform because they are less burdened by balance-sheet debt. They borrow less than large caps do during downturns, Lo said.A fifth reason for small-cap excellence is the prevalence of small-cap innovators.The 108 Best Mutual Fund Award winners last year have dwindled to 49 the latest year. Why the big drop-off? The stock market in 2016 was a pivotal factor, as the Brexit and elections caught many fund managers on the wrong side of the broad market benchmark. The number of large-cap winners fell to 11 from 94, midcap winners edged up to 15 from 10 and small-cap winners rose to 23 from 4.Return winners among the three cap-size categories also got mowed down by a volatile market in 2016. Large-cap funds did best, with three of their 11 winners this year repeating from 2015. Just one midcap winner was a repeat performer. And not a single small-cap portfolio was a veteran award winner.So how can you use our lists of award winners to build a better portfolio? When you're building or reviewing a portfolio, your investment profile is likely to call for various weightings in large-, mid, and small-cap funds. Consider filling those portfolio slots with IBD Best Mutual Fund Award winners. If the winners aren't available in your 401(k) plan, you can ask your plan provider why not.What made these funds winners? For one thing, to become a winner it helps if a fund can minimize its losses in market downturns. Otherwise, its long-term returns suffer, potentially knocking it out of contention over the longer time periods.""It takes discipline,"" said Mark Oelschlager, manager of $213 million Pin Oak Equity Fund (POGSX), a top-five standout in the U.S. diversified equity, blend (where it is No. 1) and large-cap categories. He also runs $420 million Red Oak Technology (ROGSX), tops among sector funds. ""It takes a willingness to go against the crowd. And it takes conviction.""Oelschlager showed those traits in recent years when he bet big on financials as they sold off in the financial crisis. ""We had confidence that eventually conditions would change and we would be rewarded,"" he said. He has already started to take profits in the sector, trimming his weighting, he says.Independent thinking is another trait that fuels outperformance, Oelschlager says. His reaction to the market's postelection advance is a case study. While many other investors are seeking pure plays on the widely expected boost in infrastructure spending and corporate tax cuts, Oelschlager is looking elsewhere. ""We've been looking in the opposite direction from the Trump bump,"" he said. ""We're moving incrementally toward stability. We still have significant exposure to financials and some other cyclical sectors, but we're generally favoring stability in consumer staples, health care, even in technology and financials.""Bank of New York Mellon (BK) is a financial he still likes. ""Its valuation is still attractive,"" he said. ""It's relatively stable. It doesn't have the same issues with lending cycles as many other banks because it's not focused on lending. It's more of a trust bank.""Paychex (PAYX) and Amdocs (DOX) are two more examples. Paychex provides payroll and other employee-benefits services for customers. Amdocs is a leader in back-end software systems for telecom enterprises. ""Both are relatively stable companies in what are considered cyclical sectors,"" Oelschlager said.Valero Energy (VLO) refines and markets fuels and other petroleum products. ""Energy is considered a cyclical, and energy is expected to benefit from Trump,"" Oelschlager said. ""But Valero has less leverage to this cycle. They are further downstream. They are not an E&P. They don't have the same volatility. And their results are more consistent than an E&P company's.""Oelschlager isn't the only advocate of discipline. Jerry Dodson, manager of $3.7 billion Parnassus Endeavor (PARWX), shows another way that discipline contributes to outperformance. Dodson buys stocks only once they have tumbled 33% below what he determines their intrinsic value to be.He must also satisfy himself that the stock's setback is just temporary and not a sign of something that has crippled the company. In addition, he wants bargains that can rebound within three years.""Part of the beauty of this process is that all we need is for the stock to rebound to its fair market value,"" Dodson said. ""We're not asking it to do anything extraordinary.""Dodson is a returning winner for good reason. Parnassus Endeavor posted a 12.23% average annual return over the 10 years ended Dec. 31. That was tops among all U.S. equity funds. It was also No. 1 in both the growth and large-cap categories. Its pace was nearly double the S&P 500's 6.95% yearly average return.There's no single path to consistent outperformance. Dodson achieved that goal with just 25 large-cap holdings as of Dec. 31. William Coleman and Gerry O'Reilly, managers of $5.2 billion Vanguard Tax-Managed Small Cap (VTMSX), reached the brass ring with 597 small stocks as of Jan. 31.The Vanguard fund ranks in the top five in both the small-cap and blend categories.Coleman and O'Reilly's strategy hinges on dumping holdings that are losing ground. They do it to minimize tax losses. But the strategy has the added benefit of constantly pumping up their weighting in their best performers. ""Some of our outperformance comes from selling names before they head farther south,"" O'Reilly said. ""We take those proceeds and spread them over winning names in our benchmark, which boosts our performance.""It's a strategy that wins by hitting singles, not home runs. The portfolio holds nearly 600 names, and just one had a weighting higher than 0.58% as of Dec. 31.Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR), with a weighting of about a quarter of 1%, gapped up 43% on March 20, and is now up 91% so far this year. The biotech jumped on the release of data from its main clinical trial, which involves a search a practical alternative to addictive opioid therapies for managing pain. Opioid abuse is an epidemic. The company has yet to notch an annual profit, going back to 2008.Nutrisystem (NTRI), which markets weight-loss products and services, is up 57% this year. Shares gapped up 19% on Feb. 28, the day after the company reported fourth-quarter and full-year results. The company reported 29-cent Q4 earnings per share, a 53% gain vs. 20% in Q3, topping analysts' estimates. It also offered bullish guidance for 2017.Lumentum Holdings (LITE), a fiber optics provider, is up 40% this year. The stock is ranked No. 2 in IBD's No. 1-rated Telecom-Fiber Optics industry group. It has a top-notch 99 Composite Rating from IBD — 99 is the highest rating. And it has four years in a row of annual EPS growth.IBD'S TAKE: See how Lumentum's easy-to-understanding fundamental and technical data stack up against rivals' at IBD's Stock Checkup.There are many paths to consistent outperformance. One fund's winning way may be fine for some shareholders but too volatile or too risky for others, says Gary Miller, lead manager of $8.2 billion Victory Sycamore Established Value Fund (GETGX), the No. 1 winner in the value funds category and a top-five winner in the midcap group.RELATED:Introducing IBD's Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards

78,VLO,"Tesoro (TSO), an oil refiner based in Texas, agreed to buy Western Refining (WNR) in a deal valued at $6.4 billion, creating a company that will account for about 6% of U.S. crude-processing capacity.Tesoro will acquire Western Refining at an implied price of $37.30 per Western share in a stock transaction, representing an equity value of $4.1 billion, the companies said in a joint statement Thursday. The deal also includes the assumption of approximately $1.7 billion of Western's net debt and the $605 million market value of a non-controlling interest in Western Refining Logistics.The deal ""extends our portfolio into attractive and growing markets,"" Greg Goff, chairman and chief executive officer of Tesoro, said in the statement. ""Our increased scale and diversity will enable us to leverage and enhance in-house technical capabilities, which we expect will result in cost efficiencies, the ability to drive more growth and increased productivity.""The combined companies will deliver $350 million to $425 million of annual synergies as a result of the acquisition, with that rate of cost savings to be achieved within two years. They will have a refining system with over 1.1 million barrels a day of capacity, it said.The deal comes as U.S. independent refiners, including leaders Valero Energy (VLO) and Marathon Petroleum (MPC), brace for lower margins after a two-year period in which they enjoyed strong profits. The so-called West Texas Intermediate 3-2-1 oil refining margin has fallen to $11.81 a barrel, down from a peak of more than $30 a barrel in early 2015.The combination will transform Tesoro into the fifth-largest U.S. refiner behind Valero, Exxon Mobil (XOM), Marathon and Philips 66 (PSX) and ahead of Motiva Enterprises LLC and Chevron (CVX), according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.The purchase price represents a premium of 22.3% to the closing price of Western's stock on the day prior to announcement, according to the statement. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2017 and is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by the shareholders of both companies and the receipt of regulatory approval, the companies said.

80,VLO,"WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Tesoro (TSO) CEO said at an industry conference Monday that he supports the U.S. oil export ban being lifted and doesn't see a threat to the industry from hybrid cars.In the opening remarks at the annual Energy Information Administration conference, Gregory Goff said he supports free-market policies, noting that the end of the crude export ban is actually in the best interest for his industry, which had fought to keep the ban as it made U.S. oil cheaper.""From our standpoint, as a principle-based company, we believe a healthy free market economy is the way to address things,"" Goff said. ""Based upon that, we felt was in the best interest to lift the ban to allow the economy to move forward. Crude oil is sold and priced around the world and is very transparent.""The crude export ban, a relic from the 1970s that attempted to protect Americans from price spikes from Middle Eastern countries, was lifted last year. The ban's removal was good news for U.S. producers like Continental Resources (CLR) and Devon Energy (DVN), as it opened up additional markets.But refiners like Valero Energy (VLO) and their allies in Congress were some of the biggest advocates for keeping the ban.IBD'S TAKE: Amid the slump in oil prices and U.S. output, domestic producers like Continental are developing new ways to extract oil more efficiently and quickly.Tesoro shares rose 1.8% to 74 in the stock market today. Devon Energy climbed 0.2% and Valero 1.6%, but Continental sank 2.9%.Meanwhile, Goff said that ""no one has objections"" to advances in renewable energy as long as a strong business case could be made, but he called out the Obama administration for supporting overreaching regulations. Goff also said hybrid cars aren't a threat but a change, despite the impact that such vehicles have on gasoline consumption.Hybrids like the Toyota (TM) Prius and electric cars like the Tesla Motors (TSLA) Model S are becoming more affordable, but Goff questions the affordability of hybrids currently, saying it was important for alternative forms of transport to be developed in a free market economy.Tesla Motors rose 3.7%, retaking its 50-day moving average. Toyota climbed 3.5%, also retaking its 50-day line.

81,VLO,"SolarCity (SCTY), First Solar (FSLR) and SunPower (SPWR) could bloom under Hillary Clinton, but her goal of 500 million solar panels cumulatively installed by 2025, along with the potential for higher gasoline taxes, could slam Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX) and Valero Energy (VLO), S&P analysts said Wednesday.But that doesn't mean a Donald Trump presidency would boost gasoline to the detriment of solar, S&P analyst Stewart Glickman says.""We think efforts to rein in gasoline consumption would dissipate"" if Trump were president, Glickman wrote in a research report. ""A potential loss of incentives for renewables could push incremental demand for refined products, which we think would be a mild tailwind for these oil and gas companies.""Solar and oil/gas both depend heavily on subsidies, Glickman notes. In December, Congress voted in a five-year extension to the Investment Tax Credit (ITC), a key subsidy underpinning the solar industry. But stocks have plunged on net-metering actions in Arizona and Nevada that reduce financial incentives for solar installations.IBD's 20-company Energy-Solar industry group is down 45% this year and ranks No. 196 out of 197 groups tracked by IBD. Conversely, the Oil & Gas-Integrated industry group is up 17% since January and ranks No. 14.Clinton could spell the difference for solar stocks, Glickman says. During her hypothetical two-term presidency, she plans to reduce U.S. oil consumption by a third by reaching 500 million in solar panel installations.To date, the U.S. has installed 25 gigawatts to 30 GW, or roughly 100 million to 120 million panels installed cumulatively. So, Clinton's goal would require a 20% compound annual growth rate over eight years, or 45% over four years.""Generating that kind of growth is possible but highly contingent, in our view, on the continued extension of the ITC, which is now slated to expire in 2021,"" he wrote. And strong demand for green energy could depress the fundamentals for fossil fuels, which run best at high utilization, he said.In Q1, the International Energy Association estimated U.S. crude oil demand stood at 19.5 million barrels per day, the highest globally, with No. 2 China at 11.5 million barrels daily. A one-third reduction under Clinton would eliminate 6 million barrels per day, contributing to ""markedly weaker utilization and earnings power,"" Glickman said.Trump, on the other hand, has argued in favor of all forms of energy, ""but doesn't want to pick favorites."" Glickman expects Trump to reduce or eliminate the ITC. S&P analyst Angelo Zino says a reduction to 10% from the current 30% would force solar demand to fall 60%.A Clinton victory would help Canadian Solar (CSIQ), First Solar, SolarCity and SunPower, but hurt Valero, Phillips 66 (PSX), Marathon Petroleum (MPC), HollyFrontier (HFC) and Tesoro (TSO), Glickman says.""We think the new administration could pursue enhanced environmental protection efforts or higher gasoline taxes, both of which could curb gasoline demand and thus cut throughput at these refining companies,"" he said, adding that global integrated oil companies like Exxon and Chevron could feel some heat.

83,VLO,"Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) has been loading up on shares of Phillips 66 (PSX) and now owns about 14%, fueling speculation that Buffett may buy the oil refiner outright.If so, it would likely be among his largest takeovers ever. Phillips 66 has a market cap of $40 billion. Last month, Berkshire closed its $37.2 billion purchase of Precision Castparts, its biggest acquisition to date.Berkshire began buying big lots of Phillips 66 stock in August, when it purchased $4.5 billion worth of the shares to boost its stake to 10.8%. Berkshire bought more shares last month to give it a 13.7% stake. Additional purchases this month put the stake over 14%.Phillips 66 CEO Greg Garland was asked about the big Berkshire purchases on a Jan. 29 earnings call but only said, ""We don't comment on conversations with shareholders.""Berkshire didn't respond to requests for comment.Shares of Berkshire closed up 2.4% on the stock market today. Phillips 66 rallied 3.2%.Buffett's pattern of Phillips 66 stock purchases is reminiscent of his transactions leading up to his $9.7 billion acquisition of lubricant and chemical maker Lubrizol in 2011, said S&P Global Markets Intelligence analyst Cathy Seifert.""He bought an equity stake and then bought the company,"" she told IBD.Seifert said she doesn't have knowledge of a specific plan by Buffett to buy Phillips 66, but his purchases of its stock follow a well-trodden path.""You have to think what his patterns tend to be,"" Seifert said. ""This move lately was an opportunity to, No. 1, diversify holdings and, No. 2,  gain opportunistic exposure to the space at an attractive price. It's a function of diversification and a long-term macro view of an opportunity to get in.""Any purchase of Phillips 66 would come at a tricky time for the sector. While integrated giants like Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) are suffering amid low oil prices, pure-play refineries generally benefit, as they enjoying reduced input costs and fatter profit margins.But the good times may be nearing an end.Earlier this week, a Delta Air Lines (DAL)-owned refinery, Monroe Energy, prepared to reduce output by 10%, according to Reuters. It followed Valero Energy (VLO), which slashed gasoline output by 25% at a Tennessee refinery.Analysts expect more output cuts by refiners who will try to avoid flooding the already saturated market, Reuters said.Shares of Delta Air Lines rose 0.7% Friday, and Valero climbed 3.9%. Exxon rose 1.8%, and Chevron gained 2.9%.

84,VLO,"Most energy stocks have tanked with the price of oil. Not Valero Energy (VLO). The world's biggest independent oil refiner is up 50% over the past year, while the S&P 500 is down slightly and the 39-stock oil and gas refining group has dropped 14%. The stock is currently getting support at its 10-week moving average as it works on a flat base with a buy point at 73.98.Valero operates 15 refineries stretching from California to Canada to the United Kingdom, turning oil and natural gas into products such as gasoline and heating oil. It also sells gasoline through more than 7,000 filling stations nationwide.Lower gasoline prices have hurt Valero's revenues, which have declined for five straight quarters. Yet the company's profit growth has been strong over most of that period as the prices of oil and natural gas have fallen faster than the prices of refined products such as gasoline.The difference has boosted margins. Valero's after-tax margin has risen for five straight quarters to 6.1% in Q3. That's nearly double the 3.1% margin in the same period a year earlier.Valero, based in San Antonio, Texas, will report Q4 results Jan. 28. Profit for the period is expected to fall 24% from the same period a year earlier to $1.39 a share. Revenue is seen dropping 38% to $17.2 billion. Meanwhile, analysts expected profit to fall 12% in the current year after an expected 32% gain for 2015.Yet Valero's relative strength line continues to rise, and its up/down volume ratio of 1.8 is above the neutral 1.0, suggesting solid demand. The well-regarded Fidelity Contrafund has increased its holdings for three straight quarters.Valero also earns income from its majority stake in Valero Energy Partners (VLP), a master limited partnership that owns pipelines and storage facilities.In Q3, Valero hiked its quarterly dividend by 25%, to 50 cents a share. The annualized dividend yield is 2.8%, above the S&P 500 average of 2.1%. The long-term dividend growth rate is a whopping 54%.

97,VLO,"The economy rose at a 2% annual rate in the third quarter, revised down from 2.1% and Q2's 3.9%, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. The U.S. is on pace for a 10th straight year of failing to achieve 3% annual growth. That helps explain why it took nearly a decade for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, and why Donald Trump has had so much support in his presidential run.
"
98,VLO,"In the third quarter, exports were a little weaker than previously estimated, as U.S. manufacturers and others struggle to sell to weak overseas economies amid a strong dollar.

122,VLO,"The economy rose at a 2% annual rate in the third quarter, revised down from 2.1% and Q2's 3.9%, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. The U.S. is on pace for a 10th straight year of failing to achieve 3% annual growth. That helps explain why it took nearly a decade for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, and why Donald Trump has had so much support in his presidential run.In the third quarter, exports were a little weaker than previously estimated, as U.S. manufacturers and others struggle to sell to weak overseas economies amid a strong dollar. Inventories rose a little less than expected, subtracting 0.7 percentage point from Q3 GDP growth. Most economists expect business destockpiling still has a ways to go.Business investment rose at a 9.9% pace, the best in a year. Consumer spending, which accounts for roughly 70% of economic activity, rose at a solid 3% pace amid improving jobs and wages and cheap gas prices at the pump.But through the first nine months of 2015, GDP has risen at a 2.2% rate. Most economists see Q4 growth as lackluster, leaving the economy with less than 3% yet again. This decade of futility would the worst in the post-World War II era.Sluggish growth has left wages stagnant for Americans, especially noncollege educated men. This blue collar discontent has generated resentment and forms the base of Trump's populist presidential run. More than two-thirds (69%) of Trump supporters say the U.S. is still in a recession, according to the latest IBD/TIPP Poll, even though the current expansion started in June 2009; 44% of Trump supporters are in job-sensitive households, meaning they or someone in their family are looking for work or worried about losing their job.The decade of weak economic growth — including the sharpest recession since the Depression and the weakest expansion since WWII — also lines up with the Fed's reluctance to raise rates. Until this month's move, the Fed hadn't hiked since mid-2006, and for nearly 7 years the rate had been near zero.Job growth has been sluggish and wages too. Yes, unemployment has fallen to 5%, but much of that reflects a sharp decline in the labor force participation rate.Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen and other policymakers have stressed that future tightening will be gradual, if not glacial.In other economic news:Existing-home sales plungeExisting-home sales fell 10.5% in November to an annual rate of 4.76 million units, the National Association of Realtors said, the slowest pace in 19 months and much worse than expected.

216,VLO,"Battered, bruised and coveted: Energy ETFs have been gutted in the past year amid falling oil prices, but investors keep piling in. The three largest exchange traded funds holding broad-based energy stocks absorbed roughly $3 billion in new money combined in the first seven months of this year.CLS Investments, an ETF strategist firm in Nebraska, has been cautiously adding to its energy stakes.""While we believe current prices are attractive, we are inclined to maintain our current overweight, without being heavy buyers,"" said senior portfolio manager J.J. Schenkelberg.She likes Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) and Fidelity MSCI Energy (FENY) for their focus on fully integrated large companies, which have strong balance sheets and react more nimbly to shifting conditions.Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) are the top two holdings in both. FENY has almost a third of its assets in these two titans.Stewart Glickman, an equity analyst at S&P Capital IQ, is overall negative on energy stocks.""I don't see oil prices going meaningfully higher"" for a while, he said. Oil prices hit a fresh 6-1/2-year low Monday as slowing China growth caused global panic. Plus, renewed concerns about an oil glut dog the industry.That's eroding profits for ""upstream"" exploration and production companies that get oil and gas out of the ground, as well as equipment and services companies providing the tools to get the job done.Higher RiskETFs tracking these industries have lost as much as 23% year to date. ""Industry ETFs can incur elevated risk that investors may not want,"" according to S&P Capital IQ.Still, there are pockets of opportunity for successful investing.Glickman describes ""downstream"" companies, such as refiner Valero (VLO), as benefiting from weak commodity prices. IBD 50 stock Tesoro (TSO), a Texas refiner, grew earnings 172% in the past quarter.""Crude oil prices are an input cost for them,"" Glickman said. So they are profiting from an attractive ""crack spread,"" or the difference between the price of crude oil and its refined products.A new ETF, Market Vectors Oil Refiners (CRAK), provides targeted, pure-play exposure to global oil refiners. It has a 0.59% expense ratio.Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research at S&P Capital IQ, also likes Alerian MLP (AMLP).The ETF holds 23 infrastructure-related master limited partnerships, including EQT Midstream Partners (EQM). Profits for EQT and other ""midstream"" pipeline-type companies depend on the volume of oil, natural gas or electricity transported, not commodity price.Pipeline SpaceRosenbluth says ""trends are supportive"" of the pipeline space, given demand for improved energy infrastructure. Plus, he likes their income aspect.MLPs must distribute at least 90% of their profits to investors, boosting their yields.AMLP was down 15% year to date as of Friday vs. a 19% fall for XLE and 20% for FENY.ETFs based on price or earnings momentum have also held up better, relatively speaking. PowerShares Dynamic Energy Exploration & Production (PXE) was down 12% year to date as of Friday.""In a rapidly moving energy marketplace, a momentum strategy can have its benefits,"" Rosenbluth said. ""These alternative approach ETFs shift holdings and go where the style is working, instead of being static and fixed on the largest or smallest holdings.""PXE's No. 1 holding is Valero, with 7% of assets. Valero has an IBD Composite Rating of 87.
"
217,VLO,"The oil and gas refining industry group has been climbing the ranks this year and is now at No. 51, up from 144 six months ago. Three stocks in the group earn 90 or better Composite Ratings, with four more above 85.
"
218,VLO,"In this group, Valero Energy (VLO), Tesoro (TSO), HollyFrontier (HFC), Alon USA Energy (ALJ) and Northern Tier Energy (NTI) hit 52-week highs Thursday, although many reversed lower by the close.Investors by and large gave top refiners a thumbs up for second-quarter earnings results. According to a Barclays research note on Aug. 7, U.S. and global refining margins continued to march higher in Q2, significantly topping market expectations and building on an already impressive first quarter.Also noteworthy in the U.S. market, reported July margins were higher than even May, which is typically the strongest month.Valero Energy is the group leader by Composite Rating and the second-largest by market cap at $35 billion. The stock is extended, though, up 8% from a 64.59 flat-base breakout on July 1.Sales for the refining giant have dropped sharply over the past four quarters, but that hasn't stopped big gains in earnings per share. Lower oil prices have hit Valero's revenue hard, but helped margins expand.Tesoro fell hard Thursday despite a positive open, but is still extended from a flat-base breakout at 94.93 on July 10. The stock is up about 40% year to date and enjoys growing mutual fund sponsorship, including a position by the well-regarded Fidelity Contrafund .On Aug. 6, HollyFrontier topped a 51.41 buy point from a deep consolidation. The pattern had an awkward shape and ran 41% deep, which is a flaw. Aggressive investors may also have spotted an earlier handle entry at 43.81.The handle passes the midpoint test, which means it formed in the upper half of the overall pattern.

219,VLO,"Corn futures fell to a seven-week low and soybeans plunged the most in six years after the U.S. unexpectedly raised its crop forecasts, citing higher yields than anticipated.The corn harvest will be 13.686 billion bushels compared with 13.53 billion projected in July, the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.The soybean outlook also exceeded expectations.The government report surprised investors because the crop year began with record June rain in Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, washing away newly sown crops.Corn futures for December delivery fell 5% to close at $3.68 a bushel at 1:20 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade.The price touched $3.575, the lowest for a most-active contract since June 22.Soybean futures for November delivery slid 6% to $9.1325 a bushel, the biggest drop since July 7, 2009.Larger supplies of corn may reduce costs for ethanol refiners such as Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM) and Valero Energy (VLO) and meat producers such as Tyson Foods (TSN), which buys grain for livestock feed.Shares of farm equipment makers fell on the news. Deere (DE), the largest tractor manufacturer, dropped 3%.

The move puts Valero solidly in buy range from a cup base with a 64.59 buy point. The stock has gained about 31% this year.Marathon broke out of a flat base with a 54.25 buy point to hit a fresh high. Shares are in buy range to 56.97.

248,VLO,"Pioneer Natural Resources shares jumped Wednesday after the Texas-based oil company got the OK from Washington Tuesday to export oil. Refiners' shares sank on the news.Domestic drillers Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) received approval from the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security to export condensate, a type of ultralight oil, reported the Wall Street Journal. Shipments can begin as early as August and likely will be small.The ruling probably will encourage other oil producers to ask for export permission, and the Commerce Department is working on an industrywide approval, according to the report. But as of Tuesday, the department said ""no change in policy on crude-oil exports"" has been made. By midafternoon, Pioneer Natural shares had traded up 4% to 230.57 in the stock market today, Wednesday. Enterprise Products shares rose 1.1% to 76.97.Separately Tuesday, Enterprise announced plans to build a 1,200-mile pipeline to connect the Bakken play in North Dakota to the oil pricing hub of Cushing, Okla.The pipeline will have a daily capacity of 340,000 barrels of oil and should be operational by the end of 2016.The Oil & Gas-U.S. Exploration & Production group is highly ranked at No. 3 out of the 197 industry groups that IBD tracks.Only refined petroleum products can be exported under current laws. The ban started in the 1970s as an attempt to protect Americans from price spikes caused by Middle Eastern countries and OPEC using oil as a political weapon. But with the new influx of oil from previously unreachable plays in the Dakotas and Texas, many analysts and lawmakers believe that the ban is outdated.Refiners are the biggest opponents to lifting the ban and have benefited from the discount of light crude in the U.S., sending refined products abroad at much higher prices.Valero Energy (VLO) shares fell 10.6% to 50.08.

The walkouts impacted West Coast fuel production the most, which partially caused the recent rise in gas prices in that area. In California, regular gasoline now costs an average of $3.41 a gallon, which is up nearly 26% from $2.71 a month ago.The proposed agreement includes increasing wages, maintaining current health benefits, reviewing workload assessments and involving union safety personnel at every facility, according to USW.But workers won't necessarily return to plants immediately.

BP (BP) shares rose 0.7% to 51.69.The oil boom in the U.S. hasn't done much to lower the price of gasoline at home, as U.S. prices are set on international markets.""Generally what happens is that when the price of crude goes up a dollar, the price of a gallon of gasoline will go up 2.5 cents,"" James Williams, an energy economist at WTRG, told IBD.Williams said that Iraqi production hasn't really been affected by the unrest as the violence, for now, has been centered in the northern part of the country. But if the fighting heads south to the oil-producing region, oil prices could jump by $20 per barrel, leading to a 50-cent per-gallon spike in gasoline.If Iraq's oil goes offline, Saudi Arabia can help make up some of the production but not enough to see prices drop.Still, the U.S. has other options if prices rise dramatically due to the violence.""We could release oil from the strategic supply of oil or the president could go to Congress and ask for an emergency lifting of the export ban,"" said Phil Flynn, a senior energy analyst at the Price Futures Group.Lifting the decades-old crude export ban, which was enacted to prevent spikes in oil prices at home, is a complex issue that has many supporters and opponents. Flynn believes that flooding the global market with more crude from U.S. fields will lower Brent prices, the benchmark for U.S. gasoline pricing.Flynn called the unrest in Iraq the ""most serious threat to the global oil market since the first Iraq war."" He also warned not to discount the troubles in Russia and Ukraine.""The freer the flow of oil is the better it is for everyone.""Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter at @IBD_GRich

323,VLO,"Finding and buying leading stocks are what IBD discusses the majority of the time. Yet investors can also make money selling stocks short.Granted, shorting is a whole different animal with its own set of rules. But you can reap two benefits. Learning to short will help you take advantage of down markets. It will also help you more keenly recognize correct exit points in your long trades.When you sell a stock short, you're selling something that you don't already own in hopes that the price will go down. That way, you can buy it back later at a lower price and pocket the difference.In a short sale, shares are borrowed from a broker to sell short. When you cover the position, you buy back the shares and, in effect, return them to the broker.Just as buying should only be done in an up market, investors should only sell short in a bear market.""Bear markets happen about once every three years,"" noted IBD founder and chairman William J. O'Neil in The Short Selling Home Study course. ""When they occur, the decline takes place much faster than the previous rise.""Shorting isn't for beginning investors. But with time, any disciplined trader can learn to short in order to take advantage of opportunities on the downside. While leading stocks can have long, stellar runs, they eventually do break down.Titanium Metals (TIE) was a monster winner from late 2004 to May 2006. But then the stock plunged from an all-time high of 47.63 to 4.04 by 2009. Valero Energy (VLO), another former leader, set off a short sale during the 2007-to-2009 bear market and fell more than 80%.Timing is crucial in short-selling. Investors should always consult a chart to see if a stock is in position to be shorted. While many investors would like to have shorted at the very top, shorting opportunities typically don't present themselves until the stock has already broken down.Investors can use a stock's failed late-stage base breakout to enter the short side. Those who get caught in the failed breakout from a late-stage pattern can use this action to reverse their position.When checking out a stock's price action, what may appear to be two bumps with a larger bump in the middle may actually be a head-and-shoulders formation. This is another key short-sale pattern and it takes months to develop.The correct entry arrives when the stock makes a last rebound attempt above the 50-day moving average and fails, dropping below the line in heavy trading.On Sept. 20, 1993, International Game Technology (IGT) cleared a 39.35 buy point in a late-stage cup with handle. The stock rose 5% by Sept. 29 before fizzling (1).IGT triggered the 8% sell rule Oct. 20 (2). This failed breakout not only marked a sell signal for investors that bought at 39.35, but it was also a short-sale signal. Shares slumped more than 50% by June 1994.(Editor's Note: For more education on IBD's short-selling rules and strategy, read ""The Short Side"" column, published the first Monday of most months and at Investors.com.

411,VLO,"It was a week where oil prices were buoyed by OPEC’s plans for a smaller-than-expected output raise. Meanwhile, natural gas futures again fell below the critical $3 threshold.On the news front, Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A  -  Free Report) said it has committed to the Fram gas field in the North Sea, while Canada’s Baytex Energy Corp. (BTE  -  Free Report) agreed to snap up rival Raging River Exploration Inc. for $2.3 billion. Meanwhile, Petrobras (PBR  -  Free Report) lost a wage dispute potentially costing the company 4.5 billion in U.S. dollars.Overall, it was a mixed week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained about 5.8% to close at $68.58 per barrel, natural gas prices fell some 2.6% to $2.945 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: ExxonMobil, Chevron, Transocean & More)The U.S. oil benchmark rallied after OPEC agreed to stabilize the market by making modest increase in crude output. At the Vienna meeting, top producers came together and decided to raise volumes by about 1 million barrels per day from July to make up for falling production in Venezuela.Friday’s consensus figure was well below some of the numbers that had been floated ahead of the meeting, while the actual addition is expected to be even lesser – at around 700,000 barrels a day – due to several member countries’ inability to boost exports.Earlier in the week, oil futures were buoyed by the federal government’s EIA report that showed a large draw in crude stockpiles due to strong refinery runs. Data showing a reduction in U.S. oil drilling rig count brought further upside.Meanwhile, natural gas prices moved southward last week as a larger-than-expected increase in supplies overshadowed the commodity’s growing use for air-conditioning.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Royal Dutch Shell plc recently announced its intention to forge ahead with development of the Fram natural gas field in the North Sea. Banking on improving economics and recovering energy landscape, this is notably the second North Sea project approved by the European energy giant in the past six months.Shell, along with Exxon Mobil, which is its co-partner in the Fram project, intends to produce around 13,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (comprising about 41 million cubic feet of gas along with 5,300 barrels of liquids a day) from the two wells in the Fram field by 2020. This will increase the The Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company’s output in the North Sea by 10%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Fram field, located 137 miles east of Aberdeen, will be connected using a subsea infrastructure to a processing facility, Shearwater, from which gas will be transported to the shore. Basically, the two wells will transport gas via a subsea pipeline to the Starling field, from which it will be further transported to the Shearwater platform through existing pipelines.Utilizing the existing infrastructure from the nearby hubs will result in huge cost savings associated with the development of new fields. Reduction in development costs has in fact prompted Shell to reinvest in projects in the U.K. once again. (Read more Shell Eyes Fram Project, North Sea Regains Focus)2.    Baytex Energy recently inked a $2.3 billion all-stock deal to acquire western Canadian oil explorer, Raging River Exploration Inc., in a bid to bolster its operations in Alberta’s East Duvernay Shale. Notably, it marks the biggest buyout in the Canadian oil patch this year.However, the deal failed to garner positive response from its shareholders, as evidenced by the dismal stock movement post the announcement of the merger. Shares of Baytex have dropped 11.92% to close at $3.40 on Jun 18, reflecting investors’ rough initial response toward the pricey deal. Investors are mainly concerned about the company’s intent to finance the deal by the issuance of new stocks that in turn are likely to hurt its earnings per share metrics.Baytex’s operations are mainly focused on Eagle Ford, Peace River and Lloydminster regions while Raging River’s activities are mainly concentrated in East Duvernay (where it holds 260,000 acres of land), and Viking areas. Thus, the buyout expands the geographical footprint of Baytex, creating an enviable diverse portfolio of oil assets in five core areas namely Viking, Peace River, Lloydminster and East Duvernay Shale regions in Canada, and the Eagle Ford play in Texas. (Read more Baytex to Buy Raging River: A Closer Look)3.    Petrobras recently lost a wage lawsuit when Brazil’s Labor Court voted in favor of the workers of Petrobras seeking higher wages. This is notably the biggest lawsuit that the company has faced in the Brazil’s Labor Court, which is expected to cost the company around 17 billion reals or 4.5 billion in U.S. dollars.The case is mainly centered on the Minimum Remuneration Level Regime (RMNR) policy, adopted by Petrobras in 2007. The employees argue that the payments related to special working conditions such as night shifts and hazardous working environment should not be included in the base wage calculation, which will thus lead Petrobras to make additional payment to comply with RMNR. In contrast, the company is of the opinion that such payments should be included in the base wage calculations itself.The ruling in favor of the workers is likely to result in wage increase of around 35% for 59,000 employees. Petrobras intends to appeal the decision in the Supreme Federal Court. (Read more Petrobras Loses Wage Lawsuit, to Pay $4.5 Billion)4.    Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report) recently won a U.S. Supreme Court ruling, which enabled the company to recover the profits lost due to unaccredited use of its patented technology outside the country by ION Geophysical Corporation. The ruling countermanded a previous decision from a lower court that constrained the usage of U.S. patent law abroad.The previous ruling from the lower court reduced the damage compensation by $93.4 million. The said Schlumberger technology is used for finding oil and gas under the ocean floor. The significance of the latest ruling is that it enhances the ability of the patent holders to stop rivals and other companies from using their technologies abroad. It also helps them recover profits that were lost due to unauthorized usage of its technologies.WesternGeco, a subsidiary of Schlumberger, was the one fighting the case against ION Geophysical regarding the use of four patented methods, used while conducting marine seismic survey. Notably, Schlumberger received compensation for damages caused due to the occurrence of infringement in the United States. Now the compensation basket includes the lost profits from overseas as well.

(HES  -  Free Report) reiterated the exploration potential of the Stabroek Block, following the announcement of the eighth oil discovery at the Longtail-1 well, offshore Guyana. Stabroek Block is spread across acreage of 6.6 million (26,800 square kilometers).Located about five miles west of the Turbot-1 well, the Longtail-1encountered about 256 feet (78 meters) of superior, oil-bearing sandstone reservoir. The drilling of the well commenced on May 25, 2018, using the Stena Carron drillship to reach a total depth of 18,057 feet (5,504 meters) in 6,365 feet (1,940 meters) of water.The previous outstanding discoveries on the Stabroek Block include Liza, Payara, Liza Deep, Snoek, Turbot, Ranger and Pacora. Currently, drilling results of Longtail are under appraisal. The combined gross recoverable resources of Turbot and Longtail are projected to surpass 500 million barrels of oil equivalent.

412,VLO,"It was a week where oil prices extended their recent declines but natural gas futures moved above the critical $3 threshold.On the news front, Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) announced plans to spend more than $2 billion to build a massive pipeline in the Permian Basin and smaller rival Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) started production from the second LNG unit at the Wheatstone project in Australia. Meanwhile, Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report) announced its intent to retire four rigs.Overall, it was a mixed week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost about 1% to close at $65.06 per barrel, natural gas prices rose some 4.6% to $3.022 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Devon's Asset Sale, Exxon's Brazil Win & More)The U.S. oil benchmark booked fourth weekly drop in a row on fears of supply increase, climb in domestic production, and increasing rig count.Of late, oil futures have been dragged down by reports that top suppliers Saudi Arabia and Russia are likely to step up output amid reduced supply from Iran and Venezuela.The commodity was also spooked by the federal government’s EIA report that showed production climbing to a fresh record.Data showing U.S. drillers adding oil rigs for fourth consecutive week brought further downside.Meanwhile, natural gas prices moved northward last week on warm weather forecasts that should lead to rising power sector demand.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    ExxonMobilintends to construct a pipeline in the Permian Basin, in line with its plan to allocate more than $2 billion for midstream asset expansions in the crowded shale play.The largest publicly traded integrated energy firm along with Plains All American Pipeline will likely invest billions of dollars for building a pipeline that will transport crude to the Gulf coast region from the Permian Basin.The Permian faces a dearth of pipeline capacity for transporting oil to Gulf Coast export facilities, major refinery terminals and principal hubs like Cushing. This has forced Midland operators to sell stranded oil at a big discount to that in Cushing.The latest announcement seems that ExxonMobil is following the same path to construct pipeline networks in the Permian so that explorers can boost oil production. In fact, the integrated energy firm is willing to lift Permian production three times through 2025. (Read more ExxonMobil to Construct Pipeline in Crowded Permian)2.    Chevron recently achieved a major milestone, as it started production at its second unit of the Wheatstone LNG project in Western Australia, solidifying its position as one of the biggest suppliers of natural gas to the Asian countries.The project is located 7.5 miles west of Onslow and is intended to process gas from the Wheatstone and Iago fields, both of which are operated by Chevron. The Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company holds an 80.2% interest in the offshore licenses containing the Wheatstone and Iago fields. The Wheatstone fields are estimated to contain more than 4.5 trillion cubic feet of gas deposits. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The $34-billion Wheatstone project consists of two liquefaction trains with a shipment capacity of 8.9 million metric tons of LNG per year. The first cargo from liquefaction train 1 was shipped last October, few months behind target. With the second train coming online, Chevron currently operates five LNG trains in Australia, including three at the Gorgon Project. (Read more Chevron's 2nd Train at Wheatstone LNG Project Comes Online)3.    Transocean recently announced its intention to retire four of its aging rigs —Deepwater Discovery, Deepwater Frontier, Deepwater Millennium and Songa Trym — amid continued offshore weakness. Post the announcement of its decision, the company’s shares have declined more than 3% to eventually close at $11.92 on Jun 15. In regard to this, the oilfield services player will book non-cash impairment charges of around $520 million, which will be reflected in its second-quarter results.Evidently, Transocean’s Deepwater Discovery built in 2000, has been stacked since March 2015. Likewise, Deepwater Frontier, established in 1999, is also stacked since November 2015. The company also stacked its Deepwater Millennium drillship — built in 1999 — since May 2016. The same is the case of Songa Trym — which had been added into Transocean’s portfolio as part of the acquisition of Norwegian contractor, Songa Offshore — that needs to get retired amid lack of contracts in the current scenario.Transocean has been facing pressure in its top line owing to lower contract drilling revenues from the deepwater and ultra-deepwater floaters amid reduced dayrates and weak utilization. Last September, Transocean retired six of its ultra-deepwater floaters that had been cold-stacked, booking $1.4 billion charge to cover the cost of the same. The latest retirement of the four rigs was actually quite inevitable, considering the challenging issues associated with stacking as well as the present bleak deepwater drilling scenario.

(EGC  -  Free Report) recently inked a deal, per which privately held Dallas-based operator Cox Oil Offshore LLC will acquire the former. Apart from expanding Cox’s presence in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM), the acquisition also offers Energy XXI the much-needed respite and best solution to maximize its shareholders’ value amid its distressing financials.Per the deal, Cox will buy all outstanding shares of Energy XXI for $9.10 a share, representing a 21% premium to Energy XXI’s closing share price as of Jun 15. The transaction is valued at $322 million.Energy XXI has had been going through quite a tumultuous phase since a couple of years, considering its bankruptcy filing and then successfully emerging out of it, along with a major shakeup in its leadership position.Interestingly, the latest development comes a month after the company announced its decision to offload non-core assets worth $125 million to Orinoco Natural Resources LLC, which would have ended up acquiring 35% stake in Energy XXI. Of course, negotiations with Orinoco Natural have been terminated now, due to the more profitable proposition by Cox.

The transaction, which needs to meet customary closing conditions, will likely conclude in July 2018. Through the January-to-March quarter of 2018, the to-be-divested properties produced 84 million cubic feet of natural gas every day.The sale is in line with Pioneer Natural’s focus to operate only in the Permian Basin. To become a pure play firm in the Permian, Pioneer Natural also divested certain Eagle Ford assets – spreading across 10,200 net acres. The company believes that operating on the low-cost and prospective drilling locations in the Permian Basin will help generate high cashflow for shareholders.

413,VLO,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded an unexpected weekly build as domestic oil production reached another all-time high. On a further bearish note, the report revealed that refined product inventories, gasoline and distillate, both rose from their week earlier levels.Following the negative data sets, the front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost 1.2% (or 79 cents) to $64.73 per barrel yesterday – the lowest settlement since Apr 9.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories rose by 2.1 million barrels for the week ending Jun 1, following a decrease of 3.6 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 1.3 million barrels.Soaring imports and record high domestic production led to the shock build with the world's biggest oil consumer even as refiner demand hit a five-month high.In particular, U.S. output rose by 31,000 barrels per day last week to 10.8 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983. In early February, oil production broke through the 10 million barrels a day threshold for the first time in nearly 50 years and has maintained the record levels thereafter.Despite last week’s increase, oil inventories have generally trended lower in a year and a half. In fact, stockpiles have shrunk in 41 of the last 61 weeks and are down more than 75 million barrels in the past year. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 436.6 million barrels, current crude supplies are 15% below the year-ago period and are in the bottom half of the average range during this time of the year.Moreover, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – fell 955,000 barrels to 34.6 million barrels.The crude supply cover was down from 26 days in the previous week to 25.8 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 29.7 days.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies were up a third week in a row as demand weakened. The 4.6 million barrels gain – defying the polled number of 600,000 barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 239 million barrels. Following last week’s addition, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product inched closer to the year-earlier level and it is in the top half of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) went up 2.2 million barrels last week, significantly ahead of analysts’ expectations for 700,000 barrels increase in supply level. The weekly rise could be attributed to lower demand. At 116.8 million barrels, current supplies are 22.7% below the year-ago level and are in the lower half of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 1.5% from the prior week to 95.4%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.The data from EIA generally acts as a catalyst for crude prices and affect producers, such as ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), and refiners such as Valero Energy (VLO  -  Free Report), Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) and Marathon Petroleum (MPC  -  Free Report).Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?If you are looking for a near-term energy play, Wildhorse Resource Development Corporation (WRD  -  Free Report) may be an excellent selection.

414,VLO,"It was a week where oil prices tumbled to their lowest levels since April. However, natural gas futures edged closer to the psychologically important $3 level.On the news front, energy biggie Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) outlined plans to double earnings by 2025 in its annual meeting and European peer Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) announced early production start-up at the Kaikias subsea development in the Gulf of Mexico. Meanwhile, Pedro Parente abruptly resigned from the position of CEO of Brazil’s Petrobras (PBR  -  Free Report).Overall, it was another mixed week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost about 3.1% to close at $65.81 per barrel, natural gas prices edged up some 0.8% to $2.962 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Shell's GoM Find, Cheniere's FID on Train 3 & More)The U.S. oil benchmark slumped for the second week on fears of supply increase, bearish EIA inventory numbers, and soaring rig count.Oil futures fell after reports emerged that Saudi Arabia and Russia were in discussion to step up output amid reduced supply from Iran and Venezuela.The commodity was also spooked by the federal government’s EIA report that revealed increases in refined product inventories - gasoline and distillate. On a further bearish note, the report revealed that U.S. output edged up 44,000 barrels per day last week to 10.77 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983.Data showing the number of U.S. oil rigs climbing – this time by 2 following a large increase of 15 last week – brought further downside.Meanwhile, natural gas prices moved northward last week. Apart from the weekly inventory release showing a smaller-than-expected increase in natural gas supplies, the commodity got a leg up from rising power sector demand.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    In its annual meeting, ExxonMobil Corporation announced its intention to increase earnings by more than two-fold by 2025 and address the risks of climate change.ExxonMobil’s plan will be especially aided by lower-cost-of-supply investments in U.S. tight oil, deepwater and liquefied natural gas (LNG). This will be backed by a group of industry-leading technologies comprising advanced seismology, integrated reservoir modeling and data analytics.ExxonMobil plans to boost tight oil production by fivefold in the U.S. Permian Basin. The company will also bring online 25 projects globally that will add volumes of more than 1 million oil-equivalent barrels per day. About 10 billion oil-equivalent barrels was added to its resource base in 2017 in locations including the Permian, Guyana, Mozambique, Papua New Guinea and Brazil.Recently, the company announced plans to reduce greenhouse emission by 2020. ExxonMobil targets a 15% cut in methane emissions and a 25% deduction in flaring from levels in 2016. Since 2000, the company has spent more than $9 billion on lower-emission energy solutions that have enabled it to achieve 10% improvement in energy efficiency across global refining operations. (Read more ExxonMobil Chalks Out Plans to More Than Double Earnings)2.    Royal Dutch Shell has been making a remarkable progress in forging ahead with its deepwater projects of late. The European oil giant recently announced that the first phase of its deepwater Kaikias project in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) has become functional and that too one year prior to the scheduled date. The first phase of the project is expected to produce up to 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.The Kaikias project is a joint venture undertaken by Shell and MOEX North America, a subsidiary of Tokyo-based Mitsui Oil Exploration Co. Shell holds 80% operating interest in the project, while the remaining 20% stake is held by MOEX North America. Kaikias is estimated to hold more than 100 million barrels of oil equivalent and the project is set to develop in two phases.Shell took the final investment decision (FID) on the project in March 2017 and has been betting on cost and technology efficiencies to make the project more competitive since then. Notably, it has managed to lower the cost of Kaikias by 30% since the FID on the project. Simplified well designs, along with utilization of the existing oil/gas processing equipment and subsea umbilicals brought down the costs. While the total cost of the project has not been disclosed; Shell expects to push breakeven oil prices lower than $30 per barrel.3.    Petrobras’s shares declined more than 20% in the mid-day trading to eventually close at $10.13 (14.6% down) on Jun 1, after the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s CEO Pedro Parente stepped down from his position. Following his resignation, the Brazilian real also weakened against the dollar, sparking fear over the country’s economy. The CEO’s resignation came in the wake of the nationwide trucker strike in Brazil, which had strangled the country’s economy for more than a week. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.In an attempt to resolve the truckers’ strike in Brazil, the government intervened on May 23 to temporarily lower diesel prices at the pump by 10% along with freezing the prices for 60 days.Parente believed that the strike had challenged the implemented pricing policy, which is depicted in a statement during his resignation. Per the statement, his role “as CEO had stopped being positive and the government needed to consider alternatives to its pricing policy going forward”.Ivan Monteiro will be serving as the interim CEO after Parente’s resignation. Monteiro has been the CFO of Petrobras since 2015, supervising the company’s successful debt-reduction attempts. He had also led the initial public offering of the company’s fuel-distribution unit, Petrobras Distribuidora S.A. that managed to raise $1.5 billion.

(NOV  -  Free Report) recently agreed to acquire a Dutch rig design and engineering company, GustoMSC. The deal is expected to enable Houston, TX-based National Oilwell to expand its equipment-providing business to the upstream companies. The financial details of the deal are yet to be disclosed.GustoMSC’s designs are present in 10% of the jackup fleet and 8% of the floater fleet, both of which are currently active globally. Hence, the acquisition strengthens equipment provider, National Oilwell’s hold in the offshore industry. Moreover, with the recent improvement in the oil-price environment, the deep-water energy sector is expected to bounce back, making National Oilwell’s move even more profitable in the coming days.Additionally, the acquisition is expected to help the company enhance its jack up equipment, geophysical gear transporting skids and other vessels, with the services designed to broaden its portfolio. The move boosts National Oilwell’s supply chain and is considered as a vertical integration. Furthermore, along with providing offshore oil and gas services, GustoMSC also serves the wind markets.(Read more Is National Oilwell's GustoMSC Acquisition Beneficial?)5.    Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report) recently decided to break the OneLNG joint venture (JV) with Golar LNG Limited, primarily due to financial delays. The JV was created to develop the offshore Fortuna LNG project in Equatorial Guinea, in association with Ophir Energy Plc. The project is located in the Block R, operated by Ophir.Although the development plan of the project was ready way back, finding attractive debt financing for the project and finalizing on the investment decision got delayed. The JV was created in July 2016, in which Schlumberger holds 49% stake. The JV holds 66.2% interest in the Joint Operating Company — which was created to develop the offshore Fortuna FLNG project — and Ophir owns the rest of the stake. The total cost of the Fortuna project is anticipated to be around $2.1 billion.With oil price on the rise, the profitability of the project has increased. Yet, the final investment decision failed to meet the previously announced timelines. Focusing on the project would only block Schlumberger’s resources, which the company can use in other projects.

415,VLO,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded its largest weekly draw since 2016. The massive 12.6 million barrels dip pushed storage levels to their lowest since February 2015, while keeping them under the five-year average. Despite the record decline, U.S. benchmark crude futures lost as much as 5% (or $3.73) to $70.38 per barrel Wednesday – the worst daily slump in 13 months. The front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures further edged down to $70.33 at yesterday’s close.The price plunge could be attributed to fears of supply resumption from Libya and escalating trade conflict between the United States and China.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 12.6 million barrels for the week ending Jul 6, following a shock increase of 1.2 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 4.8 million barrels.Steep decline in imports, partly due to an outage at Syncrude facility in Canada, led to the massive stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consumer even as domestic production remains at 10.9 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983.Oil inventories have generally trended lower in a year and a half. In fact, stockpiles have shrunk in 45 of the last 66 weeks and are down more than 90 million barrels in the past year. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 405.2 million barrels, current crude supplies are 18% below the year-ago figure and 4% under the five-year average.Moreover, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – plunged 2.1 million barrels to 25.7 million barrels.The crude supply cover was down from 23.7 days in the previous week to 22.90 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 29.0 days.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies were down for the second week. The 694,000 barrels draw – below the polled number of one million barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles down to 239 million barrels. Following last week’s decline, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product is now 1.4% above the year-earlier level and is 6% over the five-year range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) went up 4.1 million barrels last week, ahead of analysts’ expectations for 1.7 million barrels increase in supply level. The fourth successive weekly rise could be attributed to lower demand. At 121.7 million barrels, current supplies are 21% below the year-ago level and 12% lower than the five-year average.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was down by 0.4% from the prior week to 96.7%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products.

417,VLO,"It was a week where both oil and natural gas finished lower.On the news front, Enbridge Inc. (ENB  -  Free Report) struck a pact to unload its Canadian natural gas gathering and processing businesses C$4.31 billion ($3.3 billion), while Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) plans to put most of its oil and gas fields in the ageing North Sea for sale.Overall, it wasn’t a good week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures edged down 0.5% to close at $73.80 per barrel, natural gas prices fell around 2.3% to $2.858 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: BP, Baker Hughes, EQT & More)The U.S. crude benchmark slipped for the first time in three weeks following a shock build in domestic inventories and rise in the oil drilling rig count. President Donald Trump’s tweet demanding action by OPEC to calm rising oil prices also played spoilsport.Meanwhile, natural gas prices moved southward last week following a larger-than-expected increase in supplies.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Enbridge Inc. is expected to raise C$4.31 billion ($3.3 billion) from the divestiture of its Canadian natural gas gathering and processing (G&P) business to Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P.The assets include G&P units in the Montney, Peace River Arch, Horn River and Liard basins in British Columbia and Alberta. The G&P units have a total operating capacity of 3.3 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) and 3,550 kilometer of natural gas gathering pipelines. It comprises 19 natural gas processing plants and liquids handling facilities.The proceeds from this transaction will help Enbridge pare its C$61.2 billion debt load that it assumed following last year’s Spectra Energy buy. The latest deal takes the company’s divestments to C$7.5 billion for this year – significantly above the targeted C$3 billion.2.    Chevron is set to put up many of its North Sea oil and gas assets for sale, in a bid to streamline portfolio. The assets it intends to offload include Britannia and its satellites, along with Alba, Alder, Captain, Elgin/Franklin and Erskine fields. The move is part of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) Chevron’s strategic review of global portfolio to determine the competitiveness of all its projects. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The decision seems to be a prudent one as extracting oil from North Sea is not so economical because production costs are much higher than the returns. Even other biggies like Bp plc and Royal Dutch Shell plc have jettisoned their non-core assets in the region. Early last year, Shell offloaded a large chunk of its North Sea assets to smaller rival Chrysaor Holdings Ltd. for $3.8 billion. BP also divested 25% of stake in the Magnus Field to EnQuest PLC.Notably, output from North Sea accounts for just about 3% of Chevron’s total production, providing around 50,000 barrels of oil and 155 million cubic feet of natural gas a day. Instead, the company wants to sharpen its focus on the lucrative shale exploration in Permian, along with some of its major projects in the Gulf of Mexico and Kazakhstan. (Read more Chevron to Put North Sea Assets on Sale, Optimize Portfolio)3.    Core Laboratories N.V.’s (CLB  -  Free Report) shares declined more than 13.5% to eventually close at $112.66 on Jul 2, after the company downwardly revised its second-quarter 2018 outlook amid deferred international activities.In its first-quarter report, the company forecast second-quarter earnings of around 64-68 cents per share. However, a delay in the recovery of international oilfield development activities has compelled the company to cut its guidance. Hence, it now expects total revenues in the band of $174-$175 million against the prior guided range of $177-$179 million. It now anticipates EPS within 57-58 cents.Core Laboratories’ Reservoir Description unit will bear the brunt of reduced revenues as most (almost 85%) of the segment’s income is based on international activity levels. Delayed activities in the North Sea, Middle East and Asia-Pacific regions as well as the Gulf of Mexico will impact its revenues.Higher ramp-up costs related to deployment of new laboratory technology and infrastructure are also expected to hurt the segment’s operating income. (Read more Core Labs Slashes Q2 Guidance, Shares Plunge 13.6%)4.    National Oilwell Varco, Inc.

418,VLO,"This Memorial Day subtropical storm Alberto is expected to hit north in the Gulf of Mexico, hitting Mississippi to Florida and affecting offshore energy production. Onshore energy production is also expected to be affected due to high flooding risks. The storm is expected to have a top wind speed of 65 miles (105 kilometers) per hour (mph), which is below the hurricane level of 74 mph. The storm is anticipated to make landfall along Florida Panhandle.What’s at Stake?Several energy producers in the region have taken safety measures and evacuated their offshore facilities. Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report), the world’s largest publicly traded energy major, has withdrawn its non-essential personnel from Gulf of Mexico’s Lena production platform. However, the company expects production at its site to remain unaffected. To ensure uninterrupted production, Exxon has transferred its offshore operations’ control to a control room on land from Mobile Bay, AL.Another oil major BP p.l.c. (BP  -  Free Report) is also continuing with its offshore operations, keeping the workers prepared for emergencies. The company is closely monitoring the storm.

419,VLO,"A smart beta exchange traded fund, the Guggenheim Multi-Asset Income ETF (CVY  -  Free Report) debuted on 09/21/2006, and offers broad exposure to the Total Market (U.S.) ETFs category of the U.S. equity market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?Market cap weighted indexes were created to reflect the market, or a specific segment of the market, and the ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on this strategy.Market cap weighted indexes offer a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns, and are a good option for investors who believe in market efficiency.On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.By attempting to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, non-cap weighted indexes are based on certain fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such.Methodologies like equal-weighting, one of the simplest options out there, fundamental weighting, and volatility/momentum based weighting are all choices offered to investors in this space, but not all of them can deliver superior returns.Fund Sponsor & IndexThe fund is managed by Invesco, and has been able to amass over $294.75 M, which makes it one of the larger ETFs in the Total Market (U.S.) ETFs. Before fees and expenses, this particular fund seeks to match the performance of the Zacks Multi-Asset Income Index.The Zacks Multi-Asset Income Index is comprised of approximately 125 to 150 stocks selected, based on a multi-factor proprietary model, from a universe of domestic and international companies, including U.S.-listed common stocks, ADRs paying dividends, REITs, MLPs, closed-end funds and traditional preferred stocks.Cost & Other ExpensesCost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same.Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.79% for CVY, making it on par with most peer products in the space.CVY's 12-month trailing dividend yield is 3.96%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.When you look at individual holdings, Valero Energy Corp (VLO  -  Free Report) accounts for about 1.35% of the fund's total assets, followed by Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) and Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (HST  -  Free Report).CVY's top 10 holdings account for about 11.7% of its total assets under management.Performance and RiskCVY has gained about 1.38% so far this year, and as of 06/14/2018, is up roughly 10.38% in the last one year. In the past 52-week period, the fund has traded between $20.64 and $23.39.CVY has a beta of 0.86 and standard deviation of 12.73% for the trailing three-year period. With about 149 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.

420,VLO,"It was a week where both oil and gas prices logged gains.On the news front, integrated majors ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) earmarked their growth actions in respective annual analyst meetings. Meanwhile, energy explorer Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report) announced a new $1 billion share repurchase program.Overall, it was a good week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained about 1.3% to close at $62.04 per barrel, while natural gas prices increased 1.4% to $2.732 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Marathon's Libya Sale, SeaDrill's Restructuring, Canadian Natural's Q4 & More)Oil rebounded from its mid-week slump, with the U.S. benchmark rising more than 1%. The commodity declined in earlier sessions after the Energy Department's inventory release revealed that crude stockpiles recorded another weekly build. Crude was further pressured by soaring U.S. production, wherein output rose to 10.4 million barrels per day -- the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983.However, a strong jobs report, falling U.S. oil rig count and news of more countries likely to be excluded from Trump administration’s planned tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, helped turn things around. Oil’s recovery was further facilitated by weakness in the U.S. dollar and reduced geopolitical fears on the back of reports that President Trump has agreed to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.Meanwhile, natural gas prices moved higher last week on strong demand and a supportive weather outlook.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    ExxonMobil has outlined its growth strategy, which intends to more than double earnings and cash flow from operations by 2025 based on current oil prices. Per the growth plans, the company expects earnings of $31 billion by 2025, up more than 100% from last year’s adjusted profit of $15 billion. The figure does not include the impact of U.S. tax reform and impairments.ExxonMobil has set capital spending at $24 billion for 2018, $28 billion for 2019 and $30 billion from 2023 to 2025, to meet its target to achieve high growth. However, its peers including Chevron are cutting down on spending and keeping budgets unchanged.Darren W. Woods, chairman and chief executive officer of ExxonMobil, also emphasized that the plan estimates double-digit rates of return in all three segments of ExxonMobil’s business — upstream, downstream and chemical.Overall, ExxonMobil’s growth strategy aims to fully leverage competitive advantages to boost shareholder value in three of its world-class businesses. The increased investments are expected to enhance and boost returns on capital employed to about 15% by 2025.(Read more ExxonMobil's Growth Strategies to Double Earnings by 2025)2.    Chevron recently issued a statement at its latest annual analyst day, bringing in pleasant news for its investors. The California-based supermajor highlighted its commitment toward dividend growth as its top priority. It also laid emphasis on prudent reinvestment in the business, strengthening of financials and cash flow generation. It updated its guidance related to capex, production, margins and other details along with emphasizing on its growing free cash flows.While dividend growth remains the topmost priority for management, Chevron still emphasizes the need of operational efficiency and capital discipline to strengthen its cash flows. The company now plans to spend $18-$20 billion per annum through the end of the decade versus the prior guidance of $17-$22 billion per annum.Despite the capital discipline, the supermajor forecasts a year-over-year increase in net production of 4-7% in 2018, with 2-3% output gain from the base and shale/tight oil assets. This compares with the 5% net production growth achieved by the company in 2017 on a yearly basis.Chevron also targets asset disposal worth $5-$10 billion through 2018-2020 in an attempt to exit the non-core holdings and strengthen its cash flows. The company also plans to tap strategic acquisition opportunities to streamline and high grade its portfolio, thereby increasing shareholder value. (Read more: Chevron Sets Dividend Growth & Other Priorities for 2018)3.    Hess announced a new share repurchase plan after receiving authorization from its board of directors. Through 2018, the explorer will likely buy back shares worth $1 billion. Late 2017, the company declared a $500-million stock buyback plan. The recent announcement reflects the firm’s strong commitment toward returning cash back to stockholders on a regular basis.The company foresees higher oil and gas production which when combined with healthy oil prices will likely boost cashflow. Hess added that with the new buyback program, it will not compromise with its potential to invest in key developments like Guyana and Bakken.Earlier, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company had announced that majority of its 2018 capital budget will likely get allotted toward low-cost resources in Bakken and projects located off the coast of Guyana. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Overall, with the robust business outlook, the management might think the company’s shares are undervalued and hence is the right time to boost share buyback.(Read more Hess Boosts Buyback Plan on Favorable Business Scenario)4.    Devon Energy Corp. (DVN  -  Free Report) announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to sell the southern portion of its Barnett Shale position for $553 million. This deal is part of the company’s plan to divest more than $5 billion of its non-core assets in the next three years under its Vision 2020 initiative. The transaction is subject to customary terms and conditions and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018.The assets, which are earmarked for monetization, are currently averaging 200 million cubic feet of gas-equivalent per day. Combined with other recent asset divestitures announced by the company, it has already announced to sell non-core assets worth $1 billion.In 2018, Devon Energy plans to lower $1.5 billion of its outstanding debt to strengthen its balance sheet and lower interest expenses. Devon Energy might utilize the sale of proceeds from Barnett Shale to lower its outstanding debt level.The strategy to divest non-core assets is actually helping Devon Energy to concentrate on its high-margin oil production region. The company will in turn utilize the cash flow to lower its existing debts levels, and work to increase shareholders’ value through share buybacks and dividend growth. (Read more Devon Divests Non-Core Assets in Barnett for $533M)5.    Eni SpA (E  -  Free Report) has agreed to divest 10% of its stake in the Shorouk concession, offshore Egypt, to a wholly owned subsidiary of Mubadala Investment Company, Mubadala Petroleum. Eni will generate about $934 million from this sale.Eni currently holds 60% stake in the Shorouk concession through its subsidiary, IEOC. Other partners are Rosneft and BP plc with the respective 30% and 10% interests in the concession. The transaction’s closure is subject to fulfillment of certain standard conditions including all essential authorizations from Egyptian authorities.The super-giant gas field of Zohr is also located at the Shorouk concession, producing 400 million standard cubic feet per day. It was brought online in December 2017 within 28 months after its discovery. The yield from Zohr is expected to eventually reach the plateau by the end of 2019. In 2018, Zohr is likely to add 70,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for Eni.The deal is in line with Eni’s dual exploration strategy, via which, the company seeks to farm out stakes in the fields it operates so as to raise cash for financing future development as well as meting out dividends.  (Read more Eni to Divest 10% in the Shorouk Concession for $934M)Price PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of some the major oil and gas players over the past week and during the last 6 months.CompanyLast Week Last 6 MonthsXOM-0.9%-5.4%CVX+4.6%+3.8%COP+2.2%+21.9%OXY-3%+5.1%SLB+5.5%+2.5%RIG+2.2%+12.6%VLO+3.9%+32%ANDV+12.2%-3.3%In line with the week’s positive oil market sentiment, the Energy Select Sector SPDR – a popular way to track energy companies – generated a +2.7% return last week.

421,VLO,"It was a week where both oil and gas prices logged gains.On the news front, upstream energy biggies Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report) and Devon Energy Corp. (DVN  -  Free Report) came up with their respective earnings reports, while natural gas operator EQT Corp. (EQT  -  Free Report) announced plans to separate its midstream business into a new publicly traded company.Overall, it was a good week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained about 3.3% to close at $63.55 per barrel, while natural gas prices increased 3.9% to $2.657 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Occidental, Williams, Marathon Report Strong Q4)The U.S. oil benchmark scored its second consecutive weekly bump. The major catalyst was the Energy Department's inventory release, which revealed that crude stockpiles recorded a surprise drop.Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 35 of the last 46 weeks and are down more than 110 million barrels since April last year. The gradual fall – stemming from a combination of lower imports and spiraling exports – has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 420.5 million barrels, current crude supplies are 18.9% below the year-ago period.Meanwhile, natural gas prices moved higher last week following a larger-than-expected decrease in supplies. The improvement was primarily on account of strength in the commodity’s production amid the upcoming conclusion to the winter heating season.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Concho Resources reported strong fourth-quarter results on the back of higher commodity price realizations and robust production growth. The independent energy explorer came out with net earnings per share of 66 cents, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents. The bottom line also improved significantly from the prior-year quarter adjusted income of 20 cents per share.Concho Resources' average quarterly volume increased 28% year over year to 211 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (exceeding the high-end of the company’s guidance range), of which 61.6% was liquids. Overall, the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company fetched $40.18 per barrel compared with $34.70 a year ago. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Concho Resources has provided a preliminary guidance for 2018. The company expects its total production to grow 16-20%, with crude oil growth about 20%. The upstream player forecasts its output to grow at 20% CAGR over the 2017-2020 timeframe. Capital expenditures for 2018 are estimated to be around $2 billion. (Read more Concho's Q4 Earnings Top on Price, Output Gains)2.    Devon Energy reported fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of 38 cents, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 60 cents by 36.7%. The underperformance primarily stemmed from an accounting change and lower-than-expected production volumes, partly offset by higher realized prices.In the fourth quarter of 2017, total production touched 548,000 barrels of oil equivalent (Boe) per day. The actual production was lower than the expected range of 551,000-571,000 Boe per day. Meanwhile, realized oil prices in the quarter were $42.21 per barrel, up 20.9% from $34.90 per barrel in the year-ago quarter. Realized prices for natural gas were up 11.2% to $2.48 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) from $2.23 per Mcf in the prior-year quarter.Devon estimates total production from its assets in the first quarter of 2018 in the range of 530,000-554,000 Boe per day. Full-year production is expected in the range of 552,000-576,000 Boe per day. Capital expenditure (capex) in the first quarter of 2018 is anticipated within $585-$700 million. 2018 capex is expected in the range of $2.33-$2.61 billion.(Read more Devon's Q4 Earnings Lag Estimates, Expands Reserves)3.    Natural gas producer EQT Corporation’s board of directors has finally succumbed to months of pressure from investors and agreed to separate the company's upstream and midstream businesses. It will form an independent publicly traded company (NewCo), whose operations will focus on the midstream businesses of EQT. The deal is devised to be tax-free for the company's shareholders, who will retain their EQT shares and receive a pro-rata share of the NewCo.The spin-off is expected to enable the company to concentrate on its upstream assets, and exploration and production business. The deal will leave EQT with 680,000 core Marcellus acres and 65,000 Ohio Utica acres.With the shale production to ramp up in the coming quarters, this move can help the company benefit largely through efficient allocation of capital, compared with the previous company set-up that constrained the company's returns in the recent years. Additionally, $2.3-$2.8 billion of free cash flow over the 2019-2023 timeframe is expected to trickle down from the move, which forecasts 10-15% annual production growth. (Read more Will EQT's Spin-Off of Midstream Businesses Prove Beneficial?)4.    U.S. energy firm Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter earnings per share – excluding one-time items – of 33 cents, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 21 cents. The bottom line also turned around from the year-ago adjusted loss of 6 cents. The outperformance stems from higher oil realizations, and lower cost.The production of oil and natural gas (excluding divested assets and non-controlling interests) averaged 362,251 oil-equivalent barrels per day (BOE/d) (68% liquids), essentially flat from last year. The company aims to grow production by 7-13% in the next year. The average realized crude oil price during the fourth quarter was $58.36 per barrel, representing an increase of 23.1% from the year-ago realization of $47.39.Apache’s fourth quarter lease operating expenses totaled $334 million, down 10.9% from the year-ago quarter. Moreover, total costs and expenses fell 16.4% from the fourth quarter of 2016 to $1,308 million. (Read more: Apache Posts Q4 Earnings Beat on Oil Price, Cost Cuts)5.    U.S. gas exporter Cheniere Energy, Inc. (LNG  -  Free Report) reported strong fourth-quarter results on robust production volumes and strong pricing. The company’s net income per share came in at 54 cents, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 49 cents and the comparable 2016 period profit of 48 cents.During the quarter, the company shipped 70 cargoes from Sabine Pass liquefied natural gas terminal in Louisiana. Total volumes lifted in the reported quarter were 252 trillion British thermal units.Overall costs and expenses soared 190% to $1,305 million from the same quarter last year. The increase is mainly attributed to the higher cost of sales which jumped to $980 million compared with $229 million in the prior-year quarter, while operating and maintenance expenses rose 87.7% year-over-year to $137 million.Cheniere Energy raised its EBITDA guidance for full-year 2018 following the better-than-expected profit. The upbeat forecast reflects higher-than-anticipated realized margins on marketing volumes. The adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be between $2,000 million and $2,200 million, compared to the prior guidance of anything between $1,900 million and $2,100 million.Meanwhile, distributable cash flow is likely to be between $200 million and $400 million, in line with the previous prediction.

422,VLO,"Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report) recently announced that its UK-based subsidiary, Valero Logistics UK Ltd, has agreed to acquire the SemLogistics Milford Haven fuel storage facility from SemGroup Corp. (SEMG  -  Free Report), which is located on Wales' west coast. Valero struck the deal with SemGroup Corporation's subsidiary, SemGroup Europe Holding L.L.C. With a storage capacity of 8.5 million barrels, the Milford Haven facility is one of the largest in the United Kingdom. It stores crudes, diesel, gasoline, gasoline blendstocks, gas oil, jet fuel and naphtha. The company expects the deal to close in the July-September quarter of 2018.Valero wants to retain the present employees in the facility, who can bring further expertise in their operations. Although the financial details of the deal are yet to be disclosed, Valero will make earn-out payments to SemGroup if it can reach certain revenue goals in the four years following the deal closure.How Will Valero Benefit?The storage facility is located near Valero's Pembroke refinery and expected to complement its operations in the U.K. and Ireland. Additionally, more than 67% of the storage volume is multiproduct that can provide the acquirer flexibility to meet clients' demands in the European region. Moreover, Valero announced that SemLogistics Milford Haven will keep serving as a third-party storage facility, benefiting third-party clients in Europe.Valero’s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Joe Gorder said, “This purchase demonstrates Valero’s commitment to Wales and the UK, and it aligns with our strategy to grow the logistics business and reduce secondary costs.”The deal is also expected to provide Valero with stable and predictable cash flows in the long term. Of the total 2017 revenues of the company, only 1% came from the Storage & Other category.The deal is also in line with SemGroup Corporation’s strategy to divest its non-core assets. The company is expected to use the proceeds from the deal to fund its capital growth projects.About ValeroSan Antonio, TX-based Valero is one of the largest independent refiner and marketer of petroleum products in the United States. It has a refining capacity of 3.1 million barrels per day across 15 refineries located throughout the United States, Canada and the Caribbean. Valero is also a leading ethanol producer with 11 ethanol plants in the Midwest that have a combined capacity of 1.45 billion gallons per year.Majority of the company’s refining plants are located in the Gulf coast area from where there is an easy access to the export facilities. This Gulf coast presence has helped Valero to increase its export volumes over the last few years.We are concerned about the company’s escalating debt level over the past two years.

423,VLO,"It was a week where the price of oil rallied. However, natural gas futures were down slightly.On the news front, energy biggies Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY  -  Free Report), The Williams Companies, Inc. (WMB  -  Free Report) and Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report) came up with strong earnings reports.  Overall, it was a mixed week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained about 4.2% to close at $61.68 per barrel, while natural gas prices lost 1% to $2.558 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Earnings Beats & Dividend Hikes from Total, Anadarko & Suncor)The U.S. oil benchmark recorded its second increase in five weeks. The major catalyst was the Energy Department's inventory release, which revealed that crude stockpiles recorded a lower-than-expected weekly build. A tumbling dollar – that made the greenback-priced crude more affordable for investors holding foreign currency – provided further support.Meanwhile, natural gas prices dropped last week despite a larger-than-expected decrease in supplies. The decline was primarily on account of strength in the commodity’s production Investors were also spooked by forecasts of warmer weather, leading to the heating fuel’s tepid demand.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Houston-based energy explorer Occidental Petroleum reported fourth-quarter 2017 earnings of 41 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. In the year-ago quarter, the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company had posted a loss of 13 cents. The outperformance was owing to improvement in worldwide sales volume and realized price of oil and natural gas liquids. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Occidental Petroleum’s average daily net oil, liquids and gas production volume increased to 621,000 barrels of oil equivalents per day (boe/d) from 583,000 boe/d reported in the year-ago quarter. This increase could be attributed to increased drilling activity and well productivity in the Permian Resources region.Occidental Petroleum’s proved reserves at the end of 2017 were 2.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent, out of which 60% is located in the United States and the rest in other international locations. Finding and development costs (F&D) were $8.53 per BOE in 2017 compared with $9.65 per BOE in 2016.

The bottom line improved from the prior-year figure of 17 cents per share. Better year-over-year results can be attributed to absence of impairment charges associated with equity method investments and favorable changes in the income tax provision.During the reported quarter, Williams Companies’ capital expenditure was $699 million. As of Dec 31, 2017, the company had cash and cash equivalents of 899 million compared with $170 million in the year ago quarter. Long-term debt of the company was $20,434 million, representing a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 67.9%.The company issued a preliminary guidance for 2018, wherein it anticipates the net income from its major segment Williams Partners to be within the range of $1.5-$1.7 billion range.  Williams Companies expects the annual dividend growth rate of 10-15% for 2018 and 2019, with the dividend-coverage ratio of 1.35x.(Read more Williams Companies Q4 Earnings in Line, Sales Top)3.    Upstream energy firm Marathon Oil posted fourth-quarter adjusted income of 7 cents per share, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 2 cents. In the year-earlier quarter, the company incurred adjusted loss of 10 cents. The strong numbers came thanks to higher production and the recovery in crude prices. In particular, total quarterly output rose 12% year over year to 383,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day (BOE/d).The company’s exploration expenses for the quarter came at $57 million, higher than $34 million in the year-earlier quarter. Moreover, Marathon Oil’s total quarterly cost and expenses rose 7.3% to 1,174 million.During the year, Marathon Oil spent $2,100 million on capital programs, in line with its guidance. The company announced a 2018 capital program of $2,300 million, with 90% of the outlay earmarked for high return U.S. resource plays.Marathon Oil expects first-quarter 2018 United States E&P output available for sale in the range of 265,000–275,000 BOE/d and International E&P output in the range of 105,000–115,000 BOE/d. For the full year, Marathon Oil forecasts sale-ready output from the combined United States and International E&P segments to average 390,000 to 410,000 net BOE/d.

The prime reservoir of the project – discovered in March 2015 – holds approximately 1.5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.BP was able to start production from the Atoll field seven months before it was planned. Moreover, the company was successful in reducing the operating cost of the upstream project by 33% from its initial projection. BP’s daily oil and natural gas production from the field currently stands at 10,000 barrels and 350 million cubic feet, respectively.Investors should know that Atoll Phase One project is the first key upstream development of BP, having initiated operations in 2018. During 2016 and 2017, BP managed to bring 13 key developments online, which already boosted the company’s daily production by more than 500,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BoE). The firm believes that all these major projects might help reach its target worth 900,000 BoE of daily new output by 2021. (Read more BP Commences Oil & Natural Gas Production From Atoll Field)5.    Energy giant ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report) recently agreed to divest its 50% stake in the Scarborough gas field offshore Western Australia to Woodside Petroleum Ltd for $744 million. The gas field is located in the Carnarvon Basin.The divestment can shrink ExxonMobil's risky asset portfolio and give an opportunity to focus on comparatively cheaper offshore liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) prospects in Papua New Guinea, Mozambique and others.Moreover, the company was of the opinion that the economic development of the gas field involved a few challenges like water depth, resource characteristics and execution complexities. With production unlikely to start before 2025, short-run payoff from the field is not available.Additionally, offshore drilling is excessively expensive that might dent the company’s cash flow. The Scarborough project’s overall estimated cost was $9.7 billion. ExxonMobil’s move is likely to enable the company to improve its cash flow situation.

Moreover, wider spreads between domestic sweet crude oil and Brent contributed to growth.Ethanol gross operating income increased to $45 million from $22 million in the year-ago quarter and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $34.86 million. The upside was led by higher distillate margins in most regions.Gross operating income from the VLP segment was $84 million compared with $70 million in the prior-year quarter and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $80 million.

426,VLO,"It was a week where oil prices ended above $70-a-barrel and natural gas futures got a lift from the U.S. supply data.On the news front, energy biggies Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY  -  Free Report), Cheniere Energy, Inc. (LNG  -  Free Report) and Petrobras (PBR  -  Free Report) came up with strong earnings reports.Overall, it was a good week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained about 1.4% to close at $70.70 per barrel, while natural gas prices rose some 3.5% to $2.806 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: BP & EOG's Q1, Marathon-Andeavor Deal & More)The U.S. oil benchmark hit a new three-and-a-half-year high last week on bullish EIA inventory numbers and a looming drop in Iranian crude exports.The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude stockpiles recorded a fall of 2.2 million barrels, the first increase in three weeks, and significantly larger than expected. On a further bullish note, the report revealed that refined product inventories, gasoline and distillate, both dropped from their week earlier levels.The commodity was also supported by President Trump’s recent withdrawal from a nuclear deal with OPEC’s third-largest producer Iran and a pledge to reimpose sanctions on Tehran. The action has stoked worries about an expected cut in Iranian oil exports by around 1 million barrels per day from current levels and lead to a supply shortage in an already ‘tight’ oil market.Natural gas prices also moved northward last week following a smaller-than-expected increase in supplies. Stockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states rose by 89 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended May 4, below the guidance (of 92 Bcf gain) as per the analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts, a leading independent commodities and energy data provider.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Houston-based energy explorer Occidental Petroleum reported first-quarter 2018 earnings of 92 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 29.6%. The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s outperformance was owing to improvement in worldwide sales volume and realized price of oil and natural gas liquids. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Occidental Petroleum’s average daily net oil, liquids and gas production volume increased to 609,000 barrels of oil equivalents per day (BOE/d) from 584,000 boe/d reported in the year-ago quarter. This increase could be attributed to increased drilling activity and well productivity in the Permian Resources region. Realized prices for crude oil in the first quarter increased 24.5% year over year to $61.04 per barrel worldwide, while realized NGL prices increased 17.4%.Occidental Petroleum expects second-quarter production to be in the range of 628,000-648,000 BOE/d and Permian Resources production within 188,000-198,000 BOE/d. The company expects 2018 production between 645,000 and 665,000 BOE/d, up from the prior expected range of 640,000-665,000 BOE/d. Occidental expects 2018 Permian Resources production in the range of 198,000-210,000 BOE/d, up from the prior guidance of 195,000-209,000 BOE/d. (Read more Occidental Q1 Earnings Beat Estimates, Guidance Up)2.    U.S. gas exporter Cheniere Energy reported strong first-quarter results on robust production volumes and strong pricing. The company’s net income per share came in at $1.18, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 62 cents and the comparable 2017 period profit of 23 cents.During the quarter, the company shipped 67 cargoes from Sabine Pass liquefied natural gas terminal in Louisiana. Total volumes lifted in the reported quarter were 244 trillion British thermal units.Overall costs and expenses soared 79% to $1,495 million from the same quarter last year. The increase is mainly attributed to the higher cost of sales which jumped to $1,178 million compared with $624 million in the prior-year quarter, while operating and maintenance expenses rose 79.5% year-over-year to $140 million.Cheniere Energy raised its EBITDA guidance for full-year 2018, following the better-than-expected profit. The upbeat forecast reflects higher-than-anticipated realized margins on marketing volumes. Adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be between $2,300 million and $2,500 million compared with the prior guidance ranging $2,000-$2,200 million. The distributable cash flow is likely to be between $350 million and $550 million, up from the prior guided range of $200-$400 million. (Read more Cheniere Energy Q1 Earnings Beat Estimates, View Up)3.    Brazil's state-run energy giant Petrobras announced first quarter net income of $2,145 million or 16 cents per share, compared with $1,417 million or 11 cents in the year-earlier quarter. Earnings per ADR came in at 32 cents (1 ADR equivalent to 2 shares in the Brazilian market), well ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 19 cents. Higher oil prices were primarily responsible for the outperformance, which helped Petrobras post its best quarterly earnings in five years.Importantly, Petrobras generated free cash flows of $4,005 million for the quarter ended Mar 31 – positive for the twelfth quarter in a row – reflecting operational improvement and lower investments. However, free cash flows fell 3% from the year-ago period due to the payment associated with a class action lawsuit. Moreover, adjusted EBITDA edged down 1% to $7,914 million.During the three months ended Mar 31, 2018, Petrobras’ capital investments and expenditures totaled $3,067 million, lower than the $3,672 million incurred in the year-ago period.This allowed the world's most indebted oil company to trim its massive debt load. At the end of the quarter, the company had net debt of $81,447 million, decreasing from the $84,871 million as of Dec 31, 2017. Net debt-to-capitalization ratio during the same period was approximately 49%, down from 51% three months ago. Additionally, Petrobras finished the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $19,966 million.

(SHLX  -  Free Report), a subsidiary of Shell Pipe Line Corporation. The deal is valued at $1.22 billion (more than £900 million).Per the agreement, Shell will divest its 75% interest of Amberjack Series A and 50% interest of Amberjack Series B to Shell Midstream. Notably, the deal marks the largest acquisition for Shell Midstream to date. The drop down is anticipated to close within May 11, 2018.The transaction is expected to heighten Shell's midstream assets' value without dropping possession of crucial infrastructures. The move is also in line with the company's aim to upgrade and streamline its portfolio. Shell intends to simplify the operational structure by offloading assets.

(ENB  -  Free Report) – through one of its subsidiaries – inked a definitive agreement for sale of Midcoast Operating, L.P. and its units (Midcoast) for $1.120 billion in cash. Subject to regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions, the transaction is projected to close in the third quarter of 2018.The Midcoast Operating, L.P. and its subsidiaries (Midcoast) carry out the company's U.S. natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL) gathering, processing, transportation and marketing businesses along with supplying to renowned basins in Texas.The natural gas gathering, treating, processing and transportation as well as NGL transportation assets located in the East Texas, Western Anadarko and Barnett shale plays comprise the Midcoast business. It also includes about 11,200 miles of natural gas gathering and transportation pipelines, 2,075 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) of natural gas processing capacity and 1,330 MMcf/d of treating capacity.These transactions are in sync with Enbridge’s strategy to move towards a pure regulated pipeline and utility model as well as achieve its target of selling non-core assets worth CAD$3 billion in 2018.

427,VLO,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a second straight weekly build. On a further bearish note, gasoline and distillate inventories rose, too.However, the talking point from the data sets was the steady trend of rising domestic oil production that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market. EIA revealed that weekly U.S. crude output jumped above 10 million barrels a day for the first time since 1970. This has refueled concerns that the domestic supply glut is cancelling out cuts from OPEC and its allies.As a result, the front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures moved down 2.5% (or $1.6) to end at $61.79 per barrel yesterday – the lowest settlement since Jan 8.Investors Dump Energy StocksThe federal data sparked widespread selling in energy stocks, which pushed the Energy Select Sector SPDR – an assortment of the largest U.S. energy companies – down almost 1.7% Wednesday.The two energy representatives in the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average, ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) lost 1.8% and 1.6%, respectively, yesterday. Meanwhile, some of the biggest casualties of the S&P 500 were oil and oil-related stocks like Southwestern Energy Co. (SWN  -  Free Report), Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK  -  Free Report), Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO  -  Free Report) and Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report).Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories rose by 1.9 million barrels for the week ending Feb 2, following an increase of 6.8 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go up some 2.8 million barrels.Record high domestic production led to the stockpile build with the world's biggest oil consumer. This was partly offset by lower imports and higher refiner demand, which helped restrict the inventory injection below expectations.In particular, U.S. output rose by 332,000 barrels per day last week to more than 10.2 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983 and the first time in nearly 50 years that oil production broke through the 10 million barrels a day threshold.While oil inventories rose for a second successive week, stockpiles have shrunk in 34 of the last 44 weeks and are down more than 110 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 420.3 million barrels, current crude supplies are 17.4% below the year-ago period though they are in the middle of the average range during this time of the year.Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was down by 711,000 barrels to three-year lows of 36.3 million barrels.The crude supply cover was up from 25.1 days in the previous week to 25.4 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 31.6 days.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies recorded their twelfth increase in 13 weeks on the strength of production and imports. The 3.4 million barrels addition – significantly above the polled number of 200,000 barrels rise in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 245.5 million barrels. Despite last week’s increase, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains 4.2% below the year-earlier level and is in the middle of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) gained 3.9 million barrels last week, contrary to analysts’ expectations for 800,000 barrels decrease in supply level. The weekly rise could be attributed to tepid demand and strong production. But at 141.8 million barrels, current supplies are still 16.9% below the year-ago level and are in the middle of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 4.4% from the prior week to 92.5%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.The data from EIA generally acts as a catalyst for crude prices and affect producers, such as ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), and refiners such as Valero Energy Corp. (VLO  -  Free Report), Phillips 66 (PSX) and Marathon Petroleum Corp.

428,VLO,"It was a week where both oil and gas prices logged handsome gains.On the news front, oil refiners Valero Energy Corp. (VLO  -  Free Report) and Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC  -  Free Report) raised their respective quarterly dividends. Meanwhile, driller Helmerich & Payne Inc. (HP  -  Free Report) came out with better-than-expected first-quarter fiscal 2018 results.Overall, it was a good week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained about 4.5% to close at $66.14 per barrel, while natural gas prices soared 10% to $3.505 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Schlumberger & Halliburton's Q4, BP's Horizon Woes & More)The U.S. oil benchmark recorded its fifth increase in six weeks, attaining its highest closing since December 2014. The major catalyst was the Energy Department's inventory release, which revealed that crude stockpiles recorded another weekly draw. A tumbling dollar – that made the greenback-priced crude more affordable for investors holding foreign currency – provided further support.Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 34 of the last 42 weeks and are down almost 114 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 411.6 million barrels, current crude supplies are 15.7% below the year-ago period and the lowest since February 2015.Meanwhile, natural gas – one of 2017’s worst-performing commodities – had an excellent week of its own following a larger-than-expected decrease in supplies. The 288 billion cubic feet (Bcf) withdrawal was also was significantly higher than both last year’s drop of 137 Bcf and the five-year (2013-2017) average net shrinkage of 164 Bcf for the reported week.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Valero Energy Corporation's board of directors recently announced plans to raise regular quarterly cash dividend to 80 cents per share from 70 cents per share, representing an increase of 14.3%.Following the hike, the company’s new annualized dividend will amount to $3.20 per share, up from $2.80 distributed earlier. This revised quarterly stock dividend is expected to be payable on Mar 6, 2018, to stockholders of record on Feb 13, 2018. Notably, the company’s dividend per share has been witnessing a rising trend for the last three years.Along with the decision to increase dividend, Valero announced that it has sanctioned share repurchase of $2.5 billion. We would like to remind investors that the company, per its previous declaration, has an authorization to repurchase $1.2 billion of shares. The latest addition takes the total authorization to $3.7 billion.

The Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company will now reward shareholders with a dividend of 46 cents per share compared with 40 cents earlier. This translates to an annualized dividend of $1.84 per share. The increased dividend will be paid on Mar 12, 2018 to shareholders of record as of Feb 21, 2018. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The oil refining and marketing giant was able to pull off the dividend hike due to the strategic actions it undertook last year for generating long-term cash flow. Notably, Marathon Petroleum's $8.1 billion drop-down deal with its midstream subsidiary MPLX L.P. bodes well for the company as it will lead to huge cash influx, boosting dividend and buyback programs. Moreover, the recent tax reform by the U.S. government has reduced the company's cash burden, leading to the hike.Marathon Petroleum is known for raising dividends since it became a standalone public company in mid-2011. Additionally, it has an active share repurchase program. These highlight the company’s commitment to return more value to shareholders. Notably, the dividend hikes and buybacks, since the company's inception, have totaled $13 billion. (Read more Marathon to Reward Shareholders With 15% Dividend Hike)3.    Contract drilling services provider Helmerich & Payne Inc. reported first-quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted operating loss of 2 cents per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 14 cents. The outperformance was primarily driven by higher drilling activity at its biggest segment – U.S. Land. The bottom line also compared favorably with the year-ago adjusted loss of 41 cents.During the quarter, operating revenues at its U.S. Land unit totaled $461.6 million (81.8% of total revenues), up 75.1% year over year. While average rig revenue per operating day was $22,400 — 10.7% below the year-ago period — average rig margin per day was down 7.6% to $8,854. However, utilization levels of 57% in the quarter under review (versus 31% in first-quarter fiscal 2017) resulted in an operating income of 24.7 million at the segment marking a turnaround from the year-ago loss of $30.9 million.The company expects activity in the U.S. land segment to rise by 3-4% sequentially during the second fiscal quarter of 2018. While the average rig revenue per day is likely to be flat compared with the first fiscal quarter, daily average rig cost is expected to be roughly $13,900 during next quarter.During the quarter, Helmerich & Payne spent approximately $91.7 million on capital programs. As of Dec 31, 2017, the company had approximately $383.7 million in cash, while long-term debt stood at $493.2 million (debt-to-capitalization ratio of 9.7%).

(PTEN  -  Free Report) shares declined more than 2% in the wake of an explosion in a well in Quinton, OK, owned by Red Mountain Energy. The tragedy, one of the deadliest oil and gas related accidents in the last few years, occurred at one of Patterson-UTI's APEX 1500 rigs. The rig had operated for 10 days and dug 13,500 feet when the accident took place. Notably, the company has 25 drilling rigs online in the state.Although the reason for the explosion is still not clear, gas from the well may have been a factor. Out of the 22 workers at the site, 16 managed to escape while five went missing. Their bodies were found in an adjacent building, one day after the explosion took place. Three of them were working for Patterson-UTI.Halliburton’s well control and prevention service providing unit, Boots & Coots was summoned to extinguish the fire at this eastern Oklahoma site. Currently, the U.S. Chemical Safety Board and Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the United States are investigating the disaster.

429,VLO,"Launched on 09/21/2006, the Guggenheim Multi-Asset Income ETF (CVY  -  Free Report) is a smart beta exchange traded fund offering broad exposure to the Total Market (U.S.) ETFs category of the U.S. equity market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?Products that are based on market cap weighted indexes, which are strategies designed to reflect a specific market segment or the market as a whole, have traditionally dominated the ETF industry.Because market cap weighted indexes provide a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns, they work well for investors who believe in market efficiency.However, some investors believe in the possibility of beating the market through exceptional stock selection, and choose a different type of fund that tracks non-cap weighted strategies: smart beta.By attempting to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, non-cap weighted indexes are based on certain fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such.The smart beta space gives investors many different choices, from equal-weighting, one of the simplest strategies, to more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting. However, not all of these methodologies have been able to deliver remarkable returns.Fund Sponsor & IndexThe fund is sponsored by Invesco Powershares. It has amassed assets over $292.13 M, making it one of the larger ETFs in the Total Market (U.S.) ETFs. CVY seeks to match the performance of the Zacks Multi-Asset Income Index before fees and expenses.The Zacks Multi-Asset Income Index is comprised of approximately 125 to 150 stocks selected, based on a multi-factor proprietary model, from a universe of domestic and international companies, including U.S.-listed common stocks, ADRs paying dividends, REITs, MLPs, closed-end funds and traditional preferred stocks.Cost & Other ExpensesSince cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.Annual operating expenses for CVY are 0.79%, which makes it on par with most peer products in the space.The fund has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 3.99%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.When you look at individual holdings, Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) accounts for about 1.28% of the fund's total assets, followed by Valero Energy Corp (VLO  -  Free Report) and Bank Of America Corp (BAC L).The top 10 holdings account for about 11.39% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskSo far this year, the ETF has gained about 0.49%, and is up roughly 11.87% in the last one year (as of 05/23/2018). CVY has traded between $20.64 and $23.39 in the past 52-week period.The ETF has a beta of 0.86 and standard deviation of 12.72% for the trailing three-year period. With about 148 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.

431,VLO,"It was a week where oil prices settled under $60 a barrel for the first time this year and natural gas logged its lowest closing since February 2017.On the news front, energy biggies TOTAL S.A. (TOT  -  Free Report), Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) and Suncor Energy Inc. (SU  -  Free Report) came up with stronger-than-expected earnings reports, driven by higher oil prices. Moreover, all the companies awarded shareholders with dividend increases.Overall, it was another dismal week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost about 9.6% to close at $59.20 per barrel, while natural gas prices dived 9.2% to $2.584 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Exxon & Chevron's Q4 Earnings Miss, Shell Reports Strong Numbers)The U.S. oil benchmark recorded its third decrease in four weeks. The major culprit was the steady trend of rising domestic oil production that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market.As per EIA’s latest data, U.S. output rose by 332,000 barrels per day last week to more than 10.2 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983 and the first time in nearly 50 years that oil production broke through the 10 million barrels a day threshold. This has refueled concerns that the domestic supply glut is cancelling out cuts from OPEC and its allies.Data showing the number of U.S. oil rigs climbing for a third straight week – this time by 26, the most in more than a year – brought further downside.Meanwhile, natural gas had a forgettable week of its own following a smaller-than-average decrease in supplies. The 119 billion cubic feet (Bcf) withdrawal was less than last year’s drop of 142 Bcf and the five-year (2013-2017) average net shrinkage of 151 Bcf for the reported week. Investors were also spooked by forecasts of warmer weather, leading to the heating fuel’s tepid demand.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    France-based supermajor TOTAL S.A. reported fourth-quarter 2017 operating earnings of $1.10 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.06 by 3.8%.

432,VLO,"Toward the end of 2017, we saw partial recovery in oil prices. Solid demand growth, declining inventories and the extension of OPEC-led supply cuts until the end of 2018 is keeping the market steady and supporting strong uptrend.While there might be a number of winners within the energy sector, refiners have stood out amid weakness in the commodity prices. Moreover, the overhaul of the nation’s tax code is expected to benefit the refiners. With the implementation of the law, the corporate income tax will be lowered from 35% to 21%, which will benefit the refiners.This is because unlike crude producers and equipment makers who have been victims of stubborn low oil price environment and struggled to generate positive cash flows, refiners have been among the handful of energy sub industries displaying strength during the shaky period.The business of downstream players is negatively correlated with crude prices. This is because the companies use oil as an input from which they derive refined petroleum products like gasoline, the prime transportation fuel in the United States. Hence, lower the oil price, higher will be their profits. Therefore, the income from converting crude into gasoline and diesel — also known as refining margin or crack spread — has been going up over the past few quarters.Consequently, these companies — having generated positive income before taxes — are in a much better shape to take advantage of the current situation. Consequently, shares of the major downstream operators have been rising lately.    In this context, we put the spotlight on two of the refining players — Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) and Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report) — with market caps of $50.92 billion and $38.28 billion, respectively. Since both stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it will be interesting to see which stock is better positioned in terms of fundamentals.Valero Beats on the BoursesOver the past year, Valero surpassed the industry’s gain of 22.6% as well as S&P 500 index’s rally of 21.3%. Moreover, Valero’s rise of 40.4% has outshined Phillips 66’s returns of 20.3%.ValuationPhillips 66 and Valero have P/E ratios of 29.4 and 20.3, respectively. Clearly, Valero is the cheaper proposition. Notably, while Valero is underpriced, Phillips 66 is overpriced compared with the industry’s P/E ratio of 25.4.LiquidityThe liquidity of a company is determined through quick ratio which is a more stringent test to measure the capability of a company to pay both short- and long-term obligations.Valero has a better liquidity than the industry’s level of 1.02 and that of Phillips 66’s 0.86. Valero’s quick ratio of 1.24 puts it in a more comfortable position to meet short-term obligations.Return on Capital (ROC)Coming to Phillips 66 and Valero, ROC for the trailing 12-months is 5.4% and 7.1%, respectively, which are above the sector’s level of 5.3%.Last Quarter Performance & ProjectionsPhillips 66 delivered impressive results in third-quarter 2017 wherein adjusted earnings per share not only surged 58.1% year over year to $1.66 but also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.62. Phillips 66 expects year-over year earnings growth of 60.28% and 39.39% in 2017 and 2018, respectively.Valero’s third-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings surged over54% year over year to $1.91 per share, also surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.83. Valero expects year-over year growth of 34.41% and 29.68% in its earnings in 2017 and 2018, respectively.In terms of long-term growth expectations, Phillips 66 scores above Valero. The expected growth rate for Phillips 66 for the next 3-5 years is 10.00% compared with an expected growth of 9.86% for Valero.Earnings Surprise HistoryConsidering a more comprehensive earnings history, Phillips 66 seems to be a clear winner. Phillips 66 delivered average positive earnings surprise of 429.3% in the trailing four quarters. However, the Valero reported average negative earnings surprise of 10.3% in the same period.Dividend YieldIna year, the dividend yield for both Valero and Phillips 66 has been higher than the broader sector. While the sector depicted yield of 2.6%, Valero returned almost 3%. Phillips 66 has a dividend yield of 2.7%.Cash Flow From OperationsOver the last nine months, Phillips 66 reported a sharp year-over-year decline in cash flow from operating activities, which is a key metric to gauge the financial health of the firms. Valero’s figure was unchanged. Valero generated enough cash to fund capital payment.Phillips 66 generated operating cash flow of $1717 million in the first nine months of 2017 compared with $2296 million reported in the corresponding period of 2016. Valero generated cash flow from operations of $3822 million, unchanged from the corresponding period of 2016.Bottom LineOur comparative analysis shows that Valero has an edge over Phillips 66 considering price performance, valuation, liquidity, dividend yield.  Phillips 66 scores on long-term projections and earnings surprise history. On overall comparison, the scale is slightly tilted in favor of Valero.However, we prefer to be on the sidelines and ask investors to hold the stocks for now, reflected by the companies’ Zacks Rank.A few better-ranked stocks in the same industry are Statoil ASA  and Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report).

433,VLO,"Heading into the New Year, both oil and natural gas futures experienced noticeable upticks on healthy storage draws.On the news front, energy explorer SandRidge Energy, Inc.  called off its merger with peer Bonanza Creek Energy, Inc. (BCEI  -  Free Report) following criticism from some of its largest shareholders, while oilfield services player McDermott International, Inc. (MDR  -  Free Report) announced the receipt of a contract in the Danish sector of North Sea.Overall, the sector ended 2017 on a bullish note. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained about 3.3% to close at $60.42 per barrel, while natural gas prices surged 11% to $2.9530 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Shell Boosts Power Market Presence, Cabot Sells Eagle Ford Assets)Posting its second annual gain in a row, oil prices closed 2017 up more than 12%. The last week of the year saw U.S. oil benchmark attain its highest closing since June 2015. The major catalyst was the Energy Department's inventory release, which revealed that crude stockpiles recorded another higher-than-expected weekly draw. On a further bullish note, domestic oil production snapped its steadily rising trend and fell for the first time since October. Data showing the number of U.S. oil rigs not rising for a third straight week helped cement those gains.Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 30 of the last 38 weeks and are down more than 100 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 431.9 million barrels, current crude supplies are 11.1% below the year-ago period and the lowest since 2015.Meanwhile, natural gas was one of 2017’s worst-performing commodities, losing 21% during the period. However, the fuel gained substantial ground during the past week following a larger-than-average decrease in supplies. Favorable weather forecasts (translating into robust heating gas demand) added to the positive sentiment.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Oil and natural gas company, SandRidge Energy recently announced that it has dropped its plan to acquire Colorado-based Bonanza Creek Energy, following intense opposition from its shareholders. SandRidge has agreed to reimburse Bonanza Creek with up to $3.7 million for terminating the agreement.Earlier, SandRidge had announcedits plan to acquire Bonanza Creek Energy for a total consideration of $746 million including cash and stock. The plan was primarily opposed by New York-based Fir Tree Partners and activist Carl Icahn, the two largest shareholders of SandRidge. While Icahn holds 13.5% of Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) SandRidge shares, Fir Tree holds owns 8.3%. Following the decision, both the companies mutually dismissed the acquisition plan. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Although SandRidge – which emerged out of bankruptcy in 2016 – initially believed that the acquisition will help it to increase its DJ Basin hold and raise oil production, the majority of its shareholders felt it should better focus on the proportion of management compensation and company size and scale. The shareholders expect the company with a market cap of $654.184 million to mend its internal disparities before increasing its asset holdings.

434,VLO,"It was a week where both oil and natural gas prices experienced noticeable upticks on healthy storage draws.On the news front, supermajor Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) has signed an agreement to purchase British energy supplier First Utility, while domestic natural gas producer Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report) announced plans to offload its Eagle Ford shale holdings for $765 million.Overall, it was a good week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained about 2% to close at $58.47 per barrel, while natural gas prices rose 2.1% to $2.667 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: MDR-CBI Tie-Up, STO's Oilfield Stake Buy & More)The U.S. oil benchmark recorded an increase for the first time in three weeks. The major catalyst was the Energy Department's inventory release, which revealed that crude stockpiles recorded a higher-than-expected weekly draw. Data showing the number of U.S. oil rigs not rising for a second straight week helped cement those gains.Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 29 of the last 37 weeks and are down nearly 97 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 436.5 million barrels, current crude supplies are 10.1% below the year-ago period and the lowest since 2015Meanwhile, natural gas futures recovered from last week’s ten-month lows following a larger-than-average decrease in supplies. Favorable weather forecasts (translating into robust heating gas demand) added to the positive sentiment.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    In a bid to lower its carbon footprint, Royal Dutch Shell recently inked a deal to acquire UK’s energy supplier First Utility. The move will enable Shell to expand its energy supply business from commercial and industrial customers and venture into the residential sector. The purchase price of the transaction has been kept under wraps. Subject to regulatory approvals and satisfactory closing conditions, the deal is set for completion by the end of the first quarter of 2018. (Read more Shell Boosts Power Market Presence With First Utility Buyout)The announcement of the acquisition comes amid a challenging time for UK’s energy firms as the British Prime Minister Theresa May plans to cap electricity and gas bills until 2020 which could dampen competition. Since 2012, new energy suppliers have increased competition in the space, lowering the Big Six’s market share from nearly 100% to about 80%. The latest acquisition deal will further intensify the competition putting more pressure on the Big Six. The move will mark Shell’s entry to Britain's household energy market, enabling the company to develop innovative new services for customers.First Utility will operate as a stand-alone entity and subsidiary of Shell within its New Energies division in which the company will invest approximately $1 billion per year till 2020 to shift its focus on cleaner and renewable energy sources. The new business will serve as a hedge for reduced gasoline and diesel fuel demand.2.    As part of its cost-containment initiatives, Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation recently inked a deal to divest Eagle Ford Shale holdings to a unit of Venado Oil & Gas LLC for $765 million. Subject to satisfactory closing conditions, the deal is set for completion during the first quarter of 2018.The divested assets will include around 74,500 acres which produced 15,656 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter of 2017. The assets accounted for just 5% of the total year-to-date equivalent production and 4% proved reserves. The company will record a one-time charge of around $270-$280 million on the Eagle Ford sale in the fourth quarter. In a separate transaction, the company also offloaded remaining East Texas properties to an undisclosed buyer.Cash proceeds from this transaction will strengthen the balance sheet of the company boosting its free cash flow generation. Cabot’s execution success, disciplined capital allocation and improving well economics will enhance its outlook, driving the shareholder value by share buyback programs and dividend growth. Further, the portfolio streamline is in sync with the company‘s aim to increase its focus on the lucrative Marcellus shale.

435,VLO,"It was a week where oil prices consolidated above $70-a-barrel and natural gas futures got a lift from growing cooling demand.On the news front, energy major TOTAL S.A. (TOT  -  Free Report) signed a natural gas resources development deal with the Government of Oman, while U.S. oil and gas provider Rex Energy Corp.  confirmed filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.Overall, it was another good week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained about 0.8% to close at $71.28 per barrel, while natural gas prices rose some 1.5% to $2.847 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Occidental, Cheniere & Petrobras' Earnings Impress)The U.S. oil benchmark hit a new three-and-a-half-year high last week on bullish EIA inventory numbers, a looming drop in Iranian crude exports and alarming drop in Venezuelan crude output.The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude stockpiles registered a fall of 1.4 million barrels, the second weekly decrease in a row. On a further bullish note, the report revealed that refined product inventories, gasoline and distillate, both dropped from their week earlier levels.The commodity was also supported by U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent withdrawal from a nuclear deal with OPEC’s third-largest producer Iran and a pledge to reimpose sanctions on Tehran. The action has stoked worries about an expected cut in Iranian oil exports by around 1 million barrels per day from current levels and lead to a supply shortage in an already ‘tight’ oil market.Fast falling production in Venezuela have added to the jitters. With the country tethering on the verge of an economic collapse, oil output has dwindled by almost 50% since 2005. Venezuela currently churns out less than 2 million barrels per day, much lower that its pledge per the OPEC-led supply cuts.Natural gas prices also moved northward last week. While the weekly inventory release showed a larger-than-expected increase in natural gas supplies, the report pointed to a tightening market dynamic and boosted the fuel’s price. In particular, total consumption of natural gas averaged around 57.5 Bcf per day, 4% higher on a weekly basis due to rising usage for power generation.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    TOTAL S.A. recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Government of Oman to develop natural gas resources in Oman. The agreement covers both the upstream and downstream businesses of the company. TOTAL’s involvement in the above project will increase its production from Oman, which was 37,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boe/d) in 2017.TOTAL, along with Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report), will develop several natural gas discoveries located in the Greater Barik area on onshore Block 6. Shell will be the operator with 75% stake and TOTAL will have 25% interest in these natural gas discoveries. Initial gas production will be 500 million cubic feet per day, with the potential to increase to 1 billion cubic feet.TOTAL has plans to utilize its equity gas entitlement from the Oman project as feedstock to develop a regional hub for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) bunkering service to supply LNG as a fuel to marine vessels. A small-scale liquefaction plant will be built in Sohar port and TOTAL will utilize this plant to convert natural gas to LNG. In addition, TOTAL may benefit from improving natural gas demand in Oman.

U.S. oil and gas provider, Rex Energy believes that comprehensive debt restructuring will enable it to overcome the challenging times that the company has been facing. Rex Energy has secured $100 million in financing from first-lien lenders, which along with its operating cash flow would be sufficient for the company to maintain normal operations during bankruptcy proceedings.Notably, the Appalachian Basin-focused company had got delisted from the Nasdaq stock market effective Apr 12. In its latest quarterly report, the company disclosed that it could not come into an agreement with the lenders, after it failed to make an interest payment in April.

(KMI  -  Free Report) is going through a roller coaster ride with its Trans Mountain expansion project in Canada, where political uncertainty is playing a major role in deciding its future. Recently, the company received assurance from the Canadian government that losses related to politically-triggered delays in the project will be covered.As the future of the project seemed in jeopardy, the company started to rethink over the matter. Kinder Morgan was thinking of walking away from the project if further delays would hamper the company’s plans. The recent bottleneck in Canada’s pipelines has forced the government to take steps in this expansion project. The New Democratic Party led government of British Columbia, however, criticized the decision. The party has support from the Green Party, an environment-focused federal political party in Canada.Canadian Finance Minister, Bill Morneau stated that if Kinder Morgan leaves the Trans Mountain project, the government will be ready to provide the financial assurances as and when any company steps in to take over.

436,VLO,"Making its debut on 10/21/2015, smart beta exchange traded fund SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF (SPYD  -  Free Report) provides investors broad exposure to the Large Cap ETFs category of the U.S. equity market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?The ETF industry has long been dominated by products based on market cap weighted indexes, a strategy created to reflect the market or a particular market segment.Market cap weighted indexes offer a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns, and are a good option for investors who believe in market efficiency.But, there are some investors who would rather invest in smart beta funds; these funds track non-cap weighted strategies, and are a strong option for those who prefer choosing great stocks in order to beat the market.This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.Methodologies like equal-weighting, one of the simplest options out there, fundamental weighting, and volatility/momentum based weighting are all choices offered to investors in this space, but not all of them can deliver superior returns.Fund Sponsor & IndexSPYD is managed by State Street Global Advisors, and this fund has amassed over $495.12 M, which makes it one of the average sized ETFs in the Large Cap ETFs. This particular fund, before fees and expenses, seeks to match the performance of the S&P 500 High Dividend Index.The S&P 500 High Dividend Index is designed to measure the performance of the top 80 dividend-paying securities listed on the S&P 500 Index, based on dividend yield.Cost & Other ExpensesExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long-term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins, other things remaining the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.07%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 4.02%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Real Estate sector - about 24.80% of the portfolio. Utilities and Consumer Discretionary round out the top three.Taking into account individual holdings, Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report) accounts for about 1.50% of the fund's total assets, followed by Macy's Inc (M  -  Free Report) and Aes Corporation (AES  -  Free Report).Its top 10 holdings account for approximately 14.36% of SPYD's total assets under management.Performance and RiskSo far this year, the ETF has lost about -2.57%, and is up roughly 9.73% in the last one year (as of 05/21/2018). SPYD has traded between $34.68 and $38.74 in the past 52-week period.The ETF has a beta of 0.77 and standard deviation of 12.20% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium choice in the space. With about 82 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Large Cap ETFs segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.IShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD  -  Free Report) tracks Russell 1000 Value Index and the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV  -  Free Report) tracks CRSP U.S. Large Cap Value Index. IShares Russell 1000 Value ETF has $36.53 B in assets, Vanguard Value ETF has $36.14 B. IWD has an expense ratio of 0.20% and VTV charges 0.05%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Large Cap ETFs.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.

440,VLO,"Andeavor (ANDV  -  Free Report) is set to release fourth-quarter 2017 results after the closing bell on Feb 15.San Antonio, TX-based downstream operator— whose peers includes Marathon Petroleum (MPC  -  Free Report), Valero Energy (VLO  -  Free Report) and Phillips 66 among others — reported a negative earnings surprise of 10.89% in the preceding quarter amid high costs along with lower retail and branded fuel margins.  However, coming to earnings surprise history, the company has a good record. The company topped estimates in three of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 37.8%. Andeavor Price and EPS Surprise  Andeavor Price and EPS Surprise | Andeavor Quote Which Way are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company before the earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-quarter earnings has been revised downward by 11.7% over the last 30 days. However, it reflects growth from the year-ago quarter loss of 2 cents.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $10,789 million compared with $6,652 million in the prior-year quarter.Factors at PlayDuring the quarter, the downstream operator completed the acquisition of Western Refining which will bolster Andeavor’s assets and enhance its geographic footprint in the prolific Permian Basin, marking double-digit earnings growth in 2018.However, for fourth-quarter 2017, the company’s refining segment is likely to impact its bottom line adversely. The recent oil price rally has not only made commodity expensive for refiners but also widened the crack spread and lowered refining margins. In fact, the company released an update of its operations few weeks back, wherein it expects its refining margins to reduce by $135 million approximately. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the gross refining margins per barrel for Mid-Continent stands at $14.59 compared with $17.27 in the prior quarter. For Pacific-Northwest, the margin is estimated to be $7.87 per barrel, reflecting a decline from $15.03 per barrel in the prior quarter.Andeavor expects to incur an operating loss of $50-$55 million in its refining segment. This reflects a massive decline from the operating income of $762 million in the prior quarter and $43 million in the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate forecasts the total refining throughput to average 1,094 thousand barrels per day (MBbl/d) compared with 1,141 MBbl/d in the prior-year quarter. However, the figure compares favorably with the 841 MBbl/d in fourth-quarter 2016.Nevertheless, the negative impact of the refining segment is expected to be partly offset by strong results from marketing and logistics segments. The company expects the operating income from the Logistics segment to be around $190-$195 million, as compared with $164 million in the prior quarter and $123 million in the year-ago quarter. Further, the company expects its marketing segment to generate an operating income of around $235-$240 million compared with $175 million and $169 million in the prior quarter and fourth-quarter 2016, respectively.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Andeavor is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -0.19%.

441,VLO,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded another massive drop on continued strong refinery runs. With oil supplies falling for the ninth week, investor sentiment has turned slightly positive on dissipating fears about a meltdown to sub-$40 levels. Analysts also believe that the trend, if sustained, could help tighten the market significantly.But the positive effect from the hefty crude inventory draw was more than offset by the steadily rising domestic oil output that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market. At 9.53 million barrels a day, production is at the highest level in more than two years, thereby cancelling out cuts from OPEC and its allies. Surprise builds in refined product inventories – gasoline and distillate – added to the pessimism. As a result, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures shed 1% (or 48 cents) to $45.96 per barrel Wednesday.In any case, the federal data was overshadowed by the impact of Hurricane Harvey-induced shutdowns at crude production and refining infrastructure.Gasoline Prices JumpThe Gulf of Mexico (GoM), which bore the brunt of Hurricane Harvey, has major refining infrastructures. According to the EIA, more than 45% of domestic oil refining capacity and around 51% of the nation’s natural gas processing capacity are located in the GoM.Exxon Mobil Corporation’s (XOM  -  Free Report) Baytown, Royal Dutch Shell plc’s (RDS.A  -  Free Report) Deer Park, Marathon Petroleum Corporation’s (MPC  -  Free Report) Galveston Bay, Phillips 66’s (PSX  -  Free Report) Sweeny Texas, Petrobras’ (PBR  -  Free Report) Pasadena, Valero Energy Corporation’s (VLO  -  Free Report) Corpus Christi are among the facilities affected. As a result, gasoline soared to a two-year high of $1.885 a gallon after Harvey caused weeks of disruptions at refineries in its path and shut units, creating supply shortages that will affect facilities for months.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories slumped by 5.4 million barrels for the week ending Aug 25, following a decline of 3.3 million barrels in the previous week.The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 1.5 million barrels. Continued strength in refinery crude runs led to the bigger-than-expected stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consumer even as domestic production rose to the highest level since July 2015.Inventory reduction in 19 of the past 21 weeks has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 457.8 million barrels, current crude supplies are at their lowest since January 2016 and are in the middle of the average range during this time of the year.However, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was up by 689,000 barrels to 57.2 million barrels.The crude supply cover was down from 26.5 days in the previous week to 26 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 31.5 days.Gasoline: Supplies of gasoline were up for the third time in four weeks on higher production and imports. The nominal 35,000 barrels addition – contrary to the polled number of 1.9 million barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 229.9 million barrels. Despite last week’s increase, the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains 0.9% below the year-earlier level but is close to the upper limit of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) went up by 748,000 barrels last week, as opposed to analysts’ expectations for 600,000 barrels decrease in supply level. The third successive weekly rise could be attributed to fall in demand. At 149.2 million barrels, current supplies are 3.6% below the year-ago level but are in the upper half of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization jumped 1.2% from the prior week’s 12-year highs to 96.6%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?If you are looking for a near-term energy play, Range Resources Corp.

442,VLO,"It was a week where both oil and natural gas finished higher.On the news front, U.S. supermajor Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) gave its go-ahead to the $5.1 billion second stage of its massive Gorgon LNG project in Western Australia, while oilfield service providers McDermott International, Inc. (MDR  -  Free Report) and National Oilwell Varco, Inc. (NOV  -  Free Report) provided first-quarter operational updates.Overall, it was a good week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained around 8.6% to close at $67.39 per barrel, while natural gas prices rose 1.3% to $2.735 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: RDS.A & SM's Divestment Deals, KMI's Project Suspension & More)The U.S. oil benchmark settled at a three-year high last week on renewed geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and reports of strong OPEC compliance with the supply pact.Crude literally took off following news of U.S.-led military strike against Syria and gained further when Saudi Arabia claimed to have intercepted missiles fired by Yemeni rebels.Apart from the geopolitical risk premium, the commodity was also supported by a bullish ‘Oil Market Report’ by energy consultative body IEA. The agency, in its April publication, said that OPEC and its allies have been largely successful in erasing the global oil stock surplus through their high compliance rates on production curbs.Natural gas prices also moved northward last week following a larger-than-expected decrease in supplies. Investors were further encouraged by unseasonal winter-like weather that might lead to the fuel’s strong demand and push back the commencement of the injection season.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Chevronfinally announced its intention to proceed with the second stage of its multibillion dollar Gorgon LNG project in Western Australia's north-west coast. While Chevron is the chief operator of Gorgon LNG project holding 47.3% stake, Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell own 25% interest each.Gorgon LNG project is the largest single resource project in Australia, dealing with the delivery of natural gas to international and domestic customers. The $69 billion project is one of the costliest energy projects, employing more than 10,000 people to construct the processing facility at Barrow Island. The Gorgon LNG project has a shipment capacity of 15.6 million metric tons per year.The second stage of the project involves a capital investment of around $5.1 billion. The investment in the second stage of the project would fit within Chevron’s planned annual investment of $18-$20 billion through 2020. Apart from leading to creation of jobs and boosting the local economy, the expansion of the project is likely to boost the domestic supply of gas from 200 terajoules (TJ) to about 300 TJ a day.

The company thanked solid backlog conversation in its operational areas along with successful execution of its cost-saving plans for the positives. Following the news, the stock jumped 6.7%.The company expects its top line for the Jan-Mar quarter to be in the range of $600-$610 million, much higher than the year-ago figure of $519.4 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate shows revenues to be $590.8 million. Moreover, McDermott expects its EPS for the quarter to be in the range of 10-12 cents.Per McDermott, cost saving efforts like the Fit2Grow initiative played crucial roles in this quarter. The Fit2Grow initiative alone helped the company in generating $15 million in savings. Moreover, McDermott expects its operating margin in the quarter to be in the range of 10-10.7%.McDermott also reaffirmed its preliminary 2018 guidance, issued on Feb 21. The Houston, TX-based service provider expects its full-year revenues to be in the range of $3.1-$3.3 billion. Moreover, the company anticipates its EBITDA to be within the $340-$365 million range.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The company blamed new offshore rig construction's lowered progress as well as client-associated equipment deferrals for decline in its revenues. The delay from customers is expected to push the remaining revenues to later quarters. Moreover, the sequential shipments of subsea production equipment declined during the end of the quarter, hurting National Oilwell's top line in the period.

(VET  -  Free Report), an oil and gas producing company, has agreed to acquire its rival Spartan Energy Corp. in a C$1.4 billion ($1.11 billion) deal. The transaction is expected to enable Vermilion Energy to boost its North American light oil production. Notably, annual production of Spartan Energy is expected around 23,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boe/d) this year, of which 91% is oil.Should the deal go through Calgary, Canada-based Vermilion Energy. Apart from increasing its hold in the region with 480,000 acres of light oil producing property, it will add low decline assets to Vermilion Energy's portfolio, which holds huge investment opportunities in the future. The additional production from the acquisition is expected to help Vermilion Energy reach its revised 2018 output guidance of 86,000-90,000 Boe/d. Moreover, proved and probable reserves of 113.5 million barrels will be added to Vermilion Energy's portfolio. The company increased its capital budget to C$430 million following the acquisition from C$325 million earlier.Additionally, operational synergies from the deal are expected to benefit Vermilion Energy in a tough energy environment in Canada, where lack of infrastructure is currently leading to discounted, and volatile pricing for crude and gas.

443,VLO,"Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report) recently signed a long-term contract through its subsidiary, Valero Marketing and Supply de Mexico, S.A. de C.V. for providing refined products like diesel and gasoline to northern Mexico.Valero is expected to ship fuels from its refineries located in the Corpus Christi and Three Rivers in Texas to Mexico. The company is likely to use NuStar Energy L.P.’s (NS  -  Free Report) infrastructure, which includes the midstream company's Nuevo Laredo storage terminal in Mexico and its related pipelines. The terminal has five storage tanks that hold 34,000 barrels of refined products, which is likely to be increased to meet Valero's requirement. By 2018-end, Valero is expected to start shipping fuel to the storage terminal.The deal is in line with Valero's strategy of expanding its supply chain in a growing market. Notably, the company has an existing deal made in August 2017, to supply fuels in central Mexico. We note that SENER, Mexico’s Ministry of Energy, had issued renewable permits to Valero for importing almost 54 million barrels of gasoline along with more than 56.7 million barrels of diesel per annum. Notably, the latest accord comes right after the company signed a contract to foray into the South American infrastructure market through the acquisition of Pure Biofuels del Peru S.A.C.We also note that previously, Northern Mexico used to be provided with fuels by the country's national oil company, Pemex. The Caderayta and Madero refineries of Pemex supplied 285,000 barrels per day (BPD) and 190,000 BPD of fuels in the region. But in the recent times, Pemex's refineries are producing below their capacity, triggering significant import of fuels. In February 2018, demand for refined products in the northeastern states of Coahuila, Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon together was 171,800 BPD, of which almost 40% was imported. Price Performance San Antonio, TX-based Valero has gained 79.5% in the past year compared with 13.7% growth of its industry. Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderValero has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Investors interested in the Energy sector can opt for some better-ranked stocks in the same space like Nine Energy Service, Inc.

444,VLO,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a big weekly build as domestic oil production reached another all-time high.Middle East Tensions Overshadow EIA DataHowever, oil traders chose to overlook bearish trends from the EIA data set and were more concerned about the uncertainty surrounding mounting tensions in the Middle East and the resultant fears of supplies being disrupted. The commodity settled at a three-year high of $66.82 per barrel yesterday after President Trump hinted at the possibility of a military strike against Syria, and Saudi Arabia claimed to have intercepted missiles fired by Yemeni rebels.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories rose by 3.3 million barrels for the week ending Apr 6, following a decrease of 4.6 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go up some 100,000 barrels.Record-high domestic production and surging imports led to the larger-than-expected build with the world's biggest oil consumer even as refiner demand strengthened.In particular, U.S. output rose by 65,000 barrels per day last week to more than 10.5 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983. In early February, oil production broke through the 10 million barrels a day threshold for the first time in nearly 50 years and has maintained the record levels thereafter.While oil inventories rose last week, stockpiles have actually shrunk in 37 of the last 53 weeks and are down nearly 105 million barrels in the past year. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 428.6 million barrels, current crude supplies are 20% below the year-ago period and are in the bottom half of the average range during this time of the year.Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was up by 1.1 million barrels to 36 million barrels.At 25.4 days, the crude supply cover was unchanged from the previous week. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 32.7 days.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies recorded their first increase in six weeks as production edged up. The 458,000 barrels build – contrary to the polled number of 2 million barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 238.9 million barrels. Despite last week’s rise, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains just below the year-earlier level though it is in the top half of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) were down 1 million barrels last week, slightly lower than analysts’ expectations for 1.2 million barrels decrease in supply level. The weekly fall could be attributed to higher demand. At 128.5 million barrels, current supplies are 15% below the year-ago level and are in the lower half of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 0.5% from the prior week to 93.5%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.The data from EIA generally acts as a catalyst for crude prices and affect producers, such as ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), and refiners such as Valero Energy (VLO  -  Free Report), Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) and Marathon Petroleum (MPC  -  Free Report).Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?If you are looking for a near-term energy play, Concho Resources Inc.

445,VLO,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a surprise weekly decline even as domestic oil production reached another all-time high. Following the data sets, front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures moved down 0.2% (or 14 cents) to end at $63.37 per barrel yesterday.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 4.6 million barrels for the week ending Mar 30, following an increase of 1.6 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go up some one million barrels.Higher refinery runs and lower imports led to the surprise draw build with the world's biggest oil consumer even as domestic production reached a new record.In particular, U.S. output rose by 27,000 barrels per day last week to nearly 10.5 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983. In early February, oil production broke through the 10 million barrels a day threshold for the first time in nearly 50 years and has maintained the record levels thereafter.Meanwhile, stockpiles have shrunk in 37 of the last 52 weeks and are down more than 108 million barrels since April last year.

446,VLO,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Valero Energy has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18.2, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 21.1. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Valero Energy’s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 23.4. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Valero Energy has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 17.4, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Valero Energy stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Valero Energy has a P/S ratio of about 0.4. This is significantly lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4 right now. However, as we can see in the chart below, this is in line with the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years. This suggests that the company’s stock price has already appreciated to some degree, relative to its sales.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Valero Energy currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Valero Energy a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Valero Energy is 1.8, a level that is lower than the industry average of 2.0. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 10.5, which is slightly better than the industry average of 10.9. Clearly, VLO is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Valero Energy might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of A. This gives VLO a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mostly trending higher. The current quarter has seen five estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower, while the full year estimate has seen six upward and three downward revisions in the same time period.As a result, the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 24.8% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has increased 1.3%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Valero Energy Corporation Price and Consensus  Valero Energy Corporation Price and Consensus | Valero Energy Corporation QuoteEven though Valero Energy has a better estimates trend, the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). That is why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineValero Energy is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Furthermore, a robust industry rank (among the Top 43%) should boost investor confidence.However over the past three years, the industry has underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:Despite the poor past performance of the industry, a good industry rank signals that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future. Add to this the positive estimate revisions and robust value metrics, and we believe that we have a strong value contender in Valero Energy.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

447,VLO,"It was a week where both oil and gas prices tallied losses.On the news front, U.S.-based integrated majors ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) came up with weaker-than-expected earnings reports despite higher oil prices. However, their European counterpart Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) bucked the trend and reported strong numbers, helped by rebounding commodity prices and cost cuts.Overall, it was a dismal week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost about 1% to close at $65.45 per barrel, while natural gas prices dived more than 10% to $2.846 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Valero and Marathon Hikes Dividends, Helmerich & Payne Reports Q1)The U.S. oil benchmark recorded its second decrease in three weeks. The major culprit was the steady trend of rising domestic oil production that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market.As per EIA’s latest data, U.S. output rose by 384,000 barrels per day in November to 10.038 million barrels per day – the first time in nearly 50 years that oil production broke through the 10 million barrels a day threshold. This has refueled concerns that the domestic supply glut is cancelling out cuts from OPEC and its allies.Data showing the number of U.S. oil rigs climbing for a second straight week brought further downside.Meanwhile, natural gas had a forgettable week of its own following a smaller-than-expected decrease in supplies. The 99 billion cubic feet (Bcf) withdrawal was also lower than the five-year (2013-2017) average net shrinkage of 160 Bcf for the reported week.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Energy giant ExxonMobil posted lower-than-expected results in fourth-quarter 2017, thanks to weak refinery throughput. This was partially offset by higher liquid price realizations. The company reported adjusted earnings of 88 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.06. Also, the bottom line fell from the year-ago quarter level of 90 cents.Production averaged 3.991 million barrels of oil-equivalent per day (MMBOE/d), lower than 4.121 MMBOE/d in the year-ago quarter. Liquid production fell year over year to 2.251 million barrels per day. However, natural gas production was 10.441 MMCF/d (millions of cubic feet per day), up from 10.424 MMCF/d in the year-ago period.During the quarter under review, ExxonMobil generated cash flow of $8.8 billion from operations and asset divestments. The energy giant returned $3.3 billion to shareholders through dividends. Capital and exploration spending surged more than 100% year over year to almost $7.6 billion. (Read more ExxonMobil Misses Q4 Earnings on Lower Throughput)2.    Smaller rival Chevron reported weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings after excluding the impacts of U.S. tax reform. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of 73 cents, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.27. However, the bottom line improved significantly from the year-ago profit of 22 cents amid the recovery in oil prices and production gains.Chevron’s total production of crude oil and natural gas increased 2.7% compared with last year’s corresponding period to 2,740 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day (MBOE/d). The U.S. output fell 1.6% year over year to 671 MBOE/d but the company’s international operations (accounting for 76% of the total) was up 4.1% to 2,069 MBOE/d.Importantly, Chevron delivered a good cash flow performance this quarter – an important gauge for the oil and gas industry – with $6,230 million in cash flow from operations, up from $3,863 million a year ago. (Read more Chevron Q4 Earnings Jump, Helped by Rising Oil Price)3.    Europe’s largest oil company Royal Dutch Shell plc reported strong fourth-quarter results on all round contribution from all its segments. In particular, rebounding commodity prices and cost cuts helped the company in coming out with better-than-expected numbers.During the quarter under review, Shell generated cash flow from operations of $7,275 million, returned $3,900 million to shareholders through dividends and spent $6,778 million on capital projects. Despite falling from the year-ago period, the company’s resilient cash generation has helped it to cover dividend payments.Shell has already aborted its two-and-a half-year long scrip dividend program as cost-containment efforts and divestment strategies have paid off. Importantly, the group raked in $6,610 million in free cash flow during the fourth quarter, up from $5,741 million a year ago.As of Dec 31, 2017, the company had $20,312 million in cash and $85,665 million in debt (including short-term debt). Net debt-to-capitalization ratio was approximately 24.8%, down from 28% a year ago following the BG Group acquisition. The improvement in the group’s debt ratio was helped by cost cuts and asset sales. (Read more Shell's Q4 Earnings Jump After Oil Prices Recover)4.    Upstream energy player ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 45 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. In the prior-year quarter, the company had posted a loss of 26 cents. The fourth-quarter results were supported by higher oil and natural gas price realizations.Production from continuing operations averaged 1,256 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED) in the quarter, lower than 1,596 MBOED in the year-ago quarter. The decline was led by planned divestment of assets.As of Dec 31, 2017, the company had total cash and cash equivalents of $6.3 billion and debt of $19.7 billion, with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 39%. In the reported quarter, ConocoPhillips generated $2.5 billion in cash from operating activities. Capital expenditures and investments totaled $1.5 billion and dividends payments grossed $319 million.ConocoPhillips got an approval from the board of directors to hike the quarterly dividend to 28.5 cents per share from 26.5 cents, representing an increase of 7.5%. The company also enhanced its share buyback program. With this, ConocoPhillips will increase share repurchases during 2018 to $2 billion from the prior projection of $1.5 billion. (Read more: ConocoPhillips Q4 Earnings Meet, Revenues Top Estimates)5.    Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC  -  Free Report) reported strong fourth-quarter 2017 results on higher refining margin. The Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company’s earnings per share came in at $1.05, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.00. Earnings surged from the year-ago period's figure by 144.2%. Specifically, refining margin of $13.12 per barrel increased versus $11.31 a year ago. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Operating income from the Refining & Marketing segment — which is the main contributor to Marathon Petroleum earnings — was $732 million compared with $166 million in the year-ago quarter. The jump reflects wider crack spread leading to stronger refining margin and higher capacity utilization.In the quarter, Marathon Petroleum spent $956 million on capital programs (51% on the Midstream segment).

451,VLO,"It was a week where the price of oil spiked to its highest settlement since June 2015. However, natural gas futures fell sharply.On the news front, Anglo-Dutch oil giant Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) announced the expansion of its electric vehicle charging business through a partnership with Munich-based venture IONITY, while Brazil’s Petrobras (PBR  -  Free Report) started oil production from its Libra field off Rio de Janeiro.Overall, it was a mixed week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 4% to close at $58.95 per barrel, natural gas prices slumped 9.2% to $2.813 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Keystone XL's Approval, BP's Buyback & More)The U.S. oil benchmark rallied to two-and-half year high on expectations that OPEC and other major producers will agree to expand their output-cut deal beyond March when they meet at the end of the month. The agreement, already renewed once, keeps 1.8 million barrels a day off the market in an attempt to clear a supply glut.Further support came from the U.S. Energy Department's inventory release, which showed a decline in crude stockpiles.The shutdown of TransCanada Corporation’s 590,000 barrel-per-day Keystone oil pipeline – one of the largest from Canada to the United States – due to a leak and subsequent cleanup operations, was also bullish for oil prices.Meanwhile, natural gas futures logged a big decline following a smaller-than-expected decrease in supplies. Unfavorable weather forecasts and strength in the commodity’s production also fueled the downside.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    In a bid to bolster its electric-vehicle (EV) charging business, European oil giant Royal Dutch Shell plc is set to collaborate with EV-focused charging operator IONITY.IONITY— one of the most significant developments in the EV infrastructure — is a joint venture (JV) formed by world’s major carmakers namely BMW Group, Daimler AG, Ford Motor Company, and Volkswagen Group with Audi and Porsche. The Munich-based JV, set up only a few weeks ago, aims at designing around 400 high-power charging stations across Europe by 2020.Per the deal, Shell is likely to launch around 80 charging networks across Europe by 2019. The charging stations will be deployed in Belgium, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. The charging points to be installed by the partnership are likely to top up the electric vehicles in around 5-8 minutes.With this deal, Shell wants to cash in on the wide acceptance of the electric cars and thereby increase customer base and revenues. Shell believes that the deal will provide customers range of refueling choices in future and bring diversification to its asset portfolio.

The offshore oil field is located 200 kilometers south of Rio de Janeiro. The Libra field — one of the biggest pre-salt oil fields in Brazil — was discovered in 2010 and has recoverable oil resources in the range of 7.9-15 billion barrels.The Brazilian state-run integrated energy company reported that production was initiated through the Pioneer of Libra floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) unit in the pre-salt of Santos Basin. The FPSO vessel is the company's first unit capable of reinjecting all the gas produced during the tests that will induce the flow of crude oil. The unit has a processing capacity of 50,000 barrels of oil and 4 million cubic meters of gas per day.Brazil has huge oil reservoirs that lie below the Espírito Santo, Campos and Santos basins in deep and ultra-deep water. These reserves, estimated to hold 50 billion barrels, are widely thought to be the most important oil finds in recent years. Petrobras is the operator in most of these exploration areas, and holds interests in the range of 20-100%.

452,VLO,"As Hurricane Harvey tore through the Texas Gulf Coast--the devastating storm just made landfall again, this time in Louisiana--workers in the U.S. oil industry have struggled to evacuate production facilities and shut down refineries. This, in turn, triggered the biggest disruption in nationwide energy supplies in years, driving gasoline prices higher at the pumps.The tropical cyclone led to heavy downpour which surpassed the all-time rainfall in Texas, according to the National Weather Service.The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) has estimated property damages in the range of $30 billion to $40 billion. In fact, the U.S. investment bank predicts third-quarter GDP growth to fall by 0.2%.Oil Refineries Face the BruntThe United States has major refining infrastructures along the Gulf of Mexico (GoM). According to The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), more than 45% of domestic oil refining capacity and around 51% of the nation’s natural gas processing capacity are located in the GoM. Super major Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) has shut down the 584,000 barrels of oil per day Baytown refinery – touted to be the second largest in the domestic market.Anglo Dutch energy giant Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) has stopped refining activities at the Deer Park unit that has the capacity to process 325,700 barrels of oil daily. Three facilities of the largest U.S. refiner Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report) – Port Arthur, Three Rivers and Corpus Christi – have been affected by the storm as well.Another downstream player Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report) is operating its Galveston Bay refinery at reduced rates.As per consulting firm WTRG Economics, the shutting down of leading gulf coast refineries translated into a daily loss of around 2 million barrels of production – mostly gasoline and diesel. Crude Output Remains Relatively UnaffectedPer the EIA, the GoM area accounts for just about 17% of total domestic crude production and 5% of total natural gas output. This is in stark contrast to a decade ago when 30% of the domestic oil volume came from the GoM region.This is mainly due to the spectacular boom in U.S. shale production. Arguably the biggest development in the global oil market over the last few years, the relentless increase in the low-cost North American shale output has taken the limelight away from the GoM. To maintain deepwater/ultra-deepwater drilling in the GoM – with its associated risks and steep costs – oil prices need to be much higher than the current level.Hence, the majority of domestic oil and natural gas production comes from shale resources. Per data provided by the EIA, roughly 48% of the domestic oil output has been generated from tight oil plays in 2016. Moreover, the U.S. produced 60% of natural gas from shale resources like Marcellus and Utica in 2016.As a result, the loss from GoM oil and gas output following Harvey is far less than that incurred in 2005, when hurricanes like Katrina and Rita had hit the region. As per the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, almost 19% of the GoM volume, which represents 331,370 barrels of crude per day, was lost thanks to Harvey. This is significantly lower than the combined loss of 1.5 million barrels a day almost 12 years ago, according to WTRG Economics.Among the few explorers that have been forced to cease operations following heavy winds and rains are Chesapeake Energy (CHK  -  Free Report) and Denbury Resources Inc. (DNR  -  Free Report). In the Eagle Ford area of Texas, Chesapeake has decided to close drilling work of two new wells. Additionally, Denbury temporarily suspended its operations at its Houston area fields. Both Chesapeake and Denbury carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.On August 25, ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) decided to stop all activities in the Eagle Ford shale region of Southern Texas. Now, the upstream player is restarting some of its Eagle Ford wells.How Did Commodity Prices React?While oil companies are in a hurry to assess damages to refineries and offshore platforms in the wake of the tropical storm, the near-term impact to prices vary.The decline in refinery operations from the temporary closure of the units led gasoline prices to jump to beyond a two-year high of $1.783 a gallon on anticipated supply outages.On the other hand, with the expectation of lower crude demand due to major refinery shut downs, oil dropped to a one-month low of $46.57 a barrel on August 28. The commodity lost further ground the following day, closing at $46.44 a barrel.Meanwhile, natural gas was down slightly on concerns of lower power and manufacturing sector demand due to temporary electricity outages. 4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye On Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

453,VLO,"Tropical storm Harvey is intensifying in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) and is predicted to become the biggest hurricane to hit Texas in the last 12 years. Energy companies are thus busy chalking out ways to counter the storm which is expected to result into a major landfall by tonight or tomorrow.Impact of Hurricane Harvey The U.S. National Hurricane Center has issued a warning of severe rainfall and heavy flooding across eastern Texas, GoM, Louisiana and the lower Mississippi Valley. The agency expects Hurricane Harvey to become a category 3 hurricane having wind velocity between 111 miles per hour (mph) and 129 mph. The hurricane is likely to cause weeks of disruptions at refineries in its path and shut units, spark fires and create supply shortage affecting facilities for months.GoM, which is expected to bear the brunt of the storm, is the energy hub of the United States. It accounts for about 18% and 5% of the total oil and gas production of the nation respectively. The region is also a home to about 50% of the country’s refining capacity. Refineries in the path of the storm have already shuttered leading to weaker crude demand and reduced gasoline supply.The sudden outages in the refineries are forcing traders to buy gasoline as they are expecting the commodity price to rise further in the future. With the anticipation of lower future crude prices, traders are selling oil.Oil prices fell by more than 2% to eventually close at $47.43 per barrel on Aug 24, owing to the anticipation of reduced demand of crude oil due to the hurricane. However, gasoline prices rose by 2.8%, resulting in a three-week high to eventually close at $1.66 per gallon.How Have Energy Players Responded?The storm has affected the operations of the energy companies and they are take measures to combat its effects. Several energy companies have suspended their offshore operations already or are in the process of evacuating their oil and gas facilities in GoM. Nearly 10% of the GoM crude output capacity were closed on Aug 24.Major energy players like Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report), Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) and Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report), all carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), have already shut their production platforms in the GoM in the wake of the expected landfall. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Anadarko Petroleum has temporarily stalled its production in Boomvang, Gunnison, Lucius and Nansen oil fields. Exxon Mobil has also planned to reduce its output at Hoover Facility in GoM and evacuate its staff from the offshore facilities. Shell has suspended production at Perdido — the deepest production platform — and evacuated the facility. Statoil ASA  is on its way toevacuate staff from the Eagle Ford shale region in South Texas.Independent refiner Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report) is keeping a close watch on its facilities in Corpus Christi as Hurricane Harvey is forecasted to douse the region. Two refineries — with refining capacity of 450,000 barrels per day of crude — were shut in Corpus Christi, the home to some of the major refineries in the nation. However Chevron Corporation and (CVX  -  Free Report) and BP p.l.c. (BP  -  Free Report) have not interrupted their operations or evacuated their facilities.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye On Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

It has amassed assets over $495.39 M, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap ValueLarge cap companies usually have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Considered a more stable option, large cap companies boast more predictable cash flows and are less volatile than their mid and small cap counterparts.While value stocks have lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, they also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates.

455,VLO,"Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report) recently acquired Pure Biofuels del Peru S.A.C. from a private-equity firm, Pegasus Capital Advisors L.P. The deal flags Valero's first investment in infrastructure in South America. Valero, which had $4.7 billion in cash and equivalents as of Mar 31, funded the deal with cash. The financial details of the deal are yet to be disclosed.Valero’s GainsPure Biofuels is the third-largest importer of fuels in Peru, and has terminals of refined products in Callao and Paita located in northern Peru. The deal provides Valero with a land adjoining the Callao terminal, which can uphold an expansion of the terminal’s storage capacity in the future. It has a product storage capacity of around one million barrel.In mid-2018, the Paita terminal is expected to come online. It has an initial product-storage capacity of 180,000 barrels and enough land for expansion in the future.Moreover, Pure Biofuels has a biodiesel production facility. The inclusion of the biodiesel unit is highly profitable for Valero since Peru blends biodiesel with fuels for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It is to be noted that Peru depends heavily on biodiesel and ethanol imports since the government introduced blending rules in 2010 and 2011 to improve the quality of air in the country.Additionally, the deal is in line with the company's strategy of enhancing product exports as well as fuels volumes. The acquired assets are also expected to enable Valero to benefit from the growing demand for fuels in South America. North America's one of the largest refining companies, Valero, along with its Gulf Coast refineries is included in this strategy, which have access to low-cost crude and natural gas.Price Performance San Antonio, TX-based Valero has gained 76.8% in the past year compared with 13.6% growth of its industry.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderValero has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Investors interested in the Energy sector can opt for some better-ranked stocks in the same space like Nine Energy Service, Inc.

456,VLO,"Hurricane Harvey is expected to be classified a Category 3 hurricane before it strikes the coast of Southeast Texas this morning, jeopardizing the oil refinery industry located in  and around Houston, the 4th largest city in the United States. This is a major hub for oil refineries, both U.S.-based and from elsewhere around the world. Rainfall could reach up to 35 inches from this storm, and flooding is the major hazard for the refinery industry.The last time a major storm hit this region was in 2008, when Hurricane Ike cost the industry roughly $30 billion, as well as more than 100 lives. Currently, Hurricane Harvey mounting the 17-foot sea wall in Galveston, TX may have devastating affects to Galveston Bay and the Houston shipping channel, one of the busiest ports in the U.S. and home to several oil refineries, such as Valero ((VLO  -  Free Report) and Marathon ((MRO  -  Free Report) and foreign-based TOTAL ((TOT  -  Free Report) and Petrobras ((PBR  -  Free Report). (And all this without Glen Campbell around any longer to sing Galveston’s praises.)Tragedy aside for a moment, if you’re looking for something to bolster oil prices, you may have just found it. Both WTI and Brent crude prices are up in this Friday pre-market, not by much but by roughly a half a percentage point. Should this hurricane be as big a disaster as some are expecting, we should see at least gasoline prices climb throughout the day and perhaps into next week.July Durable GoodsThe preliminary measure of Durable Goods orders for July was down 6.8% this morning, lower than analysts had anticipated. Subtracting Defense costs, this number blossoms to -7.8%, and ex-Transportation that figure grows to +0.5%. Combined, non-Defense, ex-Aircraft results are +0.4% for the month of July.Jackson Hole, ContinuedBoth Fed Chair Janet Yellen and European Central Bank (ECB) President Mario Draghi are scheduled to speak today at the symposium of monetary operatives in Jackson Hole, WY today. It’s the first time Draghi has appeared in three years, and back then he presaged the ECB asset-buyback program that has helped dig the EU out of its economic hole. Odds are decent (better than Conor McGregor’s chances of beating Floyd Mayweather) that Draghi will announce a dialing back of this program now that the EU is on more solid footing.

457,VLO,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a massive weekly build as domestic oil production reached another all-time high. However, product inventories (gasoline and distillate) fell sharply, which offset the bearish impact of the crude oil inventory increase.The front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures ended at $61.19 per barrel yesterday.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories rose by 5 million barrels for the week ending Mar 9, following an increase of 2.4 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go up some 2.5 million barrels.Record high domestic production led to the massive stockpile build with the world's biggest oil consumer even as imports fell and refiner demand strengthened.In particular, U.S. output rose by 12,000 barrels per day last week to nearly 10.4 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983. In early February, oil production broke through the 10 million barrels a day threshold for the first time in nearly 50 years and has maintained the record levels thereafter.While oil inventories rose for a third successive week, stockpiles have shrunk in 35 of the last 49 weeks and are down more than 100 million barrels since April last year. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 430.9 million barrels, current crude supplies are 18.4% below the year-ago period and are in the bottom half of the average range during this time of the year.Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was up by 338,000 barrels to 28.5 million barrels. It is the first time in 12 weeks that Cushing inventories have increased after dropping to the lowest level since December 2014.The crude supply cover was up from 26.7 days in the previous week to 26.9 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 34.1 days.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies recorded their second weekly decrease in a row as demand strengthened. The 6.3 million barrels draw – significantly above the polled number of 500,000 barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles down to 244.8 million barrels. Following last week’s hefty decline, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains just below the year-earlier level though it is in the top half of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) were down 4.4 million barrels last week, comfortably exceeding analysts’ expectations for 1.6 million barrels decrease in supply level. The weekly fall could be attributed to lower production and imports. At 133.1 million barrels, current supplies are 15.4% below the year-ago level and are in the lower half of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 2% from the prior week to 90%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.The data from EIA generally acts as a catalyst for crude prices and affect producers, such as ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), and refiners such as Valero Energy (VLO  -  Free Report), Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) and Marathon Petroleum (MPC  -  Free Report).Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?If you are looking for a near-term energy play, Concho Resources Inc.

458,VLO,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded an unexpected weekly build. The report further revealed that gasoline inventories increased slightly from previous week, while distillate stocks recorded a fall.Meanwhile, refinery activity improved. However, the talking point from the data sets was the steady trend of rising domestic oil production that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market.As a result, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures shed 0.7% (or 37 cents) to $55.33 per barrel Wednesday – the lowest settlement since Nov 2. The commodity fell further yesterday, finishing at $55.14 (down 19 cents or 0.3%).Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories increased by 1.9 million barrels for the week ending Nov 10, following a rise of 2.2 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some one million barrels.Record high domestic production and higher imports led to the surprise stockpile build with the world's biggest oil consumer. In particular, U.S. output rose by 25,000 barrels per day last week to more than 9.6 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983.While oil inventories rose for a second successive week, stockpiles have shrunk in 24 of the last 32 weeks and are down more than 75 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 459 million barrels, current crude supplies are 6.4% below the year-ago period though they are in the upper half of the average range during this time of the year.Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was down by 1.5 million barrels to 63.1 million barrels.The crude supply cover was down from 28.7 days in the previous week to 28.3 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 31.2 days.Gasoline: Supplies of gasoline were up for the first time in four weeks as demand weakened. The 894,000 barrels addition – contrary to the polled number of 1 million barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 210.4 million barrels. Despite last week’s increase, the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains 5.1% below the year-earlier level but is in the middle of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) went down by 799,000 barrels last week, compared with analysts’ expectations for 2 million barrels decrease in supply level. The marginal weekly fall could be attributed to weakening demand. At 124.8 million barrels, current supplies are 16.2% below the year-ago level and are in the bottom half of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 1.4% from the prior week to 91%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products.

459,VLO,"Independent oil refiner and marketer Andeavor (ANDV  -  Free Report) is set to release third-quarter 2017 results after the closing bell on Nov 8.San Antonio, TX-based downstream operator Andeavor — which counts Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report), Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report) and Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) among its peers — posted a positive earnings surprise of 20.25% in the preceding quarter on significant contribution from the logistics and refining segments.  Coming to earnings surprise history, the company has an impressive record. The company has topped estimates in each of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 40.70%.Which Way Are the Estimates Headed?Let’s take a look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of analyst opinion on the stock before the earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.05 for third-quarter earnings has been revised upward by 13.4% over the last 30 days. Further, the earnings estimates for the current year have also moved up by 3 cents at $6.82.These surging earnings estimate revisions signal promising prospects about Andeavor. Andeavor Price and EPS Surprise  Andeavor Price and EPS Surprise | Andeavor Quote Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model also shows that Andeavor is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Andeavor’s Earnings ESP is +6.38%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $3.25, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.05. A favorable ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.    Zacks Rank: Valero currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Valero’s favorable Zacks Rank and a positive ESP makes us reasonably optimistic of an earnings beat.Factors at PlayApart from bolstering its network of assets, downstream operator Western Refining’s buyout is likely to help Andeavor enhance its geographic footprint in the prolific Permian Basin, driving double-digit earnings growth in 2018.Andeavor expects throughput level for the third quarter between 1,090 MBbl/d and 1,145 MBbl/d. This is higher than the 873 MBbl/d recorded in the year-ago quarter and 893 MBbl/d recorded in the prior quarter. With throughput set to be higher, we expect the company to report solid quarterly results.Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $11,629 million for the third quarter, up 77.7% and 48.2% from the year-ago and prior quarter respectively.During the quarter, Andeavor strengthened its geographical foothold and began operations in Mexico with the opening of the first ARCO gas station in Tijuana. The development is likely to contribute to earnings and provide long-term growth opportunities.We also appreciate the company’s strong balance sheet with high liquidity and low leverage ratios.The positive factors are also reflected in the share price of Andeavor which rallied 10.2% during the quarter. Further, year-to-date, shares of the company have rose 26% compared the 7% gain recorded by the industry.Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius. Click for details >>

460,VLO,"Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 1, before the market opens.Last quarter, the leading refining player delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.37%, courtesy of higher throughput margin. Moreover, earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, the average positive surprise being 10.26%.Which Way Are Estimates Headed?Let’s take a look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture on the stock before the earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings of $1.11has been revised downward over the last 30 days, with five firms being bearish and one firm taking a bullish stance. The consensus estimate reflects year-over-year improvement of about 37%.Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $22,523 million for the fourth quarter, up 8.7% from the year-ago quarter.Factors to ConsiderAmong independent refiners, Valero Energy has the most diverse refinery base. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating income of VLP segment for the fourth quarter is pegged at $71 million, up from $69 million reported in the preceding quarter.The company’s strong balance sheet as reflected from the rising cash balance since 2015 is encouraging. Moreover, the overhaul of the nation’s tax code is expected to bolster the refiners. With the implementation of the law, the corporate income tax will be lowered from 35% to 21%.However, the company’s escalating debt levels over the past six quarters are a concern. From no long-term debt as of December 2015, Valero Energy’s long-term debt is currently at $8.4 billion.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating income of ethanol segment for the fourth quarter is pegged at $1 million, down from $82 million reported in the preceding quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating income of refining segment for the fourth quarter is pegged at $933 million, down from $1,429 million reported in the preceding quarter. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for throughput margin per barrel from Valero’s refining operations stands at $9, lower than $10.94 in the preceding quarter. Lower expected throughput margin will likely lead the lower projected profit for refining segment.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Valero Energy is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is -5.58%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $1.04, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is at $1.11. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Valero Energy carries a Zacks Rank #3.Conversely, we caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Q4 Price PerformanceDuring the quarter, Valero Energy’s shares have rallied 19.5% compared with the industry’s 15% gain.    Stocks to ConsiderThough earnings beat looks uncertain for Valero Energy, here are some firms that you may want to consider on the basis of our model. These have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Headquartered in Irving, TX, Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) is an independent oil and gas exploration and production company.

461,VLO,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded another weekly draw to the lowest level since 2015. As a result, the front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures moved up 1.8% (or $1.14) to end at $65.61 per barrel yesterday – the highest settlement since December 2014.But the positive effect from the record tenth straight crude inventory withdrawal was partly offset by builds in gasoline and distillate supplies. On a further bearish note, domestic oil production revisited its rising trend that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 1.1 million barrels for the week ending Jan 19, following a decrease of 6.9 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 1.6 million barrels.An uptick in exports led to the stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consumer. However, the withdrawal failed to match expectations as U.S. output edged up 128,000 barrels per day last week to 9.9 million barrels per day – tantalizingly close to the all-time record of just over 10 million barrels per day set in 1970.Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 34 of the last 42 weeks and are down almost 122 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 411.6 million barrels, current crude supplies are 15.7% below the year-ago period and the lowest since February 2015 though they are in the middle of the average range during this time of the year.Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was down by 3.2 million barrels to three-year lows of 39.2 million barrels.The crude supply cover was up from 23.9 days in the previous week to 24.1 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 29.5 days.Gasoline: Supplies of gasoline were up for the eleventh straight week on the strength of imports. The 3.1 million barrels addition – more than the polled number of 2.1 million barrels rise in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 244 million barrels. Despite last week’s increase, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains 3.6% below the year-earlier level and is in the middle of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) gained 639,000 barrels last week, contrary to analysts’ expectations for 2.5 million barrels decrease in supply level. The weekly rise could be attributed to tepid demand. But at 139.8 million barrels, current supplies are still 17.3% below the year-ago level and are in the lower half of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was down by 2.1% from the prior week to 90.9%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products.

The latest addition takes the total authorization to $3.7 billion.The moves are expected to benefit Valero – scheduled to release its fourth-quarter and full year 2017 earnings on Feb 1, 2018 –  in the coming quarters. While the dividend hike is expected to help it retain shareholders’ confidence, the share repurchase will boost shareholder value.Investors should also know that it generates higher dividend yields than its industry. While the industry has a dividend yield of 2.52%, Valero’s yield is 2.84%. About ValeroSan Antonio, TX-based Valero is among the largest independent refiner and marketers of petroleum products in the United StatesAmong all the independent refiners, Valero offers the most diversified refinery base.

464,VLO,"The United States has pulled out of the landmark deal curbing Iran’s nuclear program and reimposing sanctions on the Islamic Republic. Trump said that it was a “horrible one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made.” He added that the “Iran deal is defective at its core” and it’s an “embarrassment” that the United States did little to restrain Iran’s nuclear ambition.In the run-up to the U.S. decision, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed that he has evidence that the nuclear deal was nothing but fabrications and Iran was hiding nuclear weapons. Trump agreed that Netanyahu’s claims corroborated his own view.So, what is the Iran nuclear deal? It was a historic agreement reached by Iran and several other world powers including Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States to reduce the Islamic Republic’s ability to produce two major components of nuclear weapons — plutonium and uranium. In return, Iran will be able spared of crippling financial sanctions. The deal also permitted Iran to export more crude provided the nation restricted its nuclear activities.Let us now take a look at the potential winners and losers emerging from the end of the Iran nuclear deal:Oil Near $70, Energy Stocks GainWith the United States poised to reimpose sanctions on Iran’s petroleum sales, oil prices initially dropped but rebounded soon after. This has disrupted global oil production at a time when the crude market is tight. The international benchmark, Brent crude oil, rose as high as 3.1% to $77.20 in early trading in London on May 9, while the benchmark price for U.S. crude oil climbed to $70.93. Shares of energy companies are, undoubtedly, rallying as crude prices hover near $70 a barrel. Energy shares are looking up after they fell out of favor when oil price slipped from $100 a barrel to under $30 in 2014. In fact, the energy sector of the S&P 500 has risen more than 10% in the past month to total gains of 3.1% so far this year.From exploration and production firm Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) and Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report) to petroleum refiner Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report), all have seen a rally in shares of more than 20% to date, easily outperforming the broader S&P 500’s decline of less than 0.1%. Meanwhile, smaller energy equipment and services companies, whose shares tend to rise with an uptick in oil prices, have gained even more.At the same time, companies like Encana Corporation, Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY  -  Free Report) and Pioneer Natural Resources Company’s (PXD  -  Free Report) earnings are poised to improve further as oil prices scale north. This is because these companies have already posted better results in the most recent quarter when oil prices were between $50 and $60 a barrel.As oil continues to hover around $70 a barrel and is probably heading toward $80 soon, these energy players will not only make the most of the higher spot prices but will also hedge into next year at higher oil prices.But let’s admit that it’s just not oil prices that are changing investors’ attitude toward energy companies. Stronger balance sheets, steady rise in profitability and focus to boost shareholders’ returns are shaping the turnaround in the energy space.Oil majors Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) have already seen the best first-quarter performance in years last month. In all, the highest first quarter year-over-year earnings growth is likely to be recorded in the energy sector, which is expected to surge 73.9% from the same period last year on 14.4% higher revenues.Given this bullishness, some of the top-ranked energy shares one could consider are Evolution Petroleum Corporation (EPM  -  Free Report), Pioneer Energy Services Corp. (PES  -  Free Report), Oasis Midstream Partners LP (OMP  -  Free Report) and Rice Midstream Partners LP (RMP  -  Free Report). These stocks flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of A or B. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three metrics. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners (read more: Oil Hits $70 for First Time in 4 Years: 5 Top Energy Picks).Travel Shares Go Down, Boeing in TroubleThe surge in oil prices incited investors to dump travel and leisure stocks, put off by the prospect of increasing fuel costs for airlines. Travel and leisure stocks dropped as much as 2.1% on May 8.Trump’s announcement to withdraw from what he considers a “defective” Iranian nuclear deal, in the meantime, is expected to heighten tensions in the Middle East region. This doesn’t bode well for The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report). The airline manufacturer stands to lose a whopping $20 billion in business with Iran. After all, it has an agreement to sell around 110 planes worth the said amount to Iranian airlines.The U.S. withdrawal also affected Boeing’s French rival Airbus SE, which had a multibillion-dollar sale planned. IranAir has ordered nearly 80 passenger aircraft from Airbus.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All                 Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

465,VLO,"Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report) recently inked a deal worth $23.3 billion to acquire its rival Andeavor (ANDV  -  Free Report), marking the biggest-ever deal by an oil refiner, in a bid to become the top independent refiner in the United States.  When the mega-acquisition deal will culminate, it is likely to give all the leading refiners a run for their money. The combined company is set to create the largest U.S. refiner in terms of refining capacity, surpassing Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report) that currently holds the position. The new entity will also create a nationwide refining giant in terms of market capitalization, taking over the crown from Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report).Post the announcement of the deal, shares of Marathon Petroleum have declined 8% to close at $74.91 on Apr 30. It further slid almost 2.7% yesterday to close at $72.90. This reflects investors’ disappointment toward the pricey deal, considering that Marathon is paying a hefty premium for Andeavor’s shares. However, many analysts still find the premium reasonable, owing to the synergies associated with the deal and long-term opportunities it could provide.On the other hand, Andeavor’s share price rose more than 13% to close at $138.32 on Apr 30. However, shares have declined about 3.5% yesterday to stand at $133.48.Deal DetailsMarathon Petroleum has agreed to buy all the outstanding shares of Andeavor’s representing a total equity value of $23.3 billion. The deal also assumes Andeavor’s debt, thus pushing the total value of the transaction to $35.6 billion.Investors in Andeavor can choose to receive $152.27 per share in cash or 1.87 shares of Marathon Petroleum in exchange of their current shareholdings.Marathon’s bid represents 24% premium to Andeavor’s closing share price of $122.38 on Apr 27, thus valuing Andeavor at $152.27 a share.The transaction has been unanimously approved by the board of directors of both the companies. Subject to satisfactory closing conditions, along with shareholders’ consent and other regulatory approvals, the deal is set for closure in the second quarter of 2018.Post the culmination of the deal, Marathon will own 66% stake in the combined entity, while Andeavor will hold the remaining 34% interest.Deal MotiveMarathon Petroleum’s operations are focused on the Gulf Coast and Midwest while Andeavor’s refinery activities are mainly concentrated in California, the Mid-Continent and Pacific Northwest. The complementary asset base has been the key driver of the deal.The buyout will integrate the premier assets of both the companies, bolstering the scale and leadership position of the combined entity in the region. The deal will enable the companies to pool their expertise and share their best practices, thereby enhancing buying power in securing services in the region.The deal comes at an opportune time as the U.S. refiners are set to benefit from the record U.S. shale output. The combined entity also looks well positioned to capitalize from regulations to lower pollution levels from ships. Andeavor’s port assets in California along with Marathon Petroleum’s facilities in the U.S. Gulf Coast will allow the new entity to sell lower-sulfur ship fuel.Deal BenefitsThe deal expands the geographical footprint of Marathon Petroleum in attractive markets, expanding its foothold in the Permian Basin, thereby creating an enviable retail and marketing portfolio. The combined entity will have a processing capacity of more than 3 million barrels per day (bpd) at 16 refineries spread across the country, selling fuel via 7,800 branded filling stations. The deal makes the company the largest U.S. refiner and the fifth largest in the world by capacity.Additionally, the strategic acquisition is expected to lead to significant commercial, financial and operational synergies, due to the integration of asset, systems and staff. The agreement is expected to result in operational synergies of around $1 billion within the first three years. The deal is expected to be immediately accretive to Marathon Petroleum’s earnings and cash flows. Based on the forecasted cash-flow generation, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has also approved share buybacks of $5 billion.

466,VLO,"Launched on 12/02/2015, the SPDR Russell 1000 Yield Focus ETF (ONEY  -  Free Report) is a passively managed exchange traded fund designed to provide a broad exposure to the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.The fund is sponsored by State Street Global Advisors. It has amassed assets over $392.76 M, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap ValueCompanies that find themselves in the large cap category typically have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Overall, they are usually a stable option, with less risk and more sure-fire cash flows than mid and small cap companies.Value stocks are known for their lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, but investors should also note their lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. Considering long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in almost all markets; however, they are more likely to underperform growth stocks in strong bull markets.CostsInvestors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.20%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 3.33%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk.

The Russell 1000 Yield Focused Factor Index reflects the performance of a segment of large-capitalization U.S. equity securities demonstrating a combination of core factors high value, high quality, and low size characteristics, with a focus factor comprising high yield characteristics.The ETF has lost about -1.86% so far this year and was up about 7.34% in the last one year (as of 05/02/2018).

Because of this, ONEY is an outstanding option for investors seeking exposure to the Large Cap ETFs segment of the market. There are other additional ETFs in the space that investors could consider as well.The Vanguard Value ETF (VTV  -  Free Report) and the iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD  -  Free Report) track a similar index.

VTV has an expense ratio of 0.05% and IWD charges 0.20%.Bottom-LineWhile an excellent vehicle for long term investors, passively managed ETFs are a popular choice among institutional and retail investors due to their low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.

467,VLO,"It was a week where oil prices ended modestly down but natural gas futures tilted higher.On the news front, U.S.-based integrated major Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) and European counterpart Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) reported strong numbers, helped by rebounding commodity prices. However, world's largest publicly traded oil company Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) and France-based TOTAL S.A. (TOT  -  Free Report) came up with weaker-than-expected earnings reports despite higher oil realizations.Overall, it was a mixed week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures edged down 0.4% to close at $68.10 per barrel, natural gas prices gained about 1.2% to $2.771 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Schlumberger & Halliburton's Q1, TOTAL's Acquisition & More)The oil benchmark was little changed as the upside from the possibility of United States re-imposing sanctions on Iran was more than offset by bearish EIA crude inventory numbers.Of late, crude prices have been supported by indications that the Trump administration might lead America's exit from the landmark Iran nuclear deal if the European allies do not agree to toughen the terms by May 12. The return of sanctions would put pressure on OPEC’s third-largest oil producer’s energy industry and reduce global supply.But the Iran-induced gains were overshadowed by the Energy Department's inventory release, which revealed a surprise weekly build in crude stockpiles. A rise in the oil drilling rig count – pointing to an increase in domestic output – also played spoilsport.Meanwhile, natural gas prices moved northward last week following a larger-than-expected decrease in supplies. Investors were encouraged by another unseasonal inventory drawdown that further pushed back the commencement of the injection season.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Energy giant Exxon Mobil posted lower-than-expected earnings in first-quarter 2018, thanks to plunge in oil equivalent production, decreased refinery throughput and lower margins at the chemical business. This was partially offset by increased price realizations from liquids. To be precise, the company reported earnings of $1.09 per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.14.Days before the earnings release, Exxon Mobil board of directors approved a hike in the quarterly dividend. The second-quarter 2018 dividend was 82 cents per share, higher than 77 cents in the first quarter.Production averaged 3.889 million barrels of oil-equivalent per day (MMBOE/d), lower than 4.151 MMBOE/d in the year-ago quarter. Liquid production fell year over year to 2.216 million barrels per day. Moreover, natural gas production was 10.038 MMCF/d (millions of cubic feet per day), down from 10.908 MMCF/d in the year-ago quarter.During the quarter under review, Exxon Mobil generated cash flow of $9.9 billion from operations and asset divestments, marking the highest level since 2014. The energy giant returned $3.3 billion to shareholders through dividends. Capital and exploration spending rose roughly 17% year over year to almost $4.9 billion. (Read more Exxon Mobil Falls on Q1 Earnings Miss, Beats on Sales)2.    Smaller rival Chevron saw its shares rise almost 2% on Friday after reporting stronger-than-expected first-quarter earnings amid the recovery in oil prices and production gains. The company reported earnings per share of $1.90, significantly ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.45.Quarterly revenues of $37,764 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $38,737 on refining weakness but was up 13% year over year.Chevron’s total production of crude oil and natural gas increased 6.6% compared with last year’s corresponding period to 2,852 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day (MBOE/d). The U.S. output rose 9.1% year over year to 733 MBOE/d but the company’s international operations (accounting for 74% of the total) was up 5.7% to 2,119 MBOE/d.Importantly, Chevron delivered a good cash flow performance this quarter – an important gauge for the oil and gas industry – with $5,043 million in cash flow from operations, up from $3,777 million a year ago.(Read more Chevron Shares Gain After Posting Big Q1 Earnings Beat)3.    Europe’s largest oil company Royal Dutch Shell reported strong first-quarter results as rebounding commodity prices and continued improvement of its integrated gas unit helped the company in coming out with better-than-expected numbers.The Hague-based Shell reported earnings per ADS (on a current cost of supplies basis, excluding items - the market’s preferred measure) of $1.28, going past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.24. Revenues of $91,114 million also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $81,020 million.During the quarter under review, Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) Shell generated cash flow from operations of $9,427 million, returned $4,000 million to shareholders through dividends and spent $5,183 million on capital projects. Despite falling marginally from the year-ago period, the company’s resilient cash generation has helped it to cover cash dividend payments and interest. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Shell has already aborted its two-and-a half-year long scrip dividend program as cost-containment efforts and divestment strategies have paid off. Importantly, the group raked in $5,178 million in free cash flow during the first quarter. (Read more Shell's Q1 Earnings Jump on Higher Commodity Prices)4.    French supermajor TOTAL S.A. reported first-quarter 2018 operating earnings of $1.09 per share (€0.89 per share), lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.12 by 2.7%. The bottom line improved 8% from the year-ago figure of $1.01 (€0.95 per share). This was due to solid operational performance, steadily decreasing manufacturing costs and new project ramp ups, boosting production.Total hydrocarbon production during the first quarter averaged a record 2,703 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 5% year over year. The increase was due to higher contribution from Kashagan, Moho Nord, Fort Hills, Edradour-Glenlivet and Yamal LNG, partially offset by natural field decline and PSC price effect. Improved security condition in Libya and Nigeria also boosted production.Cash and cash equivalents as of Mar 31, 2018 were $30.09 billion, compared with $27.52 billion as of Mar 31, 2017. Net debt-to-equity ratio was 15.1% at the end of the quarter, down from 18.1% at the end of first-quarter 2017.Cost-reduction initiatives have resulted in cost savings of $3.7 billion in 2017 and the company aims to save more than $4 billion in 2018. TOTAL’s upstream production is expected to increase 6% in 2018, in sync with its objective to grow 5% per year on an average between 2016 and 2020. (Read more TOTAL Q1 Earnings Miss, Production at Record High)5.    Upstream energy player ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of 96 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 74 cents. Revenues of $8,961 million steered past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8,680 million. The strong first-quarter results were supported by higher oil and natural gas price realizations.Production from continuing operations averaged 1,269 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED) in the quarter, lower than 1,593 MBOED in the year-ago quarter. The decline was led by divestment of assets and decline of field.As of Mar 31, 2018, the company had total cash and cash equivalents of $5.2 billion and debt of $17.1 billion, with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 36%. In the reported quarter, ConocoPhillips generated $2.4 billion in cash from operating activities. Capital expenditures and investments totaled $1.5 billion and dividends payments grossed $338 million.ConocoPhillips reiterated its 2018 capital spending at $5.5 billion. For the April-to-June quarter of this year, the company projects production in the range of 1,170-1,210 MBOED. For 2018, the company’s production projection was raised from 1,195 -1,235 MBOED to 1,200-1,240 MBOED.(Read more ConocoPhillips Beats on Q1 Earnings, Lifts Output View)Price PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of some the major oil and gas players over the past week and during the last 6 months.CompanyLast Week Last 6 MonthsXOM-1.5%-7.3%CVX+3.5%+8%COP-1.3%+24.8%OXY+0.7%+13.8%SLB-0.2%+8.4%RIG+0.6%+18%VLO+1.1%+37.4%ANDV+3.9%+26.7%Contrary to the week’s mildly negative oil market sentiment, the Energy Select Sector SPDR – a popular way to track energy companies – generated a +0.7% return last week.

Another independent refiner,Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report), is far and away the major gainer during this period, experiencing a 37.4% price fall.What’s Next in the Energy World?As usual, market participants will be closely tracking the regular releases i.e. the U.S. government statistics on oil and natural gas -- one of the few solid indicators that comes out regularly. Energy traders will also be focusing on the Baker Hughes data on rig count.However, the 2018 Q1 earnings again remain the primary focus this week, with a number of S&P 500 members coming out with quarterly results.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

468,VLO,"It was a week where the price of oil finished lower and natural gas futures also pulled back from their highest levels since May.On the news front, oilfield service majors Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report) and Halliburton Co. (HAL  -  Free Report) kicked off the fourth-quarter energy earnings season. Importantly, both companies, apart from coming out with estimate beating numbers, indicated that activity in North America remain strong even as the international market continues to improve. Meanwhile, British oil giant BP plc (BP  -  Free Report) saw its Deepwater Horizon costs spill over $65 billion following a new, $1.7 billion charge in the fourth-quarter.Overall, it was a dismal week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost about 1.5% to close at $63.37 per barrel, while natural gas prices edged down 0.5% to $3.185 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Shell's Acquisition, Apache & Encana's Production Guidance & More)The U.S. oil benchmark recorded its first weekly decline in a month. The major culprit was the steady trend of rising domestic oil production that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market. U.S. output rose by 258,000 barrels per day last week to 9.75 million barrels per day, tantalizingly close to December’s record of 9.789 million barrels per day -- the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983. In fact, the Energy Department believes that U.S. output will break through the 10 million barrels per day barrier soon, thereby cancelling out cuts from OPEC and its allies.The negative sentiment was partially offset by another higher-than-expected weekly draw. Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 33 of the last 41 weeks and are down more than 120 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 412.7 million barrels, current crude supplies are 15% below the year-ago period and the lowest since 2015.Meanwhile, natural gas – one of 2017’s worst-performing commodities – settled lower following a smaller-than-expected decrease in supplies. The 183 billion cubic feet (Bcf) withdrawal was also below the five-year (2013-2017) average net shrinkage of 203 Bcf for the reported week, pointing to tepid demand for the heating fuel.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    The world’s largest oilfield services provider, Schlumberger, reported fourth-quarter 2017 earnings of 48 cents per share (excluding charges and credits), ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents and the year-ago figure of 27 cents.Surge in SIS software sales, ramp up of drilling operations in Colombia and Argentina along with higher pricing in North America’s onshore market supported the strong fourth-quarter results.On a further positive note, Schlumberger issued a positive outlook for 2018. The company, which plans to exit its marine and land seismic acquisition services, believes that the positive oil market sentiment will push up North American investment by upstream operators. Meanwhile, the international market is expected to witness 5% higher spending in 2018 following three years of decline.As of Dec 31, 2017, the company had approximately $5,089 million in cash and short-term investments and $14,875 million in long-term debt. This represents a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 32.8%. In the October-to-December quarter, Schlumberger bought back 1.6 million shares. (Read more Schlumberger's Q4 Earnings Beat Estimates, Up Y/Y)2.    Smaller rival Halliburton reported better-than-expected fourth quarter profit thanks to improved utilization and pricing gains in North America -- the company’s largest market by sales. Halliburton’s income from continuing operation (adjusted for Venezuela write-downs and charges associated with U.S. tax reform) came in at 53 cents per share, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents – the fourteenth consecutive quarterly outperformance. Moreover, revenues of $5,940 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,567 million.Along the results, Halliburton also sounded optimistic in its view that the North American land market is improving rapidly, driven by increased utilization and pricing, particularly for pressure pumping.Additionally, the outlook for Halliburton’s international market continues to improve. In fact, regional sales were up 11% sequentially in the fourth-quarter on the back of strong activity gains across a number of product services lines in Latin America, as well as increases in drilling and stimulation activity in the Eastern Hemisphere.Halliburton’s capital expenditure in the fourth quarter was $439 million. For the full year, capital spending was $1,373 million. As of Dec 31, 2017, the company had approximately $2,337 million in cash/cash equivalents and $10,430 million in long-term debt, representing a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 55.5%.

The Court Supervised Settlement Program (""CSSP""), which was established post the DWH, has ordered BP to pay a post-tax non-operating charge of about $1.7 billion for the remaining Business Economic Loss (""BEL"") and other claims related with the CSSP. The payment will be carried out over a multi-year period.The high claims determined by the CSSP along with the effect of the Fifth Circuit’s adverse May 2017 ruling on the matching of revenues with expenses while appraising BEL claims has resulted in this charge.The claims are about seven times higher than the company’s expectations. By the end of September 2017, BP paid about $63.4 billion to cover clean-up costs and legal fees connected to the largest environmental disaster in the U.S. history where 11 rig workers were killed. Moreover, hundreds of outstanding claims have yet to be closed.

However, there won’t be any quarterly distributions for the Class B units in the first year following the closure of the transaction, which is expected by the first half of 2018.The deal is expected to strengthen Energy Transfer Partners' balance sheet by lowering its debt burden. As of Sep 30, 2017, the partnership had long-term debt (less current maturities) of $33,630 million. Debt-to-capitalization ratio was about 52.2%. Apart from reducing the debt load, the cash proceeds of $1.225 billion can also be used for funding new projects. The move also reduces the chance of the partnership slashing its distribution – currently yielding an attractive 11.3% – in the coming quarters. (Read more Energy Transfer Partners Divests Compression Units for $1.8B)5.    Moving forward with its $30-billion divestment goal, Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) is set to offload West Qurna 1 oil field in Iraq to Japan's Itochu Corporation. However, the value of the transaction has been kept under wraps.The Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company also intends to close the divestment of its interest in the Majnoon oil field in Iraq to the state-run Basra Oil Company by June 2018. Production in the Majnoon oil field started in 2014, with average capacity of 210,000 barrels per day. It is to be noted, Shell has a 45% operating stake in the Majnoon oil field. Malaysian national petroleum company, Petronas and Iraq’s Missan Oil Company have 30% and 25% stakes in the field, respectively.The primary reason behind Shell leaving Majnoon is that the oil department of the country and the company could not agree on the future production plans and investments for the field. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The divestment is in line with Shell's strategy to steer clear of debt stemming from its $50-billion acquisition of BG Group. The move will also help the company to upgrade and streamline its portfolio.

469,VLO,"It was a week where oil prices briefly crossed the key mark of $50. Natural gas futures rallied too as warmer forecasts continue raising expectations for demand.On the news front, European oil major BP plc (BP  -  Free Report) and its international partners have agreed to pay Azerbaijan $3.6 billion to extend an oilfield contract for 25 more years, offshore drilling company SeaDrill Limited  filed for bankruptcy protection, while small oil and gas explorer Resolute Energy Corporation (REN  -  Free Report) sold properties in the Paradox Basin in southeastern Utah for up to $195 million.Overall, it was a good week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures jumped 5.1% to close at $49.89 per barrel, while natural gas prices gained 4.6% to $3.024 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: BP Launches U.S. Pipeline IPO, Shell Enters Mexican Fuel Market.)The U.S. oil benchmark closed at its highest level since Jul 31 as traders held out hope for price stability amid an improving supply-demand narrative. Data showing the number of U.S. oil rigs dropping for a second straight week helped cement those gains.Energy bodies OPEC and IEA both recently raised global oil demand forecasts for this year, helping to tighten the market significantly. Further, the Paris-based IEA said that the global oil supply had come down by 720,000 per day last month to 97.7 million barrels on outages and maintenance in non-OPEC countries.Meanwhile, according to the OPEC’s latest monthly report, the oil cartel’s production fell by 79,000 barrels a day in August to 32.76 million as output dropped in Libya, Gabon, Venezuela and Iraq. This points to the success of the 14-member group’s output curb initiatives and rising compliance levels.Adding to the positive momentum, OPEC and fellow exporters are said to be open to extending their production cut agreement beyond its March expiry.The number of active rigs drilling for crude in the U.S. – an indicator of oil industry activity – fell by 7 to 749 as of Friday, as per data from oilfield services firm Baker Hughes Inc.Meanwhile, bullish weather forecasts and lower-than-expected power loss from Hurricane Irma propelled natural gas futures despite an above-average build.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Oil giant BP plc along with its co-venturers has inked a modified and restated Azeri-Chirag-Deepwater Gunashli (ACG) field production sharing agreement (PSA), which calls for a one-time payment of $3.6 billion to the State Oil Fund of the Republic of Azerbaijan. Per the new agreement, Azerbaijan's government has extended the production sharing deal for the country’s massive ACG oilfields until 2049. The current deal was slated to end in 2024. Under the new accord, State Oil Company of the Republic of Azerbaijan (“SOCAR”) has increased its shareholding to 25% from 11.65%. BP’s shareholding has dropped to 30.37% from 35.8%, though it continues to be the operator of the field.Located in the Azerbaijan Sector of the Caspian Sea, the first PSA for the ACG field was inked in 1994. The field has received investments of over $33 billion and has yielded about 440 million tons of oil. This has aided the country to rake in a direct net profit of $125 billion. Total production from ACG averaged 585,000 barrels per day during the first half of the year.The extended contract is a major milestone for BP amid the ongoing price volatility. It will provide regular revenues to the company for almost the next three decades and also increases the company’s backlog. (Read more BP & Partners Ink Deal to Extend PSA for ACG Field till 2049.)2.    International offshore drilling company SeaDrill Limited filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Sep 12 to restructure its balance sheet amid volatile oil prices. Following the development, shares of the company rose more than 20% to eventually close at 23 cents on Sep 12. The stock scaled up further more than 21% yesterday. The rise reflects investors’ optimism as the company finally managed to secure a restructuring agreement after 18 months of negotiations. The agreement will provide the company with more than $1 billion of capital to restructure its highly leveraged financials.Due to the plunge in oil prices since 2014, energy companies reduced their spending and slashed rig hires. Demand for drilling reduced further as the rigs ordered during the boom period led to oversupply. This in turn led to reduced activities and diminishing contracts for Seadrill which negatively impacted the company’s revenues, earnings and cash flows. Increased costs, idle rigs and low dayrates led to high operating losses and affected the market capitalization of the company adversely. SeaDrill, being one of the worst sufferers of the downturn has been battling with around $14 billion debts and liabilities.The company expects to emerge from Chapter 11 in six to nine months. The restructuring deal will not affect the day-to-day business operations of SeaDrill as the company expects to pay employees, suppliers and vendors as usual. The company which has more than $1 billion in cash will not require debtor-in-possession financing. (Read more: SeaDrill Files for Bankruptcy Protection, Shares Up.)3.    In a bid to transform itself into a Delaware Basin pure play, upstream player Resolute Energy Corporation recently inked a deal to divest assets in the Paradox Basin in southeastern Utah for up to $195 million.Per the deal, Resolute Energy will sell the Aneth Field assets in the Paradox Basin to an affiliate of Elk Petroleum Limited. Aneth is one of the largest carbon dioxide enhanced oil recovery field projects in the Rocky Mountains with a production capacity of 6,500 barrels of oil per day. The oilfield contains around 1.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent, out of which just 31% has been recovered yet.Proceeds from the deal will be used to pay the outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility of Resolute Energy. This will help the company to reduce its leverage ratio and strengthen its financials. Employees of Aneth Field will also make a transition to Elk Petroleum reducing the future overhead expenses of Resolute Energy by $6 million along with $3 million in stock-based compensation. The deal will also lower the lease operating expenses of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The transaction not only aims at improving the cost structure of the company, it also makes Resolute Energy become a pure play in the Delaware Basin - one of the most productive and economically viable oil and gas fields in the United States.

(OAS  -  Free Report) recently filed for the initial public offering (IPO) of its pipeline unit Oasis Midstream Partners LP. The company launched an IPO of 7,500,000 common units with an expected price range of $19-$21 per unit.  Oasis Midstream – to be listed in the NYSE under the ticker HESM – intends to raise around $150 million at a price of $20. The partnership is expected to grant underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 1,125,000 common units.About 27.3% of the ownership stake is being sold in the IPO and the figure is likely to reach 31.4% if the underwriters purchase the additional common units. Post the closure of the IPO, Oasis Petroleum and its affiliates will own either a 72.7% limited partner interest in Oasis Midstream or a 68.6% interest in case the underwriters exercise their full option to purchase the additional units.Oasis Midstream, which was created in 2013, reported revenues of $140 million for the trailing 12 months ending Jun 30. The partnership’s operations are located exclusively in the Williston Basin area of North Dakota and Montana. The assets include a diversified portfolio of midstream assets which are strategically positioned to secure volumes from various producers. These assets mainly include crude oil /natural gas gathering and transportation system and water handling systems.

(MMP  -  Free Report) for the expansion of the Pasadena marine storage facility. It is to be noted that a limited liability firm – jointly owned by Valero and Magellan Midstream – will own the storage unit. The terminal is expected to store diesel, gasoline of varying grades, renewable fuels and jet fuel.Phase one of the terminal project, slated to commence operation by the first half of 2019, is presently under construction and is expected to comprise storage unit with capacity to store 1 million barrels of liquid. The terminal will also include a new marine dock that will be able to accommodate Panamax-sized ships.The phase two of the project is expected to expand the storage capacity by another 4 million barrels. Another marine dock will be added which will be able to handle Aframax-sized vessels. The Phase two will initiate operation by early 2020.Total cost estimated by the JV players for both the phases of development stands at $820 million. Both Valero and Magellan Midstream, likely be the operator of the storage plant, will finance the project.

470,VLO,"An independent refiner, Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report) and Texas-based Plains All American Pipeline, LP (PAA  -  Free Report), a master limited partnership (MLP), have jointly decided to call off the agreement relating to the acquisition of two petroleum storage and distribution terminals located in Martinez and Richmond, CA. Per the agreement, a subsidiary of Valero had agreed to purchase the assets from a subsidiary of Plains All American.The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) had opted to not pursue any regulatory action relating to the proposed transaction following a widespread survey.  However, on completion of the FTC’s examination, the Office of the Attorney General for the State of California filed a suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, to check the transaction.Both companies decided not to move ahead with this transaction as they found it detrimental, regardless of the fact that the court overruled the Attorney General’s motion for a temporary restraining order and its motion for a preliminary injunction.Valero and Plains All American thought that the constant uncertainty attached to an extensive trial would produce insecurity for the California-based employees and customers of the terminals. Also, the significant cost related to defending a taxpayer-funded lawsuit would put a big hole in their finances, which is already a concern amid the ongoing commodity price volatility.   About ValeroTexas-based Valero is the largest independent refiner and marketer of petroleum products in the United States.

473,VLO,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a large build, triggered by nine-year low refinery activity following last month’s Hurricane Harvey. Moreover, with almost a quarter of the nation’s fuel processing capacity shut down in the immediate aftermath of the catastrophe, product inventories (gasoline and distillate) fell sharply.While the data sets were neither overly optimistic or pessimistic fundamentally and much of what came out of the report was anyways expected, bullish commentary regarding world demand catapulted crude above $50 a barrel for the first time since Jul 31 yesterday.Eventually, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 1.2% (or 59 cents) to settle at $49.89 per barrel Thursday.Improving Supply-Demand NarrativeEnergy bodies OPEC and IEA both recently raised global oil demand forecasts for this year, helping to tighten the market significantly.Further, the Paris-based IEA said that the global oil supply had come down by 720,000 per day last month to 97.7 million barrels on outages and maintenance in non-OPEC countries.  Meanwhile, according to the OPEC’s latest monthly report, the oil cartel’s production fell by 79,000 barrels a day in August to 32.76 million as output dropped in Libya, Gabon, Venezuela and Iraq. This points to the success of the 14-member group’s output curb initiatives and rising compliance levels.Adding to the positive momentum, OPEC and fellow exporters are said to be open to extending their production cut agreement beyond its March expiry.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories jumped by 5.9 million barrels for the week ending Sep 8, following an increase of 4.6 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go up some 10.1 million barrels.Lower refinery throughput due to lingering Hurricane Harvey effects on Gulf Coast units, together with volume ramp-up from the production facilities shuttered in the wake of the storm, led to the big stockpile build with the world's biggest oil consumer. Nevertheless, the build was significantly below forecasts.At 468.2 million barrels, current crude supplies are down 2.5% from the year-ago period but are in the upper half of the average range during this time of the year.Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was up by 1 million barrels to 59.1 million barrels.The crude supply cover was up from 27.5 days in the previous week to 29.4 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 30.5 days.Gasoline: Supplies of gasoline were down for the second week running as Gulf Coast refineries continued to be sidelined by damage from Hurricane Harvey. The massive 8.4 million barrels draw – way above the polled number of 4 million barrels and the largest since at least 1990 – took gasoline stockpiles down to 218.3 million barrels. Following last week’s slide, the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product has fallen 4.4% below the year-earlier level but is in the upper limit of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) went down by 3.2 million barrels last week, compared with analysts’ expectations for 300,000 barrels decrease in supply level. The second successive weekly fall could be attributed to plunging production, which reached a seven-year low of 3,973 thousand barrels per day on storm-induced outages. At 144.6 million barrels, current supplies are 11.2% below the year-ago level but are in the middle of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was down by 2% from the prior week to 77.7%. – the lowest since 2008 – as the facilities continue to recover from the impact of Harvey.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.The data from EIA generally acts as a catalyst for crude prices and affect producers, such as ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), and refiners such as Valero Energy Corp. (VLO  -  Free Report), Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) and Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC  -  Free Report).

474,VLO,"Friday, August 25th, 2017Hurricane Harvey is expected to be classified a Category 3 hurricane before it strikes the coast of Southeast Texas this morning, jeopardizing the oil refinery industry located in  and around Houston, the 4th largest city in the United States. This is a major hub for oil refineries, both U.S.-based and from elsewhere around the world. Rainfall could reach up to 35 inches from this storm, and flooding is the major hazard for the refinery industry.The last time a major storm hit this region was in 2008, when Hurricane Ike cost the industry roughly $30 billion, as well as more than 100 lives. Currently, Hurricane Harvey mounting the 17-foot sea wall in Galveston, TX may have devastating affects to Galveston Bay and the Houston shipping channel, one of the busiest ports in the U.S. and home to several oil refineries, such as Valero (VLO  -  Free Report) and Marathon (MRO  -  Free Report) and foreign-based TOTAL (TOT  -  Free Report) and Petrobras (PBR  -  Free Report). (And all this without Glen Campbell around any longer to sing Galveston’s praises.)Tragedy aside for a moment, if you’re looking for something to bolster oil prices, you may have just found it. Both WTI and Brent crude prices are up in this Friday pre-market, not by much but by roughly a half a percentage point. Should this hurricane be as big a disaster as some are expecting, we should see at least gasoline prices climb throughout the day and perhaps into next week.July Durable GoodsThe preliminary measure of Durable Goods orders for July was down 6.8% this morning, lower than analysts had anticipated. Subtracting Defense costs, this number blossoms to -7.8%, and ex-Transportation that figure grows to +0.5%. Combined, non-Defense, ex-Aircraft results are +0.4% for the month of July.Jackson Hole, ContinuedBoth Fed Chair Janet Yellen and European Central Bank (ECB) President Mario Draghi are scheduled to speak today at the symposium of monetary operatives in Jackson Hole, WY today. It’s the first time Draghi has appeared in three years, and back then he presaged the ECB asset-buyback program that has helped dig the EU out of its economic hole. Odds are decent (better than Conor McGregor’s chances of beating Floyd Mayweather) that Draghi will announce a dialing back of this program now that the EU is on more solid footing.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

475,VLO,"We issued an updated research report on refining and marketing player, Valero Energy (VLO  -  Free Report) on Aug 22. We believe that improving throughput volume on higher refinery utilization will help Valero generate more cash flow. However, escalating debt load is a concern.The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), implying that the stock will perform in line with the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months.Among all the independent refiners, Valero offers the most diversified refinery base with a processing of 3.1 million barrels per day in its 15 refineries situated throughout the United States, Canada and the Caribbean. More importantly, Valero is best positioned to profit from increased refining margins, mainly due to its strategic refinery structure that enables it to use cheaper oil for more than half of its needs.Also, higher throughput volume on the back of increased refinery utilization rates has been rewarding for Valero over the past four quarters. Following this development, the company managed to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the prior quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 18.2%. Also, Valero’s price performance looks lucrative as reflected by its 17.7% gain over the past year as compared with the 3.4% improvement of the industry.Investors should know that the company has been returning cash to shareholders on a regular basis. During second-quarter 2017, Valero returned $658 million to stockholders through dividend payments and share buybacks.However, during first-half 2017, total costs rose on heavy maintenance activities. If the trend continues over the coming quarters, it could hurt the company’s profits.Moreover, we are concerned about the company’s escalating debt levels over the past six quarters. From no debt as of December 2015, Valero’s long-term debt now stands at $8.4 billion.Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked players in the energy sector include TransCanada Corporation (TRP  -  Free Report), Transmontaigne Partners LP (TLP  -  Free Report) and Range Resources Corporation (RRC  -  Free Report). All the stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.   Headquartered in Calgary, Canada, TransCanada is a midstream energy firm in North America. The company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 4.06% over the last four quarters.Transmontaigne – headquartered in Denver, CO – involves in transporting and storing refined petroleum products. The firm posted an average positive earnings surprise of 6.60% over the last four quarters.Based in Fort Worth, TX, Range Resources is an independent oil and gas company, engaged in the exploration, development and acquisition of U.S. oil and gas resources. The company’s 2017 earnings are estimated to grow 116.5%.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye on Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

476,VLO,"We have closed the book for the Q2 earnings season with releases from all S&P 500 Oil/ Energy companies already out. From our article, it is clear that the Energy sector contributed the most to year-over-year earnings growth in the S&P 500 Index.Among the major industries in the Energy sector, we found Q2 performances of the Oil Refining & Marketing industry the most impressive. The refining industry generated huge cash flow from core operations for investors in second-quarter 2017. Also, the industry’s dividend yield is higher than that of the S&P 500 Index. Thus, it is a good time to consider stocks from the oil refining industry.Oil Refining IndustryThis industry mainly deals in downstream operations. Companies belonging to this space have plants that help refine raw crude to produce end products like gasoline, heating oils and diesel. In other words, refining companies buy raw crude from the exploration and production players and sell the refined products.The industry has a good industry rank and is undervalued as compared to the S&P 500 index. Industry RankIn terms of Zacks Industry Rank,Oil Refining Industry is among the top performing industries.The industry is ranked #100 and lies in the top 39% of industries. The industry rank is impressive as the top 50% of the Zacks Ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Undervalued as Compared to S&P 500Compared to the S&P 500, the Oil Refining Industry is undervalued. This implies that the industry has more potential to grow in the near future compared to the index. The Oil Refining industry has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 8.57, which is below the index’s mark of 10.69. The EV/EBITDA ratio is one of the best multiples for valuing oil and gas companies because energy firms have a large amount of debt and EV (Enterprise Value) has included the parameter.Terrific Q2 Performance With the help of our proprietary model, we picked up key parameters that highlighted the terrific performance of the Oil Refining Industry during the second quarter of this year.Beats S&P 500 The performance of any stock or industry over a specified period of time gets reflected in the pricing chart. The April-to-June quarter has clearly shown that the Oil Refining & Marketing industry has surpassed the S&P 500 Index.During the aforesaid period, the industry has gained 4.4% as compared with the 2.8% improvement of the index. We are highlighting the positive price movement of the Oil Refining industry as many major industries in the Oil/Energy sector have seen negative movements.Cash Flow & Earnings Skyrocket During second-quarter 2017, net cash flow from operations from the Oil Refining industry jumped more than 200% sequentially to $973 million. In other words, the industry saw a marked improvement in cash flow in Q2 from the decline in Q1.On top of that, earnings out of core operations – as measured by earnings before income, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) – was registered at $776 million, highlighting almost 60% improvement from the prior quarter.Lucrative Dividend Yield for Q2Along with improved earnings, the Oil Refining industry also recorded a lucrative dividend yield which outpaced the S&P 500 Index.During the April-to-June quarter of this year, the industry reported dividend yield of 3.35%, which is far better than 1.9% yield of the S&P 500 Index.Refining Stocks in FocusPicking the prospective energy stocks can be a daunting task. To simplify the screening process, we have resorted to our proprietary stock screener. We have primarily picked stocks that have beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last reported quarter.Headquartered in San Antonio, TX, Andeavor (ANDV  -  Free Report) is involved in the refining and marketing of refined products.

477,VLO,"It was a week where the price of oil spiked to its highest mark in nearly eight months. However, natural gas futures fell sharply.On the news front, integrated majors ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) and TOTAL S.A. (TOT  -  Free Report) came up with stronger-than-expected earnings reports, driven by higher oil prices.Overall, it was a mixed week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained about 4% to close at $53.90 per barrel, natural gas prices slumped 5.6% to $2.752 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: SLB & HAL's Q3, RIG's New Contract & More.)The U.S. oil benchmark rallied on expectations that OPEC and other major producers will agree to expand their output-cut deal beyond March. The agreement, already renewed once, keeps 1.8 million barrels a day off the market in an attempt to clear a supply glut.Further support came from the U.S. Energy Department's inventory release, which showed steep declines in domestic gasoline and distillate inventories on rising exports.Upbeat third-quarter U.S. GDP data and signs of recovery in global demand growth was also bullish for oil prices.Meanwhile, natural gas futures finished the week down despite a smaller-than-expected increase in supplies. Unfavorable weather forecasts and strength in the commodity’s production, induced the drop in prices.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Energy giant ExxonMobil Corp. posted strong third-quarter 2017 results, courtesy of increased price realizations from liquids and gas and improved margins at the refinery business.Production averaged 3.878 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (MMBOE/d), marginally higher than 3.811 MMBOE/d in the year-ago quarter. Ramp up in Australian projects supported the upside.ExxonMobil’s downstream segment recorded profits of $1.5 billion, $303 million higher than the July-September quarter of 2016. This improvement was backed by improved margins from refining activities.During the quarter under review, ExxonMobil generated cash flow of $8.4 billion from operations and asset sales.

480,VLO,"Investors in Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jan 19, 2018 $62.50 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Valero Energy shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Valero Energy is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry that ranks in the Bottom 21% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimate for the current quarter, while two have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.28 per share to $1.22 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Valero Energy right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

481,VLO,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a sharp decline for the sixth week in a row on record high refinery runs. With oil supplies continuing to fall, investor sentiment has turned slightly positive on dissipating fears about a meltdown to sub-$40 levels. Analysts also believe that the trend, if sustained, could help tighten the market significantly.However, gains were capped by a strong dollar and escalating tensions between the US and North Korea that sparked investor movement away from riskier assets to safe havens like gold. As a result, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures added 0.8% (or 39 cents) to $49.56 per barrel Wednesday.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 6.45 million barrels for the week ending August 4, 2017, following a decline of 1.53 million barrels in the previous week.The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 2.5 million barrels. A surge in refinery crude runs to 12-year highs and dip in imports as well as domestic production led to the large stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consume.The sixteenth inventory reduction in 18 weeks has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. Nevertheless, U.S. still remains awash with excess oil. At 475.44 million barrels, current crude supplies are in the upper half of the average range during this time of the year.After declining in 15 of the last 16 weeks, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was up 569,000 barrels from previous week’s level to 56.37 million barrels.The crude supply cover was down from 27.9 days in the previous week to 27.4 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 31.3 days.Gasoline: Supplies of gasoline were up for the first time in 8 weeks as demand weakened in the face of increasing imports and production. The 3.42 million barrels addition – contrary to the polled number of 1.25 million barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 231.10 million barrels. Despite last week’s increase, the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains 1.8% below the year-earlier level but is in the upper half of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) went down by 1.73 million barrels last week, well ahead of analysts’ expectations for 600,000 barrels decrease in supply level. The fourth successive weekly fall could be attributed to strong demand and lower imports. At 147.69 million barrels, current supplies are 2.3% below the year-ago level but are in the upper limit of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 0.9% from the prior week to 96.3%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.The data from EIA generally acts as a catalyst for crude prices and affect producers, such as ExxonMobil Corp.

482,VLO,"Independent oil refiner and marketer Andeavor (ANDV  -  Free Report) – formed following the merger of Tesoro Corporation and El Paso-based Western Refining Inc. – is set to release second-quarter 2017 results after the closing bell on Aug 8. Tesoro completed the merger on Jun 1 and renamed itself to Andeavor, which started trading on NYSE under the ticker ANDV from Aug 1.San Antonio, TX-based downstream operator Andeavor – which counts Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report), Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report) and Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) among its peers – posted a positive earnings surprise of 44.44% in the preceding quarter. Significant contribution from the logistics segment and improved performance of the refining segment drove the results.  Coming to earnings surprise history, the company has an impressive record. The company has topped estimates in each of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 57.52%.Andeavor Price and EPS Surprise Andeavor Price and EPS Surprise |  Andeavor QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at playApart from bolstering its network of assets, downstream operator Western Refining’s buyout is likely to help Andeavor enhance its geographic footprint in the prolific Permian Basin, driving double-digit earnings growth in 2018. In June, Andeavor earned credit rating upgrade from both S&P and Fitch on healthy financials and decent coverage and liquid ratios. The company also intends to repurchase shares to offset the dilution associated with the merger.  The company also clinched a deal with Mexico’s Pemex Logística which is expected to strengthen its geographical foothold in Mexico and expand its marketing business under the ARCO brand. The company will also be able to utilize El Paso refining capacity that it has access to now, thanks to the acquisition. This bodes well for the company’s long-term growth opportunities.Although crude ended the second quarter of this year with a decline of 8.4%, the pricing environment of commodities was much healthier than the year-ago quarter, courtesy of the historical OPEC agreement. Andeavor is unlikely to benefit from the improvement in oil prices as the input cost for refiners increase with a price hike. Also, rising costs due to tougher RIN obligations are likely to weigh on the earnings and margins of the company. The RIN expense has increased from $3.3 to $3.5 per barrel in the second quarter when compared with the year-ago quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Andeavor will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to surpass estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP FilterThat is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are both pegged at $1.61.Zacks Rank: Andeavor currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Though a favorable Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Conversely, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Nustar Energy L.P. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Nustar Energy L.P. QuoteQuarterly DistributionNuStar – whose general partner is NuStar GP Holdings LLC (NSH  -  Free Report) – announced a quarterly distribution of $1.095 per unit ($4.38 per unit annualized) that remains unchanged from the year-earlier as well as previous-quarter distributions. The distribution is payable on Aug 11 to unitholders of record as on Aug 7, 2017.As per NuStar’s earnings release, distributable cash flow (DCF) available to limited partners for the second quarter was $60.3 million (providing 0.59x distribution coverage), compared with $92.8 million (providing 1.09x distribution coverage).Segmental PerformancePipeline: Total quarterly throughput volumes in the segment were 1,089,711 barrels per day (Bbl/d), up 16% from the year-ago period. While throughput volumes in the crude oil pipelines jumped 40% from the year-ago quarter to 558,182 Bbl/d, refined product pipelines throughput edged down 1% to 531,529 Bbl/d. As a result, throughput revenues rose 4% year-over-year to $126.7 million.However, the segment’s operating income – at $52.9 million – was down 17% from the year-ago figure of $63.6 million, primarily due to the effects of turnaround and operational issue at some of NuStar’s customer refineries.Storage: Throughput volumes in the Storage segment plunged 54% year over year to 337,518 Bbl/d. Nevertheless, higher renewal storage rates, increased terminal station fees and acquisition contributions meant a 4% increase in the unit’s quarterly revenues – from $151.9 million in the second quarter of 2016 to $158.6 million.Moreover, the segment's operating income came in at $56.0 million, which marks a 10% improvement from $51.1 million earned in the year-ago quarter.Fuels Marketing: The unit reported operating income of $289,000, dropping significantly from the year-ago profit of $1.4 million.

485,VLO,"Energy infrastructure provider, Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P. (MMP  -  Free Report) recently reported a gasoline leak of 10,988 barrels or more than 461,000 gallons at its Galena Park terminal near Houston, TX caused by Harvey. The leakage from two gasoline storage tanks above ground is the biggest reported spill in the region caused by the storm. While Magellan Midstream believes the devastating flood caused the spill, it is still looking for the exact reason. The amount of the spill rapidly increased from the partnership's first estimate of 1,000 barrels by 10 times. The spilled fuel reached the waterway near the ship channel, which is a heavily industrialized area with dozens of petrochemical facilities. Some of the gasoline escaped into an adjacent ditch.Due to Harvey, the total amount of fuel leaked in the area– including the one from Magellan Midstream’s terminal – is estimated at 600,000 gallons. Companies that reported such Harvey-stoked leaks in the Houston area include ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report), Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report), Kinder Morgan, Inc. (KMI  -  Free Report) and others.Risk FactorGasoline is known to be more volatile than oil. Hence, following a spill, it dissolves much faster. It penetrates the soil and contaminates groundwater supplies quickly, which can take a toll on the environment of the nearby area and pose health threats.Steps Taken by MagellanMagellan Midstream contained some of the spilled gasoline that leaked on Aug 31 by spraying foam. This was done to prevent the gasoline mixture from discharging harmful vapors. The partnership is excavating and restoring the affected soil. The whole operation is being monitored by the environmental agencies as further investigation is on.The partnership reported that most of its infrastructure was back to normal after the storm. Its refined products pipeline system that originates in East Houston and connects Dallas and West Texas areas has already come online. It has started the truck loading services in the area on a limited basis.About the Partnership Tulsa, OK-based Magellan Midstream is a master limited partnership (MLP) that owns and operates a diversified portfolio of energy infrastructure assets. The partnership primarily transports, stores, and distributes refined petroleum products and, to a lesser extent, ammonia. Magellan Midstream conducts its operations in three segments: Refined Products, Crude Oil, and Marine Storage.Magellan Midstream’s portfolio of energy infrastructure assets helps it to generate stable tariff-based revenues. However, the refined product demand of the partnership is inherently volatile and is subject to complex market forces.Zacks RankThe partnership has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

486,VLO,"Picture Thus FarThe Q3 earnings cycle is in full swing with 138 S&P 500 members that account for 32.9% of the index’s total market capitalization having reported their numbers. Per the latest Earnings Trends, total earnings for these companies are up 7.3% from the same period last year on 4.9% higher revenues, with 70.3% positive earnings surprises and 68.1% beating revenue estimates.As of now, very few energy companies have reported their third-quarter results. Notably, just two energy companies on the S&P 500 index have reported their Q3 numbers. These include the major oilfield services players Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report) and Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report). Schlumberger reported third-quarter 2017 earnings of 42 cents per share (excluding charges and credits), in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and higher than the year-ago figure of 25 cents.(Read more: Schlumberger Posts In-Line Q3 Earnings, Revenues Miss)Halliburton Co. reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings, thanks to improved utilization and pricing gains in North America. Halliburton’s income from continuing operation came in at 42 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 38 cents. Notably this is the 13th consecutive earnings beat recorded by the company. Moreover, revenues of $5,444 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,318.9 million.(Read more North American Strength Drives Halliburton Q3 Earnings)Q3 Report Card: Oil and Gas Prices End on a Positive NoteOil: Prices of oil at the end of the third quarter improved amid continued decline in domestic inventories and an improving supply-demand narrative. With fundamentals pointing to a tighter market, price of oil at the end of the third quarter was $51.67 per barrel, up about 10.5% sequentially. A year ago, crude prices lingered around $45 per barrel.Natural Gas: Prices of natural gas dropped about 3.5% in the July-September period owing to the fuel’s tepid demand due to mild weather conditions and hurricane-related power outages. Despite the sequential fall, natural gas prices remain favorable when compared with the corresponding period of 2016. The commodity futures ended the quarter at $3 per MMBtu, up more than 3% from the Sep 30, 2016 settlement of $2.9 per MMBtu.Energy Companies to Gain from Higher Prices: As we know, the profitability of energy companies is directly affected by fluctuations in oil and gas prices. Therefore, all oil/gas-related stocks are poised to benefit from recovering commodity prices as they will be able to extract more value for their products.Year-over-Year Gain Leads to Bullish ExpectationsA look back at the Q2 earnings season reflects that earnings for the sector recorded a massive 252.7% jump from the same period last year — by far the highest growth among all sectors — on 16.8% higher revenues.The energy sector is poised to see the strongest growth in Q3 again. Per our expectations, earnings for the sector are expected to jump 122% from third-quarter 2016, while the top line is likely to witness an improvement of 16.3% from the year-ago levels.Energy Stock Reporting Q3 Earnings on Oct 26Let’s see what’s in store for four energy companies that are slated to release their quarterly numbers.Texas-based leading refinery player Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report) is slated to report results before the opening bell.According to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to increase its odds of an earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 13.89%, courtesy of higher throughput margin. Moreover, Valero surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last four quarters, with an average of 18.24%.Valero Energy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Valero Energy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Valero Energy Corporation QuoteValero is expected to keep its earnings streak alive this quarter also as it has the right combination of the two ingredients. The company has an Earnings ESP of +0.27% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s refining segment earnings is $1,372 million, higher than $990 million recorded in the year-ago quarter and $959 million in the prior quarter. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $20,183 million for the third quarter, up 2.7% from the year-ago quarter.Our model predicted earnings beat earlier too. When we issued its Q3 earnings preview article, the company had an Earnings ESP of +0.27% and carried a Zacks Rank #2.Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report) an independent oil refiner and marketer is set to release results before the market opens.The Findlay, OH-based downstream operator has a mixed earnings surprise history. It surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice in the last four quarters. In the preceding three-month period, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 0.96% on lower gross margins and elevated costs.Marathon Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Marathon Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Marathon Petroleum Corporation QuoteHowever, our model indicates that Marathon Petroleum is likely to beat on earnings estimates this time, as it has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.09%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s revenues from refining and marketing is pegged at $419 million, 36.9% higher than the reported figure in third-quarter 2016. We also expect profitability in its midstream (or pipeline transportation) segment to be 62.8% higher than the year-ago quarter to stand at $420 million. Earnings are likely to be driven by solid process and fractionation volumes, along with contribution from investments in new projects.Our model predicted earnings beat earlier too. When we issued its Q3 earnings preview article, the company had an Earnings ESP of +0.14% and carried a Zacks Rank #3.Energy equipment supplier National Oilwell Varco, Inc. (NOV  -  Free Report) will report its results after the closing bell.National Oilwell Varco has a good track record of earnings surprise history, courtesy of its cost-reduction initiatives and improved efficiencies. The company delivered average positive earnings surprise of 10.46% in the trailing four quarters.National Oilwell Varco, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  National Oilwell Varco, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | National Oilwell Varco, Inc. QuoteBased on our model, National Oilwell is likely to beat on earnings even this time, as it has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +13.04%.Rising momentum in the U.S. markets and modest improvement in international markets along with increasing consumer demand are likely to improve the revenues of the company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of the Wellbore Technology segment is $672 million compared with $614 million reported in second-quarter 2017 and $526 million recorded in the year-ago quarter.Our model predicted earnings beat earlier too. When we issued its Q3 earnings preview article, the company had an earnings ESP of +10.91% and carried a Zacks Rank #3.Upstream energy player EQT Corporation (EQT  -  Free Report) is set to report results before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company reported earnings of 6 cents per share surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 5 cents. EQT delivered average positive earnings surprise of 102.17% in the trailing four quarters.EQT Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  EQT Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | EQT Corporation QuoteHowever, our proven model does not show that EQT is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because the company has an Earnings ESP of -31.31% and a Zacks Rank #3. Though a Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, a negative Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the average daily sales volume for the current quarter is estimated at 2,303 million cubic feet equivalent per day (MMcfe/d), which is higher than 2,177 MMcfe/d recorded in the preceding quarter and 2,131 MMcfe/d in the year-ago quarter. The company is poised to benefit as the midstream business might rake more profits for EQT given the fact that U.S. drillers continue to bank on shale plays.However, we are concerned by the increased spending of the company. EQT is expected to spend $1.5 billion in 2017.  During first-half 2017, EQT’s operating expenses related to transportation and processing activities surged more than 66%. If the trend continues, it might hurt EQT’s earnings.Even earlier, our model did not indicate that EQT will beat on earnings this season. When we issued its Q3 earnings preview article, the company had an Earnings ESP of -163.91% and carried a Zacks Rank #3.Zacks' Hidden TradesWhile we share many recommendations and ideas with the public, certain moves are hidden from everyone but selected members of our portfolio services.

487,VLO,"This is a big week for earnings, with over 800 companies expected to report. Included in that big group is a handful of energy stocks.This group has been out-of-favor with investors for over 2 years and the earnings picture hasn’t looked great either thanks to a reduction in oil production.But not all energy companies are created the same. Some are being impacted by lower oil prices while others are not.Which energy companies have the best earnings charts this week?And which should you be watching for the best read on what is happening in the sector?5 Top Energy Earnings Charts 1.    Hess (HES  -  Free Report) is an E&P which gets about half of its revenue from the US and half from international. Shares have sunk near 5-year lows as the price of oil continues to be at multi-year lows. It’s coming off a miss last quarter.2.    ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) has actually beat 3 out of the last 4 quarters which has been hard to do for the big E&P companies. But much like Hess, shares are still near multi-year lows.3.    Valero (VLO  -  Free Report) has only missed twice in the last 5 years. That’s an impressive track record for ANY company. Valero is the largest US refiner and also owns over 7,000 service stations. Shares are at new 5-year highs. Maybe energy stocks aren’t so bad after all?4.    ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report) has a great track record of beating, with just 4 misses in the last 5 years. During the oil price plunge, it has gotten a boost from its petrochemical and refining divisions. Will that still hold for the rest of 2017?5.    Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) shares are well off their 2015 lows even though it has missed more than it has beat on earnings. Still, investors have found comfort in Chevron’s large dividend, which is currently yielding 3.6% even as shares are trading near 1-year highs.Want to Learn How to Trade Options?Have you always wanted to trade stock options but are unsure where to begin or what to look for?Each week, Zacks’ Dave Bartosiak will bring you a detailed explanation of the trades “live” on YouTube.Watch him go through the trade as he answers your questions in real time.Become one of Dave’s minions.

488,VLO,"Even as the U.S. is recovering from the flooding and devastation caused by the powerful Hurricane Harvey, an even bigger storm is brewing in the Atlantic Ocean. The potentially catastrophic Hurricane Irma has been accorded a rare Category 5 status -- the highest possible designation for a hurricane. It is already battering the Caribbean with extreme rain and winds and is set to strike Florida sometime Sunday after moving through Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and Haiti. One of the strongest Atlantic storms on record, Irma is likely to be worse than Harvey.Harvey’s Impact on Energy PricesAs Hurricane Harvey tore through the Texas Gulf Coast, workers in the U.S. oil industry struggled to evacuate production facilities and shut down refineries. This, in turn, triggered the biggest disruption in nationwide energy supplies in years.The United States has major refining infrastructures along the Gulf of Mexico (“GoM”). According to the EIA, more than 45% of domestic oil refining capacity are located in the GoM.With deluge and floods in the aftermath of Harvey knocking out a major chunk of domestic refining capacity, crude demand was significantly curbed. This led to lower oil prices.However, in terms of price action, gasoline was the market mover. The most widely used petroleum product ended more than 13% higher last week to $1.748 a gallon in the aftermath of Harvey knocking out refining operations in the Houston area. Harvey caused weeks of disruptions at facilities in its path -- shutting units, sparking fires and creating supply shortage possibly extending for months.Oil, Gasoline Limp Back to NormalcyProduction and refining infrastructure that was shut down in the wake of Hurricane Harvey is starting to come back online.While Saudi-owned Port Arthur refinery – America’s largest – is on its way up and should be partly operational by early next week, other refining giants like Valero Energy Corp. (VLO  -  Free Report) and ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report) are also making progress in restarting their units. In fact, eight facilities constituting more than 11% of domestic refining capacity are beginning procedures to restart, a process that has boosted demand for crude and catapulted the commodity to four-week highs. Meanwhile, with refining capacity starting to ramp up, gasoline futures are sliding.  Oil producers along the Gulf of Mexico and Eagle Ford shale also continue to claw back to pre-Harvey levels amid inspections and damage assessments. Companies including ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), Devon Energy Corp. and EOG Resources Inc. have all resumed drilling operations and hopes to bring major portion of their affected production online soon.Irma Unlikely to Cause Major Energy Upheaval in the U.S.Compared to Harvey, the effects of Irma on the energy sector is expected to be much lighter. This is because Florida hardly has any critical supply-side assets – downstream or upstream – and therefore the U.S. refining capacity and production will be barely hit. With virtually no impact on supply, the only casualty is likely to be oil demand in the U.S. Southeast, that too for a limited period.However, certain traders believe that the superstorm – ranked in the top five most powerful Atlantic hurricanes in the last 80 years and coming just after Harvey – could take out a major domestic demand center leading to renewed fuel shortages.Some Caribbean Facilities at RiskWhile most of the U.S. energy industry will remain unscathed, some facilities in the storm’s immediate path stands to be affected by Irma.   Midstream operator Buckeye Partners L.P.’s (BPL  -  Free Report) petroleum products storage terminal in Bahamas – the largest such facility in the Western Hemisphere with a capacity of 26 million barrels – is set to be affected by Irma. Houston-based Buckeye Partners is also the operator of marine terminals close to Miami, Tampa, and Jacksonville, FL., with all of them likely to take minor hits. The Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) partnership’s Yabucoa oil terminal in Puerto Rico is likely to get impacted as well.

491,VLO,"As we know, U.S. President Donald Trump loves to tweet and has quite a loose-cannon approach toward it. After the twitter tussle between the President and Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) early this month, Trump attacked OPEC — The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries— blaming it for artificially hiking oil prices, post which crude prices tumbled; albeit temporarily.  The energy market has witnessed extreme volatility in terms of prices over the past three years. However, the market has finally recovered from the historic lows to comfortably trade at more than $60 a barrel since the start of this year. Crude has been well supported by a variety of catalysts, including strong demand and continued production curbs from OPEC and its allies.Since 2014, major oil producing countries whose economies depend heavily on the resource revenue, have been hugely affected by the oil slump caused by the supply glut. Hence, OPEC members as well as other major non-OPEC countries entered into an agreement in late 2016 to curb oil production in an attempt to rebalance the market. The continued efforts of OPEC have led to the gradual recovery of oil prices.However, it seems that the rally in oil prices on the back of OPEC’s commitment to curtail production has not gone too well with President Trump. OPEC has hiked gasoline prices in the United States and rising energy costs may lead to inflation. Trump took to Twitter on Apr 20 to express his anger, blaming OPEC for artificially inflating oil prices.Trump’s OPEC Tweet Leaves No Lasting ImpactHis tweet read: “Looks like OPEC is at it again. With record amounts of oil all over the place, including the fully loaded ships at sea. Oil prices are artificially Very High! No good and will not be accepted!”This is the first time that Trump lashed out at OPEC on social media during his presidential term. The tweet came as the OPEC and non-OPEC members met in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, to reaffirm their agreement in order to keep output limited. The meeting determined that compliance is at its highest level ever.Following Trump’s tweet, crude prices came under much pressure, dropping to $67.50 a barrel for WTI and $72.83 for Brent. However, by the end of the day it moved higher, rebounding from early losses, to close at $68.38 a barrel (WTI) and $74.07 a barrel (Brent).In fact, the impact of Trump’s tweet fizzled out too soon with both WTI and Brent crude prices pivoting higher yesterday to touch their three-year highs at $ 68.64 a barrel and $ 74.71 a barrel, respectively.Notably, the Energy Select Sector SPDR — an assortment of the largest U.S. energy companies — also rose 0.61% as of Apr 23. The two energy representatives in the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average, ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report), added 0.72% and 1%, respectively. Both these supermajors carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Among other big energy companies, Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY  -  Free Report) was up 1.01%, Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report) gained 0.65%, while EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report) saw its stock price go up 0.76%.OPEC Denies, Hits BackSuhail Al Mazrouei — OPEC’s President and UAE’s minister of energy industry — rejected Trumps criticism of OPEC manipulating oil prices claiming that they never targeted any specific price level. He maintained his stance of just focusing on efforts to cut production in order to rebalance the market and prevent it from supply glut.Khalid al-Falih said, “There’s no such thing as artificial price.” He claimed that the OPEC agreements cannot continue to curb the production indefinitely and that it is in fact market demand and supply factors that actually set the price.Alexander Novak, Russia’s energy minister, also supported Falih’s claims asserting that OPEC’s production cut agreement is not just the only factor leading to oil price surge; rather it is the overall market dynamics that determine the price. Further, he also pointed out that crude price recovery has aided the U.S. shale oil industry, with domestic output at record levels.Primary Drivers of Crude RecoveryOne of the main reasons why the U.S. oil benchmark soared revolved around expectations that OPEC and other major producers agreed to expand their output-cut deal beyond March. The coalition prolonged the agreement for another nine months to the end of 2018 in an attempt to clear the supply gut.Meanwhile, reports have emerged that Saudi officials are looking to push oil prices even higher ahead of the launch of the Aramco IPO to bolster its valuation.Another major factor fueling higher oil prices is fast-growing demand for the commodity, which continues to tighten the market. Per the International Energy Agency (IEA), global oil demand is likely to grow by 1.5 million barrels a day this year to average 99.3 million barrels a day.Sharp inventory drawdowns have also helped the commodity tread on a growth trajectory. Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 36 of the last 51 weeks and are down more than 100 million barrels since April last year. The gradual fall – stemming from a combination of lower imports and spiralling exports – has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 429.9 million barrels, current crude supplies are 20% below the year-ago period.However, not just these factors but other Middle-East tensions also led to this huge rise in oil prices.Other Factors Behind the UptickFueling the rally in oil prices over the last few weeks are concerns that geopolitical tensions in the Middle East could disrupt crude supplies. Crude prices have been soaring lately on expectations of the reintroduction of sanctions on Iran, expansion of sanctions against Venezuela and strikes on Syria.   Iran Nuclear Deal: Industry watchers are waiting to see if the Trump administration decides to impose sanctions on Iran once again, post the May 12 deadline. Following the lifting of sanctions in 2016 as part of Obama-era agreement, Iran’s crude oil production and exports have been rising. However, the return of sanctions would put pressure on Iran’s energy industry and affect the oil market in general. A disruption to Iranian oil exports and investments in the country might cut off some of its supplies to the global market, thereby boosting prices.The Venezuela Issue: Fast falling production in Venezuela have added to the jitters. With the country tethering on the verge of an economic collapse, oil output has shrunk almost 50% since 2005. As it is, Venezuela currently churns out less than 2 million barrels per day, much lower that its pledge per the OPEC-led supply cuts. U.S. sanctions have further aggravated the situation. Further, Trump is likely to increase sanctions on Venezuela, which will further tighten the markets. A prolonged slump in Venezuela production could result in higher prices.Syria Strike and Russian Involvement Also Pushes Oil Higher: The conflict in Syria heightened after a joint air strike by the United States, France and the United Kingdom, post which crude started marching north. The rally will continue as the United States is likely to take strong measures against Iran and Russia for backing Syria’s chemical attack.Also, the Russian market has seen increased volatility after Moscow was slapped with new American sanctions on Apr 6. Trump will take a strong stand against Russian players, who reportedly helped Syria to carry out the chemical attack. Since, Russia is one of the largest producers and exporters of crude in the world, any sanction on the country will lift crude price.In ConclusionSince April, prices of oil ticked up by almost 8%. However, the latest uptick has got a lot to do with geopolitical tensions and the Trump administration’s policies rather than just the OPEC production curbs. The United States being a powerful global power, plays a significant role in contributing toward these geopolitical tensions. Hence, Trump’s tweet holding OPEC responsible for the surge in prices seems more like a case of the pot calling the kettle black.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

The project is expected to cost around $150 million. Per the partnership, the initial capacity of the new 24-inch wide pipeline will be around 250,000 barrels per day (B/D). The company will expand the oil carrying capacity to more than 600,000 B/D, provided the demand for crude oil and condensate shots up. The pipeline is scheduled to be operational by mid-2019.The partnership intends to conduct an open season to look for interested takers among the transporters for this new pipeline. Magellan Midstream assures that results of this open season trial will no way affect the pipeline building work.Project PurposeThe project will work as a source to Magellan Midstream’s Longhorn pipeline that connects Houston with Texas City refining complex and marine export facilities. This latest addition to the pipeline system of Magellan Midstream will also help the oil-producers in the Delaware Basin reach the Port of Corpus Christi.Apart from the Delaware Basin pipeline, the partnership will build a new terminal at Wink with the purpose to facilitate clients.Magellan Midstream’s BenefitThe new pipeline will add positive attributes to the partnership’s solid fee-based pipeline and terminal services. We remind investors that the partnership reported revenues of $619.4 million, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $561 million in the second quarter of 2017, thus projecting strength in its fee-based services.In other news, Magellan Midstream has agreed in constructing a 135-mile, 16-inch wide pipeline from Houston to Hearne, TX with Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report), a San Antonio, TX-based downstream oil company.

493,VLO,"An independent refiner, Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report) announced that one of its indirect wholly-owned affiliate V-Tex Logistics, LLC has entered into a deal with Magellan Pipeline Company, L.P., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P. (MMP  -  Free Report).ProjectsPer the agreement, both companies would jointly construct a 16-inch pipeline that will spread over 135 miles from Houston to Hearne, TX.  Valero Energy also stated that it would build terminals in Hearne and Williamson County, TX. A 12-inch pipeline– that will stretch over 70 miles–would also be constructed to link both the terminals. The estimated cost of the projects is valued at $380 million. These projects are slated to be concluded by mid-2019.Benefits from the ProjectsThe booming Central Texas markets are expected to benefit the most as the construction of these pipelines and terminals will present an alternative unwavering source of fuel. With a capacity to provide about 60,000 barrels per day into Williamson County, the new pipelines and terminals will extend the supply chain of Valero. These projects are in sync with the company’s long-term plan of expanding through organic growth projects.Being one of the largest independent refiner and marketer of petroleum products in the United States, Valero Energy is favorably positioned to profit from increased refining margins. The company will benefit from its strategic refinery structure that enables it to use cheaper oil for more than half of its requirement. These expansion projects help Valero in providing a ratable product outlet and improve margin capture. Moreover, long term agreements for terminals and rail provide a cushion against macro uncertainties.Valero Energy expects to spend $1 billion annually on growth investments through 2021, of which about 50% is to be allocated for refining and the remaining 50% for logistics projects. Some of the projects being developed by the company include Diamond Pipeline, Wilmington cogeneration unit, Diamond Green Diesel expansion and Houston alkylation unit, among others.About the CompanyValero Energy offers the most diversified refinery base with a capacity of 3.1 million barrels per day in its 15 refineries located throughout the United States, Canada and the Caribbean.

494,VLO,"The U.S. energy department has approved the issue of up to 4.5 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (“SPR”) to counter the disruption in the market caused by refinery outages in the U.S. Gulf Coast due to Harvey. The last time SPR approved such an emergency release was in 2012 following Hurricane Isaac.Part of the overall federal initiative to respond to those impacted by Harvey, the emergency step will ensure that refining units have the crude oil they require to continue operating. This was necessitated after Colonial Pipeline – the country’s biggest gasoline mover – was closed down. The important pipeline is responsible for carrying gasoline between Houston and the East Coast.About SPR  The reserve was developed following the energy restrictions imposed by Arab nations in 1973 after the Yom Kippur War. This resulted in fuel supply panic and compelled the government to create an emergency reserve. The reserve has more than 700 million barrels of oil capacity and can meet domestic demand for more than a month. A network of tanks and deep underground storage caverns were used to create the reserve.The Beneficiaries The Trump administration has sanctioned three million barrels for Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report), while Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report) will receive 500,000 barrels of oil per day. Both these companies carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Marathon Petroleum has resumed operations in its Galveston Bay refinery. Corpus Christi and Three Rivers refineries owned by Valero are now operational at half capacity. Per Bloomberg, the reserve will be delivered to the refineries from the Bayou Choctaw site.Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) also received the emergency supply lent by the energy department. The company received 500,000 barrels of crude oil twice. The oil given to the Phillips 66 refinery is essentially in the form of a loan, which the company will replace at a later date when supplies become normal again.Major refiners whose operations in Texas were hit by Harvey include ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report), Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report), Petrobras (PBR  -  Free Report) and others.Oil Release Aimed at Easing Gasoline PricesOperations were disrupted in 13 Texas oil refineries and 11 ports. The halted crude deliveries in the U.S. Gulf coast refineries have made the market unstable due to reduced refinery output. It pushed the prices of oil products like gasoline higher for the last weeks. Gasoline price climbed up above $2 per gallon, which marks a two-year high. The government believes the move will curb rising prices and therefore benefit consumers. The energy department is yet to estimate a date by which the Gulf Coast refineries will be fully operational.The energy department had initially thought of releasing gasoline from the emergency reserve located in New York Harbor, Boston and Maine. The 1 million barrels of gasoline reserve was built following the damage to New York fuel infrastructure due to the storm Sandy in 2012.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

495,VLO,"Leverage, in particular financial leverage, is a popular investment strategy of using borrowed capital. Sometimes, it also refers to the amount of debt that a company uses to finance its operations. Although there is option for equity financing, a comparative analysis of the theory of cost of capital reveals that most companies prefer debt financing over equity since debt is cheaper, especially in periods of low interest rates.However, no one voluntarily wishes to be part of a debt-ridden nation. This is because debt brings with it the burden of interest payments. Therefore, companies with a lower level of debt are usually considered safe bets. This is because highly leveraged stocks are vulnerable in times of volatility.Interestingly, America – the richest economy in the world is the biggest borrower too. In fact, according to the FY19 Federal Budget, at the end of FY 2018, gross U.S. federal government debt is estimated to be $21.09 trillion, more than double than the debt load the nation bore in the last decade.Nevertheless, this does not indicate that one should refrain from investing in U.S. stocks. Even after holding so much of debt, the United States remains the largest economy in the world in terms of GDP, representing a quarter share of global economy per the latest World Bank figures.Considering this, the need of the hour is to choose stocks prudently, avoiding those that carry high debt loads. So the crux of safe investment lies in identifying low leverage stocks.This is where the significance of financial leverage ratio comes into play. This ratio measures the extent of financial leverage a company bears. Several leverage ratios have been developed for this purpose, with debt-to-equity ratio being the most popular among them.Analyzing Debt-to-EquityDebt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders’ EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A company with a lower debt-to-equity ratio implies that it has a more or less financially stable business, thereby making it a more worthy investment opportunity.With the Q3 reporting cycle in full swing, companies recording higher earnings growth will attract investors. But if they bear high leverage, then they might not generate satisfactory returns. This is because at the time of economic downturns, debt ridden companies are more prone to falling into a debt trap.The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned discussion, to ensure safe returns it is wise for investors to choose stocks bearing low debt-to-equity ratio.However, an investment strategy based solely on the debt-to-equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome. To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns, we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors.Here are the other parameters:Debt/Equity less than X-Industry Median: Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers.Current Price greater than or equal to 10: The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $10 or above.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change in EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than X-Industry Median: Earnings growth adds to optimism, leading to a stock’s price appreciation.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than 5: This shows earnings growth expectation.Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy): No matter whether market conditions are good or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 have a proven history of success.Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt-to-equity ratio, here are five of the 15 stocks that made it through the screen.Big Lots, Inc. (BIG  -  Free Report): It is a broad-line closeout retailer in the United States. The company offers products under various merchandising categories, which include Food, Consumables, Furniture, Seasonal, Soft Home, Hard Home, and Electronics & Accessories.

499,VLO,"It was a week where the price of oil ended slightly lower. However, natural gas futures rose sharply.On the news front, the world’s largest publicly traded oil company ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report) has decided to combine its refining and marketing units, while Anglo-Dutch oil giant Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) restored its full-cash dividend after more than two years.Overall, it was a mixed week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost about 1% to close at $58.36 per barrel, natural gas prices jumped 5% to $3.061 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Shell Boosts EV Charging Network, Petrobras Starts Up Project)Notwithstanding OPEC and other major producers’ agreement to expand their output-cut deal beyond March – for another nine months to the end of 2018 – the U.S. oil benchmark fell from previous week’s two-and-half year high. The major culprit was the steady trend of rising domestic oil production that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market. In fact, U.S. output rose by 13,000 barrels per day last week to 9.7 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983.Meanwhile, natural gas futures logged a big increase despite a smaller-than-expected decrease in supplies as investors chose to bet on the return of colder weather (translating into strong heating gas demand) over the next few weeks.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Energy giant ExxonMobil Corporation plans to merge its two separate business units into ExxonMobil Fuels & Lubricants Company.The merger is expected in first-quarter 2018. The merged company will be headed by the current president of ExxonMobil Fuels, Lubricants & Specialties Marketing Company — Bryan Milton — effective Jan 1, 2018. Milton has been elected as the president by the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s board of directors. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The combination of two operations — ExxonMobil Refining and Supply Company and ExxonMobil Fuels, Lubricants & Specialties Marketing Company — will enable the company take better decisions and boost performance in the market. The development enable ExxonMobil generate more cashflow from downstream activities – helping the energy giant to counter the volatility in its upstream business.In detail, ExxonMobil reported only $196 million profit from its upstream operation during 2016, following persistent weak crude prices, compared to as high as $8.8 billion earnings from the downstream and chemical businesses. (Read more: ExxonMobil to Merge Refining & Marketing Divisions)2.    Shares of European oil giant Royal Dutch Shell plc rose 3.36% after the company announced plans to resume full-cash dividend payouts and share repurchase program.Hit by the industry downturn and weak financials owing to the $50-billion acquisition of BG Group, Shell began to pay dividend in the form of shares in 2015 to address cash flow woes. However, the supermajor is finally aborting the two-and-a-half-year long scrip dividend program as cost-containment efforts and divestment strategies have paid off. The company’s solid third-quarter results also underscore the fact that it has successfully adapted itself to thrive at $50-barrel crude.On Management Day, CEO of Shell — Ben van Beurden — announced the resumption of cash dividends from the fourth quarter of 2017. Beurden also announced plans to buy back shares of at least $25 billion by the end of 2020. With the buyback, Shell will be able to overcome the dilution problem under its scrip dividend plan that entitles investors to choose stocks as payout instead of cash. (Read more Shell Resumes Full-Cash Dividend Payment on Oil Revival)3.    Enbridge Inc. (ENB  -  Free Report) plans to focus on more profitable businesses as well as lowering debt burden. This leading midstream energy firm also revealed ways to fund growth projects and announced intention to reward shareholders with dividend hike.Following the merger with Spectra Energy on Feb 27, Enbridge created the largest energy infrastructure company in North America. Now, Enbridge intends to streamline its portfolio by spending as much as C$22 billion on growth and maintenance developments through 2020-end. While majority of the capital budget – C$14 billion – will likely be funded by internally generated cash, Enbridge will finance C$3 billion through the sale of non-core assets and C$1.5 billion through equity capital – by issuing common stocks.Investors should know that Enbridge has figured out C$10 billion worth of non-core assets. Of the total, the company expects to monetize at least C$3 billion in 2018 through the divestment of some unregulated natural gas midstream assets and onshore renewable operations.Enbridge also received an approval from the board of directors to bump up its quarterly dividend. The new dividend of 67.1 Canadian cents, represents a sequential increase of 10%, will likely be paid on Mar 1, 2018, to stockholders of record as of Feb 15, 2018. (Read more Enbridge to Streamline Asset, Hike Dividend, Lower Debt)4.    North American pipeline operator, TransCanada Corporation (TRP  -  Free Report) resumed operations of its Keystone Pipeline on Nov 28. Services of the pipeline operator were stalled on Nov 16 following a spill of around 5,000 barrels in Marshall County, SD. The repair and resumption plans of the pipeline had been evaluated by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. Per the review guidelines, the pipeline will now run at a reduced pressure at around 80% capacity, ensuring a safe and controlled operation.This is the third time, since it has started operations in 2010, that the project has been booked for causing oil spill. Federal investigators believe that constructional fault is the most likely reason for the oil spill. Preliminary investigations suggest that the spill is due to the mechanical fault and a coating associated with the weight installed when the pipeline was built in 2008.  This has raised concerns among South Dakota regulators regarding the future operations and potential risks associated with the pipeline.TransCanada has been instructed to prepare a detailed report analyzing the root cause of the damage along with a remedial course of action to treat it. In this regard, the company now plans to run an inspection device on the Keystone to gauge the risks related to the other sections of the pipeline.

(CRZO  -  Free Report) recently agreed to divest all its Denver-Julesburg Basin assets for a total consideration of $140 million. The deal will also fetch Carrizo up to $15 million in contingent payments over the next three years, which depends on oil price level surpassing a predetermined limit. The company is yet to declare the name of the buyer.Carrizo expects the transaction, which has an effective date of Sep 1, 2017, to close in January 2018. In the third quarter, the DJ Basin assets produced 2,427 net barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boe/d), of which 69% was oil.The divestment is in line with the company's strategy, announced earlier this year, to sell its non-core assets.  The sale will also help it to lower its debt burden. It is to be noted that as of Sep 30, 2017, the company had long-term debt of $226 million.

502,VLO,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles fell more than expected as exports jumped to a new record. The report further revealed that gasoline inventories rose from previous week, while distillate stocks recorded a fall. Meanwhile, refinery activity continued to rebound from post-Hurricane Harvey challenges.However, the positive effect from the hefty crude inventory draw was more than offset by the news of production resumption at Libya’s largest oil field and slipping compliance to OPEC’s output cut deal.As a result, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost 0.9% (or 44 cents) to settle at $49.98 per barrel Wednesday – the lowest settlement since Sep 19.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories slumped by 6 million barrels for the week ending Sep 29, following a decrease of 1.8 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 1.5 million barrels.Soaring exports in the wake of widening Brent premium to WTI led to the big stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consumer. A discount in U.S. oil prices to the global benchmark Brent (or a larger spread) makes domestic crude attractive in overseas markets.The rapid decline of oil inventories in recent months has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 465 million barrels, current crude supplies are marginally below the year-ago period. However, stocks are close to the upper half of the average range during this time of the year.Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was up by 1.5 million barrels to 62.5 million barrels.The crude supply cover was down from 31.5 days in the previous week to 30.3 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 30.4 days.Gasoline: Supplies of gasoline were up for the second week running as refinery throughput decreased. The 1.6 million barrels addition – slightly above the polled number of 1.5 million barrels rise in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 218.9 million barrels. Despite last week’s increase, the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product is remains 3.7% below the year-earlier level but is in the upper limit of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) went down by 2.6 million barrels last week, compared with analysts’ expectations for 2.4 million barrels decrease in supply level. The weekly fall could be attributed to strengthening demand. At 135.4 million barrels, current supplies are 15.7% below the year-ago level but are in the top half of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 5.4% from the prior week to 88.6%. While refinery runs have rebounded from storm-induced nine-year lows, it’s still a far cry from the pre-Harvey rates of 96.6% - the highest since 2005.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.The data from EIA generally acts as a catalyst for crude prices and affect producers, such as ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), and refiners such as Valero Energy Corp. (VLO  -  Free Report), Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) and Marathon Petroleum Corp.

504,VLO,"Leading North American independent refiner and marketer of petroleum products, Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report), is set to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27, before the opening bell.The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the last four quarters with an average earnings beat of 16.25%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement. Valero Energy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Valero Energy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Valero Energy Corporation QuoteFactors to ConsiderValero Energy has the most diversified refinery base among independent refiners, with a capacity of 3.1 million barrels per day in its 15 refineries across the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean. We note that the company is favorably positioned to benefit from increased refining margins, mainly due to its strategic refinery structure that enables it to use cheaper oil for more than half of its needs.Although crude ended the second quarter of this year with a decline of 4.7%, the pricing environment of commodities was much healthier than the year-ago quarter, courtesy of the historical OPEC agreement. Improvement in oil prices is definitely not favorable for Valero as the input cost for refiners increase with a price hike.  Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Valero Energy is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Valero Energy currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.08. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Valero Energy carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power. However, the company’s 0.00% Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction inconclusive.Conversely, the Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Though the company’s shares have underperformed the industry during the April–June quarter of this year, it remains to be seen how the stock performs after the earnings release.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some firms that you may want to consider on the basis of our model. These have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:TransCanada Corporation (TRP  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of + 7.84% and a Zacks Rank #1.

505,VLO,"Per the S&P Global Platts ranking of the top financial performers of the year, U.S. oil giant ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) was pushed down to the ninth spot from its top position. In fact, only two domestic companies could sustain their position in the Top 10 list of the biggest financial performers.Valero Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report), an independent refiner in the United States secured the #8 position, down from #3 last year. Another U.S. company that had a massive rank fall was Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report), down to #121 from #17 last year.Russian energy company Gazprom dethroned ExxonMobil for #1 in the 2017 S&P Global Platts Top 250 Global Energy Company Rankings.  Last year, Gazprom had secured the #3 slot.Platts ranks company’s financial performance based on four parameters – asset worth, revenues, profits and return on invested capital. The companies on the list also need to have assets greater than $5.5 billion.Reasons for Gazprom #1An energy economist explains that government support might have been a big factor that has led to the change in the rankings. The Russian government owns the majority share in Gazprom. Also, Gazprom’s #1 spot is significant of management's endeavor to combat low oil and gas prices, bans from low interest rate credit in Europe and its position as the EUs leading foreign supplier of natural gas, a market where the United States is seeking expansion opportunities.Other Exceptions Seen in This Year’s RankingsPer S&P Global Platts, the major changes in the rankings this year might have been due to the significant upheavals in the energy sector. This includes the volatility in the oil prices for three years in a row. Conventionally, the list of toppers includes integrated oil companies.However, this year we witnessed utilities and pipeline companies holding the top spots. This can be explained as the oil price volatility doesn’t essentially impact utilities and pipeline companies. The revenue for regulated utilities remain relatively firm. Similarly, pipeline companies also usually enter into long-term contracts with fairly rigid pricing.Some oil companies proved the exception by moving up as they made more investments in pipelines. One such company was French oil giant Total SA (TOT  -  Free Report), which climbed to #10 from #12. It returned to the top 10 after a two-year hiatus due to remarkable investments in the U.S. natural gas.Other noteworthy jumps made by some companies include S&P German utility E.ON, which climbed to No.2 from No.114. British utility Centrica leaped to #15 from #156.  Will the Trend Continue?Per the analyst with Platts, the recent phenomenon is likely to be temporary. Last year, the United States removed a 40-year old ban on crude oil exports as part of its efforts to compete with some members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) as exporters by 2020. This might help U.S oil giants regain their previous positions.Platts believes that Gazprom's role in the European natural gas market facilitated it to jump up to #1. About 20% of European natural gas needs are supplied by Gazprom and some European companies have invested its planned expansion of the Nord Stream pipeline through the Baltic Sea, despite some European governments combating it because of anti-trust concerns.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

506,VLO,"Leading refining player, Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 13.89%, courtesy of higher throughput margin. Moreover, Valero surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 18.24%.Which Way Are the Estimates Headed?Let’s take a look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of analyst opinion on the stock before the earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.84 for third-quarter earnings has been revised upward over the last 30 days, with five firms being bullish and three firms taking a bearish stance. The consensus estimate reflects a year-over-year improvement of about 48.3%.Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $20,183 million for the third quarter, up 2.7% from the year-ago quarter.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Valero is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Valero’s Earnings ESP is +0.27%. A favorable ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.    Zacks Rank: Valero currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) has a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Valero’s Zacks Rank #2 and +0.27% ESP makes us reasonably optimistic of an earnings beat.What’s Driving Better-than-Expected Earnings?Among independent refiners, Valero has the most diversified refinery base. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s refining segment earnings stands at $1,372 million, higher than $990 million recorded in the year-ago quarter and $959 million in the prior quarter.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for throughput margin per barrel from Valero’s refining operations stands at $10.88, much higher than $8.66 in the preceding quarter and $9.07 in the year-ago quarter.We also appreciate the company’s strong balance sheet as reflected in the rising cash balance since 2015. Also, the company’s debt load has reduced over the same time frame.  Q3 Price OutperformanceDuring the quarter, Valero has rallied 14%, outperforming the industry’s 10.5% gain.     Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Noble Midstream Partners LP (NBLX  -  Free Report), headquartered in Houston, TX, has diversified energy infrastructure properties.

507,VLO,"We are entering the heart of the Q2 earnings season, with more than 50% S&P 500 members expected to come out with results by the end of this week.Picture Emerging Thus FarWe now have Q2 results from 97 S&P 500 members that combined account for 28.1% of the index’s total market capitalization. According to the latest Earnings Trends, total earnings for these companies are up 8.4% from the same period last year on 5.1% higher revenues, with 78.4% positive earnings surprises and 72.2% beating revenue estimates.At this stage, we don’t have too many results from the ‘Energy’ sector. However, a number of companies have earnings lined up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.Energy: First-Half RecapLast year, 'Energy' was the strongest S&P sector performer, with a market-thumping 24% return. In particular, November's historic OPEC-led production cut deal to alleviate a supply glut managed to buoy oil prices and stabilize them around the psychologically important $50 per barrel threshold. The commodity was on a stellar run on optimism surrounding the agreement, and the outlook for oil stocks was getting better.The seemingly positive developments encouraged investors to bet on firming prices for 2017 with the oil industry finally hoping that 'this would be the year.' True to the strong sentiments, U.S. oil prices reached around $55 per barrel in late February, the highest level in 19 months.However, the situation is drastically different now, with the commodity having floundered in recent weeks. By Jun 21, crude had cratered more than 20% from its February highs and officially plunged into bear territory. In fact, prices ended down 14.3% for the first half of the year – the worst performance since 1998.Let's take a look at how oil and gas prices behaved during the second quarter of this year.Strong Q2 Earnings Growth PredictionA look back at the Q1 earnings season reflects that the overall results of the Oil/Energy sector were spectacular, driving the aggregate growth picture for the S&P 500 index.The Jan-Mar 2017 period turned out to be a rather good one with both oil and natural gas prices benefiting from easier comparison figures from the year-ago period. While crude slumped to some 12-year low in the first quarter of 2016, natural gas futures dropped to its worst level in almost 17 years.As a result, the sector – whose year-earlier comparison was to an aggregate loss – came out swinging. For the sector components on the S&P 500 index, total Q1 earnings had robust year-over-year dollar growth on 33.8% higher revenues. While 69.7% of the companies were successful in beating earnings estimates, 63.6% of them outperformed the topline.The picture looks rather encouraging for the upcoming Q2 earnings season as well. This is not surprising, considering that oil and gas are both averaging higher compared to the second quarter of 2016 when the energy companies reported unusually low bottom-line. While earnings for the Oil/Energy sector are set to jump a massive 271.4% – the highest year-over-year growth among all sectors – the top-line is likely to show a growth of 15.1% from the second quarter 2016 levels.Stocks to Watch for Earnings on Jul 27Let’s see what’s in store for six energy companies expected to come up with Jun quarter numbers on Thursday, Jul 27.Contract drilling services provider Helmerich & Payne Inc. (HP  -  Free Report) is expected to report before the opening bell.In the previous quarter, this Tulsa, OK-headquartered provider of drilling rigs, equipment and personnel to explore for and develop oil and gas missed estimates, weighed down by lower drilling activity, especially in the international markets.Regarding earnings surprises, Helmerich & Payne is on a bit of a slippery surface, having missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four reports. And our model indicates that the company is unlikely to beat on earnings this time around too.This is because, as per our proven model, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to beat earnings. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.For the quarter to be reported, Helmerich & Payne has an Earnings ESP of -6.45%, while it carries a Zacks Rank #3. Though a Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. (Read more: Helmerich & Payne's Q3 Earnings: What's in the Cards?)Simultaneously, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Helmerich & Payne, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Helmerich & Payne, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Helmerich & Payne, Inc. QuoteHeadquartered in Houston, TX, National Oilwell Varco Inc. (NOV  -  Free Report) is another energy company set to report second-quarter 2017 results – this time after market closing. The company – which is one of the biggest manufacturers of drilling equipment – has a good track of having outperformed estimates in three of the last four quarters.However, National Oilwell is likely to break the trend in the to-be-reported quarter. This is because the company is a Zacks Rank #4 stock that has an Earnings ESP of -14.29%.National Oilwell Varco, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  National Oilwell Varco, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | National Oilwell Varco, Inc. QuoteThen there is Pittsburgh, PA-based integrated energy company EQT Corp. (EQT  -  Free Report) coming out with Apr-Jun operational results before the opening bell.As far as earnings surprises are concerned, EQT – an Appalachia-focused natural gas firm with primary focus on production and midstream operations – has a decent record, having missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate just once in the last four reports. However, with an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3, our proven model shows that an earnings beat is uncertain for EQT in the upcoming quarterly release.

(MPC  -  Free Report) reporting second-quarter 2017 results tomorrow - again ahead of the opening bell. Coming to the earnings surprise history, this Findlay, OH-headquartered downstream operator has a good record: it’s gone passed estimates in three of the last four quarters, resulting in an average positive surprise of 189.75%.But our model does not indicate that the company is likely to beat on earnings this time around, as it has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. While a Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.

508,VLO,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles fell unexpectedly as refinery throughput rose. The report further revealed that gasoline inventories rose from previous week, while distillate stocks recorded a fall.The bullish impact from the surprise crude inventory draw was supported by other developments including strong Chinese data, mounting tensions between Iraq and Kurdistan near an oil-rich region, President Trump’s decision not to certify Iran’s compliance with the nuclear deal, and a falling U.S. rig count.As a result, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained around 4.4% for the week to settle at $51.45 per barrel Friday – the highest since Sep 29.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 2.7 million barrels for the week ending Oct 6, following a decrease of 6 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 400,000 barrels.Improving refinery crude runs amid higher utilization rates, together with lower domestic production, led to the big stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consumer.The rapid decline of oil inventories in recent months has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 462.2 million barrels, current crude supplies are 2.5% below the year-ago period. However, stocks are close to the upper half of the average range during this time of the year.However, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was up by 1.3 million barrels to 63.8 million barrels.The crude supply cover was down from 30.3 days in the previous week to 29.1 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 29.4 days.Gasoline: Supplies of gasoline were up for the third week running following the end of the peak driving season. The 2.5 million barrels addition – contrary to the polled number of 1.4 million barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 221.4 million barrels. Despite increases over the past few weeks, the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains 1.8% below the year-earlier level but is in the upper limit of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) went down by 1.5 million barrels last week, compared with analysts’ expectations for 1.6 million barrels decrease in supply level. The weekly fall could be attributed to strengthening export demand and storm-induced outages. At 134 million barrels – the lowest since June 2015 – current supplies are 14.6% below the year-ago level and are in the bottom half of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 1.1% from the prior week to 89.2%. While refinery runs have rebounded from storm-induced nine-year lows, it’s still a far cry from the pre-Harvey rates of 96.6% -- the highest since 2005.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.The data from EIA generally acts as a catalyst for crude prices and affect producers, such as ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), and refiners such as Valero Energy Corp. (VLO  -  Free Report), Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) and Marathon Petroleum Corp.

509,VLO,"Downstream operator Tesoro Corporation  recently inked a three-year transportation and storage agreement with Mexico’s Pemex Logística.Deal HighlightsA couple of months back, Tesoro won the Pemex auctions by offering the best tariffs for obtaining capacity on pipelines and storage terminal network. With this current deal, Tesoro will be entitled to use Pemex’s product pipelines and storage terminals and thereby will be allowed to supply transportation fuels in the Mexican states of Baja California and Sonora. Tesoro intends to integrate supply to Mexico with its West Coast Refining and Logistics system and sell gasoline and diesel in Mexico under its ARCO brand.The strategic deal will help Tesoro to strengthen its geographical foothold in Mexico and provide further growth opportunities for its marketing business. The Pemex deal will enable Tesoro to link cities such as Mexicali, Rosarito, Ensenada, Guayamas, Hermosillo and Ciudad Obregon through pipelines. It also gives the refiner company, storage terminal space in Rosarito, Mexicali, Ensenada, Guaymas, Ciudad Obregón, Hermosillo, Magdalena, Nogales and Navojoa. The deal is likely to create additional shareholders value for the company.This was the first open season for the Pemex auctions and has provided an opportunity to Tesoro to cash in on the growing demand of gasoline, diesel and other refined products in Mexico. Pemex is expected to hold a second auction for capacity on its network this year.Mexico – An Attractive Offshore ProspectTesoro had been contemplating to expand its presence and enter the Mexico market for quite some time.Energy reforms have transformed Mexico into one of the most attractive offshore prospects. In 2014, Mexican Congress passed landmark energy reforms to overhaul the country’s entrenched energy industry. The amendments opened private investment in the country by foreign investors, ending the monopoly of the country’s state owned behemoths Pemex and the power utility Comisión Federal de Electricidad.Mexico is currently heavily reliant on the U.S. for its energy supplies importing over 60% of its refined fuels from the country, thus providing huge market for refiners like Marathon Petroleum (MPC  -  Free Report) and Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report). Mexico’s demands for such products have not only helped to allay the energy glut in the U.S. markets but have also enhanced the earnings margins of the U.S. firms.Zacks Rank Headquartered in San Antonio, TX, Tesoro is an independent refiner and marketer of refined petroleum products in the western U.S. The company operates in three segments: refining, marketing and logistics through Tesoro’s master limited partnership, Tesoro Logistics LP .

510,VLO,"Integrated energy giant BP plc (BP  -  Free Report) is contemplating spinning off some of its Midwest and Gulf Coast pipelines into a master limited partnership (""MLP"") and filing for an initial public offering (""IPO"") to raise cash. The MLP will incorporate pipelines of crude oil, natural gas, and refined petroleum products and will be called BP Midstream Partners. The company expects the regulatory process for the same to begin toward the end of the year.The plan was originally proposed internally five years ago but put on hold due to the persistent weakness in oil prices.  The company had to reduce its capital spending over the past three years to counter the price drop.BP expects this move to result in increased efficiency for the MLP and provide it with capital in favorable terms. This tax-avoiding corporate structure will help the MLP to generate more value for its unit holders while creating opportunities for the expansion of the pipeline business.BP is yet to provide details on the valuation of the transaction. The company will retain general partner position of the MLP and the most of its limited partner interests. BP will also hold all of the MLP’s distribution rights, which will allow it to have greater control over the assets.This kind of a move is not unprecedented in the space. BP seems to be following the footsteps of Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report), Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report), Tesoro Corporation  and Marathon Petroleum Corporation. Shell raised approximately $1 billion in 2014 through MLP IPO.In this context, we would like to remind investors that the company operates in 48 states of the country and has almost 3,500 miles of pipeline. BP’s terminal facilities can transport and store more than 1.3 million barrels of oil equivalents per day (BOE/d), which include oil, refined products and natural gas.Price Performance In the last six months, the company’s shares have outperformed the Zacks categorized Oil and Gas - International – Integrated industry. The company’s shares lost 5.5%, while the industry registered a decrease of 7% in the same period.About the Company & Zacks RankLondon-based BP is one of the world's major integrated energy companies that provides its customers with fuel for transportation, energy for heat and light; retail services and petrochemical products. BP has a strong portfolio of upstream projects that are expected to fetch significant cash flows. The company anticipates the projects to add 800 Mboe/d to net production capacity by 2020, once they are online. It is to be noted that 90% of these upstream developments are either under construction or are completed.However, the oil spill incident of 2010 in the BP-operated Macondo Prospect is still affecting the company. Although BP has cleared the huge litigation expenses related to the spill, it had to divest some of its best operating properties. The asset sales might hinder BP’s future cash generating opportunities going forward. It is to be noted that the lost reserves/production from the group's asset sales cannot be ignored either.As a result, the company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
