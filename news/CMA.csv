2,CMA,"Among Carillon Scout Mid Cap Fund's (UMBMX) holdings, such stocks as Abiomed (ABMD), Arista Networks (ANET) and Comerica (CMA) are providing enough lift to keep the fund ahead of its midcap blend fund peers and within shouting distance of the S&P 500.X The fund is down 0.37% this year as of Feb. 28 vs. a 0.87% decline by its midcap blend peers tracked by Morningstar Direct and a 1.83% gain by the S&P 500.But it's the fund's longer-term performance that catches the eye. It's outperformed both its peers the S&P 500 in the past one, three, five and 10 years ended Dec. 31. It rose 24.02%, and an average annual 14.17%, 16.35% and 11.13% in the past three, five and 10 years.Former Air Force B-52 bomber crew member Patrick Dunkerley and his co-managers oversee the top performing mutual fund. In an interview with IBD, Dunkerley credited the strong showing to his investment team, their disciplined investment process that combines fundamental, marco economic and technical analysis, as well as a flexible valuation approach.IBD: You not only beat peer midcap funds in the past 1, 3, 5 and 10 years, but you also beat the S&P 500 in that period, one of only 16 mid cap funds to do so. What's behind the strong performance in both short term and long term?Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersPatrick Dunkerley: We are fortunate to have performed well over many years and different time periods. We seek to generate good risk-adjusted returns as measured against our benchmark, the Russell Midcap Index.  I credit our team members, including our team chemistry plus our disciplined investment process for this sustained performance.Co-managers Derek Smashey and John Indellicate have been with us since inception in 2006, and co-manager Jason Votruba joined us in 2013, along with senior analysts Craig West following health care and Eric Chenoweth following energy and utilities, who joined us in 2016 and 2017 respectively.Our investment process is unique because we incorporate both top-down macroeconomic and company specific analysis, with an emphasis on quality stocks, and a flexible valuation approach, which changes depending if market conditions are bullish or bearish.IBD: The biggest exposure has been to tech, consumer cyclical, financial services and industrials. What do you see the source of performance in the balance of this year? What macro trends are affecting your decisions?Dunkerley: Healthy leading indicators, good credit availability, adequate money supply growth, and an upward slope to the U.S. Treasury yield curve all support our bullish equity view at the moment, but increased volatility seems likely given the market sentiment is adjusting to higher interest rates.  From a sector point of view, we are sticking with investments in cyclical companies for now, with an emphasis on technology, financials — including banks and insurance companies that benefit from higher interest rates, industrials, materials, and energy as strong U.S. and global growth is lifting earnings.The consumer discretionary sector is enjoying a new tailwind, with retail sales coming in stronger than expected, and more earnings performance likely as the U.S. tax cuts and wage increases stimulate growth.  We believe stock selection is important so we own deep discounters such as Ross Stores (ROST), or other retailers than can blunt the effect of online competition.  In addition, consumer companies offering unique experiences such as Live Nation Entertainment (LYV) benefit as millennial consumers seek entertainment, such as live concerts.We believe U.S. inflation will increase and the dollar should continue to be soft if risk-on investor sentiment prevails in 2018.Our position in gold miner Newmont Mining (NEM) helps to insulate the portfolio from a gradually declining U.S. dollar, and should capture benefits from an improving gold price due to curtailed capital spending in the gold mining industry. The company pays a 1.4% cash dividend yield, and has unhedged exposure to the gold price.Stronger defense spending funded by the recent federal budget should help companies like Harris (HRS), a leader in military radios. In addition, companies like Hexcel (HXL) and Xylem (XYL) are profiting from global growth in aircraft demand and the need for better water treatment, respectively.We expect equity markets to rise further, but, if credit conditions turn bearish due to an overly aggressive Federal Reserve, then we would become more defensively positioned.  This will eventually happen, but it's not happening at the moment and we believe bullish conditions for U.S. equities are intact, despite the recent volatility in the markets.IBD: Where are we in the small cap, mid cap and large cap cycle of outperformance/underperformance?Dunkerley: We think mid caps are set up for competitive performance with the other capitalization categories. For the trailing 10 years ended Dec. 31, 2017, U.S. midcaps and small caps have outperformed their large-cap cousins, as measured by the various Russell indexes, with midcaps generating the best returns over that time period.  This midcap outperformance is consistent with longer-term historical data dating back to 1979, although we would caution that mid caps do not outperform in every time period.For example, last year, the large caps outperformed.  But, given the long-term historical outperformance of U.S. midcaps, they deserve a premium valuation and currently they do trade at a slight premium to large caps, based on forward looking (estimated) price-to-earnings ratios.  We believe the recent outperformance of large caps was driven by a valuation discount that was too wide.  But that discount has narrowed.IBD: Do you buy only midcap companies or will you buy large caps and small caps as long as they don't lift or lower the average market cap above or below midcap?Dunkerley: We seek to buy stocks within the market capitalization range of our benchmark, the Russell Midcap Index, with particular emphasis on companies with greater than a $2 billion market capitalization as they are often more liquid.IBD: What's your process for buying stocks? Do you start with screening for fundamentals?Dunkerley: We believe an active approach can outperform the benchmark by choosing higher-quality stocks, and by employing both top-down and bottom-up portions of our research process.  We follow over 150 economic indicators on a weekly basis, and we employ a toolbox approach to valuation, utilizing different tools during a bull market cycle to measure upside potential of a stock, while paying more attention to downside valuation risk during bear markets.We believe a good understanding of the macroeconomic picture helps us to more effectively position the portfolio sector weights, which are important.In addition, our bottom up research checklist helps us to identify the fundamentally strong companies with favorable financial characteristics, undervaluation, good business models, effective management, and that are free from serious litigation risks.IBD: How big a role does technical analysis play in your selection process?Dunkerley:  We do look at charts, particularly as an aid for timing of trades, or to help better understand the fundamental picture at a company.  Some of the ""cheapest"" stocks in the long run, in other words the best long-term investments from my experience, are found making new highs.We don't have to be the first to buy or sell a stock in order to be successful, as significant moves up or down can often be long lasting.  So quite often, the market will ""discover"" a stock as evidenced by strong price action seen in the chart. We just have to do the fundamental work to make sure the investment is sustainable. We also buy stocks that are experiencing price corrections if we think they have the quality characteristics we seek, so we are not exclusively buying stocks near highs.IBD's TAKE: Many of the top performing stocks in the past were trading at new price highs and above-average P-Es before they made the biggest gains of their run-ups. IBD: What are your sell rules?Dunkerley: Our process is to sell a stock due to a negative change in the fundamentals, problematic valuation, if we find a better investment alternative, or to manage our portfolio characteristics. One advantage of active management is the ability to seek to sell stocks with weakening fundamentals before the bad news is fully reflected in the stock price, so we strive to act decisively when our thesis changes.IBD: Do you spend much time talking with company management or do balance sheet and earnings report tell you what you need to know?Dunkerley: We believe the numbers reported by companies are one of the most important clues in securities analysis, determining the quality of the business, spotting trends, and evaluating the effectiveness of management. Good investment practice involves a thorough understanding of the cash flow statement and balance sheet, in addition to the income statement. We believe too many investors ignore the former and emphasize the latter, and this causes problems particularly during bear markets.However, we also like to invest with good management teams, and our investment team meets with various company managements nearly every week, or sees them at conferences in order to better size up their strategies and abilities.We also read conference call transcripts to deepen our understanding of the businesses and better understand the strategy of management, in addition to face-to-face meetings.Finally, competitive dynamics are always important and we seek to own companies we perceive as having a sustainable advantage so they can better protect profits and grow, such as a unique products or strong industry position, new product cycle, or management skill.  But we don't exclude commodity businesses that we think are experiencing an upcycle in fundamentals.IBD: Do you have a standard size, steps or range for beginning positions?Dunkerley: We often ramp a new position to at least 50 basis points (half of 1%) of the portfolio fairly quickly.IBD: Your portfolio is quite diversified with 154 stocks and 18% in the top 10 and no stock account for more than a little above 3%. How do you manage your winners?Dunkerley: We let winners run when it seems prudent to do so, although we often trim the position if we think the upside move is overdone. Our forward-looking valuation tool, the discounted earnings model helps us to gauge upside potential in a stock, primarily during bull markets.We build these for each stock we invest in, it's part of our fundamental analysis. So if we notice a stock discounting too much of its future potential, we will often trim it down or swap into another stock. This is another advantage of active management over passive, when properly executed.IBD: What strategy do you have for lagging stocks that were put into the portfolio with expectations of superior gains but become a drag on portfolio performance?Dunkerley: Our sell discipline is well defined, and has helped us to outperform our Russell Midcap benchmark by controlling downside risk. We will sell or trim a stock when we detect fundamental deterioration in the business outlook, or if we determine that high valuation is an outsized risk. Each of our team members covers one or more sectors of the market, and we emphasize looking at the downside risks all of the time, but especially prior to each quarterly earnings report.So we do a lot of work detecting and analyzing downside risk factors in the stocks we own. It's an ongoing project, and we seek to avoid complacency regarding the fundamentals or the valuation. Keeping tabs on stocks we already own is the majority of the work we do typically.IBD: Turning to a few of your top holdings, DXC (DXC) has run up 50% since last April and is trading at all-time highs near 103, with a market cap of $29 billion. What do you like about the Hewlett Packard Enterprise spinoff? Sales are down and it's expected to post its first profit in five years. And does the stock have more room to run, or is it getting too rich — and its market cap too big?Dunkerley: A clearer picture of the earnings history can be found under the former ticker CSC. On a GAAP basis, the company was profitable four out of the past five years.  The top end of the market capitalization range of the Russell Midcap Index is currently near $40 billion, so a $29 billion market cap company is a midcap company as currently defined by Russell.We think the stock is cheap at under 7X total enterprise value to EBITDA if you look two years out, and Mike Lawrie, the CEO there has a great track record of delivering earnings progress, and positive shareholder actions such as special dividends and spinoffs.  If they successfully spinoff the government technology services business, that will be the second time he has accomplished a spinoff since 2015, back when it was named Computer Sciences and they spun off CSRA, another government services technology business.They also paid a $10.50 per share special dividend that year, so a repeat in 2018 of a special dividend would be sweet, but we can't forecast that.This is not a rapid top-line growth situation, it is more about rationalizing the business and managing it more efficiently, so margins can expand.  The recent merger with Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Services gives Lawrie a bigger platform to work with. This is one of the best CEOs in America today, we think. So this is an investment in good management execution in what is a competitive technology services industry. We have owned this stock for many years and it has performed terrifically for shareholders.IBD: Abiomed has also run up, but it continues to post big earnings increases. What's the potential for this stock and what are the risks?Dunkerley: For the long term, we think Abiomed has great prospects.  They have a strong competitive position in small heart pumps for cardiac surgeries. We think the available possible total market (TAM) for these pumps could be as much as an estimated 500 thousand units globally over time, although we don't expect Abiomed to capture all of that market, as few companies ever do that and competition almost always surfaces at some point.We estimate their unit volumes just passed the 24,000 annualized run rate, so there is a long potential runway to this story. Their products are life savers in the hands of a well-trained cardiac surgeon, and they are expanding overseas.The risks in a stock like this are usually competition, which is developing slowly, high statistical valuation that can lead to a correction in the stock, or some type of unexpected flaw in the technology, or poor execution. Since their devices are approved and used in the U.S., Japan, and Germany, among others, and they have great sales and profit momentum, we view the latter risk as low. The stock has had a great run so it could be a better one to buy on pullbacks.IBD:  Atmos Energy (ATO) is 12% off its high and looking for a bottom. What's your thinking on this stock's prospects at this point?Dunkerley: This is a quality utility company, serving the lower-risk market of regulated gas utility service, with a service footprint in eight states including a large presence in Texas.  Regulated utilities offer a better safety profile in our opinion than many industries, so we have owned them in size from time to time when the cycle is right, such as when we expect interest rates to be stable or falling.Atmos has an excellent safety record, which helps them to gain favor with state regulators, and that has driven better than average earnings growth. They also maintain a conservative balance sheet, which we like.Atmos may be one of the few utilities that keeps a chunk of their tax savings from the recent corporate tax cuts, due to potential favorable treatment in Texas, where 70% of their assets are located. However, that is a developing situation and will depend on political outcomes, never a certainty.The main concern with the stock now is the direction of interest rates, which have moved higher.  So Atmos has moved down with the utility sector. Our weighting in utilities is underweight currently vs. the benchmark due to our outlook for higher interest rates.IBD: What happened to Arista Networks that it's 22% off its all-time high after beating earnings estimates? How do you handle a stock like this?Dunkerley: Arista is a share taker in the fast-growing switch market for cloud infrastructure. However after a big run-up, the stock has pulled back, possibly due to what we perceive as conservative guidance by management. We think Arista's advantages are in their software and management expertise, so we are confident in their long-term outlook. Enterprises are rapidly shifting workloads to the cloud and Arista's networking software was built for this environment.IBD: What's your favorite stock at this point, the one with potential to deliver the strongest performance?Dunkerley: For the near to intermediate term, I would have to go with DXC Technologies, our largest holding due to its low valuation and potential operating margin improvement, the potential for a spinoff, and or another special dividend. The global macroeconomic background is favorable for technology companies at the moment, with decent economic growth in many areas of the world, a change from a few years back.Finally, technology spending is a capital expenditure which we think can do well in the middle to late part of an economic cycle, since we believe companies are more likely to spend on technology systems when they feel better about their financial prospects. The recent corporate tax cut in the U.S. helps reinforce our point of view on this, we believe.  However, for the long-term, Abiomed may have the greatest upside potential due to reasons previously mentioned.IBD: Where did you serve in the Air Force, and are there any aspects of serving in the military that translate well to money management?Dunkerley: I served in B-52 bomber units, and was stationed in Maine and California. Military service is good at fostering teamwork and communications skills, and the ability to perform under stress. I enjoyed my time of service and learned a great deal.RELATED:Look Who's Replacing This Top Fidelity Manager During His LeaveWhat's The Stock Market Doing Now?

55,CMA,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones industrial average pared overnight losses Friday morning with Hurricane Irma bearing down on Florida. The U.S. dollar fell for a seventh straight session as Treasury yields neared the key 2% level.XS&P 500 and Dow futures fell a fraction vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures were flat against fair value. The major market averages are trading modestly below all-time highs and slightly above their 50-day moving averages. The euro rose to its highest levels vs. the greenback in nearly three years while the Japanese yen set a 10-year highs. Gold futures continued to advance. The 10-year Treasury yield dipped to a 10-month low of2.03% after a sharp drop on Thursday.Not coincidentally, bank stocks were big losers on Thursday. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) undercut a buy point, the SPDR Financial (XLF) bank ETF, fell below its 200-day line and industry leader Citigroup (C) dropped below its 50-day line. Morgan Stanley (MS) knifed below its 200-day moving avergage while Wells Fargo (WFC) and several superregional bank stocks hit 2017 lows.The current retreat is just one reason to steer clear of bank stocks. Hopes for tax cuts and other Trump agenda items continue to fade. Interest rates and yield spreads have steadily declined. And over the long term, bank stocks have not outperformed. The case for avoiding bank stocks was clear at the end of May; the evidence is even stronger today.Bank stocks briefly outperformed in late 2016, especially following President Trump's election win. But since early 2017 most banks began to follow the market, with clear underperformance in recent weeks, with several signals along the way.Bank stocks rallied after Election Day in part on hopes for sweeping tax cuts, which would lower their own IRS checks as well as bolster economic growth and interest rates, and accelerate Federal Reserve rate hikes. But the odds and timing of a tax hike have steadily declined, with Goldman Sachs now predicting that the odds of tax reform are down to 40%. On the positive front, the Trump administration is still making moves to ease crisis-era financial regulations, potentially freeing up capital for lending and buybacks.With the Trump agenda stalling, Treasury yields have been sliding for weeks. The 10-year Treasury yield fell sharply on Thursday to fresh 2017 lows, in part due to euro gains on European Central Bank hints of tapering asset purchases. The yield is at its lowest levels since Nov. 9, the day after the presidential election. Meanwhile, the spread between short-term and long-term yields has been falling sharply. That's bad news for banks, whose traditional profit model is borrowing short and lending long. It's also not a great sign for the economy when the yield curve flattens out.Bank stocks can be solid investments over certain periods, including right after the election. But they haven't tended to outperform the S&P 500 index significantly over time. Citigroup has been the best-performing U.S. bank stock in 2017, but its Relative Strength line is back about where it was at the start of the year. That means that Citi is trading even with the S&P 500 index. Looking further back, JPMorgan has been one of the better financials, but its shares haven't been long-term outperformers.Investors might be better off buying a broad index fund or ETF, which often will have financials as big holdings, to provide similar performance without the sector or single-stock risk.RELATED:The Big Picture: Stocks Hold Serve, But Banks Face Break PointFour Reasons You Should Withdraw From Bank StocksThese 5 Dow Titans Are Near Buys In Bullish BasesTrump's Debt Deal With Democrats Sinks Tax-Cut Hopes: Goldman SachsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksBanks And Financial Stock News

58,CMA,"X U.S. stock indexes chalked up moderate gains midday Tuesday, as the Nasdaq found some solace from the same place it recently found pain — the quality mega-cap stocks.The Nasdaq trotted ahead 0.5%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average strolled to gains of 0.3% and 0.4% respectively. The small-cap Russell 2000 added 0.5%. Volume in the stock market today was sharply down as the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting got underway.The Street is expecting an interest rate hike Wednesday. The CME Group's FedWatch Tool pegs the odds of a quarter-point rate increase at 99.6%. The remaining 0.4% probability is for a half-point increase.Bulls have run into trouble in recent sessions, largely because of the action of the FANG stocks plus Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT). Since Thursday's small gains, these major players lost 6% to 10% before rebounding midday Tuesday.The FANG stocks include Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and the class A and class C stocks of Alphabet (GOOGL). Toss in Apple and Microsoft and those seven stocks account for about a third of the Nasdaq's weighting.So, the recent bout of selling among these seven heavyweight stocks may or may not say something about the market. The key question is where the money, raised by the selling, will go. Banks and financials are possibilities. So far this month, big percentage gainers among IBD's 197 industry groups include consumer loans, up 8%; banks Southwest, up 7%; investment banks, up 7%; superregional banks, up 6%; and money centers, up 6%.Among the superregionals, Dallas-headquartered Comerica (CMA) broke out at Tuesday's open, clearing a 73.51 buy point in more than twice its usual volume. The Street expects Comerica's earnings to jump 45% this year, which would be the best in six years.Other decent gainers include the Trump infrastructure plays: steel, up 6%; and cement, up 5%.Surprisingly, the lowly rated apparel-makers are up 7% this month. Within that group, March initial public offering Canada Goose (GOOS) is up 21% in June. The IPO is a wild mover, and earnings have been erratic. In fiscal 2014 ended in March, the small-cap company lost a penny a share. Then Canada Goose earned 93 cents a share in fiscal 2015, and $1.15 a share and 94 cents a share in fiscal 2016-17. The Street expects a drop to 37 cents a share this fiscal year.The chip sector, which has been among the uptrend's leaders, has fallen 1% to 2% in June.Another possibility for the money flow is that it will go back into the FANG and mega-cap stocks.

61,CMA,"Earnings for the second quarter kick off in earnest next week with JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) on the docket. Early indications point to another strong season.XS&P 500 companies are expected to report 8% earnings growth on a 4.6% gain in revenues, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S as of July 6. That's a big reversal from a 2.1% profit decline in Q2 2016 as the energy-led earnings slump extended to a fifth consecutive quarter. And it solidifies the comeback that has seen S&P 500 profit growth of 4.3%, 8% and 15.3% in the last three quarters.Apple (AAPL), which has returned to growth in the prior two quarters, should continue to show EPS and revenue gains when it reports on Aug. 1. That's despite many consumers awaiting the Apple iPhone 8 later this year. Due to its massive size, Apple has an outsized impact on overall S&P 500 earnings and especially the S&P 500 technology sector. Facebook (FB) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) should see fat profit gains.That 8% overall earnings target for the second quarter is down 2 percentage points from the start of April, but that's half the usual four-point cut typically seen.That is fueling optimism on Wall Street that Q1's momentum — which saw earnings growth hit its highest level since 2011 — will continue into future quarters.""There is a lot more confidence in what is expected for Q3 than at this time last year,"" Sheraz Mian, research director at Zacks Investment Research, told IBD.One downside to the modest revisions: The markets may already be pricing in strong results. Investors have been taking profits in leading tech stocks over the past month.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock heading into earnings offers the opportunity for big gains or big losses. You may want to adopt this earnings options strategy to capture any upside while limiting your losses.Beyond Q2, S&P 500 companies should grow earnings 8.6% and 13.1% in Q3 and Q4, according to Thomson Reuters. They are estimated to grow earnings 11.3% in 2017 as a whole and 11.7% in 2018 vs. 1.4% in 2016.Profits and revenues have been robust from the roughly 5% of S&P 500 companies that have reported Q2 results so far, including Nike (NKE), Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Oracle (ORCL). Of those 23 companies, 78% have beaten EPS estimates and 87% have topped revenue forecasts.In a typical quarter, 64% of companies overall beat earnings estimates and 59% beat revenue views.The energy, technology and financials sectors are expected to drive earnings growth in Q2 — a period over which the S&P 500 advanced 2.6% and set a new all-time closing of 2,453 on June 19.Oil and gas companies earnings should reverse higher after an outright loss a year earlier. But oil prices are down significantly from the start of 2017, which has hurt shares of Exxon Mobil (XOM) and other energy stocks.Financials and technology, the two largest S&P 500 sectors, are expected to moderate earnings growth from the near-20% Q1 pace. But growth should still be solid, with financials up 7.6% and technology 11.2%, according to Thomson Reuters.Banks continue to see a deceleration in loan growth and unfavorable moves in bond yields, Mian said.Several Wall Street giants have warned of weak trading revenue in Q2, continuing the lackluster trend in 2017. That's a key reason why JPMorgan and Citigroup are expected to show little-to-no profit growth, while regional banks such Comerica (CMA) should see big EPS gains.Still, bank stocks large and small have been leading in recent weeks, helped by higher bond yields and massive buyback and dividend plans. JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup have moved past buy points to long-time highs, while Morgan Stanley (MS), Bank of America (BAC) and others are in buy zones.Technology is the only sector outside of energy that is expected to best the overall 8% S&P 500 gain. The sector also has gotten a boost from Adobe, Oracle and Micron Technology (MU), which smashed quarterly expectations in late June, Mian said. Expect strong growth for Alphabet and Facebook, he added.Health care, which has seen shares of health insurers and many biotechs soar in 2017, is estimated to grow earnings a tepid 2.3%. Other laggards are likely to include materials (4.3%), consumer staples (3.6%), industrials (2.4%), real estate (1.9%), telecom (1.1%) and consumer discretionary (0.9%).The utilities sector should post a 2.8% earnings decline. Of the 11 S&P 500 sectors, only industrials has seen an upward estimate revision for Q2 since the start of April.Zacks, which tracks sectors differently, expects aerospace, construction and industrial products to shine, with earnings growth of 49%, 15.6% and 11.9% respectively.Multinationals such as Apple, Boeing (BA), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet and Facebook, are expected to see less drag from a strong dollar on their earnings.""The dollar was only 4% higher year over year in the second quarter on average, so we don't expect a major impact to earnings because of that,"" said Lindsey Bell, a CFRA investment strategist. The greenback's continued weakness since then should provide a tailwind to multinationals' Q3 earnings.Mian also expects multinationals to benefit from a notably improved overseas growth outlook.""A dividing line in the last earnings season was that more internationally oriented companies had a more positive view of business than those that are domestically oriented,"" he said. ""I expect that trend to continue.""Q2 earnings growth should top current analyst estimates, in keeping with historical trends. But matching Q1's blowout performance will be a tough order, Mian said.The first quarter saw double the growth pace that was expected at the start of the reporting cycle — and that is unlikely to be surpassed for the next few quarters, in Mian's view.RELATED:Q2 Earnings Preview: Stocks Expecting 50%-Plus Growth

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson confirmed that North Korea launched an ICBM, calling it a ""new escalation"" that will brought before the United Nations Security Council. The U.S. and South Korea ordered a significant live-fire missile test as a response, just hours after China and Russia urged the two countries to halt big military exercises on the Korean Peninsula.Japan's Nikkei rose 0.25% after initially falling modestly while South Korea's Kospi gained 0.3%. China's Shanghai composite climbed 0.8% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng 0.5%. In European trade intraday, the U.K.'s FTSE was flat, Germany's Dax was little changed and France's CAC-40 climbed 0.1%.The overnight action exacerbates the Jekyll-and-Hyde market split underway for the last few weeks.On Monday,  Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and many other leading big-cap titans pushed the Nasdaq composite lower again after another failed attempt at retaking the 50-day moving average. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrial average powered to a record high and S&P 500 index edged higher, with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) leading the Dow while Bank of America (BAC) cleared a buy point.As the classic tale of ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" shows, a split personality is unstable. While there are leaders and laggards, the major averages generally follow the same path. So will Bank of America and JPMorgan carry the day, or does the market succumb to Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Google and a tech-led correction?Apple was the first and most notable tech titan to undercut its 50-day moving average on June 10, following the sudden tech stock reversal on June 9. In recent days, Apple has been relatively stable, holding in a consolidation beneath its 50-day, but not heading below that area. But it certainly isn't showing leadership either.Facebook fell 1.9% on Monday, finally closing below its 50-day line after several tests. Amazon, which finished last week just pennies below the 50-day, initially rallied Monday but then reversed for a 1.5% loss, clearly separating from its support line. Netflix, the smallest of the FANG internet giants, continued to descend, sliding 2.2% to its lowest level since late April. Google parent Alphabet lost 1.1%, back to late April prices.Among other big techs, Microsoft (MSFT) retreated 1.1%, continuing to find 50-day resistance.A slew of chip and chip-equipment stocks have tumbled through their key support lines in recent days and weeks. Even the holdouts are running into trouble.Nvidia (NVDA) is still above its 50-day line, but is rapidly approaching that level after climax-like action from May 9-June 9. Micron Technology (MU), which reversed lower Friday despite seemingly strong earnings and guidance, fell sharply on Monday, undercutting its 50-day line.Workday (WDAY), Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Paycom (PAYC) are top software firms that dropped below the 50-day on Monday.BofA, JPMorgan and other bank stocks have surged after they announced huge stock buybacks and dividend hikes last week following the completion of the second round of annual stress tests. A sharp rise in U.S. Treasury yields, partly due to a stronger eurozone economy that's lifting German bund yields and the euro, should be good for banks.JPMorgan rose 1.5% on Monday to 92.75, closing in on a 94.08 cup base. BofA advanced 1.7% to 24.68, closing above a 24.35 aggressive buy point.

65,CMA,"Futures for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 rose early Thursday, fueled by JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and other big financials rallying on buyback and dividend hikes after they passed the second round of stress tests.X S&P 500 futures rose 0.3% above fair value, Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.3% while Dow futures gained 0.2%.On Wednesday, the Dow's JPMorgan Chase and a few other financials broke out into buy range as the major averages rebounded from Tuesday's sell-off. JPMorgan rose 2% to 89.82, topping an 89.23 double-bottom entry. JPMorgan popped above 91 late Wednesday after announcing a $19.4 billion buyback and hiking its dividend 12% to 56 cents. Citigroup, which broke out June 8, rose more than 2% on its capital return plans — a $15.6 billion buyback and doubling its dividend to 32 cents — signaling a move out of buy range.Many other banks also gained ground overnight, with several poised to flirt or clear buy points on Thursday. They include Bank of America and superregionals PNC Financial (PNC), Comerica (CMA) and Keycorp (KEY).IBD'S TAKE: JPMorgan Chase is often viewed as the best-run Wall Street bank. But its stock is rated fifth in the Bank-Money Center group. See which are the top-rated banking giants, and how they stack up vs. objective criteria, at IBD's Stock Checkup.Bank of America will repurchase $12 billion in stock and increase its payout by 60% to 12 cents a share. BofA stock rose 1.5% to 24.23 in late trading after rising 2.6% to 23.88 in regular stock market trading Wednesday.Bank of America has a conventional flat base buy point of 25.90. But an aggressive investor could see 24.45 as an early entry.PNC Financial lifted its dividend to 75 cents, up 36%, and OK'd a $2.7 billion buyback. PNC stock rose 2.5% to 126.50 in late trade after closing up 1.9% to 123.40.PNC has a flat base buy point of 131.93. But it has an aggressive entry of 124.54.Comerica will buy up to $605 million in shares as its payout climbs 15% to 30 cents. Shares rose 1% to 72.69 after hours. Comerica edged up just 0.2% at 71.94 in the regular session.Comerica cleared a 73.51 cup-with-handle buy point earlier this month, but fell back below that level on June 20. The stock found support at its 50-day line and has rebounded modestly, leaving the old entry area still valid.Keycorp raised its dividend by 11% to 11 cents and announced an $800 million buyback. Keycorp advanced 1.2% to 18.60 after hours following a 1% gain during the regular session.Keycorp has a 19.19 cup-with-handle entry.Japan's Nikkei rose 0.4% intraday Thursday, while China's Shanghai composite climbed 0.2%.RELATED:JPMorgan, BofA, Citi, Wells Fargo Hike Payouts, OK Massive BuybacksThe Big Picture: Nasdaq Shows It's Still The Leader, But One Thing Was MissingWalgreens, Nike, Micron To Report As Dry Spell Nears: Investing Action Plan
"
66,CMA,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and Goldman Sachs (GS) were among the nation's biggest banks that got the OK from the Federal Reserve to hike shareholder returns, the second round of the central bank's annual stress tests showed Wednesday.X All 34 banks tested were cleared to do so, but the Fed had reservations about Capital One (COF), which got a conditional pass. The credit card company and American Express (AXP) had to adjust their plans to pass muster.After the test results, banks started announcing richer payouts:The Fed said that it is requiring Capital One to ""to address weaknesses observed in the firm's capital planning practices."" Capital One has until Dec. 28 to resubmit its capital plan.Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs released a statement saying the Fed did not object to its capital plan, but the bank did not provide specific figures for shareholder returns.""We are well positioned to continue to return capital to our shareholders while expanding our client franchise,"" CEO Lloyd Blankfein said in the statement.Other lenders delivering more capital to shareholders:Shares of JPMorgan rallied 2% late after closing up 2% at 89.82 on the stock market today, breaking out past an 89.23 buy point in a double-bottom base. Bank of America rose 1.4% late after finishing up 2.6% at 23.88, resurfacing above its 50-day average and approaching a 25.90 conventional buy point as well as an alternate 24.45 aggressive buy point.Morgan Stanley rose 1.3% late adding to its 0.2% gain to 44.32, still below a 46.08 entry. Citigroup surged 2.3% late, after rising 1.5% earlier. Wells Fargo added 1.4% to its 2.2% gain at the close, while Goldman Sachs edged up 1.2% late, on top of its 1.3% regular-session uptick.IBD'S TAKE: The stress-test results could give bank stocks a jolt after they've been idling in recent months in anticipation of tax reform and regulatory cuts from President Trump and the GOP-controlled Congress. The second test, known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or CCAR, evaluates the quality of a bank's risk management and capital planning procedures and determines how much lenders can pay out to shareholders. Banks will likely begin announcing their dividend and buyback plans shortly after the Fed releases the CCAR results.The results come after Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen delivered a bold vote of confidence for banks Tuesday, saying another financial crisis like the kind seen in 2008 is unlikely ""in our lifetime.""""I think the public can see the capital positions of the major banks are very much stronger this year,"" Yellen said at a conference in London, noting that regulators are more proactive in detecting threats to financial stability than they were a decade ago.The Fed's confidence in the financial system could mean banks may see some relief in the future from the crisis-era measures designed to ensure stability — or at the very least, they may not face tougher rules. But this year's test results are based on economic scenarios the Fed outlined in February.The CCAR test also contains a quantitative portion as well as a qualitative portion, which looks at a bank's internal quality controls. Twenty-one smaller banks this year, however, were exempted from the qualitative part of the CCAR test.The Fed said Wednesday that most of the 13 banks subject to the qualitative portion this year ""have continued to strengthen their capital planning practices since last year."" But it also said that some banks, despite improvements, ""continue to have areas of weaknesses that fall short of meeting supervisory expectations for capital planning.""Citigroup in 2014 failed the qualitative portion, and in recent years Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs received ""conditional passes"" and had to resubmit their capital plans. But banks have largely gotten used to the stress tests since they were first instituted in the wake of the financial crisis.They could become easier as the Trump administration looks to shred big parts of Dodd-Frank financial regulations and fill open positions at the Fed and regulatory agencies.The Fed over the years has tried to balance banks' demands for more testing transparency and its efforts to make the tests matter. The Fed worries that giving banks too much information would make the tests too easy to pass.Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell and Keith Noreika, the acting Comptroller of the Currency, also floated the idea of requiring fewer banks to take the tests.""We believe that future stress tests will also become easier, and the possibility of banks being exempted from the process or not having qualitative reviews for all banks remains open and possible,"" Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said in a research note dated Friday.RELATED:Here Is The Latest Bank To Warn On Q2 Trading RevenueHere's Why Bank Stocks Broke Key Support, Sinking Dow

The Dow Jones industrial average component has an 89.23 double-bottom buy point in play.American Express, also a Dow component and the lone credit card play on this list, rallied to close up 0.3% at 80.84. American Express has an 82.10 buy point in sight.Comerica, a superregional bank, cleared a 73.51 entry on Tuesday. On Wednesday, shares dropped to 72.59 intraday before reversing higher for a 0.5% gain at 74.26.The Federal Reserve signaled Wednesday that it will keep raising rates and will begin to rein in its massive $4.5 trillion balance sheet by year-end. Investors took that as a sign that interest rates will rise and spreads will widen, which would bolster banks' profits. Meanwhile, the Fed will issue stress test results on key financials later this month, following up with its appraisal of dividend and buyback plans.

75,CMA,"Citigroup (C) shares broke out on Thursday, with global and regional banks also trying to reclaim key support levels.The gains came as the House was set Thursday to pass a rollback of Dodd-Frank financial reform measures and as former FBI Director James Comey offered no additional bombshells during his testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee. Early Thursday, the European Central Bank dropped a pledge to ease policy if necessary.The 10-year Treasury yield edged up 1 basis point to 2.19% following modest gains on Wednesday. Shares of Citigroup rallied 2.15% to 63.21, clearing a 62.63 buy point from a flat base. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) climbed 1.2%, nearing its 50-day line as it grinds through a double-bottom base. Bank of America (BAC), up 1.6%, was also close to that key test of investor support. Morgan Stanley (MS) rose 1.9% as it makes its way through a consolidation. Goldman Sachs (GS) added 1.4%, also heading toward its 50-day line.Smaller banks saw steeper gains. Texas Capital Bancshares (TCBI) climbed 3.4%, Umpqua Holdings (UMPQ) popped 5%, and East West Bancorp (EWBC) surged 3.8% to 56.43, closing in on a 57.34 entry. Among superregionals, Comerica (CMA) rose 2.8% and US Bancorp (USB) added 1.3%, both retaking their 50-day lines.After a long postelection sprint, bank stocks began leveling off in March amid concerns the Trump administration's agenda of tax and regulatory reform was stalling.Bank stocks, and markets more broadly, have also been pressured amid the escalating drama over the government's investigations into Russia's meddling in the U.S. November election and the Trump camp's potential ties to Russia.Comey, whom Trump fired last month as he was seeking more resources for the FBI's own investigation into Russian interference, has been a central figure in that drama.In his prepared remarks released on Wednesday, he appeared to relieve markets, as they largely confirmed what had already been reported.On Thursday, Comey didn't drop any new revelations. But he suggested some damaging details might be revealed in a closed-door session and ratcheted up the rhetoric, saying the Trump administration had tried to ""defame"" him and the FBI with ""lies"" and that Trump's ""shifting explanations"" over his firing had made him more concerned.He also said no other person he had worked for while in government had asked him for ""loyalty"" in the way Trump had, and that he began documenting a January meeting with Trump out of concern Trump might lie about it.But he was mum on the details contained in the dossier compiled by former intelligence officer Christopher Steele, and whether Trump's remarks to him amounted to obstruction of justice.Meanwhile, the GOP-led House approved legislation to roll back many Dodd-Frank provisions. But getting 60 votes in the Senate will be a huge hurdle, so it's unclear how much investors were buying banks based on the House vote.RELATED:JPMorgan, BofA Hit On Latest Bad News For BanksAs JPMorgan, BofA Struggle, This Regional Bank Tries To Move Up

77,CMA,"Bank stocks, among the biggest winners since Donald Trump's election, were among the biggest losers as the president's political woes intensified. Citigroup (C) fell back below a buy point, while Bank of America (BAC), Morgan Stanley (MS) and several other big financials undercut key support levels. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS), both members of the Dow Jones industrial average, tumbled below the low of their current consolidations.Stocks sold off Wednesday on news reports that Trump pressured then-FBI Director James Comey to drop his investigation of Mike Flynn, who was briefly the president's national security advisor. Trump abruptly fired Comey last week.While social media is rampant with chatter of impeachment, markets are worried about more realistic scenarios. Trump's agenda for tax cuts and other pro-growth ideas already seem stalled. As a result, the odds of Federal Reserve rate hikes are falling. Treasury yields are sinking, with the yield curve flattening out once again. Bank executives and shareholders have been counting on stronger economic growth to boost lending — and widen the spread between its borrowing costs and lending rates.The Trump administration could still go forward with regulatory relief for banks. But even that could be delayed or scaled back as the president and top officials are occupied putting out political fires of his own making.Citigroup last week cleared an aggressive buy point at 60.89. On Tuesday, shares ran up to just below a convention buy point of 62.63. But Citigroup tumbled 4% to 59.98 on the stock market today, back below the alternative entry though finding some support at its 50-day moving average.Bank of America, which had just gotten above its 50-day line, fell 5.9%. Morgan Stanley, off 5.6%, also broke through that support level and is on track for a 2017 closing low. Citizens Financial Group (CFG) (-6.8%), KeyCorp (KEY) (-4.8%) and Comerica (CMA) (-5.6%) were among several other financials piercing through their 50-day lines.The Dow's JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, already on the wrong side of the 50-day line, fell 3.8% and 5.3%, respectively. Both fell intraday below the low end of their base patterns.Wells Fargo (WFC), which can't shake the fake accounts scandal, lost 1.9%, closing just below its 200-day line.RELATED:Trump Will Bust Up Bank Regulation, Not The BanksThese Words Could Doom Trump's Tax Cuts

78,CMA,"The stock market incurred heavy losses in afternoon trade as investors focused on President Trump's recent missteps.The tech-heavy Nasdaq bore the brunt of today's sell-off, down 1.7%, while the S&P 500 fell 1.1%. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 1.2%, falling under its 50-day line for the first time since late April. The small-cap Russell 2000 declined over 2%. Volume was tracking sharply higher across both exchanges vs. the same time Tuesday. Among the Dow industrials, financial components Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan plunged 4.4% and 2.9%, respectively, while Apple (AAPL) fell 2.3%, which would be the iPhone maker's largest single-day decline since its initial breakout on Jan. 6. Apple's volume tracked over 100% above average.On the upside, medical component UnitedHealth Group (UNH) rose an index-best 0.8%, while Coca-Cola (KO) added 0.7% to recent gains. Shares of UnitedHealth looked to regain their 50-day line.Among the S&P 500, financials comprised much of the worst performers. Notably, leading retail broker Charles Schwab (SCHW) and super regional bank Comerica (CMA) over 5% apiece. Shares of Schwab were approaching their 200-day line, while Comerica gave up its 50-day in heavy volume. FANG stocks experienced sharp sell-offs in the stock market today with Facebook (FB) and Netflix (NFLX) faring the worst, falling 1.7% and 2.1%, respectively. Amazon.com (AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) moved down 1% each.Many retailers were spared from today's carnage as Target (TGT) posted a Q1 earnings beat and sparked a reprieve for the beaten-down industry. Shares rose 2.3%. Victoria's Secret parent L Brands (LB) will report late Wednesday, while Wal-Mart (WMT) will report early Thursday.Chinese internet giant Tencent (TCEHY) reported Q1 results early Wednesday that surpassed the Street's top-and bottom-line targets. Shares nudged 0.3% higher. Competitor Alibaba (BABA) will report its quarterly results early Thursday. Action within the IBD 50 was definitively negative heading into late day trading, but there was one standout in a sea of red. Cyprus-based payment processor Qiwi (QIWI) surged nearly 10% after a strong earnings release early Wednesday. Shares are almost 40% above a 15.81 cup-with-handle entry.On the downside, Citizens Financial (CFG) declined over 6%. The regional bank had been building a cup with handle with a 38.11, but never broke out. Fiber optic company Lumentum (LITE) traded down 5.1%. Shares broke above a 56.03 cup-base entry Tuesday.RELATED:Target Blasts Past Earnings, Sales Views; Guides Q2 HighFANG Stocks News & Quotes: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, GoogleTrump Woes Spur Run On Bank Stocks; Key Technical Levels Broken

79,CMA,"X The major indexes retreated to session lows in early afternoon action as energy stocks tumbled with oil prices. Meanwhile, investors digested some key quarterly results from tech giants over the past few days, with the key monthly payrolls report on tap Friday.The Nasdaq and S&P 500 slid 0.2%. The Dow Jones industrial average, up more than 2.4% over the prior two weeks, gave up 0.4%. Dow components Exxon Mobil (XOM) fell 1.3% and Chevron (CVX) 2.1% as U.S. crude futures fell 4% to $45.90 a barrel, their lowest readings since last November.The Russell 2000 sank 0.5% lower. Meanwhile, on the other side of the pond, major European bourses enjoyed solid advances; the CAC 40 jumped more than 1.3% while the Dax 100 of Germany added nearly 1%.Among other indexes, the Dow utility average edged up 0.1% after underperforming the major averages on Wednesday, losing almost 0.6%.From the birdseye view of IBD's 197 industry groups and subgroups, oil drilling led the downside with a 4.3% loss, followed by Canadian oil exploration (-4.1%), U.S. oil exploration (-4%), international oil exploration (-3.6%) and oil machinery (-3.6%).Oil and gas transport firms were not spared either, with the group getting trounced 3.4%. Oneok (OKE), a star performer in the Income Investor screen in 2016, took out its 200-day moving average in heavy volume as shares dove 5% to 49.53.The Tulsa, Okla.-based pipeline giant showed uncharacteristically wild action since a bad reversal on Feb. 1, causing the stock to spend more time below its 50-day moving average -- a key defensive sell signal. Oneok has also round-tripped its gains from a late-November breakout past a 51.82 buy point in a giant bottoming base. (Please see a long-term weekly chart at Marketsmith to fully view the deep first-stage cup with handle.) Apple (AAPL), one of the Dow Jones industrials' 30 components, continued to show a mild yet manageable decline after Wednesday's nice bounce off its intraday lows. The stock eased 0.8% to 145.90 in volume that is running above normal pace.Because the iPhone giant has now achieved a 25% gain from a Jan. 6-9 breakout from a cup-with-handle base at 118.12, an investor would be fully justified in taking the profit.However, with strong anticipation for the next iPhone series, a rising dividend, and CEO Tim Cook's intention to double service-related revenue within a few more years, an investor also has good reasons to build conviction and watch if the stock has more room to grow. But a report says iPhone sales are weakening in China.No defensive sell signals have been triggered recently.As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, Apple gets a solid 91 Composite Rating, a far cry from the low 60s to 70s several months back. The Composite Rating melds together IBD's most important measures of profit and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity, stock price strength, industry group strength, and other factors.The RS Rating has also vastly improved to a 90, meaning on a 12-month basis, Apple now beats 90% of all public companies in IBD's database.Snap (SNAP), meanwhile, continues to do constructive work on the right side of its base. The Snapchat operator rose 3.8% to 22.64, good for a five-week high.Watch to see if the new social media play on Wall Street can show more strength and possibly take out the 24.40 near-term high. However, that is not a proper buy point for now. Snap also has not formed a proper double bottom; the 19.73 low seen last month did not undercut the 18.90 low set on March 17.Snap's Relative Price Strength rating is irrelevant, since it lacks 12 months' worth of stock action. However, the up/down volume ratio is positive at 1.4, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup (go to the supply and demand section of this valuable timesaving tool). Keep in mind that the up/down volume ratio works best when there are at least 50 days' worth of daily price and volume action.Snap, which reports Q1 results after the close on May 10, is still 22% below its 29.44 peak.Some banks also worthy of watching include Comerica (CMA) and East West Bancorp (EWBC). But Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL) continues to struggle as the stock, down 1 cent to 48.58, is still feeling selling heat near the 50-day moving average.Notice how the 50-day line, painted in red on an IBD or MarketSmith chart, has been sloping lower for at least four weeks.RELATED:More In Stock Market Today: Will These 10 Top Growth Stocks Keep Winning Big In 2017?The Big Picture: Are U.S. Equities Still Superior To Bonds Now?IBD Stock Spotlight: Why Is This Swiss Chipmaker Crushing It?The Case For A New Bull Run In GoldStrong Earnings, Hot Movers: 5 Growth Stocks To Consider

80,CMA,"X Stocks deepened their losses into the close on Wednesday, as the latest accusations against the White House stirred deepening uncertainty in the nation's capital.The Nasdaq sliced 2.6% lower, its worst loss since June. The Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 each lopped off 1.8%, the worst session for both since the Sept. 9 sell-off that followed comments from Federal Reserve officials that all but assured a rate hike that month.Volume roared, up significantly on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq exchanges.The trigger appeared to be news reports that notes by former FBI Director James Comey during a February meeting with President Trump, just after National Security Advisor Michael Flynn had resigned, portrayed the president pressing the director to drop the agency's probe of Flynn. Trump fired Comey on May 9. The White House has so far given conflicting reasons for Comey's firing.Markets in Europe carved out sizable losses, with the CAC 40 in Paris ending down 1.6% and Frankfurt's DAX taking a 1.4% loss.Fiber-optic stocks had some of the day's worst losses. Oclaro (OCLR) tanked 9.5% and Lumentum Holdings (LITE) skidded 8%. Finisar (FNSR) unraveled 9% and Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI) caved 5.5%.Superregional and investment banks were also hit hard. SVB Financial (SIVB) and SunTrust (STI) shed 6% apiece. So did Morgan Stanley (MS) and Bank of America (BAC). Dow component Goldman Sachs (GS) fell 5%. Huntington Bancshares (HBAN) and Comerica (CMA) dived 6% apiece.Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan (JPM) presented the worst losses among Dow industrials. Apple (AAPL) soured 3%.UnitedHealth Group (UNH) logged the strongest gain among blue chips, up 0.4% despite the U.S. Department of Justice launching its second suit against the Medicare Advantage provider in less than a month, alleging more than $1.1 billion in billing fraud.Colgate Palmolive (CL) squeezed out a 6% gain to lead the S&P 500, after news reports said CEO Ian Cook had said he'd be open to selling the company at $100 per share. The comment, which valued the personal products company near $88 billion, reportedly was made during a conference with institutional investors.Chipmakers scored the worst losses among S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 stocks. Micron Technologies (MU) dived 7% to mark the bottom of both lists. Nvidia (NVDA) also dropped 7%, ending a five-day breakout rally. It's now negative for the week.Among companies reporting quarterly earnings, both Jack in the Box (JACK) and Qiwi (QIWI) rattled off 6% gains. Qiwi pared its early 12% gain to end in buy range above a 20.42 buy point in a three-weeks-tight pattern.RELATED: Earnings Distractions From Trump Crises: Investing Action PlanWhich Three Sectors Are Seeing Gains Despite Market Sell Off?

81,CMA,"Stumbles by President Trump and the GOP Congress are so far producing a more uncertain climate for business expansion than expected, leading companies to delay plans for deploying cash reserves.A new survey of corporate finance officers finds that businesses continued to hoard cash in the first quarter, despite their plans to the contrary. A net 15% of businesses grew their cash reserves, just one point lower than a year ago, despite expectations that a net 7% would put their cash to work, the quarterly report from the Association for Financial Professionals found.Still, the survey hints that while investment plans may have been curtailed or sidelined, and confidence may have been dented a bit, there's still a good deal of optimism about the Trump administration delivering on its economic promises. In the current quarter, a net 3% of firms expect to reduce cash levels.The survey largely reflects what JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Comerica (CMA) and other banks have said in recent weeks during earnings calls.Asked about a slowdown in commercial and industrial loans in the first quarter, JPMorgan CFO Marianne Lake acknowledged that ""sequentially things are a bit quieter,"" while adding that the category was up 8% vs. a year ago. CEO Jamie Dimon noted that lending to middle-market companies ""was slow, but it was OK.""Ultimately, though, the banking giant, whose shares are listed on the Dow Jones industrial average, still expects that Trump's pro-growth policies will bear fruit. ""We'll see that translate into loan growth,"" Lake said. ""Whether that's in the second half of this year, we'll see.""Earlier this year, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon had hailed Trump for reviving businesses' ""animal spirits."" But that doesn't seem to have translated into actual spending.IBD'S TAKE: The stock market was rocking and rolling on Monday in celebration of market-friendly weekend election results in France. But will it be enough to renew the market's uptrend? As of now, IBD classifies the uptrend as being ""under pressure,"" a signal that investors should take extra caution when they buy stocks and be quick to cut losses. Read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market's prevailing trend.Comerica noted a 44% increase in its loan pipeline, ""reflective of the improving economy and anticipated changes coming out of Washington.""""There is definitely a lot more optimism than we saw in the third quarter or fourth quarter of last year, even though some of that may have waned a little bit,"" said Comerica President Curtis Farmer, according to a Seeking Alpha transcript.While some clients may not follow through on those loan commitments, he said, ""you have to assume a fair amount of the real book based on the sort of historical trends with our clients and the conversations that we've had.""But US Bancorp (USB) noted last week that large companies are putting off big loans to wait for more clarity on taxes, regulations, infrastructure and trade.RELATED:Trump Surprises Sink Fed Expectations And Bank Stocks Why Trump's 'Wonderful' ObamaCare Plan Casts Doubt On 'Massive' Tax Cut

84,CMA,"U.S. and European bank stocks spiked Monday as the French presidential election eased fears, triggering broad stock market gains, higher bond yields and increased odds for a Federal Reserve rate hike.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) closed 3.5% higher on the stock market today. Citigroup (C), which has a large base of operations internationally, advanced 3%. Bank of America (BAC) popped 4%. Goldman Sachs (GS) rallied 2.9%. JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs all remained below their 50-day moving average.Among European banks, the gains were far more pronounced. Deutsche Bank (DB), which has been hurt by litigation and still-open wounds in Europe's own economy, surged 11%. Barclays (BCS) jumped 5.9%.France's CAC index jumped 4.1% to finish at the highest level in nine years, while the Dow industrials rose 1% and the Nasdaq composite hit an all-time high.The lift came after the first round of French elections put Emmanuel Macron, the centrist candidate, narrowly ahead of Marine Le Pen, who has campaigned on a hard-right, anti-EU platform with nationalistic, anti-immigrant strains similar to those that helped carry President Trump to victory in the U.S.Macron and Le Pen now advance to a May 7 runoff. Macron, who has never been elected but is pushing a pro-reform agenda, is heavily favored. However, so was Hillary Clinton in the U.S., and many did not expect the United Kingdom to vote in favor of leaving the EU last year. But Macron appears to have a lead of more than 20 points vs. Le Pen.The outcome, Wall Street seems to think, could have been worse.A runoff between Le Pen and Jean-Luc Melenchon — a far-left candidate who also wanted to shake up France's relationship with the EU and tax the wealthy at 100% — would have triggered concerns about France's future in the euro and European Union even as the U.K. begins what could be an ugly divorce from the bloc.Meanwhile, the odds for a rate hike from the Federal Reserve by the June meeting jumped to 66% on Monday, up from 53% on Friday. The 10-year Treasury yield, a longer-term measure of inflation expectations, rose 5 basis points to 2.29% Monday morning.The European Central Bank may feel more comfortable about winding down its quantitative easing program earlier if Macron wins the French presidency.Morgan Stanley (MS) rallied 4.2%, while Wells Fargo (WFC) added 1.2%.

88,CMA,"XFutures for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 were slightly lower Wednesday morning in New York, signaling that Tuesday's sell-off heavy losses would continue into Wednesday.Futures for the Dow industrials and S&P 500 index slid about 0.2% vs. fair value, while the Nasdaq 100 lost about 0.3%.On Tuesday, the Nasdaq composite opened at a new high, led by big-cap techs such as Apple (AAPL) (also a Dow component). But market sentiment reversed amid concerns about President Trump's tax cuts: The Nasdaq composite tumbled 1.8%, the S&P 500 index 1.2% and the Dow Jones industrial average 1.1%, the worst losses of the year. The Dow Jones Transportation Average sank 1.9% to its lowest level since late November. Apple, for its part, reversed from a record high to close down 1.15%, below a recent buy point.There's growing concern on Wall Street that Trump's tax cuts and other parts of his pro-growth agenda could be derailed if the ObamaCare replacement bill falters, perhaps in a planned Thursday House vote. The concern is that Congress could get bogged down with health care, especially with a small GOP Senate majority and Trump's low approval ratings.The Dow and other major averages have soared since Election Day on hopes and expectations that the new president and GOP Congress would make good on his promises.That's hitting financial stocks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) especially hard.Expectations for Trump's agenda have helped bank stocks especially.Not only did stocks sell off on Tuesday, but Treasury yields continued their sharp decline since the Fed's March 15 decision. Worse for banks, the yield curve has flattened significantly recently.JPMorgan Chase tumbled 2.9% and fellow Dow financial Goldman Sachs lost 3.8%. Bank of America plunged 5.8% and Citigroup 2.6%. All are now below their 50-day moving averages.But it's not just the Wall Street giants. Every one of the Bank-Super Regional members is trading below their 50-day line.

89,CMA," The market sell-off showed little signs of applying the brakes in the dying minutes of Tuesday's session. Banking, biotech and select metals firms including steel production and metal ores led the decline.With minutes left in the session, the Nasdaq composite accelerated its drop in the final hour of trading, falling 1.8% as large and megacap techs retreated. It's clearly going to be the Nasdaq's biggest single-session drop since the Nov. 8 U.S. elections.The S&P 500 was down nearly 1%. The Dow Jones industrial average provided no relief as it too fell more than 0.9%. Volume expanded sharply vs. Monday, meaning that it is likely to be a true distribution day, or session of intense professional selling.A spate of four or five such distribution days is enough to end a bull market, or at the minimum trigger a mild correction in the range of 5% to 10%.Small caps took bigger hits as the Russell 2000 fell more than 2.6% and dipped back into slightly negative ground for the year. In 2016, the popular small-cap equity index rallied 19.5%. Major Wall Street banks sold off on growing concern about what impact Britain's future exit from the eurozone will have on London's status as a major banking center.Goldman Sachs (GS), which announced that it will move hundreds of employees out of the United Kingdom capital in preparation for the changes, dropped 8.32 points, or more than 3%, and slumped sharply below its 50-day moving average. Volume was running about 26% above average levels.The Wall Street bank, which has thrived by recent movement in U.S. Treasury bonds, is triggering its first major sell signal since breaking out of a long first-stage base with a 172.52 buy point in late October. The gain reached as high as 48%, big enough to have justified taking profits on the way up.One could decide to sell at least half a position bought at the proper entry, then see if the Dow Jones industrials component can rebound back to its 50-day line. For now, shares are trading less than 9% below the 255.15 high.Fellow money-center banks — Bank of Montreal (BMO) and Royal Bank of Canada (RY), as well as Morgan Stanley (MS) — are also down between 0.5% and 4% and showing weak action near their respective 50-day lines. Superregional lender SVB Financial (SIVB) took out its 50-day moving average for the first time since its early October breakout from a large bottoming-style base. Shares in the Santa Clara, Calif., firm slumped more than 6% to 175.84 in more than double average trade. At its 198.83 peak, SVB rose as much as 76% from the 112.93 handle entry.Also in IBD's superregional bank industry group, Dallas-based Comerica (CMA) and SunTrust Banks (STI) of Atlanta dropped more than 5% in heavy turnover and triggered the 50-day line sell rule.Phoenix-based Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL), a top-rated company in IBD's West/Southwest bank group, got slammed with a 7% drop to 47.05, also sinking below its 50-day line in volume running nearly four times usual levels.The stock also triggered the golden rule of selling by falling more than 7% below a recent new flat base entry at 50.82.IBD 50 stocks were not immune to the blanket-like sell-off.China's top internet video game firm NetEase (NTES) slid nearly 4% to 282.59. Yet for now, the stock is holding above its fast-rising 50-day moving average and keeping the air pocket created by an earnings-inspired Feb. 16 big gap up in price. The stock is also still extended more than 5% past a 257.78 cup-with-handle entry point.Cognex (CGNX) and Veeva Systems (VEEV) both fell more than 2% in heavy trading. The former has already gained more than 50% since clearing a 53.55 flat-base entry, while the latter pulled back near a 48.05 flat-base buy point. Yet Veeva has also risen significantly since it broke out of a first-stage bottoming base pattern at 28.05 in May 2016.Keeping gains by selling at least half the position after the rally has exceeded 20% to 25% is a smart portfolio management technique for your growth stocks.On the upside, Wynn Resorts (WYNN) is staging an eighth straight up-day, rising 1% to 112.93. That pushed the gaming resort operator's advance to 8% past a 104.49 buy point, in a choppy cup-with-handle base — so shares are extended. Wynn has large operations in Macau, the island territory of China where casino gambling is legalized.

Volume in the stock market today was about 18% higher on the NYSE and 4% higher on the Nasdaq, according to preliminary data.President Trump's speech Tuesday night initially had some stock analysts muttering over the lack of details on tax cuts, but the stock market itself was more generous. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 gapped up at the open and then kept climbing.The action of the market itself is a much better guide to the market than the opinions of analysts.Amid IBD's 197 industry groups, winners led losers by a 14-to-1 ratio.The winner's circle for the day included some heretofore middle of the pack groups.Homebuilders, for example, are demonstrating strength. Stocks hitting 52-week highs included Pulte Group (PHM), Toll Brothers (TOL), Lennar (LEN), KB Home (KBH), NVR (NVR) and MDC Holdings (MDC).Cement stocks, which also are middle of the pack, rebounded. Eagle Materials (EXP) popped almost 3%. The stock recently retook its 103.26 buy point and is still in the 5% buy zone. Vulcan Materials (VMC) gapped up 3.4% but couldn't retake its 50-day line. Vulcan could be working on a double-bottom pattern but it has work to do on the right side.The highly rated steel and steel alloy groups provided more predictable strength. Steel Dynamics (STLD) rose 3.5% as it builds the right side of a base. United States Steel (X) retook a 39.24 buy point. Both are third stage bases, which are more prone to fail than first- or second-stage breakouts.Among the steel alloys, Carpenter Technology (CRS) tried but failed to retake a 42.37 buy point. Carpenter's consolidation is first stage.Bank stocks appeared re-energized. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) gapped up to a 3.5% gain in brisk volume. The stock made a new high. Gains of 2% to 3% were common within the money-center group.The super regionals did even better. Gains were in the 3% to 4% neighborhood.

Volume on both main exchanges was tracking higher than Wednesday's levels, more so on the NYSE.JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) were top performers in the Dow, rising 4% and 2%, respectively. JPMorgan is extended, but Goldman is still in buy range from a 247.87 buy point.Advancing stocks outnumbered decliners on the Nasdaq by more than 3-to-1. The ratio was more than 2-to-1 on the NYSE. Nearly 30 names in the IBD 50 rose 2% or more. The IBD 50 is home to many financials, many of which rose 3% or more. Top gainers included Charles Schwab (SCHW), Citizens Financial (CFG), Comerica (CMA) and Home Bancshares (HOMB).Miners like Alcoa (AA) outperformed. Shares soared 9% as it gets support at the 10-week moving average for the first time, after a breakout over a 32.45 buy point.In the stock market today, Dow component McDonald's (MCD) rose 1.5% on news that it's expanding its delivery and mobile-ordering options. The stock is trying to clear a shallow, cup-shaped base with a 132.06 buy point.Earnings winners weren't easy to find in the growth-stock space, but Salesforce.com (CRM) was one. Share rose nearly 3% to 83.65 after a recent low-volume breakout over an 80.47 double-bottom buy point. The stock is still below its all-time high of 84.48.Veeva Systems (VEEV) reversed higher in a volatile session, rising 2.5% to 44.78. The provider of cloud software to the life sciences industry is working on a base with a 48.05 buy point. Late Tuesday, the company reported its fifth straight quarter of 30% or higher sales growth.The highly anticipated Snap IPO is expected to price tonight and start trading tomorrow.In economic news, the ISM manufacturing index accelerated for the sixth straight month, coming in at 57.7, a 30-month high. The hot reading came on the heels of several statements from Fed officials Tuesday that were more hawkish than dovish in tone. The odds for a rate hike at the March 14-15 meeting have risen substantially since the start of the week.Wednesday's strong showing for the stock market came as the Investors Intelligence survey of newsletter writers showed extreme bullishness again. The percentage of bulls came in at 63.1%, up from 61.2% in the prior week and the highest level since 1987. The survey is used as a contrarian indicator because excessive bullishness has been seen at or near market tops in the past.RELATED:Infrastructure Stocks Rise On Trump's $1 Trillion 'National Rebuilding' PlanCisco Partly To Blame For Palo Alto Networks' Pain?

98,CMA,"U.S. stock indexes chalked up losses in midday action Tuesday, as small caps and bank stocks led the way down.The small-cap Russell 2000 and tech-leaning Nasdaq dropped 0.9% and 0.4%, respectively. The S&P 500 and the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average held up better, each shaving off 0.2%. Volume in the stock market today was running sharply higher on both major exchanges.Small caps and bank stocks have been two hot areas in the postelection rally. However, they came in for some apparent profit-taking today. Meanwhile, some blue chips were holding up well.Home Depot (HD), a Dow Jones industrial average component, popped 1.27 to 136.31. The stock has shaped a saucer with handle with a potential buy point at 137.42. The pattern is first stage, which is more likely to work than later bases.Home Depot's fiscal year ends in January. The Street expects 2017 earnings to rise 18%, which represents an upward revision. Q4 results will be released Feb. 21.Procter & Gamble (PG), another Dow component, advanced 1.21 to 85.22 in brisk volume. The megacap retook its 50-day and 200-day lines. Procter & Gamble is working on a flat base but has some work to do on the right side of its pattern. The base is first stage.In the S&P 500, superregional bank Comerica (CMA) took the hardest hit, gapping down 3.83 to 66.09. Volume was heavy.

99,CMA,"Stocks fell at Tuesday's open and remained lower through the day as comments made in London and New York took a toll on the day's trade.The Nasdaq dropped 0.6%. The Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 slipped 0.3% apiece.  Small caps took harder hits than the overall market, leaving the Russell 2000 down 1.4%.U.S. traders took some cues from London, where stocks dropped hard after Prime Minister Theresa May announced Britain would seek to renegotiate its trade agreements outside the European Union's single-market trade protocol.  The statement of fortified independence sent the pound to its biggest gain since 2008, while London's FTSE 100 equity index shed 1.5%. The CAC 40 in Paris slid 0.5%, while Frankfurt's DAX kept to a 0.1% decline.In afternoon trade, 141 of IBD's 197 industry groups moved lower. Superregional banks fell furthest, trading lower after President-elect Donald Trump signaled opposition to a key piece of the GOP's tax strategy.Comerica (CMA) was hardest hit in the group, down 7%. The Dallas-based bank reported fourth-quarter earnings above analyst targets. The stock had been holding steady just below a Jan. 5 high, but dropped to test support at its 10-week moving average. Regions Financial (RF) and SVB Financial Group (SIVB) fell more than 5% each.IBD 50 stock Arista Networks (ANET) led the computer networking group to the day's second-worst loss among industries.  Shares fell 12% in huge trade after the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agency said it would reinstate an import ban on Arista switches pending further review. The tumble broke support at the stock's 10-week moving average in heavy trade and erased effectively all of its gain since clearing a flat base in November. Both moves are sell signals.Some of the day's strongest moves came from gold miners, as a pullback in the dollar helped boost gold prices more than 1%. A long list of miners — including Anglogold Ashanti (AU), Sibanye Gold (SBGL) and IamGold (IAG) — gained more than 2%.Noble Energy (NBL) topped the S&P 500, rallying 7% after agreeing to buy Clayton Williams Energy (CWEI) in a $2.7 billion deal. The deal gives Noble leases to 120,000 net acres in a key region of West Texas' prolific Permian Basin shale play, as well as a number of pipelines serving that region.  Noble is holding support in the fifth week of a flat consolidation. Clayton Williams shares spiked 40%, putting the stock just below its May 2014 high.After the close, investors have an eye on earnings reports due out from Netflix (NFLX) and chip equipment maker ASML  Holding (ASML).Also after the close, San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams is scheduled to speak at 6 p.m. ET.RELATED:Goldman, Citi, Retail Brokerages; Investing Action PlanBank Stock Losses Intensify After Trump Rips GOP Tax Plan

100,CMA,"Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS) — the latter of which topped Q4 forecasts Tuesday morning — and other banks fell after President-elect Donald Trump signaled opposition to a key piece of the GOP's tax strategy, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, threatening hopes for anticipated tax cuts.The slide comes as investors wait for more clarity on what Trump's plans might actually look like after they get batted around in Congress. Such policy details, Vining Sparks analyst Marty Mosby noted, might not begin to surface until the second half of the year.""You're getting more disconnect between what different Republicans want,"" he said.Lower bond yields also weighed Tuesday, and U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May's speech indicating a so-called ""hard Brexit"" to separate the country from the EU added to uncertainty over London's future as a banking hub.Even as Morgan Stanley solidly beat analyst expectations on the top and bottom line, the outlook for the industry has continued to overshadow its actual results.""These earnings are trivial in relation to the perception that's driving the stocks right now,"" Mosby said.Shares of Morgan Stanley closed down 3.8% to 42.15 on the stock market today. Goldman Sachs and Citigroup (C), which report Wednesday, were down 3.5% and 2.1%, respectively. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America, which reported earnings last week, fell 3.6% and 4.2%. Wells Fargo (WFC), which also reported last week and plans to more than double its branch closures this year, fell 2.8%.Bank stocks initially took off after the election on hopes the incoming administration and GOP-controlled Congress will cut regulations, grow the economy and create a higher-interest-rate environment. But the sector began to level off last month as the rise in bond yields have slowed.JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo shares are approaching their fast-rising 50-day lines for the first time in months, as the 10-year Treasury yield threatens to close below that key level. Superregional bank Comerica (CMA), which also reported better-than-expected earnings early Tuesday, tumbled 6.5% as it tested its 50-day line.Analysts have said the sector could fall more amid uncertainty over how new policy details shake out. The dollar has strengthened on expectations that a stronger economy could lead to higher interest rates, which help banks' finances.IBD'S TAKE: Banks are likely to close more branches as they try to cut costs and as more people manage their finances over their phones. Other forms of technology, like blockchain, could help the industry save billions.Morgan Stanley's Q4 earnings per share surged 88% to 81 cents, above estimates for 65 cents, while revenue rose 15% to $9.02 billion, beating forecasts for $8.47 billion.Revenue for the bank's institutional securities segment rose 35%, helped by strength in trading and M&A. Sales in the bank's important wealth management division rose 6%.However, equity underwriting revenue fell 36%, and compensation expenses rose 10%.""We reported solid results in Sales & Trading and Advisory, and record revenues in Wealth Management, while managing expenses prudently,"" CEO James Gorman said in the company's earnings release.

102,CMA,"Your personal finance plan in 2017 will be like baking a cake. All you'll need is the right recipe. Whether you're investing in stocks, bonds, ETFs or mutual funds in a 401(k) retirement account, now's the time to check to make sure you have the right ingredients at hand.For Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors, the recipe involves six ingredients: overweight U.S. stocks in general; underweight 10-year Treasury bonds; and overweight financial services stocks, U.S. small-cap stocks, energy stocks and industrial companies' stocks.Orlando's colleague, Steve Chiavarone, associate manager of $414 million Federated Global Allocation Fund (FSTBX), cites holdings which illustrate that recipe. Among them, Apple (AAPL) could see higher profits if corporate taxes are lowered as President-elect Trump wants. It could also boost stock dividends or buybacks and spend more to develop new products with repatriated cash under Trump's tax proposal. ""Still, Trump has issues with parts of the tech industry, so Apple's may be a more mixed picture,"" Chiavarone said.In addition, a more lenient regulatory environment for banks would convert JPMorgan (JPM) from a something akin to a regulated utility back into a growth stock, Chiavarone says. Oilfield services giant Halliburton (HAL) should get more mileage out of its run, fueled by rising energy prices, he adds. And construction aggregates producer Martin Marietta (MLM) is poised to benefit from a boom in infrastructure projects.IBD'S TAKE: Martin Marietta is No. 2 in IBD's Building-Cement/Concrete-Aggregates industry group. To see how the company's growth metrics — like its strong 83 IBD Composite Rating and very strong 96 EPS (earnings per share) Rating stack up against its rivals, visit IBD Stock Checkup.To Orlando and Chiavarone, the 2017 recipe aims to take advantage of several macroeconomic forces now in play.In financials, $1.2 billion Third Avenue Value (TAVFX) lead manager Chip Rewey says U.S. regional banks are likely to benefit from rate hikes and scaled-back regulation. Their valuations are also relatively low ""since people have shunned them since the financial crisis.""Banks he likes include top holdings Bank of New York Mellon (BK), Comerica (CMA), PNC Financial (PNC) and Keycorp (KEY). All have strong Composite Ratings from IBD in the 80s or 90s.Among other stocks, he said home-builder ""Lennar (LEN) is a new position for Value Fund because housing should do well."" Its balance sheet is improving, it is reducing debt and it is trimming its land bank.He also recently bought shares in Johnson Controls (JCI). Some investors still think of it as a maker of automotive seating, a field it has exited. ""Its hidden gem is its car batteries,"" Rewey said. ""They are a leader in lead acid batteries and in start-stop batteries. And they, not Tesla (TSLA), are the leader in lithium ion car batteries.""In addition, Rewey likes biotech Amgen (AMGN), a relative newcomer to the portfolio, largely ""because the market is ignoring its strong pipeline.""And true to his value orientation, Rewey likes apparel company Ralph Lauren (RL). Earnings per share growth has declined eight straight quarters. The stock's Comp Rating is a dismal 7. ""But Rewey likes CEO Stefan Larsson's turnaround credentials. ""We think it's a great opportunity,"" Rewey said.Lee DeLorenzo, president of United Asset Strategies in Garden City, N.Y., says workers should try to take advantage of the same apparent forces in their 401(k) accounts. At the same time, they should cut their interest-rate risk by shifting 5% to 10% of their weighting in traditional bond funds to stable value funds or flexible, go-anywhere bond funds.She advises increasing exposure to small- and midcap stocks and stock funds. Plan members who can stomach risk, she says, should boost their weightings in financials and energy.Rich Weiss, a senior portfolio manager on a team that oversees 20 American Century target-date, target-risk and asset-allocation funds, says 401(k) plan members should also look at whether the year-end spurt in stock prices threw their target asset allocations out of whack. Does your mix of stocks, large and small, U.S. and foreign, specific geographies and selected sectors, still jibe with your overall financial plan? Your risk tolerance? Your financial goals?If something has grown too big, take profits to rebalance. Keep the proceeds inside your account to avoid an early withdrawal.Plan members who'd rather not make their own investment decisions should leave the heavy lifting to target-date and target-risk funds within their accounts, he says. If you do want to forge your own investment decisions, you can look for ideas at the asset allocations of target date and target risk portfolios that match your situation. ""But doing that may be more expensive and complex than simply purchasing an appropriate target-date fund,"" Weiss added.If your 401(k) does not offer target-date or target-risk funds? Consider investing that same money instead in such a fund inside an IRA, where your investment choices are almost unlimited.In addition, Weiss says, if your 401(k) offers a Roth option, use it if you are young and if your tax bracket will stay the same or rise after you retire. Meanwhile, contributions are not tax deductible. But earnings grow tax-deferred. And withdrawals normally will be tax-free, unlike withdrawals from a regular 401(k) or IRA.Suppose you share the Orlando-Chiavarone vision of what 2017 is to bring. How do you act on it?One approach would be to boost the assets, sectors and geographies that they expect to thrive by 10% in your portfolio. Trim from assets like long Treasuries and emerging-markets stocks. You can tweak those numbers up or down, depending on factors such as your time horizon, risk tolerance, long-term goals and any near-term need for cash.If you're an aggressive investor in your 30s, for instance, you might want to boost your U.S. small caps by 11% or 12%.In any case, first form your 2017 financial action plan, either with your financial advisor or on your own. Then look for securities that can bring that plan to life. It's not all that hard. In fact, reflecting holiday cheer, DeLorenzo said, ""The execution of these changes is as easy as baking a cake.""RELATED:2017 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2016 Stock Market ReviewHot Stocks That Made Craig Hodges A Top 2016 Mutual Fund ManagerWhere Mutual Fund Pros See Big Stock Gains In 2017Here's How To Decide Which Retirement Accounts To Fund First

103,CMA,"Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena will probably fail to lure sufficient demand for a 5 billion-euro ($5.2 billion) capital raise, said people with knowledge of the matter, making a state rescue likely.Liquidity has been drying up, the bank said in a filing Wednesday amid mounting concern about the lender's viability. Shares in the troubled lender fell 12 percent to 16.30 euros in Milan. The stock has declined 87 percent this year, trimming the bank's market value to about 478 million euros.The bank's board is meeting in Siena on Wednesday to review the latest numbers on investor orders. Qatar's sovereign-wealth fund, which had considered an investment, hasn't yet committed to buying shares, while a second debt-for-equity swap has raised about 500 million euros through Tuesday, before today's expiry of the offer, people with knowledge of the matter have said.Other institutions that were considering buying shares have indicated that they would put funds in the troubled bank only if it's able to raise 2 billion euros from the swap and 1 billion euros from cornerstone investors, according to the people.""So far reports about Monte Paschi's efforts to find private capital are quite discouraging -- it seems as if a government intervention comes closer by the day,"" Par Magnusson, a strategist at Swedbank, wrote in a report Wednesday. A government intervention ""will punish equity and junior bond holders, and that is a major concern in itself.""In a supplement to the offer information document, the bank said its liquidity, which stood at 10.6 billion euros as of Dec. 16, may run out more quickly than previously expected. Commenting on risks under rules defined by the Bank of Italy, Paschi said it may run out of liquidity after four months, rather than 11 months forecast in last week's supplement.The lender's subordinated bond risk rose to a record. Its 500 million euros of junior notes due in March 2019 fell 6 cents on the euro to an all-time low of 44 cents, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Credit swaps insuring the bank's junior bonds for five years now imply a 70 percent chance of default, data compiled by CMA show.The Italian government late Monday moved closer to a potential rescue of lenders, including Monte Paschi, by seeking permission from parliament to increase the nation's public debt by as much as 20 billion euros. The plan is aimed at providing a backstop to the banking system ""through public guarantees in order to restore their short- and medium-term lending ability,"" Finance Minister Pier Carlo Padoan said following a cabinet meeting Monday night.Monte Paschi's plan to raise 5 billion euros has three interlocking pieces: a debt-for-equity swap, a stock offering and the disposal of soured loans. The capital being raised would be used to cover the bank for losses it would book in selling the bad debt. If the sale fails, the conversions of debt to equity would be nullified.Monte Paschi expanded and extended its debt-for-equity swap last week. In the previous offer, bondholders had already agreed to exchange about 1.02 billion euros for shares.If government funds are used in the bank's recapitalization, its bondholders will probably have to take losses under European burden-sharing rules. The cabinet is considering a so-called precautionary recapitalization that may reduce the potential losses. A meeting is scheduled Friday to determine the details, a government official said.Here is a summary of other Italian lenders facing pressure to shore up their finances and get rid of soured debt on their books.Banca Carige: The European Central Bank instructed the Genoa-based lender to step up efforts to reduce sour debt on its balance sheet, giving it until Feb. 28 to present a more aggressive proposal. The existing plan calls for cutting the total to 19.9 percent by 2020 from 27.8 percent in 2015. The bank, which is struggling to restore investor confidence after revising its 2012 and first-half 2013 accounts, posted a loss in the third quarter on falling revenue and higher provisions for bad loans.Banca Popolare di Vicenza/Veneto Banca: The rescued Italian lenders in merger talks may need as much as 2.5 billion euros of fresh capital to fulfill requests from the ECB, people with knowledge of the matter have said. The ECB said the pair should reduce bad loans by as much as 4 billion euros, increase liquidity buffers and make additional provisions for ongoing litigation, the people said. Atlante, the state-orchestrated fund which took over the banks earlier this year, on Wednesday said it will invest 938 million euros in further stock sales by the banks.Four ""Good Banks"" : The four small domestic lenders rescued from collapse last year must be sold to comply with European regulators' requests. Executives obtained an extension of June's deadline as they struggle to reach a deal. Unione di Banche Italiane is in talks to buy three of the four regional banks. The Bank of Italy may seek additional contributions from lenders to bolster the country's resolution fund if the sale doesn't generate enough cash to repay creditors, people with knowledge of the matter have said.

104,CMA,"Drugmaker Actavis faces fines for raising the cost of hydrocortisone tablets by more than 12,000%, British antitrust regulators said Friday as they continued a crackdown on excessive pricing in the pharmaceutical industry.The division of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) ""broke competition law by charging excessive and unfair prices in the U.K.,"" the Competition and Markets Authority said in a statement. In one example, The company raised the price of the 10 milligram packs from roughly 88 cents to $110 in U.S. currency. Teva, which acquired Actavis for $40.5 billion from Allergan (AGN) earlier this year, said it will ""defend the allegations.""""This is a lifesaving drug relied on by thousands of patients, which the (U.K.'s National Health Service, or NHS) has no choice but to continue purchasing,"" said Andrew Groves, CMA senior responsible officer. ""We allege that the company has taken advantage of this situation and the removal of the drug from price regulation, leaving the NHS — and ultimately the taxpayer — footing the bill for the substantial price rises.""The CMA sent Actavis a statement of objections laying out its concerns amid a wider crackdown on unfair drug pricing. On Dec. 7, the CMA fined Pfizer (PFE) and Flynn Pharma a record amount for abusing their dominant position by charging unfair prices for unbranded versions of the Epanutin anti-epilepsy drug.The regulator fined Pfizer roughly $105.2 million and Flynn Pharma $6.5 million after they increased prices by as much as 2,600% in September 2012. The price increases occurred after Pfizer transferred distribution rights to Flynn, which sold the medicine by its generic name, phenytoin sodium.Teva, which is already in the process of selling Actavis's U.K. operations to Intas Pharmaceuticals Ltd., said the CMA probe raises broader questions about the regulation of generic medications.Although the pricing of the Actavis product ""under investigation was never under Teva's effective control, Teva believes that intervention by the CMA in prices for generic medicines raises serious policy concerns regarding the roles of both the CMA and the Department of Health,"" Teva said. ""Generic medicines continue to be an affordable alternative to branded therapies.""A statement of objections can often lead to fines or orders to change business practices. The regulator has the power to fine companies found to have abused a dominant market position up to 10% of their annual revenue.Hydrocortisone tablets are used as the primary replacement therapy for people whose adrenal glands do not produce sufficient amounts of natural steroid hormones, resulting in conditions such as Addison's disease. The tablets are also used to treat conditions such as arthritis, blood, hormone and immune system disorders, skin and eye conditions, breathing problems, cancer, and severe allergies.Actavis also increased the price of 20 milligram hydrocortisone tablets by nearly 9,500%, resulting in charges to the NHS of $128.32 per pack by March 2016, the CMA said. The NHS had previously paid the equivalent of $1.34 per pack.Before April 2008, the NHS spent about 522,000 pounds a year on hydrocortisone tablets. By 2015, NHS spend on the tablets had risen to $87.4 million a year.Steep price hikes have put a string of drugmakers under the microscope in the U.S. with companies like Mylan (MYL) and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX). bearing the brunt of the public outrage. President-elect Donald Trump, who had been cited as a boon to free-market health care, also declared himself an opponent of high drug prices in an interview with Time magazine.

106,CMA,"Stocks held on to mild gains with an hour remaining in Wednesday's relatively mild trading session ahead of tonight's final presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Banks, e-commerce, energy and commodity plays led the upside.Meanwhile, Tesla Motors (TSLA) posted its biggest gain in two weeks, rolling 3% higher to 204.17 in fast turnover. CEO Elon Musk tweeted followers that a news conference would take place at 5 p.m. Pacific Time. Company observers are speculating a new product unveiling, such as an electric motorcycle, a new Roadster, or a new version of the upcoming Model 3 entry-level sedan.IBD'S TAKE: Tesla Motors is still consolidating and trading well below its 52-week highs. So a potential breakout is still potentially weeks away. To find leading stocks that are clearing proper buy points and making money for investors right now, view the IBD 50 list of elite fast-growing companies.The S&P 500 rose 0.3%, holding near its session highs. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 0.4% while the Russell 2000 outperformed, up nearly 0.6%.The Nasdaq composite was 0.1% higher, hurt by a sharp 6% drop in Intel (INTC) shares following Q3 results late Wednesday. Watch to see if Intel can rebound back to and eventually above its rising 50-day moving average.Banking shares continued to gain steam.In the super regional bank industry group, Comerica (CMA) rallied more than 3% to 51.79. Volume was running double its usual level. The Dallas-based bank is rising sharply after posting a 24% jump in third-quarter profit to 92 cents a share, the biggest EPS increase in seven quarters. Revenue climbed 6% vs. year-ago levels for the second straight quarter.Comerica has now rallied nearly 11% past a 46.71 buy point in a 12-week cup with handle. The buy point comes from adding 10 cents to the intraday high of the Aug. 8 session, when the stock began forming the tight handle in mostly thin trade. The handle provides the last shakeout of uncommitted shareholders, cleaning the decks for a potential breakout to new highs when strong institutional demand for shares arrives.Comerica's group peer Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) also rose more than 3%, jumping off its rising 50-day moving average in heavy trading to 20.63. The stock had cleared a 20.37 handle buy point on a nine-month cup base on Sept. 14 and rose mildly before retreating below that price level. Now the stock is trying a second breakout and is in buy range.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) added 1% to 68.42, standing just outside the 5% permissible buy range from a recent cup-with-handle breakout at 65.08.Elsewhere in the stock market today, online e-commerce firms held firm. Alibaba (BABA) rose for a third session in a row, up 0.8% to 104.19. The stock is still in buy range after a first test of the 50-day moving average near 100. The first and second rebounds off the 50-day or 10-week line offer a chance for investors to buy shares correctly.Alibaba is now up 22% from an 85.10 entry on a long cup-with-handle base that it cleared on Aug. 9, initially in light volume. But then volume surged the next few days as the breakout took hold.GrubHub (GRUB) slipped 0.2% to 42.15, yet is holding above its 50-day moving average. The online restaurant food pick-up and delivery ordering service triggered a buy signal near 40.50 on Oct. 13 as shares rebounded sharply back above the 50-day line in heavy volume.GrubHub, an IBD Leaderboard stock, has notched one quarter of accelerating EPS growth as earnings grew 11% in the first quarter of this year, then 35% in Q2.Wall Street expects Q3 profit growth to speed up even more, up 46% to 19 cents a share.Over the past four quarters, GrubHub's sales have risen 38%, 36%, 27% and 37%. The stock scores a top-notch A SMR (Sales + Margins + Return on equity) from IBD Stock Checkup.In economic news, the Federal Reserve's latest beige book survey of regional economies across the country was released at 2 p.m. ET. In the summary, the Fed noted most districts indicated a ""modest or moderate pace of expansion"" during the reporting period from late August to early October. The pace of growth improved in the St. Louis, Kansas City and Dallas districts.RELATED:What Will Tesla Motors Unveil Wednesday Evening?What Kind Of Base Did Goldman Sachs Form?What To Do When Volume On The Breakout Is Initially LightWhen Did JPMorgan Chase Shares Break Out?

107,CMA,"Banks retreated Thursday, testing buy points as Treasury yields fell ahead of earnings from Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) out Friday.Treasury yields were down Thursday after a weaker-than-expected trade report out of China sent investors toward government bonds and other safe assets. Investors have bid financials in recent weeks on the prospect of Federal Reserve rate hikes and the recent rise of long-term yields around the world. JPMorgan fell 0.6% to 67.74 on the stock market today after dropping as low as 66.82, just above the 50-day line. The stock is still in range from a buy point of 65.08, cleared in early August.JPMorgan is expected to report a 17% drop in third-quarter earnings but revenue is seen rising 2% to $23.988 billion when it announces quarterly results Friday.Citigroup shares dipped 0.5% to 48.47 after sinking intraday to 47.54, below a recent 48.24 buy point. Analysts see Citi's Q3 EPS falling 15% on Friday to $1.15, with revenue down 6% to $17.344 billion. Wells Fargo shares slid 1.3% to 44.75 well below its 50-day and 200-day lines. The bank has its own issues after a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau review found employees may have opened more than 2 million accounts and credit cards without consumers' permission. Late Wednesday, Wells said CEO John Stumpf stepped down, effective immediately, replaced by President and COO Tim Sloan.Bank of America (BAC) is slated to report results Monday, Goldman Sachs (GS) Tuesday, and Morgan Stanley (MS) on Wednesday. BofA shares fell 1.25%, continuing a recent slide after peeking into buy range on Monday. Goldman lost 1.1% and Morgan Stanley 0.6%.IBD'S TAKE: U.K.'s Brexit, bad loans at Italian banks and legal troubles from Germany's Deutsche Bank have opened the European market to U.S. banks. Regional banks, more directly dependent of lending than global Wall Street banks, were also under pressure Thursday.Comerica (CMA) shares fell 1.4% to 47.91, still in buy range, with a 46.40 buy point, out of a cup with handle base but falling toward its 50-day line.SunTrust Banks (STI) shares tumbled 2.1% to 44.76 falling toward its 50-day line but still in buy range, above its buy point of 44.42, after consolidating out of a flat base.Regions Financial (RF) stock fell 2.8% to 9.95, finding support at its 50-day line and off session lows of 9.78, but below its buy point of 10.10.RELATED:Bank Of America Gains Share Globally, Vows Blockchain Embrace
"
108,CMA,"Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) have broken out this week on growing Federal Reserve rate-hike speculation and relief over Deutsche Bank (DB).After AFP reported that Deutsche Bank could settle a mortgage-securities case for far less than the Justice Department asked for, potentially warding off a bigger shock to the global banking industry, Bank of America and Citigroup on Friday bounced off their 50-day lines. Meanwhile, Fed officials' comments and recent economic data have reinforced expectations for central bank tightening by the end of the year.Banks and bank stocks should do well if the Fed raises rates because it allow them to increase the spread between its lending rates and borrowing costs. Banks' net interest margins have been squeezed in recent years.JPMorgan Chase (JPM), meanwhile, also rebounded off its 50-day. JPMorgan broke out in early August from a handle in a consolidation and remains within range of the 66.58 buy point. JPMorgan rose 1.6% to 67.69 Wednesday.Citigroup climbed 1.9% to 48.65 in the stock market today, hitting its best levels since early January. Citigroup cleared a 48.28 buy point in an 11-month consolidation.Bank of America advanced 2.% to 16.11. BofA is 4.9% above its 50-day line, still within the chase zone. Ideally, for a stock to be within buy range, it should be no more than 5% above the 50-day line.Wells Fargo rose 2.8%, but from a two-and-a-half-year low. Wells Fargo is still reeling from the cross-selling scandal.IBD'S TAKE: The Banks-Money Center industry group, which includes the big banks, moves in tandem with the Federal Reserve's announcements on interest rates. To learn more about top industry groups and taking profits quickly rapid changes in the market, see this story about Swing Trading strategies. Meanwhile, some super-regional banks also have broken out. SunTrust Banks (STI) broke past a 44.71 buy point of a consolidation pattern begun in late May on Tuesday. On Wednesday, SunTrust rose 2.2% to 45.73, still in range. SunTrust had found resistance several times just above 44 in recent months.Meanwhile, Comerica (CMA) rose 2.8% to 49.21 Wednesday, extended from buy range but still performing solidly.Wednesday's bank stock gains come as ADP reported that companies added 154,000 jobs in September, short of estimates for 170,000 but still solid. Meanwhile, the ISM nonmanufacturing index shot up to an 11-month high last month. On Monday, ISM's manufacturing index signaled a return to factory expansion.RELATED:New High Analysis: Session Yields Slew Of Financial BreakoutsU.S. Banking Giants Gain As Deutsche Bank, European Financials TeeterBank Of America Gains Share Globally, Vows Blockchain EmbraceJPMorgan, Goldman, Citi Waver As Rates To Stay Lower For Longer

109,CMA,"Dancing to the Federal Reserve's familiar rate-hike-is-coming tune in August, the major stock market indexes did little more than tread water near multiyear if not all-time highs.A pullback by defensive sectors largely offset an advance by cyclical sectors as the S&P 500 inched up 0.14%. U.S. diversified stock mutual funds edged ahead 0.48%, according to Lipper Inc.General domestic taxable bond funds rose 0.74% to be up 8.53% for the year.At an economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo., in late August, Fed Chair Janet Yellen and other Fed officials said the economy is strong enough for a rate hike.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month Leaders""The fact that the market saw an opportunity for a rate increase at the Sept. 21 (Fed) meeting was an indication that the U.S. economy was actually moving in the right direction,"" said Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer, equities at Charles Schwab Investment Management. ""So the market reacted to that.""Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category PerformanceThat reaction took the form of a rotation out of high-dividend stocks and stable sectors into more economically cyclical sectors, Aguilar said. Investors pulled money out of utilities, consumer staples and telecom, he added. They shifted much of it into technology, health care, consumer discretionary and financials.Sector funds reflected some of that. Financial services funds gained 4.25% last month on average. Tech funds gained 2.33%. Health/biotech and consumer-goods funds lost ground.The mood shifted again early this month when the Bureau of Labor Statistics revised the count of its July jobs gains upward to 275,000, but reported August jobs gains of only 151,000. That was less than the 180,000 jobs forecast by economists polled by Reuters. The relatively weak employment growth increased the odds that the Fed would delay its rate hike until November or even December, and the stock market rallied modestly and rotated back toward dividend stocks.""There isn't a lot of market leadership now,"" Aguilar said last week. ""Bottom line: We're going to have to wait until the Fed's September meeting to know what comes next.""IBD's TAKE: How will investors react once the Fed finally hikes rates? Understanding the stock market's prevailing trend is a key factor when you are choosing between growth and defensive stock buys. For pointers, visit IBD University.Chip Rewey, lead manager of Third Avenue's $1.2 billion Value (TVFVX) and $317 million Small Cap Value (TVSVX) funds, said ""the market is confused by the Fed, the way Charlie Brown is confused by Lucy.""Rewey added that whenever the Fed does raise rates, sustained, aggressive hikes are unlikely. ""Still, why allocate (money) to yield-oriented sectors when you see a raise coming off generational low rates?"" he asked.Instead, Rewey has added to stocks that should not be hurt by a hike. He recently increased his stake in Johnson Controls (JCI), which makes building-efficiency systems and just completed its combination with Tyco, which makes fire and security systems.""We like the merger with Tyco,"" Rewey said. ""There's a lot of misunderstanding about what type of company Johnson is. Many people still think of it as an auto company (because of its history as a maker of car seats and interiors). But the majority post-Tyco merger is a building services company.""Rewey also added to Amgen (AMGN), which has a dividend yield of 2.3%. ""We saw it as a leading pharmaceuticals (company) that had been caught in the generic fears about (drugmakers because of political calls for intervention over pricing).""Rewey bought shares under 150. They're now trading near 170. ""At that price, we're getting its pipeline for free,"" he said. The company has 31 potential treatments in preclinical and clinical targets development, including 12 in phase three tests, which are closer to market. Another nine biosimilars are in development, including three in later stages, nearing the point where they might go on sale.Rewey also likes Comerica (CMA), a bank with most of its operations in Michigan, Texas, California, Arizona and Florida. ""It's trading around 1.1 times tangible book value,"" he said. ""We think it's undervalued. They're cutting costs. If rates and loan growth go up, their return on equity will go up.""And Rewey likes media giant CBS (CBS), which is controlled by Sumner Redstone through National Amusements, which also controls Viacom (VIA). Some family members and company executives have been jockeying for power over the company once Redstone ceases to exercise control.""Investor overreaction to the noise over Viacom has weighed on the value of CBS stock,"" Rewey said. ""They are taking an advertising driven model and taking it to more fee-driven (which should generate revenue and earnings that are more visible and stable). They should be almost 60% fee-driven by 2018 once they spin out their radio business. And they're in a stock buyback program. And we like the management team, led by Les Moonves.""James Abate, chief investment officer of Centre Funds and manager of its $156 million Select Equity (DHAMX), says it's possible the Fed won't raise rates in the wake of disappointing recent economic data.In this environment, he likes consumer staples names PepsiCo (PEP) and Kimberly Clark (KMB) for their aggressive cost cutting. He likes the outlook for Coach (COH), whose rising sales per employee show that its restructuring is on track, he says. And he likes Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN), whose innovations provide them with a competitive moat.RELATED:The August Jobs Report Was The Weakest Since 2010As Companies Step Up Wage Hikes, Tax Receipts Get A LiftMutual Fund Strategists Like U.S. Stocks, Led By Tech, Health Care In A Sluggish Market

110,CMA,"Even as the Federal Reserve signals that tougher standards lie ahead for its annual stress tests, banks like JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), Bank of America (BAC) and others could still get more generous with their payouts as the tests become more routine, analysts suggest.After the Fed approved 31 of 33 bank capital plans late Wednesday, JPMorgan announced a $10.6 billion buyback, Bank of America OK'd a $5 billion repurchase and a 50% payout increase, and Citigroup unveiled a $8.6 billion buyback and more than tripled its dividend. Morgan Stanley (MS) hiked its dividend 33% and announced a $3.5 billion buyback.The results ""highlight the capital strength that enabled the sector to broadly increase payout requests,"" Fitch Ratings said in a statement Thursday, later adding that banks are ""becoming increasingly comfortable with the annual process.""As massive as the shareholder returns unveiled Wednesday were, there appears to be room for more among giants like JPMorgan, Citigroup and Bank of America, based on the ratio of dividends and buybacks vs. earnings expected over the next year.Comerica (CMA) and M&T Bank (MTB) lead banks with net payout ratios of 119% each, followed by Morgan Stanley at 105%, according to Credit Suisse. Meanwhile, JPMorgan's is 73%, while the ratio for both Goldman Sachs (GS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) is 65%, Citigroup's is 63%, and Bank of America's is 49%.Shares of Morgan Stanley climbed 3% on the stock market today. JPMorgan added 1.5%. Bank of America and Citigroup rose 0.6%. Goldman Sachs climbed 2.1%.Even before the stress test results came out, analysts have been expecting the banks to get more aggressive with shareholder returns after finally emerging from the aftereffects of the financial crisis.A CLSA note this month said JPMorgan, Citigroup, Bank of America and Wells Fargo are likely to hand out a bigger chunk of profits over the next four years, meaning greater gains for investors who stuck with them through lean times.Portales Partners this month said it expects banks ""to get more creative in their capital return requests, as the companies are becoming more familiar with the process"" of submitting capital plans for the stress tests, as well as resubmitting them if the Fed has any concerns with risk assessment or whether banks' dividend and buyback plans could overburden their finances if the economy falters.But even as banks push the envelope on capital returns and become more accustomed to the yearly drill of visualizing their state of affairs in an economic crisis, the Fed has warned of potentially stricter capital requirements in future tests.""The Fed noted that, despite general progress, banks still need to improve internal controls around various elements of capital planning,"" Fitch said.
"
111,CMA,"Big banks JPMorgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) got through the second and final round of the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests unscathed, resulting in a shareholder-returns bonanza shortly after the test results were announced late Wednesday.But Morgan Stanley's (MS) capital plan only got conditional approval, and U.S. segments of Deutsche Bank (DB) and Santander (SAN) failed once againStill, Morgan Stanley said it will move forward with a 33% quarterly dividend hike to 20 cents and a $3.5 billion buyback. JPMorgan OK'd a $10.6 billion buyback but kept its dividend the same. Bank of America announced a $5 billion repurchase program and a 50% payout increase to 7.5 cents. Citigroup will buy back $8.6 billion in stock and raised its payout to 16 cents from 5 cents.Goldman Sachs (GS) didn't give specifics but said its plan included buybacks and a dividend hike. Wells Fargo (WFC)  kept its capital plans unchanged.Morgan Stanley stock were little changed in pre-market trading on the stock market today after rising late Wednesday JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup climbed 2.4%, Wells Fargo rose and Goldman Sachs all rose fractionally. Deutsche Bank, which the IMF said ""poses the greatest risk to the global financial system,"" sank nearly 4% while Santander fell 2%.Other banks also announced bigger returns to shareholders.The Fed only gave conditional approval to Morgan Stanley's capital plan, in which it projected how it would perform under difficult economic conditions for this year's stress tests. As a result, Morgan must resubmit its capital plan and address broader concerns from the Fed by Dec. 29. If Morgan can't deliver on those promises, the Fed said, its governors ""would expect to object"" to the resubmitted plan, potentially hindering Morgan's shareholder returns.While the Fed did not technically object to Morgan Stanley's capital plan, the central bank said the company ""exhibited material weaknesses in its capital planning process,"" including in governance, modeling and other safeguards.""These weaknesses warrant further near-term attention but do not undermine the quantitative results of the stress tests for the firm,"" the Fed said, referring to the portion of the tests that quantifies what banks' capital levels would look like under financial turmoil.The Fed said Deutsche Bank and Santander, both of which also had their plans rejected last year, had tightened up some aspects of their capital planning methodology but still struggled with ""material unresolved supervisory issues that critically undermine (the) capital planning process.""The results follow a pattern of stress-test one-upmanship between the banks, which have been shoring up capital since the financial crisis, and the Fed, which has tried harder each year to catch the banks off-guard in the scenarios posed in the tests.While the banks that passed can move forward with their dividend and buyback hikes, tougher standards on the horizon could keep payouts restrained this year. Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo warned this month that banks in future tests might have to make a ""significant increase"" in the assets they set aside to cushion against a potential economic crisis.The final round of results from the stress tests -- known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or CCAR -- came after all 33 tested banks last week passed the first round of the evaluation, which quantifies how banks' finances would be affected against a barrage of market shocks.The Fed outlined the economic scenarios for both tests at the beginning of the year. In the weeks that followed, the banks submitted their capital plans, which this year forecast how they would do amid 10% unemployment, negative interest rates on short-term U.S. Treasuries -- among the conditions in the Fed's worst-case scenario.The first round of test results can serve as a preview of sorts to the second, in which the Fed actually indicates whether it accepted, rejected or had any reservations with the banks' capital plans. If it does have an issue, banks could have to temper plans to issue buybacks and boost dividends in order to pass.The second round of tests contains both a quantitative element and qualitative element. The quantitative element measures banks post-stress-test capital levels and whether they could sustain any new dividend and buyback plans. The qualitative element evaluates the soundness of the banks' capital plans and how they were developed.Analysts largely had not anticipated major problems with the banks' stress-test results.

112,CMA,"Stocks came under selling pressure early yesterday morning as expected, but then did a complete 180 degree turn around closing mostly higher with the Dow up triple digits, piercing the psychologically important 18k level while the S&P surged 13 pts ending the day right on the highs as the rally that people love to hate moves on. Pressure on oil prices worked against stocks in the first moments of trading but investors/traders and the big banks ended up ignoring the news out of Doha in a move that surprised many.Mkts around the world are all celebrating today...taking their cue from the turnaround in US equities....US futures are rocketing higher - currently up 11 pts as we kiss the psychological 2100 level.....but as my friend Scott Redler (@RedDogT3) tells me on twitter this morning""The first kiss us usually meets some opposition, then the romance gets you around the bases"" - to which I say - Yes, but it is the first kiss that is the sweetest which makes you want to go back for more.....and more is what it looks like we are gonna get today.....Remember - the mkt is a discounting mechanism....it is looking 4 - 6 months out....the trading today is not about today.....(Just sayin.....) - it is really about what the mkts expect in the fall......and by the looks of it - the mkt is expecting great things...Asian mkts were all higher overnight - Japan which got clobbered on Monday - snapped back and regained 100% of Monday's losses.....as we saw the Yen weaken a bit....a stabilizing oil mkt is also helping to support mkts today....After yesterday's mkt action - it appears that investors are disconnecting from the whims of the oil mkt....at least for now and concentrating on earnings.....European mkts are also enjoying an explosive rally....because why? Earnings and oil......and the sense is that maybe - the whole Mid-East OPEC summit was all hype.....to confuse the conversation.....interesting that the possibility of increased production has caused oil to stabilize and rally a bit from the Monday lows.....Does it feel like something else is going on? FTSE +0.56%, CAC 40 + 1.21%, DAX + 2.22%, EUROSTOXX +1.58%, SPAIN +0.88% and ITALY + 0.57%.Now just a thought or two about yesterday.....and the role that the Deputy Crown Prince is now playing......Look the big story was OIL and POLITICS – Mid East politics – and after two months of all the hype about this pending agreement in a production freeze – traders and the mkts had to deal with the fact that there was no deal – which now sets up the oil mkt for a possible 'free for all'….Keep your eyes on Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman – for he is now the name to know – for it was this 30 yr old son of King Salman who has now turned over the apple cart and merged the commercial considerations of the kingdom with his political stance – a move that is in complete contrast to what was existing policy.......You see for the past 20 yrs – Ali Al-Naimi – the current Saudi oil minister has kept those two issues on separate pages – keeping supply and pricing as the main drivers of any production decisions, always cooperating with the other members – including Iran – no matter what their politics were – in the past to cut production to boost oil prices. The Deputy Crown Prince is not sure he agrees with this policy and so while all the talk has been about how the Saudi's were cooperating with Russia, Venezuela and Qatar – Iran was still the thorn in Prince Mohammed's side….so in a bid to establish himself as an emerging 'force' - as the potential heir to the throne - he nixed the oil deal sending oil mkts into a tailspin on Sunday night/Monday.What is important to understand is that the deputy Crown Prince has now burst onto the global stage since his father became King last year and appears to have every intention of letting the world know. He was appointed the Defense Minister – and is the one responsible for launching the latest military campaign in Yemen while also chairing the country's 'economic planning body' and the council that controls the massive 'state owned' oil company. In a telling interview last week with Bloomberg – the Prince was very clear –""We don't care about oil prices, $30 or $70, they are the same to us. We have our own programs that don't need high oil prices.""This is not how the rest of the OPEC and non OPEC members feel at all – so by nixing any deal he has protected the Saudi's mkt share, and has secured their role as a 'leader' while at the same time laying the groundwork for continued political instability in the region.OK - back to the mkts.....After the initial concerns over these recent developments – the focus returned to US earnings…the day started off with better numbers from Pepsico (PEP), Hasbro (HAS), JB Hunt (JBHT) and in a another surprise move – we learned that Morgan Stanley (MS) – while reporting horrible numbers did in fact ""beat all the estimates."" Net Income FELL 54%, Equity trading revenues FELL 34%, Fixed Income trading revenues FELL 52% and Investment Banking Revenues FELL 15% - but yet they somehow managed to beat the 'much lower' EPS expectation….so all this means is that we must watch out for Goldman Sachs (GS) report this morning.....Analysts expect EPS of $2.48......Now remember – Uncle Lloyd pre-announced this 're-structuring' plan late on Friday – so investors/traders have been prepped about all the bad news and how he has dealt with it head on…. – and like Cousin Jamie (Dimon) of JP Morgan (JPM)– Uncle Lloyd knows how to 'massage' the street analysts – so what I expect to hear this morning is a 'BLOW YOUR SOCKS OFF EPS' beat to rival even the most generous estimate….and the clock ticks towards 7:30 am......In other news - United Health (UNH) just reported a better number - $1.81 vs. exp of $1.72, Philip Morris (PM) on the other hand missed - $0.98 vs. exp of $1.10.....

114,CMA,"Banking giants such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Wells Fargo (WFC) are expected to report poor earnings this week as market turmoil hits investment banking and trading. But investors may pay more attention to banks' massive loans to now-embattled energy companies.Even though oil prices have rebounded from early 2016 lows, cash-flow woes persist for many shale companies that bet big when crude was trading at $100 a barrel. JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and several other banks already have set aside more funds for potential energy-loan losses. A key question is how much they will raise loan loss provisions now.Fitch Ratings, in an analysis released Tuesday, said that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) will classify many high-yield loans to oil and gas exploration and production companies as Criticized -- specifically, as Substandard, Doubtful or Loss.Justin Fuller, Fitch's senior director of financial institutions, said that the troubles could worsen if nonbank lenders step in and buy Criticized loans, in which case ""banks may see losses crystallize, given the low bid prices on some loans and uncertainty around oil prices.""Meanwhile, banks continue to set aside billions in reserves to cover losses related to bad energy loans, Barclays said.""The noise surrounding energy-related provisions trends in 1Q '16 reached deafening levels across the banking industry when JPM announced at its Investor Day on February 23 that it planned to add about $500 million to its oil & gas related reserve in 1Q '16,"" bringing its total up to about $1.3 billion, Barclays said in an April 1 report.JPMorgan's late February announcement that it would hike energy loan loss reserves was followed by Comerica (CMA), which disclosed in a regulatory filing that if current conditions persist, an estimated additional provision of $75 million to $125 million could result.Morgan Stanley (MS) on Feb. 23 said in an SEC filing that it has $15.9 billion in energy-related loans outstanding. Morgan Stanley added that 60% of the loans are investment grade, implying that 40% were junk-rated. Morgan Stanley reports earnings on April 18.Wells Fargo, which reports earnings Thursday, set aside $1.2 billion for energy-loan losses in Q4. It has $17.4 billion in energy loans, with $24 billion in untapped credit lines.Bank of America has about $21 billion in energy-related loans and about the same amount in credit lines yet to be drawn down. Bank of America also reports earnings Thursday.Citigroup (C) also has $21 billion in energy loans and $37 billion in credit lines yet to be tapped. Citigroup reports earnings on Friday.JPMorgan reports first-quarter earnings on Wednesday. JPMorgan shares closed up 1.85% on the stock market today, retaking its 50-day moving average. The stock fell to a 52.50 low on Feb. 11 before turning up, but it is still below its 200-day average.Wells Fargo stock rose 1.6%, Morgan Stanley 1.95%, Citigroup 1.9% and Bank of America 2.3%. All are below their 200-day lines.Fitch said that many energy companies with high levels of cash-flow and balance-sheet leverage are at risk of default. ""Classified risk ratings from the OCC could amplify the pain that many leverage E&P borrowers are already feeling,"" Fitch Senior Director of Leveraged Finance Sharon Bonelli said in the report.""However,"" Fitch offered in a positive caveat, ""most large banks have manageable exposure to energy loans, averaging just 23% of tangible common equity in Fitch's portfolio.""

""We are always looking for exceptional growth companies that we believe have solid and/or improving fundamentals, a reasonable valuation and an approaching catalyst.""With that double-barreled approach, the fund's -1.28% return topped 77% of its large-cap growth peer mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. over the 12 months going into Tuesday. Its direct rivals averaged a 3.89% loss. The S&P 500 eked out an 0.51% gain.Over the past three years, the fund's average annual gain of 11.16% beat 62% of its peer group, which averaged a 10.31% yearly return. The big-cap bogey averaged an 11.23% advance.While the fund rotated from some smaller, fast-growing biotech and technology stocks in Q4 into better-established, more stable stocks, it has hardly abandoned growth. Holdings in the portfolio average an IBD Composite Rating of 72. The Composite Rating combines IBD's five stock-performance ratings, including EPS and RS Ratings, with 99 being the highest.Top holdings with very strong Comp Ratings of at least 80 as of Dec. 31 included Alphabet (GOOGL), Facebook (FB), Home Depot (HD), Priceline (PCLN) and Nike (NKE).New buys with Comp Ratings of 90 or better included McDonald's (MCD), Adobe Systems (ADBE), Southwest (LUV) and MSCI (MSCI).Stocks poised to do well can be spotted deeper in the portfolio, too. Chemicals and paint company Sherwin-Williams (SHW), with a 97 Comp Rating, is up 9% so far this year. It is still within buy range of its 282.10 entry on a cup pattern.It also sports a dividend yield of 1.2%. Its earnings per share have climbed 23%, 18% and 39% the past three quarters.Comerica Bank (CMA), BLB&B Advisors, Bank of the West, Berkshire Money Management, HighPoint Advisor Group and Beese Fulmer Investment Management reportedly all opened or added to stakes in Sherwin-Williams during Q4.Online travel agency Priceline is pushing into China and elsewhere in Asia. Shares are up 4% this year and are approaching a double-bottom entry at 1342.09.Priceline's EPS growth was flat three quarters ago, but its earnings per share grew 14% and 16% the past two stanzas. Within the past week, Cantor Fitzgerald and Cowan & Co. reportedly restated their buy recommendations.McDonald's is up 4% this year. Shares are forming a flat base with a 124.93 buy point.Its EPS rose 28% and 16% the past two quarters after declining in five of the six prior four frames. Its dividend yield is 2.9%.

116,CMA,"Wells Fargo (WFC) on Wednesdsay set aside $1.2 billion in reserves for oil and gas loans gone bad, becoming the second big bank in two days to make such an announcement.Energy-related loans comprise 2% of Wells Fargo's overall loan portfolio, but make up about 10% of its total loan loss reserves, the San Francisco-based bank announced in a regulatory filing. If oil prices remain low for an extended period of time, there could be additional deterioration in its energy portfolio, resulting in nonperforming loans and credit losses, Wells Fargo warned.The filing came one day after JPMorgan Chase (JPM) boosted its energy-related loan loss reserves by 60% to $1.3 billion. JPMorgan  also warned of a ""very tough"" Q1 for investment banking.Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley (MS) late Tuesday disclosed that it has $15.9 billion in energy-related loans, with only 60% investment grade.Wells Fargo shares fell 1% to 47.61 on the stock market today after sinking to 46.56 intraday. JPMorgan stock rose 2 cents to 56.14 tumbling 4.2% on Tuesday. Morgan Stanley was flat after losing 3.2% Tuesday.Many regional banks such as Comerica (CMA) are believed to be much-more heavily exposed to energy sector woes. Comerica stock fell 0.2% Wednesday after tumbling 4.5% Tuesday.The crumbling energy sector has adversely impacted banks, hurt by loans to energy companies that have gone bad as oversupply and soft demand have gutted prices by more than 70% since June 2014.Earlier this month, Morgan Stanley said it doesn't expect oil to hit $70 per barrel until 2018. On Wednesday, U.S. crude rose 0.9% to $32.15 a barrel on Wednesday after falling more than 4% intraday.Image provided by Shutterstock.

117,CMA,"With events such as Apple's (AAPL) recent wrangling with the feds pushing the issue of digital security to the forefront, it's no wonder payment processor Vantiv (VNTV) is growing more prominent in the ongoing battle against cybercriminals.The No. 2 company in its field by volume, Vantiv continues to reap the rewards of merchants' and financial institutions' move to chip cards and their corresponding terminals. Its suite of other cybersecurity products continues to play a key role in the company's upward climb.Vantiv processed $842 billion in transactions last year, and this is showing up in the company's numbers. Fourth-quarter results surpassed analyst estimates as adjusted earnings jumped 23% to 65 cents a share, marking a third straight quarter of accelerating growth. Net revenue increased 13% to $453 million.“Vantiv has strong secular tailwinds, in our view, spanning digital payments, security, software and e-commerce with little exposure to macro headwinds like (currency exchange), gas, regulation, credit or discretionary spending,” Pacific Crest analyst Josh Beck said in a recent note to clients. He also notes that Vantiv has ""above-average industry growth.""Vantiv can thank a number of entities for lifting awareness of cybersecurity, with the most recent example being Apple. The tech behemoth brought the issue of smartphone security front and center in recent days with its controversial refusal to assist the FBI in unlocking an iPhone that could contain terrorism evidence. The company says it wants to protect customer privacy.Cyberhacks have also struck customer databases at such merchants as Target (TGT) and Home Depot (HD) in recent years, and the threat they'll keep scouring the Internet for further vulnerability persists.One relatively new security measure in the U.S. payments space is that of chip cards and terminals known as EMV. Named for the three consumer credit companies that originated the technology -- Europay, Mastercard (MA) and Visa (V) -- EMV uses a chip embedded in the card, rather than the traditional black strip, in an attempt to process payments in a much more secure way.The card-and-terminal upgrade cycle is driving significant growth for Vantiv, which plays on both sides of the equation. Some 80% of the company’s revenue comes from merchants, via the sale of new terminals, as well as other e-commerce, mobile, compliance and data analytics products. Clients include Macy's (M), Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), Kroger (KR) and the U.S. Postal Service.The other 20% comes from financial institutions, with Vantiv behind the reissuance of the cards that contain EMV chips. Partners include Comerica Bank (CMA), Fifth Third Bank (FITB), Discover Financial Services (DFS) and Capital One Financial (COF).Fortunately for Vantiv, the EMV upgrade cycle has a long way to go. Vantiv said last month during its fourth-quarter earnings call that, as of the end of 2015, more than two-thirds of the terminals of its merchant clients still needed to be upgraded. And more than half the debit cards of its bank clients still needed to be reissued as chip cards.""Some 15% of Vantiv's merchant transactions are chip-on-chip, meaning a chip card used by a consumer at a merchant that has a chip terminal,"" Beck told IBD. ""That gives you a sense that we're still pretty early, and my view is that this a multiyear cycle for Vantiv.""Further, the urgency for financial institutions and merchants to convert is growing. October 2015 marked a shift in liability to whichever party -- card issuers or merchants handling payments -- has the weaker technology. Prior to that, the card issuers were primarily responsible for cyber fraud liability.The company expects to see continued growth from EMV-related sales at least through early 2017, with an even longer tail from smaller clients on the merchant side, according to Vantiv Chief Executive Charles Drucker.""On the financial institution side, we're seeing the large banks adopt fast and reissue the cards,"" Drucker told IBD. ""The mid-size banks, as you pull into early 2017, you're going to see a lot of the cards out there with chips in them.""Along with upgrades, Vantiv is helping guide clients through the ever-changing regulatory environment, Drucker says. And its large clients are implementing Vantiv’s entire security suite, including end-to-end encryption and tokenization, a process that removes the credit card number completely from the retailer’s system.Beyond that, a number of merchants are buying terminals that also have near-field communication, or NFC, technology, which enables payments from the likes of Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Google-owner Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Android Pay.The introduction of Apple Pay in September 2014 helped create a turning point in the payment processing industry, with nearly 1 in 5 point-of-sale terminals in the U.S. now enabled to accept billions of dollars in mobile payments, according to Juniper Research.""Most of the merchants, when they are designing their system, they're designing it in a way that when they get EMV, they are able to implement NFC inside of it,"" Drucker said.Another area of growth for Vantiv has been in the integrated payments space. For example, when a server enters an order into a restaurant's software system, Vantiv is embedded in that process. Plus, Vantiv is expanding into new verticals in the integrated payment category, including health care.Vantiv earns a near-best IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of 99. Shares are trading 1%-2% below a cup-shaped base buy point of 53.46, with the stock retaking its 50-day line several weeks ago.Vantiv also has less exposure to the current volatile economic environment because of its concentration in everyday spending categories, including grocery stores and drug stores. The company doesn’t have much foreign exposure at this time, but in the long term, Drucker sees an international investment in the e-commerce space.And with the vast amount of information its transactions contain, Vantiv sees data analytics as a long-term growth driver as well.""Merchants and banks continue to be more interested in data analytics -- whether it’s banks using it to activate customers or see trends inside their base, or merchants using it to give a better customer experience, or to improve ticket sales that they have,"" Drucker said.

118,CMA,"Standard & Poor's cut the ratings of four regional banks, including Comerica (CMA) and Texas Capital Bancshares (TCBI), because of their exposure to the battered energy sector and low crude oil prices.Cullen/Frost Bankers (CFR) and BOK Financial (BOKF) were the other two lenders whose ratings suffered a cut late Tuesday.""We are in the early innings of the downturn, in our view, and we expect loan losses to rise over the next two years, even if energy prices rebound modestly from current levels,"" S&P said in a statement.Comerica and BOK Financial Corp were lowered to BBB+ from A-, while Cullen/Frost Bankers was cut to A- from A. Texas Capital Bancshares was lowered to BB+ from BBB-.In addition, S&P revised its ratings outlook to negative for the four banks, suggesting another downgrade is possible in the future.Shares of Comerica closed down 1.2% Wednesday but climbed 4% after hours, Texas Capital fell 2%, Cullen/Frost rallied 0.3%, and BOK gained 0.8%.Last week, Fitch Ratings said most U.S. banks can weather the cheap oil storm for now, but it warned that a prolonged slump in crude oil prices could cause problems for lenders, particularly mid-sized banks with exposure to the energy market.Last month, Wells Fargo (WFC) raised provisions against bad assets by 70%, nearly half of it for loans in the oil and gas sector. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) said its expenses related to credit losses rose 49% during the fourth quarter, mostly driven by bad energy loans.Citigroup (C) has set aside $250 million to cover energy portfolio losses, but it warned it would have to double the overall provisions if oil fell below $25 per barrel.Thanks to oversupply and weak global demand, oil prices have plunged more than 70% from their level in June 2014.
"
119,CMA,"Direct exposure to plummeting oil prices is modest for U.S. banks, according to a study by Fitch Ratings, but it could intensify going further.Most U.S. banks are in a good position to withstand volatile energy markets despite several of them, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC), announcing energy-related loan provisioning in Q4, Fitch said.""Losses to date have been minimal,"" said Doriana Gamboa, senior director at Fitch, in a statement.But if oil prices remain low for longer than expected, lenders -- particularly midsized banks  with outsized exposure -- could have problems with additional provisioning. Fitch said that it expects oil prices to increase to $45 per barrel on average this year and $55 in 2017. Crude oil currently trades around $30 per barrel.""Larger U.S. banks should be able to weather loan provisions without rating pressures, but negative rating actions are possible for some midtier banks if oil prices remain depressed near or under the $30 per barrel range for an extended period,"" said Julie Solar, senior director at Fitch.Last month, Wells Fargo raised provisions against bad assets by 70%, nearly half of them for loans in the oil and gas sector. JPMorgan said that its expenses related to credit losses surged 49% in Q4, mostly driven by bad energy loans. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned of some ""stress"" in energy loans as the bank reported its Q4 earnings last month.Citigroup (C) has set aside $250 million to cover energy portfolio losses but warned that it would have to double the overall provisions if oil were to fall to $25 per barrel for a sustained period. Comerica (CMA) increased its provisions for credit losses to $35 million in Q4, up 35% from the third quarter's total.JPMorgan Chase closed down 1.1%, Wells Fargo dipped 0.8%, Citigroup lost 2.3% and Comerica eased 1.1% in the stock market today.

"
138,CMA,"The company ranks fourth among 28 names in IBD's Finance-Credit Card-Payment Processing industry group. Other players in the group include Blackhawk Network (HAWK), Total System Services (TSS)and Heartland Payment Systems (HPY). The group itself is ranked No. 29 among IBD's 197 industries.
"
139,CMA,"Originally a spinoff from Fifth Third Bank, Vantiv loaded up on technology and additional distribution capabilities to conquer the fast-growing market of electronic payments. It expanded its growth organically via a strong referral business and inorganically through a few key acquisitions.
"
140,CMA,"As a result, it's been able to grow revenue at a 40%-plus rate for the past nine consecutive quarters. Earnings per share increased 15% to 26% during the past six quarters. Its stock is up 36% so far this year.
"
141,CMA,"The transition to chip cards, or what the industry calls EMV migration, has challenged the industry. October is the target for the so-called ""liability shift."" After the shift, when a transaction takes place, the party with the weaker technology will bear the cost of the possible hack or fraud.
"
142,CMA,"That's why most national merchants, retailers and banks have been working hard to issue the EMV cards and install EMV card terminals. Those cards carry a chip and are accessible with a PIN instead of the classic magnetic cards that require a signature. The technology embedded in the chip is much more complex; it makes point-of-sale transactions a lot more secure and the cards nearly impossible to duplicate. The chip cards alone do not enhance online payment security, though.
"
143,CMA,"This system has already been in use for many years in Europe and elsewhere in the world. EMV stands for Europay, Mastercard (MA) and Visa (V), the originators of the standard. The U.S. is the last payment market to migrate to it, mostly due to the vastness of the old tech and the cost and complexity of the transition.
"
144,CMA,"The result is that more credit card fraud migrated to the less secure U.S. market over the years. Now that chip cards will enhance the security on that end, the risk may shift to the weaker links in the industry: small and medium-size businesses and online users.
"
145,CMA,"That's where Vantiv comes in.
"
146,CMA,"In addition to being a leader in the EMV transition, Vantiv also has taken steps beyond it. ""We think that the best way for the merchants to protect information is to do what we call a security suite of products, which is accepting EMV cards but also encrypting the information and tokenization,"" said Vantiv CEO Charles Drucker.
"
147,CMA,"Point-to-point encryption helps merchants protect client data. ""If the data is encrypted from the point they swipe the card to the point that it's received by us as payment processor ... that data is now protected and virtually impossible to unencrypt, and that's a value-added service we make revenue on,"" said Andrew Ciafardini, vice president of corporate communications for Vantiv.
"
148,CMA,"The other tool is tokenization, which removes the credit card number completely from the retailer's system. Instead, the retailer gets a representation of the number, which is called a token and is specific to that retailer, Ciafardini explained. ""So even if the system were breached, a criminal could not use that token anywhere else.""
"
149,CMA,"Growth By Acquisiton
"
150,CMA,"Vantiv has made three acquisitions in recent years. At the end of 2012, it acquired Litle, an independent e-commerce payment processor for Internet and direct-response marketing transactions. Its customer base includes Overstock.com (OSTK), Ancestry.com and Wayfair (W).
"
151,CMA,"""That was a technology-based acquisition,"" said Nathan Rozof, senior vice president of investor relations at Vantiv. ""Today, we're using that e-commerce technology to win clients like the USPS, where they need help processing not only in all their post offices but also USPS.com and the kiosks.""
"
152,CMA,"The other two acquisitions relate to the integrated payment space. Whenever a merchant, such as a restaurant, buys the software to manage its orders, inventory, kitchen, employee time and accounting, Vantiv can integrate the payment processing technology and offers 24/7 help lines for all platforms if any issues arise.
"
153,CMA,"Vantiv's purchase of Element in 2013 brought innovative technology into this integrated payment space, while the larger Mercury buyout in mid-2014 brought with it one of the largest distribution channels in the U.S.
"
154,CMA,"More Sales, Cybercrime
"
155,CMA,"The company is certainly benefiting from a positive secular trend. ""The macro backdrop has been a positive (for Vantiv), and the declining gas prices have helped fan its sales growth,"" said Jason Deleeuw, senior research analyst at Piper Jaffray. ""We think payment security at the small and midsize merchant level is a key driver of growth for the larger, more sophisticated merchant processors like Vantiv.""
"
156,CMA,"Vantiv also plans to use its large cash position to consider offshore acquisitions, grow its core business and return capital to shareholders.
"
157,CMA,"As with any business, there are risks. Analyst Johnson mentions integration risk of its acquisitions, pricing pressure from financial institutions, PIN-network transaction-fee declines and economic risk.
"
158,CMA,"But the company has ambitious plans to grow its market share. From its spinoff in 2009 to today, Vantiv has grown its U.S. payment transactions share from 13% to 18%. ""We intend to grow faster than the payments industry,"" said Rozof.The time when customers paid for their purchases by swiping their credit cards and signing a paper receipt is coming to an end. New cards with a microchip and PIN have made their inroads into the financial payments market. And October 2015 marks an important steppingstone in this transition.Payment processor Vantiv (VNTV) stands to benefit from this industrywide shift. The Ohio-based company operates on both sides of the same market: It provides a full suite of payment services to merchants on the one hand; and on the other, it produces the physical cards for financial institutions across the U.S.Thanks to its extensive distribution network and access to both large and small merchants, Vantiv is the second-largest merchant acquirer in the U.S., representing an 18% market share in total payment transactions, overtaking a unit of Bank of America (BAC) in 2014. First Data ranked at the top. Vantiv also ranks as the No. 1 U.S. merchant acquirer in PIN debit transactions. An acquirer is a bank or other institution that accepts card payments in the merchants' behalf.On the financial services side, Vantiv holds a 10% market share in the U.S., representing more than 1,400 banking and financial customers. ""It is the electronic middleman that enables and links electronically retailers and point-of-sale systems to the card brands and to the card-issuing institutions,"" said Raymond James analyst Wayne Johnson.Among its clients are Macy's (M), Office Depot (ODP), Kroger (KR), Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), In-N-Out Burger, Wendy's (WEN), Comerica Bank (CMA) and Fifth Third Bank (FITB). More recent additions include Rabobank, Capital One Financial (COF) and the U.S. Postal Service.Among The Big ProcessorsThe company ranks fourth among 28 names in IBD's Finance-Credit Card-Payment Processing industry group.

163,CMA,"SunTrust Banks (STI) and other superregional bank stocks drifted closer to buy zones on Tuesday, leaders on a down day for the broader stock market. After the close, the House voted to ease some post-crisis restrictions on the financial industry.XThe bill, which waters down some Dodd-Frank curbs put in place after the financial crisis a decade ago, will largely help smaller banks. Still, giant bank stocks like JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) were forming bases, while Morgan Stanley (MS) was near a buy point.The Republican-controlled House approved the measures. It is largely expected to pass, and would then arrive at President Trump's desk to be signed into law. The bill cleared the Senate in March.Under the bill, banks would need to have at least $250 billion in assets to be considered systemically important to the financial system, well up from the current requirement for $50 billion. Banks with such a designation are subject to more regulations, including the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe measure also exempts banks with assets of less than $10 billion from the so-called Volcker Rule, which prohibits banks from short-term proprietary trading with their own accounts and other investments deemed too risky.The bill is part of a broader deregulation agenda for Trump and the GOP, who argue that passing it will promote economic growth. Democrats warn that lifting the restrictions could lead to a repeat of the risky behavior that got banks into trouble a decade ago.Separately, regulators are reportedly considering changes to the Volcker Rule that would remove some curbs on short-term trading.SunTrust rose 1.2% to 69.59 on the stock market today.

165,CMA,"Two bank stocks in the superregional group — Comerica (CMA) and Northern Trust (NTRS) — have recently appeared in the Big Cap 20. A few statistics point to where some of the market's strength is emerging so far this year.The S&P 500 is down 3.2%  for the year. The Big Cap 20 is up 3.1%. The superregional bank group is up 1.3%. The bank sector, which includes seven industry groups, is down 1.66%. Northern Trust is down 0.4%, and Comerica is up 5.6%.So far this year, the superregional group is the leader among bank groups.Chicago-based Northern Trust has accelerated its earnings growth in recent quarters. Earnings rose 6% vs. year-ago levels in the first quarter of 2017, then 10%, 11%, and 20% in the most recently reported quarter. The Street expects earnings to increase 27% in the current quarter.Annual earnings growth is expected to hit 29% in 2018, which would be the fastest growth in 10 years.Two new factors could be helping the banks. First, rising interest rates are expected to boost the banks' net profit margins.Second, the Republican changes to the Dodd-Frank law will ease some of the regulations affecting the banks, especially those banks with less than $250 billion in assets. According to SEC filings for the year ended in December, Northern Trust's total assets were $138.6 billion. Comerica's total assets were $71.6 billion.From the smaller banks' perspective, that's good news. However, there's some bad news that goes along with the changes.From a free-market perspective, the bad news is that the Republicans are not repealing Dodd-Frank. Not even close. They are ensuring that much of it will survive. Regulators will continue to have control over how big capital cushions should be and how much in profits banks can return to shareholders.The Senate has approved the changes, but the House had yet to vote on its version, as of Friday.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

The dividend growth rate is 11%.The atmosphere could now be more favorable to increasing bank dividends, as profits improve in the sector and fears recede from the 2008 collapse of Lehman Bros.Comerica is based in Dallas. Quarterly earnings increased 49%, 40% and most recently 29%. The Street expects Q1 earnings growth to roll in at 47%, which would put growth back on the high end of the trend.Annual earnings growth increased 57% last year after breaking free from a five-year growth rate of 7%. Analysts peg 2018 growth at 37%.Pretax margin last year reached 39%, the best in at least nine years.Results from the next annual stress tests for banks are expected to be released at the end of June.RELATED:Look For An Exit When Leaders CrumbleIPO Bases Are Unusual But Can Be ProfitableThink Big Profits: The Rally Around The High Tight Flag

167,CMA,"U.S. stock indexes broke through resistance at the 50-day line Tuesday in a bullish move that also delivered the most new highs in five weeks. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs (GS) and Apple (AAPL) signaled what is wrong and right with the market.The Nasdaq galloped ahead 1.7%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average popped 1.1% and 0.9%, respectively.Small caps kept to the chase, as the Russell 2000 added 1.1% in another bullish showing.Volume picked up in the afternoon and stayed up. The Nasdaq and NYSE both showed modestly higher volume compared with Monday, based on preliminary data.New highs provide an important indicator, and lately the totals have been discouraging. But on Tuesday, the count rose to the most in five weeks, according to preliminary data. This would be another sign that the market uptrend is real.Bullishness, though, isn't shared everywhere. The banks have had trouble getting credit for any earnings report.Goldman Sachs became the latest big bank to report strong quarterly results and then shrug off the performance. Goldman's earnings came in well above estimates. But the stock reversed to a 1.8% loss in heavy volume.Dallas-based Comerica (CMA) reported a 51% increase in earnings, above the consensus estimate. The narrow beat earned a slap in the face as the superregional stock fell 3.5%.The banks recently have shown that the most dangerous thing for them is to beat earnings estimates.Besides topping earnings expectations by about 25%, Goldman boosted its dividend by 5 cents to 80 cents a share.Other big banks did just fine Tuesday. Bank of New York Mellon (BK) rose 0.4%. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) was flat. Bank of America (BAC) added 0.4%.Why the trouble among banks and their earnings beats? Uncertainty surrounds the proposed changes to the Dodd-Frank law. Banks don't like the Dodd-Frank regulations, but the Republicans have not been able to unite on a plan to either repeal or amend the law.The selling in bank stocks could be profit-taking, given the run-ups many banks enjoyed in 2017.Meanwhile, Apple is showing that no news can be good news. Apple rose 1.4% as it notched its ninth gain in 11 sessions. This was accomplished without an earnings report.Apple will report quarterly results May 1 after the close. The stock is only 3% off its high, forming a base with a 183.60 buy point.Analysts expect Apple's quarterly earnings to jump 29% to $2.70 a share. A 29% gain would be Apple's best in 10 quarters.The 50-day line had been a problem since mid- to late March for the Nasdaq and the S&P 500. The indexes broke above the 50-day line Tuesday morning and closed above the line with no trouble along the way.A close above the line helps validate the market's uptrend.If the 50-day line has been converted from resistance into support, the next resistance area would be at the 7500 price level for the Nasdaq and the 2800 area for the S&P 500.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

The stock surged 5.7% to clear a 79.50 buy point in a flat base. The pattern, though, is a late-stage one.Chemical products maker Celanese (CE) gapped up about 4%. The stock broke above a 109.35 buy point in a double-bottom base. A double-bottom base is shaped like the letter W. The middle peak is the buy point.Meanwhile, the FANG stocks were up without exception midday Tuesday.

169,CMA,"The stock market was mixed and mostly unchanged in afternoon trading Tuesday, unfazed by comments from President Trump about North Korea and trade talks with China. Some bank stocks outperformed, while retail-related groups and homebuilders lagged.JPMorgan (JPM), American Express (AXP) and Goldman Sachs (GS) gained more than 1% in the Dow. The 10-year Treasury yield edged higher by 1 basis point to 3.07%.The Dow Jones industrial average eased 0.3%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite inched up 0.1%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking slightly higher than Monday's levels.The quiet action came even as President Trump cast doubt on his June summit with North Korea's Kim Jong Un. Trump also said he's not happy with trade talks with China so far and that no deal has been reached to save Chinese telecom ZTE Corp.In stock market results today, retail stocks were in the spotlight again.A strong premarket gain for Kohl's (KSS) faded badly. Shares slumped 6.5% despite better-than-expected earnings, sales and same-store sales growth in the quarter. The problem was same-store sales guidance.Meanwhile, department store operator J.C. Penney (JCP) lost 4% after CEO Marvin Ellison resigned to take the CEO post at home-improvement retailer Lowe's (LOW).TJX Cos. (TJX) was a bright spot in retail, rising 3% on strong results. A buy point of 84.89 is still in play for the stock.Among bank stocks, BB&T Corp. (BBT) added 2% to 55.94. It's still in buy range from a 54.80 buy point. Comerica (CMA) rose 2% to 100.77. It's working on a flat base with a 102.76 buy point. Financials were generally strong ahead of a Republican-controlled House vote that would ease some post-financial-crisis restrictions on the financial industry. The bill passed the Senate in March.Homebuilders were weak again, weighed down by weak earnings from Toll Bros. (TOL) Shares crashed 8%. It was noted as a possible put-option trade in last week's Earnings Preview column.In the technology sector, shares of Micron Technology (MU) jumped 7% after announcing a $10 billion share buyback late Monday. That news came on the heels of raised earnings and sales guidance earlier in the session.Micron recently cleared an aggressive entry at 54.37, 10 cents above its April 18 intraday high. Others might say Micron is still working on the right side of a base. That's a valid take as well.RELATED:Which Stocks Just Came On — And Off — IBD's Stock Lists?Micron Pops, Expects Strong Demand From AI, Autonomous Cars, CloudChina's E-Commerce Boom Is Good News For This Logistics Firm

219,CMA,"Early in his career, Charles Drucker fell into a trap that befalls many managers: He rushed to hire employees who ultimately proved a poor fit.Now he's learned the value of patience. As president and chief executive of Vantiv (VNTV), Drucker ensures that the company doesn't fill open positions in a hurry.""I've learned the hard way that sometimes if someone isn't the right fit, it can put back your progress,"" said Drucker, 51, who became Vantiv's CEO in 2009 after it spun off from regional bank Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB). ""I've succumbed to the pressure to get that body in right away, to rush to judgment and get an average person. Three or six or 12 months later, when things didn't work out, I've looked back and thought, 'I really saw that early.'""At Vantiv, Drucker requires that the company consider multiple candidates before making a hiring decision.Mistakes can occur if you have only one candidate when you fill a job opening, he says.With roughly 3,300 employees, Vantiv provides payment processing services and related technology solutions for merchants and financial institutions. The company is based near Cincinnati, Ohio.For Drucker, talent management means more than taking the time to recruit superior candidates. He also believes in rotating promising employees through different roles within the company.""If we're working on a strategic plan, we'll take a key person maybe one or two levels down who can help us drive the plan and present it to the board (of directors),"" Drucker said. ""So it's not just the ability to attract strong talent but also offering talent rotation development opportunities.""The Right LeaderIn 2013, he reassigned a strong performer in Vantiv's finance group to lead the push to further develop business with merchant banks. Even though she lacked experience in sales and marketing, she hit the ground running and rallied the sales force to educate merchant bankers on Vantiv's products.""She looked at it in a different way,"" Drucker said.As a result, the expansion into working with merchant banks accelerated. The company recently signed two big banks, People's United Bank (PBCT) and Comerica (CMA), which now refer business.Vantiv doesn't have a significant R&D budget. Instead, the company prides itself on observing market trends and pouncing on them at the right time.""We're agile and nimble,"" Drucker said. ""We like to place a couple of bets and be ready when we see trends emerging.""For example, Drucker and his team have noticed a shift away from traditional business sales — whether via phone or by door-to-door prospecting — in favor of integrated payments. That's a big reason for Vantiv's May 2014 acquisition of Mercury Payment Systems for $1.65 billion.""By 2017, 30% of all payments will be through integrated software,"" Drucker said. ""The Mercury acquisition helps us grow in that space.""

220,CMA,"Anyone who questions the entrepreneurial spirit of Americans might be swayed by spending a few minutes chatting with Doug Bowers.He's CEO of Durham, N.C.-based Square 1 Financial (SQBK), the holding company for Square 1 Bank, which provides loans and other financial services to entrepreneurs, startups, venture capital firms and private equity outfits.The company, which was founded in 2005 and had its initial public offering on March 27, depends on a steady stream of innovative people, companies and ideas to expand its business.In that regard, Square 1 is in good shape, Bowers says.""About $25 billion to $30 billion is invested into the innovation sector every year, and it goes to somewhere between 3,000 and 4,000 companies,"" he told IBD. ""Of that, about one-third are brand-new companies. That represents the pool of opportunity we focus on.""Where The Go-Getters AreTo reach that pool of opportunity, Square 1 employs 75 client representatives — what Bowers calls ""client-facing individuals"" — in a dozen offices throughout the country.These offices are concentrated in what he calls innovation hubs — places that focus primarily on technology and life sciences.They tend to be markets rich in talent, research and venture cap firms. They include Boston, New York, Seattle, California's Silicon Valley, San Diego, Denver and North Carolina's Research Triangle, where Square 1 is headquartered.About 80% of Square 1's loan portfolio is dedicated to entrepreneurial companies backed by VC investors, Bowers says. Of that 80%, about 60% is technology-based and 20% life sciences-based.The remaining 20% of Square 1's portfolio is dedicated to venture cap investors. These are the types of borrowers who don't find a lot of financing options at traditional banks.""Given the unique nature of the borrower and investor, there are very few banks willing to make these types of loans because of the real or perceived risk of lending to startups or near startups,"" Bowers said. ""Commercial banks see a company that may not have revenue and certainly does not have income or positive cash flow, and may not have collateral — so the commercial banks tend to say, 'No, thank you.'""One result is that VC firms and entrepreneurs must go shopping for loans at banks and other financial firms that either specialize in venture banking services or offer them as part of a larger menu of services.Among publicly traded companies, the list includes Silicon Valley Bank (SIVB), Comerica (CMA), First Republic Bank (FRC), City National (CYN) and Bridge Bank, owned by Bridge Capital Holdings (BBNK).There is no precise formula for making loans to VC, private equity and entrepreneurial clients, Bowers says. It takes experience, expertise, instinct and research.""We look very closely at the investor — their experience in the space, their knowledge, the amount of capital they have,"" he said. ""The investor is a very key component of how we evaluate whether we want to lend or not.""When lending to a company, Square 1 takes a hard look at property that it holds, its management team's experience and whether it fills an area that had not been filled.Delving Into The Deal BookSome funding arrangements that Square 1 has inked in recent months include credit facilities of $3 million to online marketing software provider Accelerize New Media, $4 million to digital publishing technology firm GTxcel, $12.5 million to dietary supplement maker NutraMed and $4.5 million to sitter- and nanny-search service Sittercity.Square 1 also provided a $7.5 million growth-capital facility to network-reliability tech firm Talari Networks.There is no shortage of companies in need of funding.""We believe there is plenty of runway and opportunity out there,"" Bowers said.To raise capital for that opportunity, Square 1 took its shares public last month. The company's March 27 IPO priced at 18 — above its expected range of 15 to 17 — and raised $104 million by offering 5.8 million shares. The stock closed its first day of trading at 20.60. Shares currently trade near 20.""The IPO was underwritten by arguably the top two underwriters, in Keefe, Bruyette & Woods and Sandler O'Neill,"" said Scott Sweet, managing partner at IPO Boutique. ""The stock has held up pretty well through this tough sell-off.""Founder Casey's LegacySquare 1 was founded by Richard Casey, a banking veteran who previously served in a variety of positions at Comerica Bank and its predecessor. A couple of his posts were president of the emerging growth division and managing director of Comerica Ventures. He died in November 2010.Bowers joined Square 1 three years ago. Previously, he spent years at Bank of America (BAC) in a variety of positions.He also has experience at starting up businesses and working at a private equity firm.Square 1 has seen a steady rise in its fortunes the past few years. According to a company filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Square 1 had net income of $22.4 million in 2013. That was up from $14.4 million in 2012.The last year that the company reported a net loss was 2010.Square 1's average deposits grew to $1.87 billion in 2013 from $1.53 billion in 2012.The company's average loan balance increased to $918 million last year from $751 million a year earlier, while adjusted operating revenue climbed to $105.3 million from $84.2 million.

222,CMA,"Higher-than-expected trading revenues and rise in demand for loans drove JPMorgan’s (JPM  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2018 earnings of $2.29 per share, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.22. The figure was up 26% from the prior-year quarter.The stock rose nearly 1% in the pre-market trading, indicating that investors have taken the results in their stride. Notably, the full-day trading session will depict a better picture.Unexpected improvement in trading activities, mainly driven by escalating trade war tensions between the United States and China boosted JPMorgan’s markets revenues. Fixed income trading and equity trading revenues were up 7% and 24%, respectively.Further, higher investment banking fees (up 17%), with equity underwriting and advisory supporting the growth, acted as a tailwind. Nevertheless, mortgage banking income declined owing to lower mortgage origination volume.Decent loan growth (driven mainly by improved wholesale and credit card loans) and rise in interest rates aided net interest income growth. The reported quarter also recorded stable provision for credit losses. Further, lower tax rate supported profitability during the quarter.The overall performance of JPMorgan’s business segments, in terms of net income generation, was decent. All segments, except Corporate, reported a rise in net income on a year-over-year basis.Among other positives, credit card sales volume was up 11% and merchant processing volume grew 12%. Further, Commercial Banking average core loan balances grew 4% and Asset Management average loan balances rose 12%.Net income was up 18% year over year to $8.3 billion.Trading Income, Higher Rates & Loan Growth Support RevenuesNet revenues as reported were $27.8 billion in the quarter, up 8% from the year-ago quarter. Also, the tally topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $27.6 billion. Rising rates, loan growth and increase in Markets revenues were the main reasons for the improvement. These were partially offset by lower mortgage banking fees and Card net interchange income.Non-interest expenses (on managed basis) were $16 billion, up 8% from the year-ago quarter. The rise was primarily due to higher compensation expenses, investments in technology and auto loan depreciation.Credit Quality ImprovesProvision for credit losses were $1.2 billion, relatively stable year over year. Also, as of Jun 30, 2018, non-performing assets were $5.8 billion, down 10% from the year-ago period.However, net charge-offs rose 4% year over year to $1.3 billion.Strong Capital PositionTier 1 capital ratio (estimated) was 13.6% as of Jun 30, 2018 compared with 14.2% as of Jun 30, 2017. Tier 1 common equity capital ratio (estimated) was 11.9% as of Jun 30, 2018, down from 12.5% a year ago. Total capital ratio came in at 15.4% (estimated) as of Jun 30, 2018 compared with 16.0% as of Jun 30, 2017.Book value per share was $68.85 as of Jun 30, 2018 compared with $66.05 as of Jun 30, 2017. Tangible book value per common share came in at $55.14 at the end of June compared with $53.29 a year ago.Bottom LineContinued improvement in loans and higher interest rates are expected to continue supporting JPMorgan’s revenues. With the Fed expected to continue raising rates, the company’s interest income will likely increase. Also, gains from lower tax rates will aid profitability.However, slowdown in mortgage business is likely to continue in the near term for JPMorgan. Also, rise in operating expenses makes us apprehensive.JPMorgan Chase & Co. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  JPMorgan Chase & Co. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Earnings per share of $2.72 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.58. Moreover, the bottom line reflected a 30% increase from the prior-year quarter.Shares of PNC Financial climbed more than 1% in pre-market trading reflecting investors’ optimism on continued easing of pressure on net interest margin that led to higher net interest income during the quarter. Though mortgage banking revenues declined, overall non-interest income witnessed year-over-year growth. Lower provisions remained another tailwind.However, higher expenses hurt results to some extent. Also, weakening of capital position was a headwind.The company’s net income for the quarter was $1.26 billion, up 23.6% from the prior-year quarter.Segment wise, on a year-over-year basis, quarterly net income at Corporate & Institutional Banking and Retail Banking improved 30.3% and 43.5%, respectively.

Also, net interest margin increased 12 basis points to 2.96%.Non-interest income was up 6% year over year to $1.91 billion, driven by higher asset management income, consumer services income, corporate services and other income, partially offset by lower income from residential mortgage.PNC Financial’s non-interest expenses were $2.58 billion, increasing 4.2% from the year-ago quarter. The rise was primarily due to higher personnel and marketing-related costs.As of Jun 30, 2018, total loans rose nearly 1% sequentially to $222.8 billion.

224,CMA,"The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2018 results on Jul 17, before the market opens. Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenue growth, significant rise in total client assets and new brokerage accounts were among the positives. However, higher expenses remained a headwind.In fact, the company has an impressive earnings surprise history as its earnings did not lag the Zacks Consensus Estimate in any of the trailing four quarters. It delivered an average positive surprise of 2.9%.The Charles Schwab Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  The Charles Schwab Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | The Charles Schwab Corporation QuoteHowever, activities of Schwab during the second quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. Thus, over the past 30 days, its Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings was revised 1.7% downward to 58 cents. Nevertheless, the figure reflects a year-over-year improvement of 48.7%.Notably, Schwab’s fundamental strength has helped its shares gain 17.9% in the past year, outperforming 10.8% growth recorded by the industry.Will the stock’s rally continue post second-quarter earnings release? Let’s see how things are shaping up.Before we take a look at what our quantitative model predicts, let’s check the factors that are likely to impact Q2 results.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsAfter an impressive first quarter, in terms of significant market volatility, client activity returned to normalized levels in the second quarter. Nevertheless, Schwab opened 141,000 and 122,000 new brokerage accounts in April and May, respectively, indicating that investors were somewhat interested in entering the market. Also, the company’s efforts toward lowering trading fees should have helped in adding more brokerage accounts during the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for active brokerage accounts for the second quarter is 11,181, which reflects a year-over-year improvement of 6.6%.Thus, despite a sequential slowdown in market volatility in the second quarter, Schwab’s trading revenues are expected to witness a modest improvement, supported by decent growth in brokerage accounts.Further, Schwab witnessed a rise in total client assets and average interest-earning assets in April and May, on a year-over-year basis. This should reflect in the company’s results for the entire quarter.In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total client assets for the to-be-reported quarter is $3.4 trillion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 11.5%. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets for the quarter is $249 billion, which reflects growth of 15.3% year over year. Hence, higher assets, along with an improvement in the rate scenario, should help Schwab experience higher net interest revenues during the quarter.Improvement in the two most important components of Schwab’s revenues is expected to support overall revenue growth in the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the to-be-reported quarter is $2.50 billion, which reflects year-over-year growth of 17.2%.However, Schwab’s operating expenses have remained elevated for the past few quarters. Moreover, because of higher compensation and benefits costs, overall expenses are expected to remain high in the second quarter.Now, let’s see what our quantitative model predicts.According to our quantitative model, chances of Schwab beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the second quarter are low. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to be confident of an earnings surprise call.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Schwab is -2.29%.Zacks Rank: Schwab currently has a Zacks Rank #3.

225,CMA,"BlackRock, Inc. (BLK  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2018 results on Jul 16, before the opening bell. Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results benefited from an improvement in revenues, rise in assets under management (AUM) and long-term inflows.Moreover, the company boasts a decent earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being nearly 2.6%.BlackRock, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  BlackRock, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | BlackRock, Inc. QuoteHowever, BlackRock’s business activities and prospects in the to-be-reported quarter did not encourage analysts to revise earnings estimates upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $6.64 has decreased marginally over the past 30 days. Nonetheless, the figure reflects a year-over-year improvement of 26.7%.Strong fundamentals have helped shares of the company to gain 15.6% in the past year, outperforming 2.6% growth recorded by the industry.Will the rally in share price continue post Q2 earnings? To a great extent, it depends on whether the company is able to maintain its trend of beating earnings estimates.Before we take a look at what our quantitative model predicts, let’s discuss the factors that are likely to influence Q2 results.Factors to Impact Q2 ResultsBlackRock remains a dominant player in the ETF market, given its continued investments in U.S. iShare core ETFs. Moreover, as investors are increasing their allocations toward ETFs instead of alternative investments in order to reduce management costs, the company’s iShares inflows are expected to remain strong in the to-be-reported quarter. In fact, the company expects to witness positive active equity flows during the quarter under review. Thus, while negative foreign currency adjustments during the second quarter might have an unfavorable impact on AUM, total AUM is expected to improve, driven by steady inflows. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total AUM for the to-be-reported quarter is $6.44 trillion, which reflects rise of 1.9%, sequentially.Supported by the increase in assets during the to-be-reported quarter, investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenues, which constitute more than 80% of the company’s total revenues, is also expected to witness an improvement. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is $3.03 billion, reflecting 13.4% increase year over year.Moreover, performance fees, which is also a major revenue component, is expected to improve during the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for performance fees for the second quarter is $76 million, which represents an improvement of 58.3% from the prior-year quarter.However, consensus estimates for advisory and other revenues show that this component is likely to witness a decline. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is $72 million, which reflects a decline of 1.4% year over year.Thus, while advisory and other revenues are expected to decline, an improvement in the major components of revenues is likely to boost the company’s total revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the second quarter is $3.45 billion, which reflects growth of 16.4% year over year.Notably, BlackRock might witness an increase in costs in the to-be-reported quarter. BlackRock’s expenses have remained elevated over the last few years. Moreover, the restructuring of the traditional actively managed equities business, along with its plans for improving product offerings, is expected to lead to further rise in expenses.Earnings WhispersAccording to our quantitative model, it cannot be conclusively predicted whether BlackRock will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the second quarter.

226,CMA,"Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Jul 17. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.Before we discuss why an earnings beat might also be in store, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the last reported quarter.Comerica’s first-quarter 2018 results reflected rise in revenues. Also, a strong capital position and improving credit quality were the positives. However, higher expenses and a fall in deposits were the key headwinds.Notably, the company boasts an impressive earnings surprise history. It surpassed earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 5.2%.Comerica Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Comerica Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Comerica Incorporated QuoteNow let’s take a look at what our quantitative model predicts for the to-be-reported quarter:Our proven model shows that Comerica has the right combination of the two key ingredients —positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Comerica is +1.60%.Zacks Rank: The company currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3.Though estimates for the to-be-reported quarter have been revised slightly downward over the last seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $1.62 reflects growth of 43.4% year over year.Factors to Drive the ResultsNet Interest Income (NII) to Rise: Comerica’s net interest income is likely to improve in the to-be-reported quarter supported by expanding net interest margin and a pickup in loan growth, particularly in the areas of commercial and industrial, and consumer.These benefits might partially be offset by a fall in interest earning assets. The Zacks Consensus Estimate projects a slight decline in average earnings assets balance to $66 billion on a year-over-year basis.Higher Fee Income: Investment banking performance is expected to be flat during the quarter. Strong equity issuances globally might have been boosted by IPOs and follow-on offerings. So, equity underwriting fees are likely to show improvement. Also, increasing M&As will likely support advisory fees to some extent.Moreover, given the continued momentum in customer activity, in terms of using credit and debit cards, the company might have recorded higher related fees.Therefore, given expectations for rise in both NII and fee income, total revenues are likely to increase. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales for the second quarter is $831.9 million, reflecting an improvement of 7.2% year over year.Lower Mortgage Banking Revenues: The company is likely to continue witnessing lower revenues from this division owing to slowdown in refinancing activities caused by rising interest rates.Credit Quality Might Improve: The quarter continued to witness strong credit quality trends. Also, the consensus estimate shows 34.9% and 33.3% decline in non-performing assets and non-performing loans, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around.BankUnited (BKU  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Jul 24.

227,CMA,"ADTRAN, Inc. (ADTN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2018 results after the closing bell on Jul 17. Although this communication infrastructure provider delivered an average positive surprise of 51.3% in the trailing four quarters, it widely missed earnings estimates in the last quarter.  Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderADTRAN is accelerating the industry’s transition to open, programmable, scalable networks by leveraging its Mosaic Software-Defined Access architecture that combines modern Web-scale technologies with open-source platforms to facilitate rapid innovation in multi-technology, multi-vendor environments. This will enable operators to better face Web-scale competition by reducing time and cost to introduce new service, technologies and best-of-breed suppliers as they strive to reduce operational costs while creating and deploying differentiated product offerings.However, despite its best efforts, ADTRAN remains plagued by a merger-related review and slowdown in spending at a domestic Tier 1 customer. High operating costs and lower margins are additional concerns for the company.The success of 5G technology hinges on substantial investments to upgrade infrastructure in the core fiber backhaul network to support anticipated growth in data services. Although these investments will eventually help minimize service delivery costs to adequately support broadband competition, rural coverage and wireless densification, short-term profitability is likely to fall, leading to earnings dilution.Efforts to build resilient infrastructure facilities to withstand natural catastrophes further increase operating costs. Moreover, simmering tensions between the United States and China related to trade restrictions imposed on the sale of communication equipment to the Chinese firms have dented the credibility of the industry and led to loss of businesses.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that ADTRAN is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00% with both pegged at a loss of 23 cents.

Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results benefited from an improvement in net interest income as well as non-interest income, partially offset by higher expenses.Moreover, PNC Financial has an impressive earnings surprise history. It has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 2.6%.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc Price and EPS Surprise  The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc Price and EPS Surprise | The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc QuoteHowever, activities of the company in the to-be-reported quarter were not adequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, its Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $2.58 has been revised marginally downward over the past 30 days. Nonetheless, the figure reflects year-over-year improvement of 22.9%.Notably, the company’s price performance in the past three months has not been impressive. Its shares have lost 5.3% compared with 0.4% decline of the industry.Now, before we take a look at what our quantitative model predicts, let’s discuss the factors that are likely to impact PNC Financial’s second-quarter results.Factors to Impact Q2 ResultsNet Interest Income to Improve: The second quarter has witnessed a modest improvement in commercial as well as consumer lending. Also, the company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest-earning assets of $331.4 billion for the to-be-reported quarter reflects growth of 2.3% year over year. Thus, given the improvement in the lending scenario PNC Financial’s net interest income (NII) is expected to improve while flattening of yield curve will likely somewhat hurt.Management expects NII to grow in the low-single digit, on a sequential basis.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for NII for the second quarter is $2.4 billion, which reflects an improvement of 6.2% year over year.Non-Interest Income to Rise: Although the performance of the equity markets was not very impressive during the second quarter, the company’s asset management revenues are expected to witness a rise, supported by higher earnings from its equity investment in BlackRock. Consensus estimates for asset management revenues are $459 million, which reflects growth of 15.3% year over year.Moreover, given the continued momentum in customer activity, in terms of using credit and debit cards, PNC Financial’s consumer services revenues are likely to improve. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for consumer services revenues of $372 million reflects growth of 3.3% year over year.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for corporate services revenues is $471 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 8.5%. Also, estimates for service charges on deposits are $174 million, reflecting 2.4% rise on a year-over-year basis.Additionally, despite a slowdown in refinancing activities during the quarter under review, due to the continued rise in rates, mortgage originations were decent. Thus, residential mortgage revenues are also expected to witness a modest improvement. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is $106 million, reflecting growth of 1.9% year over year.With the improvement in all components of fee income, total non-interest income is expected to rise. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for non-interest income is $1.8 billion, indicating 1.4% rise on a year-over-year basis.Thus, given the rise in both NII as well as fee income, total revenues are likely to improve. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales for the second quarter is $4.3 billion reflecting an improvement of 4.7% year over year.Controlled Expenses: While management expects non-interest expenses to be up by low-single digits on a sequential basis, the company’s continued efforts toward its cost-saving program is likely to keep overall expenses under control.Now, let’s have a look at what our quantitative model predicts:According to our quantitative model, chances of PNC Financial beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the second quarter are low. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for PNC Financial is -0.23%.Zacks Rank: PNC Financial currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3.

229,CMA,"Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings, before the opening bell on Jul 13.This San Francisco-based banking giant has been embroiled in one scandal after another for more than one and a half years. Troubles have been mounting at Wells Fargo since the revelation of the sales scandal, which was followed by disclosure of issues in its auto insurance business, online bill pay services and the Wealth and Investment Management segment. With the ongoing review process of business practices, more wrongdoings may be reported, consequently straining the top line.The mortgage business of Wells Fargo is expected to have witnessed a slowdown in the second quarter. With the interest rates moving higher, refinancing activities and fresh originations have been slowing down. Therefore, no major help is expected from this segment. Thus, growth in Wells Fargo’s mortgage banking revenues will likely have remained low.However, management expects residential mortgage originations to increase in the to-be-reported quarter, reflecting seasonality in the purchase market.Here are the other factors influencing Wells Fargo’s Q2 results:Loan Growth: Per the Fed’s latest data, loans are likely to have improved slightly on a sequential basis during the April-June quarter. Particularly, weakness in revolving home equity loans might have offset growth in commercial and industrial (C&I), consumer and overall real estate loans to some extent.After declining for five consecutive quarters, auto originations have stabilized in the last two quarters. With the completion of the centralization of collection and funding activities, the bank is positioned to start increasing originations over time, and currently estimates the portfolio of balances to begin growing in early 2019.Notably, based on the current pricing trends, management expects production margin to have declined further in second-quarter 2018.Net Interest Income (NII) Growth: NII growth is expected to have been decent, given modest loan and deposit growth, and rising net interest margin on rising rates.According to management, net interest income is predicted to be ‘relatively stable’ in 2018. It expects that lower earning assets and higher deposit costs might offset benefits from higher interest rates.Expenses May Trend Higher: Wells Fargo might have recorded escalated costs given its franchise investments in areas, including mobile banking technology, digital lending and brokerage offerings, during the quarter under review. Moreover, ongoing litigation hassles are expected to have resulted in elevated legal costs. Encouragingly, seasonally higher personnel expenses are expected to have dropped in the quarter, though salary expense is likely to have flared up.Non-Interest Revenues to Disappoint: Outflows from the asset-management business will likely have been recorded on market declines. Growth in trading revenues is predicted to have been muted as uncertainties, mainly related to the U.S.-China trade war and some other geo-political tensions were not enough to induce volatility. In addition, trust income is likely to disappoint on lower equity markets.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model indicates that chances of Wells Fargo beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate are high as it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP,and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold).You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is currently pegged at +0.33%. This is a very significant and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the company.Zacks Rank: The combination of Wells Fargo’s Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings remained unchanged over the last seven days, calling for year-over-year growth of 4.7%. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is projected at $21.6 billion, down 2.7% year over year. Wells Fargo & Company Price and EPS Surprise Wells Fargo & Company Price and EPS Surprise | Wells Fargo & Company QuoteOther Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Comerica (CMA  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Jul 17.

230,CMA,"Muted trading business is unlikely to support Goldman Sachs’ (GS  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2018 earnings, to be reported on Jul 17. However, benefits of higher rates and relatively better performance of other segments — mainly investing and lending — are anticipated to aid earnings.Being an investment bank, Goldman is exposed to extreme market volatility. Volatility-driven growth in trading revenues, which supported the top line during the January-March quarter, is likely to have remained muted in the second quarter. Though uncertainty, mainly related to the U.S.-China trade war and some other geo-political tensions, induced volatility, client activity returned to normalized levels in the April-June quarter. Therefore, not much support is expected from this source of revenues as fixed income business is likely to have slowed down during the period.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Institutional Client Services division, of which the major portion comprises fixed income revenues, reflects a decline of 18.2% sequentially.Additionally, the investment management unit of Goldman is projected to have supported earnings. Prior investments in fixed income, alternatives and low-cost index funds are expected to continue to reap benefits to some extent. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for this division projects a rise of 6.7% year over year.Here are the other factors that might influence Goldman’s Q2 results:Investment Banking Fees to Report Modest Results: The trend of earning solid advisory and underwriting fees for debt and equity issuance is unlikely to have remained in the second quarter, as rising rates will have limited corporates’ involvement in these activities. As debt origination fees typically account for about half of total investment banking fees, this might have adversely impacted Goldman’s revenues.However, a potential rise in fees from increasing M&As will likely help banks partially offset the lost revenues. Also, strong equity issuances globally might have boosted IPOs and follow-on offerings. So, the related fees are predicted to increase. Thus, Goldman is also likely to report a decent quarter.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the investment banking segment is pegged at $1.8 billion, up 5.9% year over year.Investing & Lending to Get a Boost: Improved corporate performance and rising rates are expected to have driven revenues from this source. In addition to higher interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending — particularly in the areas of commercial and industrial, and consumer — is anticipated to have perked up revenues. Nonetheless, lower asset values recorded during the quarter might have partially offset this rise. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for investing and lending segment is projected at $1.7 billion, up 6.3% year over year.Strong Expense Management: Goldman is focused on enhancing its efficiency while maintaining strong franchise and investing in new opportunities. As the majority of unnecessary expenses have already been cut by the bank, expense reduction will unlikely be a major support. Furthermore, there were no major outflows related to legal settlements during the quarter that might have impacted Goldman’s earnings unusually.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Goldman does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Goldman is 0.00%.Zacks Rank: Goldman carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. But we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $4.67 reflects an 18.2% rise on a year-over-year basis. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $8.7 billion indicates 10.4% increase from the prior-year quarter. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

231,CMA,"KeyCorp’s (KEY  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings of 38 cents per share came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, this compared favorably with adjusted earnings of 32 cents per share recorded in the prior-year quarter.Improvement in both net interest income and fee income drove results. Further, a decline in provision for credit losses and improving loans acted as tailwinds. However, an increase in expenses was on the downside.Net income from continuing operations was $402 million, up from $296 million registered in the prior-year quarter.Revenues Improve, Expenses RiseTotal revenues grew 3.1% year over year to $1.55 billion. However, the figure marginally lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.56 billion.Tax-equivalent net interest income went up 2.5% year over year to $952 million. The rise was attributable to benefits from low deposit betas and elevated interest rates. Also, taxable-equivalent net interest margin from continuing operations improved 2 basis points (bps) year over year to 3.15%.Non-interest income was $601 million, reflecting an increase of 4.2% from the year-ago quarter. The increase was driven by an improvement in all components except trust and investment services income, cards and payments income along with other income.Non-interest expenses (excluding notable items) increased 7.9% year over year to $1.01 billion. The rise was due to higher personnel costs, largely due to recent acquisitions as well as accelerated technology investments and higher performance-based compensation.Strong Balance SheetAt the end of the first quarter, average total deposits were $102.56 billion, down 1.2% from the prior quarter. Average total loans were $86.93 billion, up 1.1% sequentially.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagNet loan charge-offs, as a percentage of average loans, decreased 2 bps year over year to 0.25%. Provision for credit losses declined 3.2% year over year to $61 million.Further, non-performing assets, as a percentage of period-end portfolio loans, other real estate owned properties assets and other nonperforming assets were 0.65%, down 7 bps year over year.However, KeyCorp’s allowance for loan and lease losses was $881 million, up 1.3% from the prior-year quarter.Capital PositionKeyCorp's tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 8.22% as of Mar 31, 2018, down from 8.51% as of Mar 31, 2017. However, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 10.84%, up from 10.74% as of Mar 31, 2017.The company’s estimated Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 9.88% at the end of the quarter.Share RepurchasesDuring the reported quarter, KeyCorp repurchased $199 million worth of shares as part of its 2017 capital plan.Our TakeKeyCorp remains well positioned for growth in revenues, given rising rate environment and rise in loan and deposit balances. Improving credit quality and enhanced capital deployment activities are the other positives. Further, the corporate tax rate cut will aid profitability to some extent. However, persistently increasing expenses, owing to investments in franchise and acquisitions, are likely to hurt bottom-line growth. Further, the company's significant exposure toward risky loan portfolios remains a major concern.KeyCorp Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  KeyCorp Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | KeyCorp QuoteKeyCorp currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Further, net interest margin expanded 23 basis points (bps) year over year to 3.05%.Non-interest income climbed 6.7% year over year to $90.4 million. The rise in almost all components of income drove the results. These were partially offset by lower other non-interest income.Non-interest expenses flared up 7.7% on a year-over-year basis to $243.5 million. Rise in all components, except other non-interest expenses and amortization of other acquisition-related intangible assets, led to higher expenses.Efficiency ratio was 59.4%, in line with the prior-year period.As of Mar 31, 2018, total loans were $32.1 billion, up 8.1% from the prior-year quarter. Furthermore, total deposits increased approximately 7.9% to $32.9 billion from the year-ago quarter.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagAs of Mar 31, 2018, non-performing assets were $174 million, down 4.9% year over year.

The new dividend will be paid on May 15 to common shareholders of record as on May 1, 2018.Our ViewpointPeople’s United reported an impressive quarter. Organic growth was experienced with rising loans and deposit balances. Though escalating non-interest expenses are expected to restrict bottom-line expansion in the upcoming quarters, the company is steadily growing through acquisitions, which is likely to continue in the near future, given its strong balance-sheet position. People's United Financial, Inc.

Earnings per share of $1.38 outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Moreover, results compared favorably with 80 cents recorded in the prior-year quarter.Results were driven by rise in revenues. Organic growth was reflected, with significant rise in loans and deposit balances. However, elevated expenses and provisions were the undermining factors.Net income available to common stockholders came in at $69.5 million compared with $40.1 million recorded in the prior-year quarter.Revenues Rise, Loans & Deposits Go Up, Costs EscalateTotal revenues (net of interest expense) jumped 21.1% year over year to $230.2 million in the quarter, driven by higher net interest income and non-interest income. Furthermore, revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $225.4 million.Texas Capital’s net interest income was $210.3 million, up 28.7% year over year, mainly due to rise in loans held for investment, improved earning asset composition and loan yields. In addition, net interest margin expanded 42 basis points (bps) year over year to 3.71%. This resulted from improvement in loan yields, partially offset by high cost of deposits.Texas Capital’s non-interest income advanced 17% year over year to $19.9 million. The rise was primarily due to an increase in service charges, servicing income, wealth management and trust fee income, along with bank-owned life insurance income. These were partially offset by lower brokered loan fees, swap fees and other income.However, non-interest expenses flared up 20% year over year to $127 million. This mainly stemmed from rise in almost all components of expenses.As of Mar 31, 2018, total loans rose 22.2% year over year to $21.5 billion, while deposits climbed 13.3% year over year to $18.8 billion.Credit Quality: A Mixed QualityNon-performing assets totaled 0.65% of the loan portfolio, plus other real estate owned assets, reflecting a year-over-year contraction of 34 bps.

As of Mar 31, 2018, return on average equity was 13.39%, and return on average assets was 1.22% compared with 8.60% and 0.83%, respectively, recorded in the year-ago quarter. Tangible common equity to total tangible assets came in at 8.6% compared with 9% reported in the year-earlier quarter.Common equity Tier 1 ratio was 8.8% as compared with 9.6% in the prior-year quarter. Leverage ratio was 9.9% compared with 10.3% as of Mar 31, 2017.Stockholders’ equity was up 11% year over year to $2.3 billion as of Mar 31, 2018. The uptrend chiefly allied with retention of net income.Our ViewpointTexas Capital’s improved top line and a better balance sheet during the quarter impress us. However, bleak economic situation might hurt the company’s performance in the future. Though its inability to control expenses will likely impede near-term profitability, improvement in margin remains a favorable factor. Texas Capital Bancshares, Inc.

The figure recorded 31.1% surge from the year-ago quarter.Results reflected a slight rise in revenues and lower operating expenses. However, higher credit costs and a decline in loan balance were the undermining factors.Results excluded merger-related and restructuring charges. After considering these, net income available to common shareholders was $745 million or 94 cents per share, up from $378 million or 46 cents per share in the prior-year quarter.Revenues Grow Slightly, Expenses DeclineTotal revenues (taxable-equivalent) came in at $2.84 billion, up marginally year over year.

Net interest margin fell 2 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter to 3.44%.Non-interest income increased nearly 1% year over year to $1.18 billion. Higher investment banking and brokerage fees and commissions, and bankcard fees and merchant discounts were partly offset by decline in insurance income and mortgage banking income.Non-interest expenses of $1.69 billion fell 19.8% from the year-ago quarter. The decrease was mainly due to lower outside IT services costs and net merger-related and restructuring charges as well as absence of loss on early extinguishment of debt.BB&T’s adjusted efficiency ratio came in at 57.3%, down from 58.0% in the prior-year quarter. A fall in efficiency ratio indicates rise in profitability.As of Mar 31, 2018, total deposits were nearly $158.2 billion, up marginally from the prior quarter.

Also, expected growth in loans, along with an improving rate scenario, is likely to propel its organic growth trajectory in the quarters ahead. However, such acquisitions are expected to keep costs toward the higher end, which might hurt profitability to some extent.BB&T Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  BB&T Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | BB&T Corporation QuoteBB&T carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

235,CMA,"U.S. Bancorp’s (USB  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share of 95 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. The figure came ahead of the prior-year quarter earnings of 82 cents.The company’s top line benefitted from rise in net interest income on the back of easing margin pressure and higher fee income. Further, elevated average loans and deposit balances were tailwinds. However, escalating expenses and lower mortgage banking revenues remained major drags.After considering impacts of notable items, net income was $1.68 billion, up 13.7% year over year. Revenues, Loans & Deposits Rise, Costs IncreaseU.S. Bancorp’s net revenues came in at around $5.5 billion in the quarter, up 3.4% year over year. The increase in net interest income and non-interest income contributed to higher revenues. However, the top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.53 billion.U.S. Bancorp’s tax-equivalent net interest income totaled $3.2 billion in the quarter, up 5.5% from the prior-year quarter. The rise was mainly due to loan growth and rising interest rates, partially offset by deposit and funding mix.Average earning assets climbed 3.1% year over year, supported by growth in average total loans and average investment securities, along with elevated average other earning assets. Furthermore, net interest margin of 3.13% was up 7 basis points (bps) year over year, driven by higher interest rates. Higher funding costs, loan mix and elevated cash balances partially mitigated the rise in margins.U.S. Bancorp’s non-interest income increased slightly on a year-over-year basis to $2.3 billion. The rise was primarily due to higher payment services revenues, trust and investment management fees and deposit service charges, partially offset by lower mortgage banking and commercial products revenues.Provision for credit losses decreased 1.2% year over year to $341 million in the reported quarter.U.S. Bancorp’s average total loans climbed 2.3% year over year to $279.4 billion. The growth was backed by a rise in commercial loans, residential mortgages, credit card lending, total other retail and retail leasing. These increases were partially offset by a drop in commercial real estate.Average total deposits were up 1.9% from the prior-year quarter to $334.6 billion. The rise was due to growth in interest-bearing deposits, partly offset by lower non-interest-bearing deposits.Non-interest expenses rose 5% year over year to $3.1 billion, primarily due to higher compensation and employee benefits expenses, technology investment and seasonal marketing and development expenses, partially offset by lower professional services and other expenses. Credit Quality: A Mixed BagCredit metrics at U.S. Bancorp deteriorated in the reported quarter. Net charge-offs came in at $341 million, up nearly 1.8% year over year. On a year-over-year basis, the company experienced deterioration, mainly in net charge-offs in the credit card segment. Also, total allowance for credit losses was $4.4 billion, up 1.2%.However, non-performing assets came in at $1.2 billion, down 19.5% year over year. Capital PositionDuring the quarter under review, U.S. Bancorp maintained a decent capital position. Beginning Jan 1, 2018, the regulatory capital requirements fully reflected implementation of Basel III.The tier 1 capital ratio came in at 10.4%, down 6 bps from the prior-year quarter. Common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio under the Basel III standardized approach fully implemented was 9% as of Mar 31, 2018, compared with 9.5% in the year-ago quarter.All regulatory ratios of U.S. Bancorp continued to be in excess of well-capitalized requirements. In addition, based on the Basel III fully implemented advanced approach, the Tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted assets ratio was estimated at 11.5% as of Mar 31, 2018, compared with 11.8% as of Mar 31, 2017.The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 7.7% as of Mar 31, 2018, compared with 7.6% in prior-year quarter.U.S. Bancorp posted an improvement in book value per share, which increased to $26.54 as of Mar 31, 2018, from $25.05 recorded at the end of the year-earlier quarter. Capital Deployment UpdateReflecting the company’s capital strength during the first quarter, U.S. Bancorp returned 68% of earnings to its shareholders through common stock dividends and buybacks.ConclusionU.S. Bancorp posted a decent quarter. Elevated revenues on the back of increased lending activities and higher interest rates was a positive factor. Further, improving economy and lower taxes are likely to continue supporting its financials. Moreover, its efforts to enhance digital offerings and expand treasury management and payment services capabilities bode well for the long term.Nevertheless, weakness in the credit card portfolio adversely affected its asset quality. Additionally, there are concerns related to the impact of legal issues and the company’s global exposure. Also, escalating expenses remain a headwind. U.S. Bancorp Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise U.S. Bancorp Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | U.S. Bancorp QuoteU.S. Bancorp carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Including certain non-recurring items, earnings came in at $1.59. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was $1.49.Higher revenues and improved credit metrics were recorded.

Moreover, net interest margin expanded 56 basis points (bps) to 3.41%.Total adjusted non-interest income came in at $244 million, slightly down on a year-over-year basis. Lower card fees, commercial lending fees, bank-owned life insurance and other non-interest income were mostly offset by increased fiduciary income and brokerage fees.Further, adjusted non-interest expenses totaled $430 million, up 2.4% year over year. The rise was chiefly due to higher salaries and benefits expense, and restructuring charges.Notably, Growth in Efficiency and Revenue (GEAR Up) Initiative Implementation resulted in increased pre-tax income of 25%.Solid Balance SheetAs of Mar 31, 2018, total assets and common shareholders' equity were $72.3 billion and $8 billion, respectively, compared with $73 billion and $7.9 billion as of Mar 31, 2017.Total loans inched up 1.9% year over year to $49.2 billion.

Total risk-based capital ratio was 14.10%, up from 13.72% in the prior-year quarter.Capital Deployment UpdateComerica’s capital-deployment initiatives highlight the company’s capital strength. During the reported quarter, Comerica repurchased 1.6 million shares under its existing equity repurchase program. This, combined with dividends, resulted in a total payout of $201 million to shareholders.Impressive Outlook for 2018Comerica guided for 2018 as compared with 2017, taking into consideration the current economic and rate environment, along with the GEAR Up initiative, resulting in $270 million of benefits.The company anticipates higher net interest income, including the benefit of short-term rate increase and loan growth. Notably, full-year benefits from 2017 and first-quarter 2018 rate increases of $205-$215 million are expected.Non-interest income is estimated to be higher, reflecting an increase of 4% (excluding accounting-changes impact of $120 million and deferred compensation of $8 million). The rise is expected on the GEAR Up opportunities driving growth in treasury management and card fees, along with fiduciary and brokerage services.Non-interest expenses are predicted to be higher by 1%, excluding an estimated $25-$45 million restructuring expense and accounting changes impact of $120 million. Notably, additional $50 million in GEAR Up savings is expected.Restructuring charges of $47-$57 million is anticipated.

The outlook reflects rise across most lines of business, and stability in energy and corporate banking portfolios.Q2 2018 OutlookAverage loans are expected to be up sequentially due to seasonality, particularly in Mortgage Banker Finance.Net interest income is likely to escalate on full-quarter impact from first-quarter 2018 rate increase and the return of loan growth.Provision for credit losses are expected to be higher.Non-interest expenses are predicted to decrease moderately, mainly due to lower compensation expense.Our ViewpointThe consistent improvement in the loan portfolio is projected to offset the pressure on revenues to some extent. Further, the company will benefit from its ongoing strategic initiatives. Its robust capital position supports steady capital-deployment activities through share repurchases and dividend hikes which seem impressive. Though regulatory issues and rise in expenses remain major concerns, rising rates remained a tailwind. Comerica Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Comerica Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Comerica Incorporated QuoteCurrently, Comerica carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

However, elevated interest expense and reduced non-interest income with lower mortgage revenues were the undermining factors. Moreover, expenses soared.

238,CMA,"Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings, before the opening bell on Jul 13.After impressive first-quarter 2018 results, driven by consumer banking business and higher equity markets, volatility-driven trading revenues are expected to have remained flat year over year in the second quarter. Though the April-June quarter witnessed uncertainty, mainly related to the U.S.-China trade war and some other geo-political tensions, it was insufficient to aid strong trading.Per John Gerspach, chief financial officer (CFO) of Citigroup, ""From a trading revenue point of view, at the end of the first quarter, what we've indicated was that we would expect a normal seasonal slowdown in the second quarter. I'd say that, that is exactly what we're seeing right now in the results. That should mean then that we'll basically have flattish trading revenues.""Notably, the equities business is expected to have remained strong in the quarter to be reported, whereas the fixed income business might have experienced a disappointing performance. Further, benefits of higher rates, decent loan growth and relatively better performance of the other segments — mainly consumer banking — are anticipated to have offset the negatives.Other Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsConsumer Banking Revenues to Exhibit Growth: In consumer, management expects continued revenue growth in U.S. retail banking, retail services, Mexico and Asia in 2018. In U.S.-branded cards, excluding Hilton, continued underlying revenue growth is anticipated as loan balances are maturing as estimated. However, this would be mostly offset by the impact of additional partnership terms that went into effect this January. Moreover, the Hilton portfolio sale will likely have a year-over-year impact.Rising card revenues are expected to accelerate growth of overall Latin America Consumer revenues in 2018. Therefore, the to-be-reported quarter results are expected to reflect the trend.Investment Banking Fees to Report Modest Results: Investment banking performance is anticipated to have been flat in the second quarter. A rise in equity issuances across the globe might have gotten a boost from IPOs and follow-on offerings. Therefore, equity underwriting fees are projected to improve slightly. Also, increasing M&As will likely support banks’ advisory fees to some extent. These are, however, expected to be more than offset by lower debt origination fees, as rising rates will limit corporates’ involvement in these activities. Thus, Citigroup is also likely to report a decent quarter.Management expects market revenues to go along the overall operating environment. Nevertheless, a seasonal decline in trading revenues is predicted from the first quarter. Investment Banking revenues will likely have improved quarter over quarter, assuming favorable market conditions, and continued revenue growth in accrual businesses, TTS, Corporate Lending, Private Bank and Securities Services is anticipated on completion of targets across the global network.Lesser scope of cost containment: As the majority of unnecessary expenses have already been cut by the bank, expense reduction might not be a major support. Nonetheless, some legal settlements during the quarter might have impacted Citigroup’s earnings to an extent.Rise in Net Interest Income: In addition to higher interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending — particularly in the areas of commercial and industrial, real estate and consumer — might have perked up interest income.Credit Costs Might Impact Negatively: Cost of credit is likely to have risen, quarter on quarter, driven by the normalization of credit costs in ICG. Net credit-card losses are likely to have worsened. Citigroup expects NCL rate in the range of 300 basis points (bps) for 2018 and up to 325 bps over the medium term. In retail services, NCL rate is projected in the range of 500 bps for 2018 and up to 525 bps over the medium term.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Citigroup does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Citigroup is -1.7%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $1.53 comes in below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.55.Zacks Rank: Citigroup carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. But we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $1.55 reflects a 22.1% rise on a year-over-year basis.

240,CMA,"Over the last five trading days, performance of banking stocks was encouraging.

241,CMA,"Northern Trust Corporation’s (NTRS  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 results, scheduled for Apr 17, are expected to reflect a year-over-year rise in earnings and revenues.Notably, the company provides majority of its asset management services through the C&IS unit, which generates more than 50% of total revenues. A rise in revenues in this segment on the back of increased trading activities, will boost the company’s overall top line.Also, improved lending scenario, rising interest rates and bottom-line benefits from tax reform will provide further support to quarter’s results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.45 billion for sales for the to-be-reported quarter reflects a year-over-year improvement of 13%.Moreover, Northern Trust uses a lag effect to calculate its corporate custody and investment management fees, i.e. the computations are based on the prior quarter-end valuations. Since the performance of equity markets was relatively better in the first quarter, the company will likely be able to register growth in custody, servicing and management fees.Here are the other factors that might influence the company’s first-quarter performance:Modest Rise in Net Interest Income (NII): Overall loan growth remained decent in the quarter. Backed by improvement in loan balances, along with the effect of rising interest rates, Northern Trust is likely to record an increase in NII.Foreign Exchange Trading Revenues to Increase: Due to the rise in foreign exchange (FX) trading volatility and volumes, the company’s revenues from FX trading might increase.Custody Fees Might Rise: As Northern Trust uses lag effect in calculation of custody and investment management fees, expansion of three-month LIBOR rate along with higher trading activities are likely to drive related fees.Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, custody fees are likely to increase 23.1% to $379 million.Marginal Increase in Expenses: Though Northern Trust has a cost-saving initiatives underway, continued investments in new business activities and seasonally higher compensation expenses may lead to a marginal rise in expenses.Let’s have a look at what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model doesn’t conclusively show that Northern Trust will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time around, as it does not have the right combination of two key ingredients. Note that a stock with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better has significantly higher chances of beating estimates.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Northern Trust is -0.70%.Zacks Rank: The combination of Northern Trust’s Zacks Rank of 3 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.However, activities of the company during the quarter under review were able to win analysts’ confidence.

242,CMA,"Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report) has raised its quarterly common stock dividend by about 12.5% to 18 cents per share. The dividend will be paid on Jul 16 to shareholders of record as of Jun 29, 2018.Fifth Third’s robust business model reflects the company’s commitment toward returning value to shareholders with its strong cash-generation capabilities.

243,CMA,"The earnings season is knocking at the door and investors are keen to see how major banks have performed in the second quarter amid uncertainty related to the trade war fears.After impressive first-quarter 2018 results, major bank stocks’ performance lost some steam. The primary reason is the flattening of the yield curve. As such, net interest margin (one of the key metrics for gauging banks’ profitability) is expected to be subdued in the second quarter.Also, growth in trading revenues, which was one of the main supporting factors during the first quarter, is likely to be muted. Though the second quarter witnessed uncertainty mainly related to the U.S.-China trade war and some other geo-political tensions, it wasn’t sufficient.Further, investment banking performance is anticipated to be flat. A rise in equity issuances across the globe might have gotten a boost from IPOs and follow-on offerings. Therefore, equity underwriting fees are projected to improve slightly. Also, increasing M&As will likely support banks’ advisory fees to some extent. These are, however, expected to be more than offset by lower debt origination fees, as rising rates will limit corporates’ involvement in these activities.Dismal mortgage banking performance is also expected to continue in the second quarter amid rising interest rates as mortgage originations and volume declined.Nevertheless, a decent improvement in lending, particularly in the areas of commercial and industrial, and consumer will offer support banks’ interest income while weakness in revolving home equity loans is expected to persist.Further, asset quality is anticipated to remain strong, backed by an improving economy and conservative underwriting standards.Increased investment in technology to strengthen digital offerings and initiatives to expand into newer areas are expected to result in a slight rise in expenses. But, increase in overall non-operating expenses is likely to be manageable.Further, passage of the new law to lessen banks’ regulatory burden and lower tax rates will support bottom-line growth.Hence, major banks on the S&P 500 Index (accounting for nearly 45% of the Zacks Finance sector'stotal earnings) are expected to witness 8.2% year-over-year earnings growth in the to-be-reported quarter. Yet, this compares unfavorably with 25.4% growth recorded in the prior quarter.(For detailed look at the earnings outlook for this industry and others, please read our Earnings Preview article).Picking the Potential WinnersWhile the upcoming results are not likely to be impressive, there are still a few major banks that are expected to outshine their peers. So, this is the right time for you to select some banking stocks that are well positioned to beat earnings estimates in their upcoming releases.Choosing stocks with earnings beat potential might be a difficult task unless one knows the process to shortlist. One way to do it is by picking stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank — Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — and a positive Earnings ESP.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in their upcoming earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.5 Major Banks Set for Earnings SurprisesHere are five major bank stocks that have the right combination of elements to deliver positive earnings surprises in their upcoming announcements:JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Jul 13.

244,CMA,"Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) can be a solid bet now on the back of its focus on revenue-enhancing initiatives which will likely drive operational efficiency. Further, the company is expected to benefit from a strong capital position, easing margin pressure and loan growth in the near term.Growth in Efficiency and Revenue Initiative or “GEAR Up” initiatives, rising rates, steady fee income and robust capital-deployment activities continue to drive Comerica’s performance. However, escalating expenses on technological developments remain concerns.The company recorded a gain 4.8% over the past six months compared with 5.3% decline recorded by the industry.Further, the company’s earnings estimates moved around 1% upward, for the current year, over the past 30 days. As a result, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).In mid-2016, Comerica launched “GEAR Up” initiatives in order to drive revenue growth, and reduce expenses by identifying and analyzing areas with room for improvement. Notably, execution of these initiatives resulted in increased pre-tax income of 25% in first-quarter 2018. Further, such initiatives are anticipated to deliver annual pre-tax income of about $270 million by year-end 2018, and additional benefits in pre-tax income of $35 million in 2019 and beyond.Moreover, the company remains well poised to benefit from the rising rate environment. The consistently increasing loans balance over the past years has supported margin expansion to an extent. Management expects average loan growth to be in line with Gross Domestic Product growth in 2018.Comerica continues to enhance shareholders’ value through steady capital-deployment activities. The successful clearance of the Fed stress test in 2018 indicates that Comerica is well positioned to weather any severe economic downturn. Furthermore, it awaits regulatory approvals for rewarding shareholders with dividends or potential share buybacks under the 2018 capital plan.However, volatile non-interest expenses remain a concern. Additionally, management expects expenses to flare up 1% in 2018, as it continues to invest in technological developments. Furthermore, Comerica’s significant exposure to commercial loans (nearly 63% of the total loans) keeps us apprehensive.Stocks to ConsiderCullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.

247,CMA,"BlackRock, Inc. (BLK  -  Free Report) intends to acquire 30% stake of Intesa SanPaolo's asset management unit, per Reuters. According to sources familiar with the matter, BlackRock views the deal as an acquisition rather than an investment and it aims to extend its influence over the second-biggest fund house in Italy.One of the sources informed, “BlackRock is the natural buyer for Eurizon. They will take a stake and use it as a Trojan horse to plug in their IT systems and control the operational side of the business.”Eurizon, which operates in Italy as well as Eastern Europe and Asia, has nearly €315 billion in assets under management (AUM). It is one of the most efficient asset managers in Europe and has a cost-income ratio of 20%.Over the past several months, Intesa has been looking for options for Eurizon and to do so, it has been working with UBS Group AG (UBS  -  Free Report), according to sources.Intesa’s plan has been to look for such deals with global asset managers, which would open more options for other smaller or similar-sized companies for partnerships. When in February, Intesa stated that it wishes to establish a partnership with an asset manager, its CEO, Carlo Messina informed that it is best to come to a decision as quickly as possible so that an agreement is reached upon by this year.However, recently, in Venice, Messina revealed that Intesa is still in the early stages to look for an investor in Eurizon.Notably, Intesa does not want to give up its control of the unit and hence, does not plan to sell more than 30% of Eurizon. However, if BlackRock acquires 30% stake of Eurizon, Intesa’s desire to establish accords with other partners is not going to be accomplished and those deals will only translate into commercial partnerships.Nevertheless, this deal will be beneficial for Intesa as it will help drive growth at Eurizon. Tommaso Corcos, the CEO of Eurizon informed, “Size will matter more and more.""Notably, since Intesa’s main source of revenues is from its asset management business, it targets to receive nearly €10 billion in fees in 2021, which would account for 48% of its total operating income.Being the largest asset manager in the United States, BlackRock’s main aim is to further enhance its technological capabilities. The company wants to integrate its global satellites onto its operating system Aladdin.With a strong global presence, broad product diversification, revenue mix and steadily improving AUM, its revenues are expected to improve further.

248,CMA,"Higher interest rates along with robust loan and deposit growth aid KeyCorp (KEY  -  Free Report). Given a solid capital position, the company is expected to continue enhancing shareholder value through efficient capital deployment activities.However, the company’s significant exposure to risky loan portfolios might curb its growth in the near term.

250,CMA,"The Finance sector was one of the best performers in the Q1 earnings season. Despite rising chances of political uncertainty, we can add some banking stocks to our portfolio based on the banks’ strong fundamentals and solid long-term prospects. Moreover, easing of regulations, financial stability and tax reform are expected to yield improved profitability for banks.With organic and inorganic growth strategies, as well as a robust capital position, M&T Bank Corporation (MTB  -  Free Report) appears to be one such stock. The company’s focus on the most attractive business mixes in the banking industry to tackle macroeconomic headwinds and strategic priorities, including core technology infrastructure, is anticipated to yield positive results for the stock.M&T Bank beat estimates in the first quarter, though the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged for 2018, over the last 30 days. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 inched up, reflecting analysts’ optimism about the company’s future prospects, during the same time frame.Further, shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have gained around 9.6% over the past year compared with 12.8% growth recorded by the industry it belongs to.Notably, M&T Bank has a number of other aspects which make it an attractive investment option.Why M&T Bank is a Must Buy  Revenue Growth: M&T Bank continues to make steady progress toward bolstering its revenues. Since 2008, the company has recorded a continued rise in net interest income. Over the past five years (ended December 2017), it has grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of nearly 9%, with the trend continuing in the first quarter of 2018 as well.The company’s projected sales growth (F1/F0) of 4.47% indicates constant upward momentum in revenues.Earnings Per Share Strength: Earnings are anticipated to display an upswing in the near term, as the company’s projected EPS growth (F1/F0) is 33.41% compared to the industry average rate of 31.28%. Also, M&T Bank recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 3.96%, over the trailing four quarters.Inorganic Growth Routes: Given its robust liquidity position, M&T Bank is well positioned to grow on the back of acquisitions. The growth has been reflected in the company’s accomplishment of several major acquisitions in and out of the United States, in the past several years. The completion of the merger with Hudson City in November 2015 expanded the company’s retail branch network in the Eastern United States, with access to 135 Hudson branches, situated primarily in New Jersey. Furthermore, product and balance-sheet diversification, stemming from the acquisition, will likely support the company’s top line.Steady Capital Deployment: M&T Bank’s capital-deployment activities remain impressive. The company’s 2017 capital plan was approved by the Fed. The plan included share buyback of up to $900 million over the four-quarter period, effective July 2017. Notably, in February 2018, it announced an additional share buyback plan of up to $745 million. The latest quarterly common stock dividend hike was 7% in May 2018. Notably, the bank has cleared the 2018 stress test and awaits capital plan approval.Stock is Undervalued: The stock currently has a Value Score of B.

253,CMA,"Volatility is back in the markets, resulting in higher trading activities. This is expected to benefit Bank of America’s (BAC  -  Free Report) first-quarter results, slated to be released on Apr 16, given the significant dependence of its top line on trading revenues.After three consecutive quarters of witnessing muted activities, the markets experienced considerable volatility in the last two months of the first quarter. In fact, February was one of the most volatile months since 2008, and March 2018 was even worse.Last year, trading activities remained weak despite several political and geopolitical developments, hike in interest rates, passage of the tax act and absence of significant progress on the regulatory reforms proposed by the Trump administration. Subdued inflation in the United States and modest rise in long-term interest rates along with lack of specific catalysts were concerns.These factors resulted in lower fixed income trading, while equity trading also didn’t fare better.Nonetheless, concerns over trade war between the United States and China, higher inflation expectation in the United States, further tightening of monetary policy by the Fed and a sharp sell-off in the tech sector incited significant volatility during the first quarter.Hence, in the to-be-reported quarter, both fixed income trading and equity trading revenues are anticipated to increase.Overall Earnings & Revenue Growth ExpectationsNotably for BofA, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 59 cents reflects 43.9% surge on a year-over-year basis.

254,CMA,"M&T Bank Corporation (MTB  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 16, before the opening bell. The company’s revenues and earnings are expected to improve from the year-ago quarter.The bank’s bottom line is expected to benefit from lower tax rates as it is likely to have retained a remarkable part of its revenues. Also, improvements in the lending scenario and a rise in consumer confidence were some other positives. Further, heightened volatility during the quarter due to U.S.-China trade war tensions is expected to have boosted the top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $1.42 billion indicates a 4.5% year-over-year improvement.Before we discuss why an earnings beat might be in store, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the prior quarter.M&T Bank’s fourth-quarter 2017 results were supported by higher revenues along with lower provisions for credit losses. The company also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate due to these factors. However, rise in expenses was a negative.The bank delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 4.8%.Over the past year, shares of M&T Bank have gained 27.3%, outperforming 22.1% growth recorded by the industry.M&T Bank Corporation Price and EPS Surprise M&T Bank Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | M&T Bank Corporation QuoteWill the upcoming earnings release give a boost to M&T Bank’s stock? This depends largely on whether the firm is able to deliver a positive earnings surprise.Why a Positive Surprise is LikelyAccording to our quantitative model, chances of M&T Bank beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for M&T Bank is +0.15%.Zacks Rank: M&T Bank carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This, when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of a positive earnings surprise.Notably, per the consensus estimate, M&T Bank’s earnings for the quarter are expected to increase 27.4% from the prior-year quarter to $2.74.Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsNet Interest Income (NII) to Improve: The quarter witnessed a moderate improvement in the lending scenario primarily due to rise in consumer confidence and increase in loan demand to some extent, owing to the tax reform. Thus, loan growth combined with a rise in interest rates are likely to boost M&T Bank’s NII.Relatively Stable Fee Income: The first quarter was exceptionally good for trading activities due to increased volatility, thanks to escalated tariff tensions between the United States and China, rise in prices of necessities and a sharp sell-off in the tech sector. Further, rise in advisory and underwriting fees on the back of higher M&A activities and equity issuances are likely to provide some support its top line.However, the debt originations remained low during the quarter and the related fees are expected to remain muted. Also, with the rising interest rate environment, no major help is expected from the mortgage banking segment. As refinancing activities slowed down during the quarter, mortgage banking revenues are not expected to witness much improvement.Expenses to Trend Higher: Expenses are expected to trend higher in the upcoming release due to the company’s continued investments in several areas including operational infrastructure and technology. Also, M&T Bank witnessed increase in compensation expenses in the first quarter.Activities of M&T Bank during the quarter were adequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter has been revised nearly 1% upward over the last seven days.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few finance stocks that you may want to consider, as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter, according to our model.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release results on Apr 17.

255,CMA,"The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 16, before market open. Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.Last quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenue growth, no provisions and a significant rise in total client assets, and new brokerage accounts were among the positives. However, higher expenses and a decrease in trading revenues remained headwinds.Moreover, the company has an impressive earnings surprise history as its earnings did not lag the Zacks Consensus Estimate in any of the trailing four quarters. It delivered an average positive surprise of nearly 3.8%.The Charles Schwab Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  The Charles Schwab Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | The Charles Schwab Corporation QuoteHowever, activities of Schwab during the first quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. Thus, over the last 30 days, its Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings remained unchanged at 53 cents. Nevertheless, it reflects a year-over-year improvement of 35.9%.Notably, Schwab’s fundamental strength has helped its shares gain 35.7% in the past year, outperforming 31.2% growth recorded by the industry.Will the stock’s rally continue post first-quarter earnings release? Let’s see how things are shaping up.A Likely Positive Surprise?According to our quantitative model, it is quite likely that Schwab will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first quarter. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to be confident of an earnings surprise call.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Schwab is +0.31%.Zacks Rank: Schwab currently has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsOverall trading activities remained strong during the quarter, driven by significant market volatility, specifically in the months of February and March. Notably, Schwab opened 165,000 and 138,000 new brokerage accounts in January and February, respectively, indicating that investors were interested in entering the market. Also, the company’s efforts toward lowering trading fees should have helped in adding more brokerage accounts. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for active brokerage accounts for the first quarter is 10,936, which reflects year-over-year improvement of 6%.Thus, with growth in brokerage accounts, Schwab’s trading revenues might have witnessed improvement in the quarter.Further, Schwab witnessed a rise in total client assets and average interest-earning assets in January and February on a year-over-year basis. This should reflect in the company’s results for the entire quarter.In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total client assets for the quarter is $3.5 trillion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 18.8%. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets for the quarter is $233 billion, which is expected to grow 7.4% year over year. Hence, higher assets, along with improvement in the rate scenario, should help Schwab experience higher net interest revenues during the quarter.Improvement in the two most important components of Schwab’s revenues should support overall revenue growth in the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the to-be-reported quarter is $2.34 billion, which reflects growth of 12.7% year over year.However, Schwab’s operating expenses have remained elevated for the past few quarters. Moreover, because of higher compensation and benefits cost, overall expenses are expected to remain high in the first quarter.Other Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few other finance stocks that you may want to consider, as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter, according to our model.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release results on Apr 17.

256,CMA,"The Q1 earnings season is just around the corner and investors are eagerly awaiting the major bank results, which have remained in the spotlight throughout the quarter for a number of reasons.The quarter witnessed investors’ anxiety on uncertainty over the number of rate hikes on upbeat economic numbers and rising inflation, which pulled the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond yields down. This somewhat reversed the rally experienced by bank stocks since last September. Moreover, Trump’s trade-tariff announcements on Chinese imports affected the stock market rally in the quarter.After three straight quarters of muted activities, it appears that volatility is back in the markets, as seen in both February and March. This indicates higher trading activities and increased trading revenues, primarily for big banks.Notably, the first-quarter earnings are expected to report decent numbers as compared with the last quarter (impacted by huge one-time charges related to the tax law reform), with a rising interest-rate environment aiding net interest margins — the backbone for banks’ top-line growth.In addition to the benefits from the rising interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending will likely energize interest income for banks. Per the Federal Reserve’s latest data, loans are predicted to improve slightly on a sequential basis in the to-be-reported quarter. Particularly, weakness in revolving home equity loans might offset growth in commercial and industrial (C&I), consumer and overall real estate loans to some extent.Therefore, major banks in the S&P 500 index (accounting for nearly 45% of the Zacks Finance Sector'stotal earnings) are projected to witness 11.1% year-over-year jump in earnings in the quarter to be reported. This comes in higher than 2.7% growth recorded in the prior quarter.(For detailed look at the earnings outlook for this industry and others, please read our Earnings Preview article.)The trend of earning solid advisory and underwriting fees for debt and equity issuance might reverse in the first quarter, as rising rates will limit corporates’ involvement in these activities. As debt origination fees typically account for about half of total investment banking fees, this could deal a blow to the banks.However, strong equity issuances globally might have got boosted from IPOs and follow-on offerings. So, equity underwriting fees are projected to increase. Also, a potential rise in fees from increasing M&A’s in certain sectors will likely help banks garner advisory fees.Further, credit quality is anticipated to remain strong, backed by an improving economy and conservative underwriting standards.Expense reduction, which has helped banks to remain profitable, is not expected to be a major support, as banks have already slashed the majority of unnecessary expenses. While the absence of considerable legal expenses since the last few quarters is encouraging, increased investments in technology to improve digital offerings might escalate costs moderately.Selecting the WinnersWith the upcoming results likely to be impressive, there are a few major banks that are expected to stand out this earnings season. Therefore, this is the right time for you to select some banking stocks that are well positioned to beat earnings estimates in their upcoming releases.Choosing stocks with earnings beat potential might be a difficult task unless one knows the process to shortlist. One way to do it is by picking stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank — Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) — and a positive Earnings ESP.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in their upcoming earnings announcement.

This will have a positive impact on its earnings, which is expected to be slightly hit by muted investment banking performance.After three consecutive quarters of muted activities, the markets witnessed significant volatility and revival of client activities in the last two months of the first quarter. In fact, February was one of the most volatile months since 2008, and March 2018 was even worse.Last year, trading activities remained weak despite several political and geopolitical developments, hike in interest rates, passage of the tax act and absence of significant progress on the regulatory reforms proposed by the Trump administration. Subdued inflation in the United States and modest rise in long-term interest rates were concerns. These factors resulted in lower fixed income trading while equity trading didn’t fare better either.Nonetheless, concerns over trade war between the United States and China, higher inflation expectation in the United States, further tightening of monetary policy by the Fed and a sharp sell-off in the tech sector incited significant volatility during the first quarter.Notably, equity trading revenues are expected to witness substantial growth in the to-be-reported quarter compared with fixed income trading revenues as Morgan Stanley had divested fixed income trading operations over the last few years.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for equity trading revenues of $2.14 billion reflects a rise of 6% from the year-ago quarter. On the other hand, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fixed income trading revenues of $1.70 billion indicates a decline of nearly 1% from the prior-year quarter.Overall, first-quarter trading revenues are expected to be $3.78 billion, up 8.2% year over year.Here are the other factors that are expected to influence Morgan Stanley’s first-quarter results:Modest rise in net interest income (NII): Rise in interest rates will likely lead to an increase in interest income. Also, overall loan demand was decent — particularly in the areas of commercial and industrial and real estate. So, NII is anticipated to witness a modest improvement.A slight fall in underwriting fees: Unlike prior quarters, growth in underwriting fees, consisting of debt and equity underwriting, is expected to be muted. Rising interest rates are likely to have slowed down corporates’ involvement in debt issuances. As debt origination fees account for more than 50% of total underwriting fees for Morgan Stanley, this will likely have an adverse impact on overall underwriting fees. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for debt underwriting fees of $520 million reflects a year-over-year fall of 2.1%.Further, high volatility in the equity markets across the globe is expected to have somewhat slowed down equity issuances. While fourth-quarter 2017 was an exception, IPOs and follow-on offerings in the to-be-reported quarter are likely to be modest. Thus, equity underwriting fees are anticipated to remain stable or improve marginally. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for equity underwriting fees of $381 million reflects a decrease of 2.3% from the prior-year quarter.All in all, total underwriting fees are projected to witness a 2.1% year-over-year decline as the consensus estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is $901 million.Advisory fees to show weakness: M&A activity in terms of deals closed globally witnessed a fall in the first quarter, though the overall deal value recorded a significant rise. Thus, as number of deals declined, advisory fees are expected to be adversely impacted to some extent. So, Morgan Stanley is not likely to remain untouched. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for advisory fees is $476 million, down 4% year over year.Expense control to support bottom line: Morgan Stanley’s cost savings plan — Project Streamline — is likely to result in lower expenses during the quarter. Nevertheless, as revenues are expected to rise, compensation expenses will likely witness a slight increase.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:We cannot conclusively predict an earnings beat for Morgan Stanley this time. This is because the stock does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Morgan Stanley is 0.00%.Zacks Rank: Morgan Stanley carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. But we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.Morgan Stanley Price and EPS Surprise  Morgan Stanley Price and EPS Surprise | Morgan Stanley QuoteNotably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $1.28 cents reflects a 28% jump on a year-over-year basis.

258,CMA,"The earnings season seems to have gotten off to a decent start with the banking giants reporting improved earnings and revenues so far. These big banks’ top line was supported by increasing loan balances, expanding net interest margin due to higher interest rates and boost in trading revenues due to improved volatility.Per our latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for five of the 98 Finance Sector companies on the S&P 500 (accounting 23.7% of the total market cap) that have reported earnings so far, have increased 20.4% from year-ago quarter on 6.9% higher revenue growth.Further, for the first quarter as a whole, earnings of the finance sector are expected to be up 22.7% year over year on 4.7% higher revenues.Earnings releases will be coming in thick this week with Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) and Northern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report), scheduled to report on Apr 17, before the opening bell.Let’s have a look at what can be expected from these two Major Regional Banks when they report first-quarter 2018 earnings.ComericaComerica’s earnings are expected to be $1.49, reflecting 34.2% improvement from the last-year quarter.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is $811.6 million, 9.5% higher than the prior-year quarter. Rise in loans along with a favorable interest rate environment is likely to benefit the bank’s net interest income (NII). Fee income is expected to benefit from higher volume of M&A and improved equity markets, partially offset by poor mortgage activities during the quarter.Nevertheless, the tax reform is expected to benefit its results. Also, since credit quality trend remained benign during first quarter, the consensus estimate reflects a decline of 21.3% and 19.8% in non-performing assets and non-performing loans, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.Also, our quantitative model predicts an earnings beat for Comerica as it has an Earnings ESP of +0.95% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.(Read more: Why an Earnings Beat is Likely for Comerica in Q1)The story about Comerica’s impressive earnings surprise history is better told by the chart below:Comerica Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Comerica Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Comerica Incorporated Quote Northern TrustThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for to-be-reported quarter earnings reflects a year-over-year improvement of 30.3%.Also, Northern Trust is expected to record a rise in revenues in the first quarter supported by higher interest and fee income. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $1.45 billion shows 13% year-over-year growth.As Northern Trust incorporates a lag effect while calculating fees for custody and investment management, expansion of three-month LIBOR rate during the quarter is likely to drive related fees. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, custody fees are likely to increase 23.1% to $379 million. Further, with the improvement in foreign exchange (FX) backdrop, the company’s revenues from FX trading might increase.However, the company’s expenses are expected to trend upward due to its investments in new business activities and seasonally higher compensation expenses.Also, our quantitative model predicts that the chances of an earnings beat for Northern Trust are low. The stock has Earnings ESP of -0.10% and a Zacks Rank #3.

259,CMA,"The Blackstone Group L.P. (BX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Apr 19. While the company’s asset under management (AUM) growth is expected to remain strong in the quarter, its revenues and earnings are projected to decline on a year-over-year basis.Last quarter, the company’s economic net income surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Higher revenues and growth in AUM were partially offset by rise in expenses.Notably, Blackstone boasts an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 10.2%.The Blackstone Group L.P. Price and EPS Surprise  The Blackstone Group L.P. Price and EPS Surprise | The Blackstone Group L.P. QuoteHowever, activities of the company in the first quarter failed to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, its Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 76 cents remained unchanged over the last 30 days. Also, the figure reflects a year-over-year decline of 7.3%.In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $1.69 billion for the quarter also reflects a decline of 12.7% from the year-ago quarter.Also, the company’s price performance does not seem very impressive. Its shares have gained only 5% in the past year, underperforming the 14.9% rally of the industry it belongs to.Will the price performance improve post Q1 earnings release? Let’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Earnings WhispersAccording to our quantitative model, it cannot be conclusively predicted if Blackstone will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first quarter. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Blackstone is 0.00%.Zacks Rank: Blackstone has a Zacks Rank of 3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. But we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsDriven by net inflows, the company’s fee-earning AUM and total AUM have been witnessing consistent growth since the past few years. In fact, with improvement in the overall economic scenario, Blackstone’s fund-raising ability is likely to continue aiding the uptrend in its fee-earning AUM and total AUM in the quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fee-earning AUM for the to-be-reported quarter is $341 billion, which reflects an improvement of 1.8% sequentially. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total AUM of $450 billion depicts 3.7% growth from the prior quarter and 22.3% growth year over year.Given the growth in assets, the company’s performance fee is also expected to be positively impacted in the quarter.However, because of rise in compensation and benefit costs, the company’s overall expenses have remained elevated in the past few years. Moreover, as its well-performing funds require more headcount, expenses are likely to increase further during the quarter.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release results on Apr 17.

260,CMA,"Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Apr 17. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.The improving economic backdrop — reflecting lower commercial tax, rise in consumer spending and decent lending scenario — is likely to support Comerica’s results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $811.6 million for the first quarter reflects year-over-year growth of 9.5%.Before we discuss why an earnings beat might also be in store, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the prior quarter.Comerica’s fourth-quarter 2017 results reflected an increase in revenues supported by easing margin pressure and higher fee income. Also, strong capital position and improving credit quality were the positives. However, higher expenses and a fall in loan balance were the key headwinds.Notably, the company boasts an impressive earnings surprise history. It surpassed earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 8%.The positive earnings surprises along with fundamental strength helped Comerica’s shares gain 45.6% over the past year, outperforming the industry’s 19.3% rally. Comerica Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Comerica Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Comerica Incorporated QuoteA Surprise in Store?Our proven model shows that Comerica has the right combination of the two key ingredients —positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat in the first quarter.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Comerica is +0.95%.Zacks Rank: Comerica carries a Zacks Rank of 3.Though estimates for the to-be-reported quarter have remained stable over the last seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $1.49 reflects growth of 34.2% year over year.Factors to Drive the ResultsNet Interest Income to Rise: Comerica’s net interest income is likely to improve in the to-be-reported quarter supported by expanding net interest margin and decent loan growth.Higher Fee Income: Trend of consumer spending was strong during the first quarter, which is likely to boost Comerica’s non-interest income. Also, investment banking and equity markets were decent due to higher volumes of M&As. Thus, the related fees are expected to increase marginally.Lower Mortgage Banking Revenues: The company is likely to continue witnessing lower revenues from this division owing to slowdown in refinancing activities caused by rising interest rates.Credit Quality Might Improve: The quarter continued to witness benign credit quality trends. Also, Moody’s Investors Service has projected a favorable credit environment for the banks in 2018.

261,CMA,"Amid an expected weakness in investment banking, strong trading results, higher rates and lower tax rate drove JPMorgan’s (JPM  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings of $2.37 per share, which handily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.28. The reported figure was up 44% from the prior-year quarter.Results in the reported quarter included 11 cents per share of mark-to-market gains related to the adoption of new recognition and measurement accounting guidance for certain equity investments previously held at cost.Shares of JPMorgan rose nearly 1.4% in the pre-market trading, indicating that investors have taken the results in their stride. Notably, the full-day trading session will depict a better picture.Decent loan growth (driven mainly by improved wholesale loans) and higher interest rates aided net interest income growth. Further, higher equity trading income (up 26%) and fixed income trading (up 8%) supported the top line. Additionally, mortgage banking income witnessed a rise, driven by growth in residential mortgage loans, partially offset by fall in mortgage origination volume.Apart from these, the reported quarter recorded a decrease in provision for credit losses, mainly attributable to reserve release in Wholesale portfolio.As expected, investment banking performance slumped during the quarter. While advisory fees witnessed a modest rise, both equity and debt underwriting fees declined. Further, higher operating expenses was an undermining factor.The overall performance of JPMorgan’s business segments, in terms of net income generation, was decent. All segments, except Corporate, reported a rise in net income on a year-over-year basis.Among other positives, credit card sales volume was up 12% and merchant processing volume grew 15%. Further, Commercial Banking average core loan balances grew 6% and Asset Management average core loan balances rose 12%.Net income was up 35% year over year to $8.7 billion.Revenues Aided by Trading, Higher Rates & Loan GrowthNet revenues as reported were $27.9 billion in the quarter, up 12% from the year-ago quarter. Also, it topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $27.8 billion. Rising rates, loan growth and increase in trading revenues were the main reasons for the improvement. These were partially offset by lower investment banking revenues.Non-interest expenses (on managed basis) were $16.1 billion, up 8% from the year-ago quarter. The rise was primarily due to higher compensation expenses and auto loan depreciation.Credit Quality ImprovesProvision for credit losses declined 11% year over year to $1.2 billion, primarily due to reserve release in Wholesale loan portfolio, partially offset by higher net charge-offs in Card.Also, as of Mar 31, 2018, non-performing assets were $6.4 billion, down 7% from the year-ago period. Also, net charge-offs were down 19% year over year to $1.3 billion.Strong Capital PositionTier 1 capital ratio (estimated) was 13.5% as of Mar 31, 2018 compared with 14.1% as of Mar 31, 2017. Tier 1 common equity capital ratio (estimated) was 11.8% as of Mar 31, 2018, down from 12.4% as of Mar 31, 2017. Total capital ratio came in at 15.3% (estimated) as of Mar 31, 2018 compared with 15.6% as of Mar 31, 2017.Book value per share was $67.59 as of Mar 31, 2018 compared with $64.68 as of Mar 31, 2017. Tangible book value per common share came in at $54.05 as of Mar 31, 2018 compared with $52.04 as of Mar 31, 2017.Bottom LineContinued improvement in loans and higher interest rates are expected to continue supporting JPMorgan’s revenues. With the Fed expected to continue raising rates, the company’s interest income will likely increase. Also, gains from lower tax rates will aid profitability.However, slowdown in mortgage business are likely to continue in the near term for JPMorgan. Also, rise in operating expenses makes us apprehensive.JPMorgan Chase & Co. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  JPMorgan Chase & Co. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Moreover, the bottom line reflected a 24% increase from the prior-year quarter.Continued easing of pressure on net interest margin helped the company earn higher net interest income during the quarter. Though mortgage banking revenues declined, overall non-interest income witnessed year-over-year growth. However, higher expenses hurt results to some extent.

Also, net interest margin increased 14 basis points to 2.91%.Non-interest income was up 2% year over year to $1.75 billion, driven by higher asset management income, consumer services income, service charges on deposits and other income, partially offset by lower income from residential mortgage.PNC Financial’s non-interest expenses were $2.53 billion, increasing 5% from the year-ago quarter. The rise was primarily due to higher personnel costs.As of Mar 31, 2018, total loans rose 1% sequentially to $221.6 billion.

263,CMA,"The PNC Financial Services Group (PNC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 13, before the opening bell. Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.Organic growth remains a key strength for PNC Financial. The quarter witnessed a rise in consumer confidence, which led to loan growth. Also, the rising interest rates came as an added advantage for the bank.Moreover, PNC Financial’s bottom line is expected to benefit from lower tax rates as it is likely to have retained a remarkable part of its revenues. Also, improved M&A and equity underwriting activities during the quarter are likely to drive fee income. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $4.15 billion indicates a 6.8% year-over-year improvement.Before we discuss the factors that might impact PNC Financial’s first-quarter results, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the prior quarter.PNC Financial’s fourth-quarter 2017 results improved primarily due to growth in loan balances and higher fee income. These factors also helped it in beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the positives were partially offset by higher expenses and provision for loan losses.Notably, the company delivered positive earnings surprises in each of the trailing four quarters, with an impressive average beat of 4.1%.The earnings beat translated into improved price performance. Over the past year, shares of PNC Financial have gained 32.7%, outperforming the 21.8% growth recorded by the industry.Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsNet Interest Income to Grow: PNC Financial might report higher interest income as the quarter continued to witness rise in interest rates and improvement in lending scenario. The U.S. consumer sentiment reached its highest level since 2004 during the quarter along with the unemployment rate remaining at record low levels. Such factors are likely to have led to upbeat lending activities.Also, the company’s net interest margin (NIM) is likely to expand with support from two rate hikes since December 2017. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, NIM is expected to expand 15 basis points to 2.92%, year over year.Notably, the consensus estimate for net interest income is projected to be $2.34 billion, up 8.4% year over year.Controlled Expenses: The company has a cost-saving program in place for the year to keep expenses under control. Also, management expects non-interest expenses to be down by low-single digits on a sequential basis.Lower Mortgage Banking Revenues: The company is likely to continue witnessing lower revenues from this division owing to slowdown in refinancing activities caused by rising interest rates. Per the consensus estimate, residential mortgage revenues are likely to decline 9.7% to $102 million in the first quarter, on a year-over-year basis.Non-Interest Income Might Rise: As the first quarter was decent in terms of investment banking and equity underwriting business due to higher volumes of M&As, the related fees are expected to increase marginally.However, debt underwriting activities during the quarter were not encouraging, so the related fees are likely to remain muted.Let’s have a look at what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model doesn’t conclusively show that PNC Financial will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time around, as it does not have the right combination of two key ingredients. Note that a stock with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better has significantly higher chances of beating estimates.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for PNC Financial is 0.00%.Zacks Rank: PNC Financial carries a Zacks Rank of 3.Nevertheless, with earnings estimates for the first quarter been revised slightly upward over the last 30 days, the company is expected to witness 23.5% year-over-year earnings growth.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few finance stocks that you may want to consider, as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter, according to our model.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release results on Apr 17.

264,CMA,"After three consecutive quarters of witnessing muted activities, volatility is back in the market. This is expected to result in improvement in Bank of America’s (BAC  -  Free Report) trading revenues in first-quarter 2018. As trading revenues constitute an important part of the bank’s top line, this is expected to lead the company to report improved results on Apr 16.In the last two months of the first quarter, the markets experienced considerable volatility. In fact, February was one of the most volatile months since 2008, and March 2018 was even worse. The trade war between the United States and China, higher inflation expectation, tightening of monetary policy by the Fed and a sharp sell-off in the tech sector incited volatility during the quarter.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Global Markets segment (under which trading revenues are accounted for) revenues of $4.64 billion reflects a jump of 36.8% from the prior quarter.Here are the other factors that are likely influence BofA’s Q1 results:Steady improvement in net interest income: In addition to higher interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending — particularly in the areas of commercial and industrial, real estate and consumer — will likely result in an increase in net interest income (NII).Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets of $1.96 trillion for the first quarter indicates a marginal sequential improvement. This, along with decent lending activities and higher interest rates, is projected to further boost BofA’s NII in the quarter.Management expects NII, in the first quarter, to benefit from the rate hike in December 2017. This is expected to be partially offset by two less days in the quarter (lowering NII by $175 million) and seasonal decline in card loans. On an FTE basis, NII is anticipated to decline nearly $120 million owing to the tax act.Investment banking performance to be muted: The trend of pocketing solid advisory and underwriting fees for debt and equity issuance may reverse to some extent in the to-be-reported quarter, as rising rates are likely to have slowed down corporates’ involvement in these activities. As debt origination fees account for a major portion of total investment banking fees for BofA, this is expected to have an adverse impact on investment banking revenues.However, strong equity issuances globally are expected to have boosted IPOs and follow-on offerings. So, the related fees are projected to increase for BofA. Also, a potential rise in fees from increasing M&As in certain sectors will likely lead to a slight rise in advisory revenues for the company.For BofA, investment banking revenues are accounted in its Global Banking segment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment revenues of $5 billion reflects a marginal decline on a sequential basis.Slowdown in mortgage banking: With the refinance boom nearing its end, a big help is not expected from this operation. Further, home equity loan portfolio is likely to decline in the to-be-reported quarter as mortgage rates continued to move upward. As BofA hasn’t bulked up its mortgage banking businesses since the last recession, the company is expected to witness muted growth in the same.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Consumer Banking segment (under which mortgage fees are accounted for) revenues of $8.91 billion shows a slight fall from the prior quarter.Reduced scope of cost control: Expense reduction, which has long been the main method to remain profitable, is not expected to be the primary support in the to-be reported quarter. Further, as BofA continues to digitize banking operations and upgrade technology, related costs are expected to rise.But given the success of BofA’s cost-saving efforts and other restructuring initiatives as well as absence of significant legal costs and provisions, overall operating expenses are likely to remain relatively stable.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:BofA does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for BofA is -0.31%.Zacks Rank: BofA carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. But we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.Bank of America Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Bank of America Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Bank of America Corporation QuoteNotably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 59 cents reflects 43.9% growth on a year-over-year basis. Also, the consensus estimate for sales of $22.9 billion shows 3% rise from the prior-year quarter.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few major bank stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements for an earnings beat this time around:Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release results on Apr 17.

266,CMA,"As expected by the markets, SunTrust Banks, Inc. (STI  -  Free Report) has announced a raise in its stock dividend. This followed the approval of its 2017 capital plan by the Federal Reserve in June.SunTrust declared a quarterly cash dividend of 40 cents per share, up a whopping 54% from the prior payout. The dividend will be paid on Sep 15 to shareholders on record as of Aug 31. Based on the last day’s closing price of $58.05 per share, the dividend yield is 2.76%.Additionally, SunTrust’s capital plan includes authorization to repurchase $1.32 billion worth of shares, through the third quarter of 2018.Other than SunTrust, several other major regional banks including BB&T Corp. (BBT  -  Free Report), Comerica Inc. (CMA  -  Free Report) and Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report) increased their quarterly dividends (as part of their 2017 capital plan) in the range of 10–60%.Given its solid liquidity position, earnings strength and lower debt level, SunTrust is likely to be able to sustain improved capital deployments and also continue enhancing shareholders’ value going forward. But is it worth considering this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock to earn this dividend income?Let’s dig deeper into its financial performance and fundamentals to understand the risk and rewards.SunTrust’s net revenue witnessed compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.1%, over the last four years (2013–2016). The increase has been backed by strong loan and deposit growth along with the efforts to enhance revenue growth through several initiatives. The company’s projected sales growth for 2017 is 5.2%.Further, SunTrust has witnessed 13.3% rise in earnings per share over the last three to five years. The trend is expected to continue in the near term as well. The company’s projected EPS growth is 13.7% and 9.2% for 2017 and 2018, respectively.Also, SunTrust’s cost-saving measures have borne results and support profitability. Though non-interest expenses declined at a four-year CAGR (2013–2016) of 2.1%, the trend reversed in the first half of 2017 and in 2016 (in sync with its efforts to enhance revenue growth). Nonetheless, as the company continues with its initiatives of consolidating branches, the overall expense level is expected to remain manageable.Despite these favorable trends, the stock has gained 5.9% compared with the industry’s rally of 7.2% so far this year.SunTrust’s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) undercuts its growth potential. Though the company’s ROE of 7.60% has gradually improved over the years, it compares unfavorably with ROE of 8.72% for the industry and 15.66% for the S&P 500, reflecting its low efficiency in using shareholders’ funds.Additionally, SunTrust stock looks overvalued based on its price-to-book (P/B) ratio. The company currently has a trailing 12-month P/B ratio of 1.25, which is near its high over the last five years.Also, the stock has a Value Style Score of ‘C’. The Value Score condenses all valuation metrics into one actionable score that helps investors steer clear of ‘value traps’ and identify stocks that are truly trading at a discount. Our research shows that stocks with Style Scores of ‘A’ or ‘B’, when combined with Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.With a steady dividend income opportunity, SunTrust stock appears to be a good investment option now based on its strong fundamentals. However, investors should keep an eye on the stock’s performance as it is significantly overvalued.More Stock News: Tech Opportunity Worth $386 Billion in 2017From driverless cars to artificial intelligence, we've seen an unsurpassed growth of high-tech products in recent months.

267,CMA,"Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 13, before the opening bell. Its earnings are likely to improve year over year, but revenues might decline.This San Francisco-based banking giant has been much in the news following the sales scam that came into light in September 2016. The revelation of the fake account scandal that marked the beginning of numerous problems for the bank was followed by the disclosure of issues in its auto insurance business and online bill pay services.Therefore, the bank has been subjected to severe political and public outrage, and faced several lawsuits and investigations as well.Wells Fargo has undertaken a number of steps to restore its reputation, post scandal. Recently, at a heated senator meeting, Wells Fargo’s chief executive officer — Timothy Sloan — vigorously tried defending America’s third-largest bank for its past wrongdoings amid a volley of questions raised by the senators.Sloan apologized for causing its customers trouble and promised to take appropriate steps to make it a better bank in the times to come. The bank still has a long way to go before it can put all these troubles behind and focus on improving its performance.Amid such adversities, shares of Wells Fargo have gained just around 1% so far, this year, significantly lagging 10.5% growth recorded by the industry.Will the upcoming earnings release exert more pressure on the stock? Notably, Wells Fargo delivered an earnings beat in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.99%. However, our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat in the third quarter.Wells Fargo & Company Price and EPS Surprise Wells Fargo & Company Price and EPS Surprise | Wells Fargo & Company QuoteA stock needs to have the right combination of the two key criteria — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Unfortunately, this is not the case here, as elaborated below.Zacks ESP:The Earnings ESP for Wells Fargo is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.06. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Wells Fargo’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsExpenses May Trend Higher: Wells Fargo may record escalated costs given its franchise investments in areas, including mobile banking technology, digital lending and brokerage offerings. Notably, management projects technology costs to remain at an elevated level in the third quarter, before declining in the fourth quarter. Wells Fargo anticipates the efficiency ratio to be in the range of 60-61%, but the company is targeting around $4 billion of cost savings by year-end 2019.Notably, legal costs related to sales scam scandal might also escalate expenses for the bank.Mortgage Business to Surge:  Wells Fargo — one of the largest mortgage lenders in the nation — might record rise in mortgage banking revenues. Higher mortgage banking is expected on stronger origination volumes. However, the bank projects decline in the auto portfolio to reflect lower origination volumes. Management tightened credit underwriting standards in response to early signs of rising delinquencies in the industry and declining used car values. As a result, the quality of originations has improved and the company expects the size of the auto portfolio to decline persistently in 2017.Expectations of a higher rate environment might have encouraged refinancing activities during the quarter under review. Nevertheless, with the refinance boom nearing its end, no major help is expected from this segment.Loan Growth: Per the Federal Reserve’s latest data, loans grew on a sequential basis during the third quarter. Particularly, growth in commercial and consumer loans, with slowdown in commercial real estate loans is expected. However, the auto portfolio run-off is likely to continue in the near term on tightening of underwriting standards by Wells Fargo. Notably, the bank is cutting back its auto lending business amid stressful markets and adherence of more centralized risk controls.Rise in Net Interest Income: In addition to higher interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending might perk up interest income.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Oct 17. The company has an Earnings ESP of +0.28% and carries a Zacks Rank of 3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Earnings ESP for The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

268,CMA,"The Q3 earnings season is just around the corner and investors are eagerly awaiting the results of banks that have been in the spotlight throughout the quarter for a number of reasons.While investors’ optimism over the Fed’s plans to unwind its giant balance sheet and keep raising interest rates should drive bank stocks higher in the upcoming months, Q3 results are not expected to be overwhelming.This is because, major banks in the S&P 500 index (accounting for nearly 45% of the Zacks Finance Sector's total earnings) are expected to witness 5.1% year-over-year decline in earnings in the to-be-reported quarter. This compares with 10% growth recorded in the prior quarter.(For detailed look at the earnings outlook for this industry and others, please read our Earnings Preview article).Reduction in equity issuance, feeble equity trading volumes and subdued volumes of M&A’s are expected to negatively impact fee income growth for banks this time around. However, a persistent rise in debt underwriting (mainly on assumption of continuous increase in interest rates) and stability of fixed income trading flows will likely provide some respite.In addition to the benefits from the rising interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending, particularly in the areas of commercial and consumer might energize interest income for banks.Credit quality is anticipated to remain strong, backed by an improving economy and conservative underwriting standards. Though a continued momentum in investment banking business is likely to support the bottom-line numbers, banks might remain under pressure due to lackluster fixed-income trading activities on low volatility during the third quarter.On the cost front, while the absence of considerable legal expenses is positive, increased investments in technology to improve digital offerings might escalate costs moderately.Selecting the WinnersWhile the upcoming results are unlikely to be impressive, there are still a few major banks that are expected to outshine their peers. Therefore, this is the right time for you to select some banking stocks that are well positioned to beat earnings estimates in their upcoming releases.Choosing stocks with earnings beat potential might be a difficult task unless one knows the process to shortlist. One way to do it is by picking stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank — Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) — and a positive Earnings ESP.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in their upcoming earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.5 Major Banks Set for Earnings SurprisesHere are five major regional bank stocks that have the right combination of elements to deliver positive earnings surprises in their upcoming announcements:Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Oct 17.

269,CMA,"Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) remains on track to improve its financials through GEAR Up initiatives. Also, the company reported rising fee income despite a sluggish market. Its steady capital deployment activities continue to enhance shareholder value. However, Comerica’s exposure to commercial loans remains a headwind.The company is well poised to grow with the help of its revenue and efficiency enhancing initiatives or GEAR Up initiatives. This is expected help the company achieve annual pre-tax income of about $270 million by year-end 2018. Further, Comericaseeks to achieve $125 million cost savings target for 2017.The company has reported increased non-interest income over the last two years, supported by cross-sell opportunities, including wealth management products such as fiduciary and brokerage services. Further, management expects 4-6% increase in fee income in 2017 through modest growth in treasury management and card fees, and wealth management products.Also, Comerica’s capital strength can be judged from its capital deployment activities. It has a share repurchase plan of up to $605 million for a four-quarter period (ending second-quarter 2018) in progress. Also, as part of its 2017 capital plan, the company raised its common stock dividend by 15% in July 2017. Further, these activities look sustainable as Comerica’s debt/equity ratio and dividend payout ratio compare favorably with the broader industry.However, Comerica’s significant exposure to commercial loans (nearly 64% of the total loans) keeps us apprehensive. If the housing sector weakens, it would adversely impact the company’s financials.Some stocks in the finance space worth considering are PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

270,CMA,"The Federal Reserve is set to wrap up its two-day policy-setting meeting on Wednesday. As the result day approaches, speculation on the Fed’s action is growing.As the current inflation rate remains below the Fed’s target level, chances of an interest rate hike are low this time around. However, this time around, investors are waiting for another important decision that might significantly benefit banks.In the June meeting, the Fed had hinted that it would start unwinding its huge balance sheet by the end of 2017. And rumours suggest that the trimming might start in September itself and investors are expecting this meeting to specify how the process will be rolled out.The Fed’s quantitative easing policy during the recession to increase money supply in the economy and support the struggling banking industry made it purchase a large number of financial assets from banks.Of the assets purchased, most were treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. The Fed kept on reinvesting the proceeds of the maturing securities. As a result of this, its balance sheet now stands at a whopping $4.5 trillion.However, now, as the economy has more or less stabilized, the Fed wants to start unwinding its balance sheet.For this, it may either sell some of its securities or stop reinvesting the proceeds.If the Fed decides to buy back some or all the short-term duration securities, the yield curve will become steeper. This means that the yield on long-term bonds will increase.Since banks borrow at the short-term rates but lend at long-term rates, their net-interest margin spreads will widen.Major banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report), BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report), The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report) and Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) have already been witnessing a gradual improvement in their margins with the rate hikes so far. They will benefit further if the Fed’s balance-sheet action steepens the yield curve.   Although the balance sheet trimming is a long and gradual process, it will definitely help banks to improve their margins further.Each of the banks mentioned above currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

271,CMA,"Hurricanes, Harvey and Irma, are expected to make U.S. banks suffer billions of dollars in losses, per a report published by The Street.Since borrowers in the affected areas are being unable to repay their loans, banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report), Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report) and a few others are dreading huge loan losses that they might have to face.According to analysts at The Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

Hurricane Harvey is likely to cause loan losses of around $600 million to $1.1 billion, while losses from Irma could range from $1.2-$1.9 billion.Per the estimates of the analysts, the earnings per share (EPS) of banks like JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) will likely drop by 1-2%.EPS losses for Zions Bancorporation (ZION  -  Free Report) are expected to range between 11-19%, while SunTrust Banks Inc.

272,CMA,"On Aug 21, we issued an updated research report on First Horizon National Corp. (FHN  -  Free Report).The company has benefited greatly from its inorganic growth strategies and cost control initiatives. However, pending legal issues relating to mortgage repurchases are likely to weigh on its financials.First Horizon pulled off a positive earnings surprise in the second quarter. The results reflected improved net interest income and loans balance. Also, lower expenses were a tailwind.Shares of First Horizon have lost 15.5% in the past six months, compared to 10.9% decline for the industry.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings have remained stable at $1.12 over the last 30 days. Thus, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The company has been focusing on inorganic growth strategies lately, which have helped improve its top line. It completed the acquisition of Houston-based Coastal Securities in April 2017, following which in May 2017, it announced the buyout of Capital Bank Financial Corp. . With these acquisitions,First Horizon has become the fourth largest regional bank in the Southeast.Further, First Horizon’s cost-control measures led to a decline in expenses over the past few quarters. Further, the company remains focused on managing expenses through process improvement, branch network optimization and other efficiencies. These measures are likely to continue improving its bottom line in the quarters ahead.However, mortgage repurchase issues have impacted First Horizon’s performance in the last few years. The company seeks to solve several mortgage repurchase-related litigations, mainly due to the origination and the sale, securitization or government insurance of residential mortgage loans before 2009. Settling such legal issues is expected to weigh on its financials.Stocks to ConsiderA couple of better-ranked stocks in the same space are Carolina Financial Corporation (CARO  -  Free Report) and Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report).Carolina Financial witnessed an upward earnings estimate revision of 4.3% for the current year, over the last 30 days.

These are designed to ensure that these banks are in a healthy position to handle crisis during an economic downturn.The Fed’s Vice Chairman Randal Quarles said, “Despite a tough scenario and other factors that affected this year’s test, the capital levels of the firms after the hypothetical severe global recession are higher than the actual capital levels of large banks in the years leading up to the most recent recession.”Detail Analysis of ResultsThis year’s stress test was the toughest, with severe adverse scenario featuring a severe global recession and the U.S. unemployment rate increasing to 10% along with a steepening Treasury yield curve. Further, changes in tax rates had an adverse impact on banks’ financials as the tax law eliminated some beneficial tax treatments that inclined to increase net income at the time of financial crisis.Under this hypothetical scenario, these banks will incur a loss of $578 million. Notably, the projected losses included $113 billion from credit card loans for the banks, at an equal level with trading and counterparty positions. Also, the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio (in aggregate) would fall to 7.9% from an actual 12.3% in fourth-quarter 2017. Notably, the figure is well above the 4.5% minimum mark set by regulators.Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) reported CET1 ratio of 8.6%, highest among the four big banks. The other three — Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) — had their ratios above 7%. All these stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Apart from this, the Fed requires the big banks to maintain a supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of at least 3% of their assets and certain other positions. However, in this year’s test, Goldman (GS  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) have the last two positions with SLRs of 3.1% and 3.3%, respectively. So, this might result in these two companies adjusting their capital plans.In a statement, Goldman commented that it did not agree with the Fed’s stress test results and intends to discuss the “divergence” before next week’s test. Additionally, Morgan Stanley stated that the results “may not be indicative of the capital distributions that we will be permitted to make.”Notably, in response to recently passed Economic Growth, Regulatory Reform, and Consumer Protection Act, the Fed dropped CIT Group, Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) and Zions Bancorporation from this year’s test. The act exempts banks with total consolidated assets of less than $100 million from this annual exercise.A Bigger Payout PossibleBanks are optimistic, given the tax cuts and easing of stringent regulations. They are keen to reward shareholders by enhancing the size of their capital deployment plans (raising dividends and repurchasing shares).According to a Financial Times report, shareholders of 22 of the largest lenders are projected to receive around $170 billion in dividends and stock buyout in 2018, nearly 25% more than last year. Among these, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo (despite facing several probes and lawsuits related to business misconducts), Bank of America and Citigroup are expected to lead the race.But the clearance of the stress test does not automatically lead to the conclusion that the banks qualify for bigger capital deployment. The companies will have to wait till Jun 28 for approval of their capital plans.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.     Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

274,CMA,"Improving operating backdrop, a rising rate environment and easing of regulations along with the strengthening of domestic economy, should keep supporting the performance of banking stocks. Keeping these in mind, we have selected KeyCorp (KEY  -  Free Report) for you to consider.The bank continues to reflect strength in several areas, such as rising loans and deposits, improving credit quality and a strong capital position. Driven by these positives, analysts seem to be optimistic about KeyCorp’s prospects. In the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both 2018 and 2019 has increased nearly 1%.Also, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has gained 1.9% so far this year against the industry’s decline of 2.8%.Why is the Stock a Solid Choice?Revenue growth: Organic growth remains a key strength for KeyCorp. The company’s revenues (tax equivalent basis) have seen a CAGR of 15.3% over the last four years (2014-2017).Sustained growth in loans and rising interest rates as well as higher fee income will likely continue aiding the top line. Also, the synergies from the First Niagara deal are projected to continue over the next few years. The company’s projected sales growth rate of 3.6% and 4.6% for 2018 and 2019, respectively, ensures continuation of the upward revenue trend.Earnings strength: KeyCorp witnessed earnings growth of 8.7% in the last three to five years, above the industry average of 5.3%. This earnings momentum is likely to continue in the near term as reflected by the company’s projected EPS growth rate (F1/F0) of 33% compared with the industry’s increase of 30.7%.Further, the company’s long-term (three to five years) estimated EPS growth rate of 9.5% promises rewards for investors in the long run.Strong asset quality: Improving credit quality continues to be a catalyst for KeyCorp. The bank has been witnessing a decline in provision for loan losses over the past several quarters. Further, in 2018, management anticipates net charge-offs rate to be lower than the target range of 40-60 basis points while provisions are expected to rise modestly, given the loan growth.Impressive capital deployment activities: Driven by its capital strength, KeyCorp’s capital deployment activities are impressive. In May, the company announced a 14.3% dividend hike (part of its 2017 capital plan) and it has a share buyback plan in place.Also, the bank has been growing inorganically as well. In 2017, it acquired Cain Brothers and HelloWallet while in 2016, the company acquired First Niagara. With the results of this year’s stress test coming out soon, the company should be able to deploy more capital, thereby rewarding its shareholders.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other bank stocks worth a look include Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report), Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) and Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc. (CFR  -  Free Report).Fifth Third Bancorp’s earnings estimates moved 6.4% upward for the current year, in the past 60 days. Also, its shares have seen a 22.2% rise over the past year.

275,CMA,"People's United Financial Inc. (PBCT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2015 results on Thursday, Jul 16.Last quarter, this financial savings and loan institution witnessed more than10% year-over-year rise in earnings, while at the same time managing to beat estimates. Results were aided by higher revenue, partially offset by increased expenses and provisions.Will People's United fail to impress in the upcoming release after combating the challenges witnessed by the industry in the quarter? Let's see what factors might have influenced the earnings report this time around.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsIncreasing commercial real estate and lending activities from the improving economy is likely to contribute to People’s United’s revenue growth. Notably, the company has a track record of positive loan growth (annualized) for the past 18 consecutive quarters. While continuity of such a trend is likely to drive net interest income in the second quarter, we remain cautious at the same time. We expect to witness a rise in provisions during the quarter given the rapidly growing and diversifying loan portfolio.Also, net interest margin is predicted to remain under pressure, owing to lower yield on new loans, given the current low rate environment.Additionally, bank service charges will continue to be impacted due to certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.On a positive note, as reaffirmed by the company during its first-quarter earnings call conference, growth in net interest income from its originated portfolio exceeding lost accretion on the acquired portfolio will likely continue to be a driving factor for subsequent quarters.Also, commercial banking lending fees is likely to get a boost due to moderate growth in commercial prepayment activity in commercial real estate.We believe the quarterly results are likely to reflect reducing expenses.  This is because increase in expenses owing to seasonality in the first quarter is not likely to repeat in the second quarter. Further, as previously announced, the company intends to close around 10 branches in the remainder of this year and plans to reduce real estate costs by consolidating other facilities. Such efforts are likely to reflect in the company’s expense base.Activities of People's United during the quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter remained stable at 21 cents per share over the last 7 days.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that People's United is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the second quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or at least 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, this is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for People's United is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 21 cents.Zacks Rank: People's United’s Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) increases the predictive power of ESP. But we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings surprise call.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as our model shows that these also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:KeyCorp. (KEY  -  Free Report) has an earnings ESP of +3.57% and carries a Zacks Rank #2. It is expected to report its second-quarter results on Jul 16.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) has an earnings ESP of +1.35% and carries a Zacks Rank #3. It is expected to report its second-quarter results on Jul 17.The earnings ESP for Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc. (CFR  -  Free Report) is +3.57% and it carries a Zacks Rank #2.

276,CMA,"SunTrust Banks, Inc.'s (STI  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 earnings of $1.03 per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 98 cents. Also, the figure was up 10% year over year.Better-than-expected results were primarily driven by an increase in net interest income, partially offset by higher expenses. Also, modest loan growth acted as a tailwind. A decline in provision for credit losses was another positive for the company.Net income available to common shareholders was $505 million, up 6% year over year.Net Interest Income Growth Offsets Higher CostsTotal revenue (FTE basis) for the quarter grew 2% from the prior-year quarter to $2.27 billion.Net interest income (FTE basis) increased 9% year over year to $1.44 billion. The rise was attributable to growth in average earning assets and higher net interest margin (NIM).On a year-over-year basis, NIM was up 15 basis points (bps) to 3.14%, reflecting higher earning asset yields, favorable impact of continued positive mix shift in the loan portfolio and lower premium amortization in the securities portfolio.Non-interest income was $827 million, down 8% from the prior-year quarter. The fall was largely due to lower net securities gains, mortgage production related income and other non-interest income.Non-interest expenses were up 3% from the year-ago quarter to $1.39 billion. The rise was mainly due to an increase in most expense categories, other than operating losses and other non-interest expense.Credit Quality ImprovedTotal non-performing assets were $821 million as of Jun 30, 2017, down 18% from prior-year quarter. Non-performing loans fell 15 bps year over year to 0.52% of total loans held for investment.Further, provision for credit losses declined 38% from the year-ago quarter to $90 million. Also, the rate of net charge-offs decreased 19 bps year over year to 0.20% of total average loans held for investment.Strong Balance SheetAs of Jun 30, 2017, SunTrust had total assets of $207.2 billion while shareholders’ equity was $24.5 billion, representing nearly 12% of total assets.As of Jun 30, 2017, loans were marginally up on a sequential basis to $144.3 billion. However, total consumer and commercial deposits declined nearly 2% from the prior quarter to $158.3 billion.SunTrust’s estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III (on a fully phased-in basis) was 9.52% as of Jun 30, 2017.Share RepurchaseDuring the reported quarter, SunTrust bought back shares worth $240 million.Our ViewpointSunTrust remains well positioned for growth given its favorable deposit mix and enhanced credit quality. Easing margin pressure (given the improvement in interest rates) and initiatives to enhance efficiency should support the company’s revenues.However, the company’s significant exposure to commercial and residential loan portfolios remains a major near-term concern. Any deterioration in the real estate prices will pose a problem.SunTrust Banks, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  SunTrust Banks, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | SunTrust Banks, Inc.

Better-than-expected results were driven by an increase in revenues and lower expenses. However, provision for credit losses increased, which was a headwind.Comerica Inc.’s (CMA  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of $1.15 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.07. Better-than-expected results reflect higher revenues and lower expenses. Moreover, lower provisions and better credit quality were the tailwinds.Riding on higher revenues, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC  -  Free Report) reported a positive earnings surprise of 4.5% in second-quarter 2017. Earnings per share of $2.10 easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.01.

277,CMA,"Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of 46 cents, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 42 cents. The adjusted figure excludes the impact of a non-recurring item.Better-than-expected results were driven by an increase in net interest income and lower provisions. Also, improved credit quality was a tailwind. However, lower non-interest income was an undermining factor.Net income available to common shareholders decreased 13% year over year to $344 million.Lower Non-interest Income Impacts Revenues, Expenses DeclineTotal revenue for the quarter came in at $1.50 billion, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.53 billion. Reported revenues were stable year over year.Fifth Third’s net interest income (tax equivalent) came in at $945 million, up 4% year over year. The rise was primarily driven by higher short-term market rates.Net interest margin expanded 13 basis points (bps) year over year to 3.01%, mainly due to improved short-term market rates.Non-interest income dropped 6% year over year to $564 million (including certain non-recurring items). Excluding significant items, non-interest income was down 5% year over year to $571 million. Notably, the quarter witnessed a fall in almost all components of income, partially offset by higher revenues from other income, service charges on deposits as well as wealth and asset management.However, non-interest expenses decreased 3% year over year to $957 million. The fall was due to lower net occupancy expense, equipment, card and processing, and other expenses.As of Jun 30, 2017, average loan and lease balances were almost stable sequentially at $92.7 billion. Average total deposits declined 1% from the previous quarter to $102.5 billion.Credit Quality ImprovesProvision for loan and lease losses declined 43% year over year to $52 million. Net losses charge-offs for the quarter came in at $95 million or 28 bps of average loans and leases on an annualized basis compared with $87 million or 37 bps in the prior-year quarter.Total non-performing assets, including loans held for sale, were $670 million, down 19% from the year-ago quarter. Total allowance for credit losses was $1.39 billion, down 4% from the prior-year quarter.Strong Capital PositionFifth Third remained well capitalized in the quarter. Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 11.76% compared with 11.03% at the end of the prior-year quarter. CET1 capital ratio (fully phased-in) was 10.52% compared with 9.86% at the end of the year-ago quarter. Tier 1 leverage ratio was 10.07% compared with 9.64% in the prior-year quarter.Our ViewpointWe believe that the company, with a diversified traditional banking platform, remains well poised to benefit from recovery of the economies where it has footprint. Steady improvement in loan balance highlights its efficient organic growth strategy. Further, the company’s improving credit quality and strong balance sheet should drive better results in the upcoming quarters.

278,CMA,"After three consecutive quarters of witnessing muted activities, volatility seems to be back in the market. The expected rise in JPMorgan’s (JPM  -  Free Report) trading revenues in first-quarter 2018 indicates the same. As trading revenues constitute a major part of the bank’s top line, this is expected to lead the company to report improved results on Apr 13.In the last two months of the first quarter, the markets experienced significant volatility. In fact, February was one of the most volatile months since 2008, and March 2018 was even worse. The trade war between the United States and China, higher inflation expectation, tightening of monetary policy by the Fed and a sharp sell-off in the tech sector incited volatility during the quarter.At the annual Investors’ Day conference in late February, management projected first-quarter market revenues to rise mid to high single-digit rate on a year-over-year basis.Similar to the prior quarters, equity trading revenues are expected to render support to the total trading revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for equity trading revenues of $1.85 billion reflects an increase of 15% from the year-ago quarter and 60.9% jump sequentially. Notably, per the consensus estimate, fixed income trading revenues will remain flat year over year but surge a whopping 91% from the prior quarter to $4.22 billion.Apart from this, here are the other factors that are anticipated to influence JPMorgan’s Q1 results:Steady increase in net interest income: In addition to higher interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending — particularly in the areas of commercial and industrial, real estate and consumer — will likely result in higher net interest income (NII).Additionally, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets of $2.21 trillion for the first quarter indicates an increase of 2.3% year over year and 1% sequentially. This, along with decent lending activities and higher interest rates, is further projected to boost the company’s NII in the to-be-reported quarter.On a sequential basis, management expects NII to be slightly lower due to the impact of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and lower day count, partially offset by the benefits of higher rates and growth.Muted investment banking performance: The trend of pocketing solid advisory and underwriting fees for debt and equity issuance may reverse to some extent in the to-be-reported quarter, as rising rates are likely to have slowed down corporates’ involvement in these activities. As debt origination fees account for about half of total investment banking fees for JPMorgan, this is expected to have an adverse impact on investment banking revenues.However, strong equity issuances globally are expected to have boosted IPOs and follow-on offerings. So, the related fees are projected to increase for JPMorgan. Also, a potential rise in fees from increasing M&As in certain sectors will likely support the company in partially offsetting the lost revenues.Notably, the company expects investment banking income to remain stable or increase marginally year over year.Slowdown in mortgage banking: With the refinance boom nearing its end, a big help is not expected from this segment. Further, home equity loan portfolio is likely to decline in the to-be-reported quarter. As JPMorgan hasn’t bulked up its mortgage banking businesses since the last recession, the company is expected to witness muted growth in the same.Lesser scope of cost containment: As the majority of unnecessary expenses have already been cut by the bank, expense reduction will not likely be a major support. Also, there were no major outflows related to legal settlements during the quarter that might impact JPMorgan’s earnings unusually.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:JPMorgan does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for JPMorgan is -0.80%.Zacks Rank: JPMorgan carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. But we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.JPMorgan Chase & Co. Price and EPS Surprise  JPMorgan Chase & Co. Price and EPS Surprise | JPMorgan Chase & Co. QuoteNotably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $2.28 reflects 38.2% growth on a year-over-year basis.

279,CMA,"BlackRock, Inc. (BLK  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 12, before the opening bell. Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.Last quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results benefited from an improvement in revenues, rise in assets under management (AUM) and long-term inflows.Moreover, the company boasts a decent earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being nearly 3.1%.BlackRock, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  BlackRock, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | BlackRock, Inc. QuoteHowever, BlackRock’s business activities and prospects did not encourage analysts to revise earnings estimates upward for the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $6.44 has decreased marginally over the last 30 days. Nonetheless, the figure reflects year-over-year improvement of 22.7%.In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the quarter is $3.28 billion, which reflects growth of 16.1% year over year.Strong fundamentals helped shares of the company to gain 35.7% in the past year, outperforming 14.4% growth of the industry.Will the rally in share price continue post Q1 earnings? To a great extent, it depends on whether the company is able to maintain its trend of beating earnings estimates.Before we discuss the factors that are likely to influence Q1 results, let’s look at what our quantitative model predicts.A Positive Surprise in Store?According to our quantitative model, it is likely that BlackRock will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first quarter. This is because, it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to be confident of an earnings surprise call.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for BlackRock is +0.07%.Zacks Rank: BlackRock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP, increases the odds of an earnings beat.Factors to Impact Q1 ResultsBlackRock remains a dominant player in the ETF market, given its continued investments in U.S. iShare core ETFs. Moreover, as investors are increasing their allocations toward ETFs instead of alternative investments in order to reduce management costs, the company’s iShares inflows are expected to remain strong in the to-be-reported quarter. In fact, the company expects to witness positive active equity flows during the quarter as well. Thus, driven by steady inflows, AUM is likely to witness improvement. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total AUM for the to-be-reported quarter is $6.49 trillion, which reflects rise of 3.3%, sequentially.While higher AUM is expected to have a positive impact on investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenues, this effect is likely to be slightly offset by the muted market performance that was witnessed during the quarter. Thus, the investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenues, which constitute more than 80% of the company’s total revenues, are likely to witness only a marginal improvement in the quarter.However, performance fees, which is another major revenue component is not expected to improve during the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for performance fees for the first quarter is $65 million, which represents decline of 77.2% from the prior quarter.Notably, BlackRock might witness an increase in costs in the to-be-reported quarter. BlackRock’s expenses have remained elevated over the last few years. Moreover, the restructuring of the traditional actively managed equities business, along with its plans for improving product offerings, is expected to lead to a further rise in expenses.Other Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few other finance stocks that you may want to consider, as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter, according to our model.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release results on Apr 17.

280,CMA,"Over the last four trading days, performance of banking stocks has been encouraging. Easing U.S.-China trade war tension has provided some respite to investors, infusing overall positivity in the market.Mortgage rates declined this week, hitting 4.4%, along with bond yields, on fears of a trade war. Despite this, investors are apprehensive about parking funds in the housing market, thanks to the volatility in the financial world. However, homeowners seeking lower rates for refinancing are definitely big-time gainers.Further, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield shrunk during the week, as demand for safe-haven assets increased due to the political tension, only to bounce back near to 2.82% as fears of the trade war waned.Notably, mortgage applications plunged last week, per the latest data from the Mortgage Bankers Association. In addition, the refinance share of mortgage activity came in at 38.5% of all applications.Though economic data might be affected marginally due to slapping of trade tariffs by the United States and China, the first-quarter GDP is expected to grow moderately and consumer spending is anticipated to bear minimal brunt. Therefore, positive numbers and anticipations of an improving job market might lead to rise in housing demand.Regarding company-specific news related to banks, streamlining operations and steady capital-deployment activities persisted over the last four trading days. (Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Mar 9, 2018)Important Developments of the Week1.

284,CMA,"The ratings of MB Financial, Inc. (MBFI  -  Free Report), along with its subsidiaries, have been kept under review for a possible upgrade by Moody's Investors Service — a rating arm of Moody's Corporation (MCO  -  Free Report). Moreover, the rating agency will review the Chicago-based bank's senior unsecured rating of Ba1 and baseline credit assessment of baa3, along with its lead bank’s issuer rating of Ba1.In addition, the rating outlook has been changed to ‘Review for Upgrade’ from the current ‘Stable’.Rationale Behind the ReviewThe review follows the announcement of the stock-cash acquisition deal with Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report), headquartered at Cincinnati, OH, under which MB Financial will be merged with Fifth Third, for a total value of $4.7 billion. However, the deal awaits meeting all customary closing conditions, including certain regulatory approvals and MB Financial shareholders’ approval. MB Financial, with about $20 billion in assets, serves middle-market customers as a leader with its strong deposit franchise, customer-centric corporate culture and commercial expertise. Per Moody’s, post-merger, MB Financial’s strengths and Fifth Third’s huge corporate lending, capital markets, wealth management and the payments business will benefit customers with complementary capabilities of both banks.Furthermore, MB Financial's diversified sources of earnings and core base of retail deposits justify its baa3 standalone baseline credit assessment (BCA). Per Moody’s, though the bank has weak liquidity and low tangible capitalization, stable net interest margin and steady fee income generation are positive factors. Moreover, concentrated commercial real estate lending and loan growth support baa3 BCA.Conclusion The rating outlook is valuable for firms since it preserves investors’ confidence in the stock and boosts its creditworthiness in the market. An upgrade in the same increases investors’ confidence and reflects the company’s strong financials.MB Financial’s shares have gained 15.2% in the last six months compared with 4.7% growth recorded by the industry. Currently, the bank carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock to consider is Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report), which has been witnessing upward estimate revisions for the last 60 days.

285,CMA,"Minutes from the latest FOMC meet indicated that the Fed is set to hike interest rates gradually this year. However, a June hike is almost certain. The committee is of the view that broadly encouraging economic conditions, even as inflation nears the 2% level, would make conditions appropriate for a rate hike “soon.”Further, tight labor market conditions and growing wages make the conditions ideal for gradually hiking interest rates. Economists largely believe that there might be three or four rate hikes in 2018. Under conditions in which interest rates are likely to remain high, investing in financial stocks seems prudent.June Hike in the OffingIn the recently concluded Fed meet on May 2, the Federal Open Market Committee jointly agreed to hold the interest rate steady. However, the committee acknowledged rising levels of inflation. The members noted that on a 12-month basis, overall inflation as well as inflation for items excluding food and energy, inched close to 2%.The minutes from the meeting, indicated that though the rate hikes would be gradual this year, a hike is inevitable in June. This is because most of the members stated that it would “soon be appropriate” to hike rates. Further, the minutes also stated that an upsurge in inflation would prove to be helpful.Moreover, the committee believes that gradual increments in federal funds rate would sustain the current level of economic growth. Under tight labor market conditions and inflation levels near the targeted rate of 2%, a gradual path toward raising rates would prove to be consistent with overall economic growth.Economists vehemently predict a possible rate hike by the Fed in its Jun 13 policy meeting. Notaby, CME’s FedWatch Tool predict a 100% probability of a hike in interest rate levels in June.Patrick Harker Expects a Spate of Rate Hikes This YearOn May 21, Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker stated that rising inflation levels in the United States should encourage the Fed to hike interest rates by two or maybe three more times this year. He further stated that the next hike could take place as early as in June.He reasoned that since inflation is fast closing in on the targeted 2% level, a hike in interest rate should not be delayed. Notably, the PCE price index rose to an annual rate of 2% in March from 1.7% in February.During the monetary tightening in March, when the Fed introduced a quarter point hike in the rates to 1.5-1.75%, Harker estimated two hikes this year. However, given the acceleration in inflation levels and the absence of any “slack in the labor markets,” he supports a third hike which he feels would bode well for the economy.4 Hot ChoicesConsistent economic growth, robust labor market conditions and rising wages have raised the possibility of a rate hike in June. Further, minutes from Fed’s latest meeting show that a vast majority of the committee members support the decision to soon hike interest rates.In this context, we have selected four financial stocks that are expected to gain from these factors. These five stocks flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Popular, Inc.

287,CMA,"Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) has been making plans to merge the Wealth Brokerage Services and Private Client Group, as both the divisions are dedicated to serving high-end customers. The news was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.The move is aimed at improving efficiency of the wealth management segment by streamlining operations. Details of the restructuring will likely be disclosed later this week, by Jon Weiss, the lead of wealth and investment management unit, at an internal meeting to be held in town hall.In its latest quarterly filing, Wells Fargo had mentioned that its investment management segment was still undergoing a review to assess whether there have been inappropriate referrals or recommendations, with respect to rollovers for 401(k) plan participants, certain alternative investments and referrals of brokerage customers. The bank had initiated this review on receiving inquiries from the federal authorities.Troubles for Wells Fargo started in late 2016 due to the outbreak of unfair sales practices at the retail brokerage business, which is part of its wealth management arm. Since then, the bank has been involved in a number of investigations and paid penalties for the same.Wells Fargo recently received the final approval for a settlement of $142 million to compensate the customers harmed by the bank’s unauthorized account-opening scandal.

288,CMA,"Rising interest rates and modest growth in loans and deposits should drive further momentum in U.S. bank stocks, which have been grossly outperforming the broader market over the past two years. Particularly, the prospects for major regional banks look bright in the near term as their scale will help them benefit more from a steadily improving domestic economy and the impending easing of regulations.Moreover, continued efforts to restructure operations and improving asset quality and capital position should keep aiding profitability growth.However, the rising rate environment, which should continue driving interest income growth, will keep corporates away from debt and equity issuance and consequently result in dismal investment banking performance. Also, higher rates will make mortgage loans less affordable for borrowers, which will put some pressure on mortgage banking revenues.  Nevertheless, uncertainty-induced volatility might continue for some time, which will keep supporting trading business.Further, digitization of banking operations will result in more cross-selling opportunities. This, along with focus on core operations, should lead to improvement in operating efficiency and lend support to banks’ efforts to manage expenses. Also, easing of regulations and lower tax rates should aid bottom-line growth.Attractive Shareholder ReturnsLooking at shareholder returns over the past two years, it appears that the border economic recovery was in favor of the industry. Gradual improvement in operating environment and policy changes were the other factors encouraging investors to bet on major regional bank stocks.The Zacks Major Regional Banks Industry, which is a 16-stock group within the broader Zacks Finance Sector, has outperformed both the S&P 500 and its own sector over the past two years.While the stocks in this industry have collectively gained 55.3%, the Zacks S&P 500 Composite and Zacks Finance Sector have rallied 33.8% and 29.8%, respectively.Two-Year Price Performance Major Regional Bank Stocks Trading at Slight DiscountDespite the outperformance of the industry in the past two years, the valuation doesn’t look too expensive. One might get a good sense of the industry’s relative valuation by looking at its price-to-tangible book ratio (P/TBV), which is the most appropriate multiple for valuing banks because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next.     This ratio essentially measures a bank's current market value relative to what it would be worth if all assets were sold, debt was paid and intangible assets were written off.The industry currently has a trailing 12-month P/TBV ratio of 2.40, which is slightly above the median level of 2.17, over the past two years. When compared with the highest level of 2.68 in that period, there is apparently some upside left.However, the space looks pretty cheap when compared with the market at large, as the trailing 12-month P/TBV ratio for the S&P 500 is 10.12 and the median level is 9.18.Price-to-Tangible Book Ratio (TTM) As finance stocks typically have a lower P/TBV ratio, comparing major regional banks with the S&P 500 may not make sense to many investors. But a comparison of the group’s P/TBV ratio with that of its border sector ensures that the group is trading at a decent discount. The Zacks Finance Sector’s trailing 12-month P/TBV ratio of 2.96 and the median level of 3.49 for the same period are above the Zacks Major Regional Banks Industry’s respective ratios.Price-to-Tangible Book Ratio (TTM)Outperformance May Continue Given the Improving Earnings OutlookExpectations of improving profitability with rising interest rates, a decent demand for loans and other strategic initiatives should help major regional bank stocks continue generating positive shareholder returns in the near future.But what really matters to investors is whether this group has the potential to continue outperforming the broader market in the quarters ahead. Investors may consider the current price levels as good entry points, as there are convincing reasons to predict a decent upside in the near term.One reliable measure that can help investors understand the industry’s prospects for a solid price performance is the earnings outlook for its member companies. Empirical research shows that a company’s earnings outlook significantly influences the near-term performance of its stock.One can get a good sense of a company’s earnings outlook by comparing the consensus earnings expectation for the current financial year with last year’s reported number, but an effective measure could be the magnitude and direction of the recent change in earnings estimates.The consensus earnings estimate for the Zacks Major Regional Banks industry of $4.55 per share implies a decent year-over-year improvement. Also, the trend in earnings estimate revisions has been favorable.Price and Consensus: Zacks Major Regional Banks industry Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are becoming more confident in this group’s earnings potential. The consensus EPS estimates for the current year have been revised 1.1% upward since Mar 31, 2018. Current Year EPS Estimate RevisionsZacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates continued outperformance in the near term.The Zacks Major Regional Banks industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #41, which places it at the top 16% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Our proprietary Heat Map shows that the industry’s rank has remained in the top half of the rank list over the past eight weeks. Major Regional Banks Long-Term Growth Not Too ImpressiveWhile the near-term prospects look bright, long-term (3-5 years) EPS growth estimates for the Zacks Major Regional Banks industry doesn’t seem much impressive. The group’s mean estimate of long-term EPS growth rate has increased modestly since beginning of 2018 and has remained stable for quite some time at current level of 8.45%. This compares to 9.8% for the Zacks S&P 500 composite.Mean Estimate of Long-Term EPS Growth RateSince the beginning of 2016, revenues have been improving, mainly driven by rising interest rates and economic improvement. The effect of higher interest rates on the bottom-line numbers is expected to gradually reduce.   Bottom LineThe effect of rising rates is expected to lessen in the long run and the operating backdrop may turn into a bit challenging one with easing of regulatory supervision. Also, the support banks receive from manageable expense levels at present might not continue as investments in technology and efforts to find new avenues will gradually increase expenses.However, major regional banks will likely continue benefiting from higher interest rates, favorable operating environment and improving economy in the near term. So, betting on this space could be rewarding. One should particularly consider betting on the major regional bank stocks that depict an improving earnings outlook.3 Regional Bank Stocks to Bet OnFifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report): The stock of this Cincinnati, OH-based bank has gained 20% over the past year.

289,CMA,"Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) has received the judge’s approval for the settlement of $142 million worth class-action lawsuit related to the 3.5 million fake accounts scandal. However, customers still have scope for filing a claim if they feel they too have been wronged by the bank.The class-action lawsuit was an outcome of the bank’s undue pressure on its employees to achieve extensive sales targets, which led them to open unauthorized savings accounts, credit cards and lines of credit from May 2002 to April 2017.The U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria feels that the settlement is an “imperfect solution”, but there was no alternative. He also said, “Class actions are to some degree rough justice, but I do believe this settlement is fair.”The settlement would entertain claims of those clients who have been charged fees on the accounts that were opened without their consent. Also, refunds would be made to customers whose credit scores have been impacted by Wells Fargo’s improper practice and led to higher borrowing costs for them. Lastly, the remaining amount will be distributed equally among the claimants.Wells Fargo has also been ordered to file some additional paper work that would contain an oversight mechanism to ensure the settlement is fully enforced before its attorneys receive their $21 million share.Since the breakout of scandal in September 2016, Wells Fargo made a lot of changes in its staff levels and practices, yet it continued to be involved in a number of legal issues. Recently, the bank settled a consolidated securities fraud class action suit related to the fake-accounts scandal filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California for $480 million.The Sans Francisco-based bank has been paying a number of penalties on this probe since 2016. With this recently announced settlement, the bank would finally get a chance to move ahead of past misconducts.Wells Fargo’s impressive cost-control plan for 2018 will help it deal with the high cost base. Also, the bank’s efforts to better its image among customers and the improving economic backdrop might support its growth in the near term.Shares of Wells Fargo have lost 9.8% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 2.3%.Wells Fargo currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderNorthern Trust Corporation’s (NTRS  -  Free Report) current-year earnings estimates have been revised 5.1% upward over the last 60 days.

291,CMA,"Italy’s political mayhem has taken U.S. investors by surprise. Italy’s president, for the time being, restricted the formation of a new government backed by two euroskeptic, anti-establishment parties. But, if these populist parties win the upcoming election, it could endanger Italy’s membership in the single currency. Such likelihood sparked a global selloff, sparing neither European nor U.S. investors.But, let’s admit that the stock market has weathered many debt and currency storms, including “Brexit” and “Grexit”. Based on such positive historic trends, investors should snap up solid stocks that will make the most of a stock market comeback in the near term.Italy’s Political ScenarioItaly’s March election failed to yield definite results. Last weekend, the anti-establishment maverick 5 Start Movement and far-right League were on the verge of forming a coalition government. But, Italian president Sergio Mattarella blocked the coalition government. Mattarella vetoed the appointment of former industry minister Paolo Savona, who has been backed by the populist coalition. The 81-year old economist was proposed to help Italy reduce public debt and boost a weak banking sector.Savona, however, is also known to have criticized the European Union and European integration which hasn’t gone down well with Mattarella. Instead, Carlo Cottarelli, a former International Monetary Fund official, has been asked by Mattarella to form a new government. But, it’s highly unlikely that he will be able to win a vote of confidence in the parliament and would thus continue to remain as the caretaker government till fresh elections take place.What Italy’s Crisis Means for European and US InvestorsInvestors are worried that if the populist parties win the election, it can lead to the Eurozone’s third largest economy leaving the shared currency. This in turn will, without doubt, disrupt Europe’s status quo. Italy’s efforts to abandon the shared currency will not only affect Europe but also U.S. markets. Any attempt to ditch the euro will hamper “euro boom” and delay the U.S. monetary normalization process.The euro tanked to a six-month low versus the dollar on May 29, while Italian stocks led European equities lower. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 1.4%, while Italy’s FTSE MIB closed 2.7% lower. This selloff, even, spread to Wall Street. The Dow Jones lost nearly 400 points and erased year-to-date gains.The broader S&P 500 also shed 31.47 points, with nine of the 11 main sectors finishing in the red. Financials led the declines, down 3.4%, tracking declining Treasury yields. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note dropped 16 basis points to 2.772%, the steepest drop since Brexit vote in June 2016. Political turmoil in Italy drove demand for safe havens such as U.S. and German government paper, pulling down yields.The tech-heavy Nasdaq declined 37.26 points, or 0.5%, to 7,396.59. Market volatility gauge, in the meanwhile, hit a 2-month high as Italy’s political mess sparked a global equity selloff.Why is Italy’s Crisis a Buying Opportunity?Even though Italy’s troubles are casting a pall over the financial markets, it does provide a buying opportunity for astute investors. It’s not the first time that countries facing debt burden and restrictive fiscal and monetary policies are threatening to pull out from the single currency regime. In the prior crises, stock investors did freak out, but more often than not, it recovered quickly. In fact, the stock market in a very short span bounced back to the level prior to the crisis.The best example will be the stock market’s reaction to the U.K.’s June 2016 referendum to exit the European Union. The Dow Jones nosedived almost 1,000 points in the two trading sessions following the vote. But, it took just eight subsequent trading sessions for the blue-chip index to reach where it was before the Brexit vote.Also, consider the market’s reaction to the debt crisis in Greece. In the subsequent years, a slew of fiscal and monetary deals were struck between the Greek government and the stronger European allies. This soothed investors and helped the stock market rally in the wake of the looming threat.Flip Italy’s Political Hullabaloo With These 5 Top Stocks               Going by the above-mentioned trends, it’s widely expected that the stock market will discount Italy’s crisis in the near term. A smart investor, thus, should bet on fundamentally solid stocks that will make the most when the broader market moves north. Also, by purchasing stocks right after a dip, investors are essentially buying shares at a discounted price.We have, thus, selected five such stocks that should make meaningful additions to your portfolio.

294,CMA,"The days of increased regulatory scrutiny are over for U.S. financial stocks. The Congress approved a plan on May 22 to scale down stringent banking regulations or the Dodd-Franck act undertaken in the height of the 2008 financial crisis.While the move sounds great for the entire banking industry, small-cap banks should actually jump in joy. SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE  -  Free Report) gained 0.6% on May 22 while SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE  -  Free Report) advanced 0.4%. Direxion Regional Banks Bull 3X (DPST  -  Free Report) gained about 1.53% on May 22.Inside the Dodd-Frank LawsThe Dodd-Frank Act is a U.S. federal law that entrusts the government with the regulation of the financial industry. The focus of the law was to cut back on uncontrolled lending and avoid the situation where tax-payers' money is needed to bail out large financial institutions. The Act increased the operating expenses of financial institutions given the rise in compliance costs. Further, stringent capital requirements led banks to curb investments.Why Is the New Rule Especially Beneficial for Small Banks?From his campaign days, President Trump addressed the Dodd-Frank regulatory revamp as needlessly strict on smaller banks.The bill lowers federal oversight of banks between $50 billion and $250 billion in assets, and “eases lending, capital and trading rules for smaller lenders,” per Reuters. Now, since the days of increased regulatory scrutiny seem to be phasing out, regional banking stocks are likely to be performing at peak levels.But big bank lobbyists and analysts are of the opinion that the latest easing will do little to comfort the stringency pertaining to the nation’s largest lenders. Large banks lobbied a lot to increase that oversight limit to $500 billion, or resort to a more lenient approach to big bank scrutiny, but small banks strived to cap the threshold at $250 billion, according to Reuters (read: Play Banking Bonanza with These ETFs in Trump World).Most importantly, the new bill relaxed capital, lending and trading rules of the banks on the basis of asset-size limits, not by firm type or activities. As a result, big banks, many of those that have size to tune of $10 billion, failed to qualify for the rule.Against this backdrop, investors can surely dip their toe in regional and community bank ETFs and stocks.ETFs to BuySPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE  -  Free Report)The fund looks to track the S&P Regional Banks Select Industry Index.

295,CMA,"Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) can be a solid bet now on the back of its leading global position in completed mergers and acquisitions in 2017. The company’s strong client activity amid volatile markets is anticipated to yield positive results for the stock.Organic growth, cost management and steady capital-deployment activities continue to drive Goldman’s growth. However, litigation issues remain concerns.Expense management and business diversification aided the company to gain 6.3% compared with 32.3% growth of the industry.Further, the company’s earnings estimates moved 6.6% upward, for the current year, over the past 60 days. As a result, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).For the past few years, Goldman has been benefiting from its successful expense-reduction initiatives. Though expenses have been volatile, the figure declined significantly in 2016, but increased 3% in 2017 and 21% in first-quarter 2018. The company is focused on improving efficiency while maintaining strong franchise and investing in new opportunities. Notably, Goldman’s $5 billion of growth initiatives is expected to drive an incremental $2.5 billion in annual pre-tax earnings, at a 30% marginal ROE.While overall revenues have been affected by unfavorable market conditions over the last few quarters, Goldman remains well positioned for growth, given its strong investment banking operations and solid client franchise. These, in turn, are likely to help the company leverage on the improving environment.Furthermore, the key source of the company’s earnings stability is its business diversification. Within traditional banking, a diversified product portfolio has higher chances of sustaining growth than many other banks, which have exited some of these areas.Driven by a solid capital position, Goldman has consistently enhanced shareholders’ value with steady capital-deployment activities. Its 2017 capital plan won regulatory approval that includes share buybacks and an increase in quarterly common stock dividend, along with issuance and redemption of other capital securities. In April 2018, the company increased its common stock dividend by 6.7%.Stocks to ConsiderNorthern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report) has been witnessing upward estimate revisions for the last 60 days.

296,CMA,"Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report), headquartered at Cincinnati, OH, entered into a stock-cash acquisition deal with Chicago, IL-based MB Financial, Inc. (MBFI  -  Free Report), under which the former will be merged with the latter, for a total value of $4.7 billion. The combined entity will form the fourth largest bank in Chicago, in terms of deposits, with a 6.5% market share.However, shares of Fifth Third depreciated 7.93%, following the announcement, as investors’ concerns were visible on the deal value which seems to be highly priced as per market sentiments.The merged entity will stand second in estimated retail deposits and will acquire 20% share of middle-market relationships in Chicago. However, the deal awaits meeting all customary closing conditions, including certain regulatory approvals and MB Financial shareholders’ approval.“There were no other potential partners of the same caliber as MB Financial in the Chicago market, and we are very pleased to reach an agreement to merge our companies. We view MB Financial as a unique partner in our efforts to build scale in this strategically important market. Customers of both banks will benefit from greater convenience and the complementary capabilities that our banks, together, can offer,” said Greg D. Carmichael, chairman, president and CEO of Fifth Third.Terms of the DealPer the deal, each common shareholder of MB Financial will get $54.20 of total value, based on the closing price of Fifth Third as on May 18. Notably, the total value indicates a premium of about 24% to share price of MB Financial as of May 18.The consideration includes stock equivalent to 1.45 of per Fifth Third share and $5.54 in cash for every MB Financial share held. The deal has been agreed upon 90% stock and 10% cash.Per the terms, two members of MB Financial’s board of directors might join the board committee of Fifth Third, on closing of the deal.MB Financial, with about $20 billion in assets, serves middle-market customers as a leader with its strong deposit franchise, customer-centric corporate culture and commercial expertise. On completion of the merger, MB Financial’s strengths and Fifth Third’s huge corporate lending, capital markets, wealth management and the payments business will benefit customers with the complementary capabilities of both banks.Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) acted as financial advisor for Fifth Third, while Sandler O’Neill + Partners acted for MB Financial.After-Effects of the DealThis strategic-fit deal for Fifth Third comes with some financial benefits as well. The merged entity is expected to record an IRR of about 18.5% and be accretive to Fifth Third’s operating EPS in the first year. Moreover, accretion of about 7% is expected in the second year, on realization of full cost savings.Per Carmichael, this merger is expected to speed up achieving NorthStar financial targets and might improve the prior guidance as well.“This merger also allows us to leverage MB Financial’s talented management team. That begins with the selection of Mitch Feiger as Chairman and CEO for our Chicago region, and we expect it to include other key members of the MB Financial leadership team. On a combined basis, we will have the best talent in the market,” Carmichael commented.Furthermore, the deal will reduce Fifth Third’s regulatory common equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio by nearly 45 basis points. The pro forma tangible common equity to tangible assets (TCE) ratio of the combined entity is estimated to be 8.2%.Notably, before the MB Financial’s shareholder vote for the deal, Fifth Third plans to complete its 2017 CCAR buyback plan with the repurchase of common stock worth $235 million. Also, additional repurchase will be subject to regulatory approvals after the vote.Bottom LineWe believe the latest acquisition is a befitting one that will support the future prospects of Fifth Third in commercial banking. Post merger, the bank will be able to cater smaller commercial clients, along with the existing large corporate clients, in the highly competitive Chicago market.The company’s repositioning and restructuring efforts, which are still underway, help it reallocate the capital into core markets. Additionally, its focus on cost control and efforts to boost long-term profitability are anticipated to augur well.Such moves have caused investors to become optimistic about Fifth Third's growth prospects. Notably, the company's share price rose nearly 8.7% over the last six months as compared with 7.3% growth recorded by the industry.Currently, Fifth Third carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

297,CMA,"Longtime CEO of Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) — Lloyd C. Blankfein — is likely to retire by the end of 2018, per an article by The New York Times. Aged 63, Blankfein has served Goldman Sachs since 2006 and has been successful in keeping the bank afloat in difficult times like the financial crisis. Over the recent months, he has been setting the ground for his exit.Per the article, Blankfien is likely to be replaced by current president of the Goldman Sachs, David M. Solomon, who has already began shaking the senior management team.

299,CMA,"Moody's Investors Service — a rating arm of Moody's Corporation (MCO  -  Free Report) — affirmed all the ratings of Comerica (CMA  -  Free Report) and its subsidiaries. The banking giant’s long-term issuer rating and a senior unsecured rating have been affirmed at A3. The bank’s subsidiary has deposit ratings of Aa3/Prime-1 and a standalone baseline credit assessment (BCA) of a2.The bank’s counterparty risk assessments is A1(cr)/Prime-1(cr).Further, Comerica’s shelf registration has been assigned prospective ratings. The shelf senior unsecured and subordinate is rated at (P)A3, while (P)Baa1 is assigned for cumulative preferred stock, and (P)Baa2 for non-cumulative preferred stock.The rating firm’s outlook for the bank remains “stable”.Rationale Behind the AffirmationThe rating affirmation follows Comerica's strong asset quality performance and traditional credit culture, including conservative underwriting standards. Moreover, solid liquidity position is another driving factor.Per Moody’s, the bank’s capital position is below the median of its peers, and Comerica’s inconsistent earnings due to the historical low level of interest rates posed a credit challenge.Further, Comerica maintains modest growth targets and a diversified loan mix with no exposure to real estate. Nevertheless, though the bank is exposed to an above-average energy exposure due to its Texas footprint, it met Moody's expectations in asset-quality performance and risk management during the energy sector slump.Per Moody's, rising rates aiding Comerica's profitability is expected to record a lower payout ratio. In addition, capital metrics of the bank are expected to remain stable in the near term, along with its modest growth expectations.However, per the rating agency, Comerica might get removed from the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) process by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act which might result in higher shareholder returns and lower capital ratios. Notably, this act amplifies total consolidated assets from $50 billion to $250 billion of a bank to get qualified for a systemically important financial institution (SIFI).Comerica currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The company’s stock has gained around 24% over the last six months, outperforming 2.2% growth recorded by the industry. Stocks to ConsiderBankUnited, Inc.

301,CMA,"Benefits from a stabilizing economy and improving interest-rate scenario have well positioned the banking industry. Moreover, tax overhaul and an expected ease in regulation could bring more benefits.The Zacks Major Regional Banks Industry has rallied 5.6% over the past six months, despite the not-so-impressive earnings results in the last two quarters of 2017. This compares with the S&P 500’s gain of 4.3% and 4.2% rally of the Financial Select Sector SPDR fund (XLF), a top bank ETF, over this period.Therefore, we are focusing on two major banks, M&T Bank (MTB  -  Free Report) and Comerica (CMA  -  Free Report).M&T Bank, with a market cap of $25.4 billion, offers a wide range of retail and commercial banking services with 780 banking offices in the United States, a commercial banking office in Canada, and an office in the Cayman Islands. On the other hand, Comerica provides various financial products and services in Texas, California, Michigan, Arizona, Florida, Canada and Mexico, and has a market cap of $14.6 billion.Both M&T Bank and Comerica carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Though both banks have similar business trends, deeper research into the financials will help decide which investment option is better.Price PerformanceBoth banks have outperformed the industry (down 2.7%) year to date and gained decently. While shares of Comerica have rallied 8.1%, M&T Bank has recorded growth of 5.2%. So, Comerica performed better than M&T Bank.Return on Equity (ROE)ROE is a measure of a company’s efficiency in utilizing shareholders’ funds. ROE for the trailing 12-month period is 10.12% for M&T Bank and 10.94% for Comerica as compared with the industry’s level of 10.68%. Therefore, Comerica reinvests its earnings more efficiently.Earnings Estimate Revisions & Growth ProjectionsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings of M&T Bank has increased slightly over the last 30 days. On the other hand, the same for Comerica inched up nearly 1% for this year, over the same time frame.Moreover, current-year earnings for M&T Bank are projected to jump 30.7% year over year. For Comerica, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $6.37 for 2018, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 34.4%.Hence, Comerica reflects better earnings growth prospects.Sales GrowthSales for M&T Bank for the current year are projected to move up 3.4% year over year to $5.8 billion. For Comerica, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $3.4 billion for 2018, reflecting year-over-year growth of 6.2%.Therefore, Comerica has an edge here as well.Dividend YieldBoth companies have been deploying capital in terms of dividend payments to enhance shareholder value. Comerica has a current dividend yield of 1.28%, while M&T Bank has a dividend yield of 1.67%.Although both the stocks’ dividend yield is lower than the industry’s average of 2%, shareholders of M&T Bank gain more.Leverage RatioBoth M&T Bank and Comerica have lower debt-to-equity ratio compared with the industry average of 0.91. However, M&T Bank, with a ratio of 0.54, has an edge over Comerica with a ratio of 0.58.ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that Comerica is better positioned than M&T Bank when considering price performance and ROE, along with earnings and sales growth expectations. M&T Bank wins on dividend yield and leverage ratio.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

302,CMA,"The banking industry has been undergoing a massive overhaul since the past year and the same is expected to continue in the near term. Benefits from the efforts will support the banks’ financials, thus boosting their prospects.While price performance of banking stocks was not impressive in first-quarter 2018 due to several macroeconomic factors that led to huge sell offs, the stocks will be positively impacted by other factors in the quarters ahead.In the first three months of 2018, the Zacks Major Banks industry declined 2.7% while Banks & Thrifts rallied 1.2%. Notably, the Zacks Finance sector fell 2.1%, over the same time frame.Factors to Benefit Banks in Q2First and foremost is the rising rate environment. Continuation of hike in interest rates (driven by higher inflation prospects and low level of unemployment rate) and the unwinding of the Fed’s balance sheet have the potential to boost banks’ revenues significantly. Therefore, this will likely keep the momentum going for the banks.Secondly, the new tax legislation will lower effective tax rates for some of the big names in the industry such as JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report). This will, thus, enable them to earn more profit. Additionally, reduced tax rates will likely provide stimulus to the economy, therefore indirectly benefiting banks.Thirdly, banks’ continuous focus on digitization of banking operations reflects a move toward more customer friendly services. Banks have been undertaking efforts to align their banking network according to clients’ needs and upgrading ATMs with latest technology. These are expected to result in more customer engagement at a lower cost.Lastly, as the bill on rolling back of the 2010 Dodd-Frank banking legislation is expected to become a law soon, all banks, big-and-small are expected to reap benefits. The bill is aimed at lowering compliance costs and hence will help boost profitability.With banks gaining from the above-mentioned factors, this is the right time to add a few stocks to your portfolio at low prices and get attractive returns in the quarters ahead.Choosing the Winning Bank StocksThough all banks are expected to gain in the coming days, picking a handful of these is not an easy task.Hence, we have taken the help of the Zacks Stock Screener to shortlisted bank stocks with a projected first-quarter 2018 earnings growth rate of 10% or more and market capitalization greater than $2 billion.

303,CMA,"The employees at the brokerage division of Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) are being investigated for any possible customer abuses made by them. Recently, William Galvin, the top securities regulator of Massachusetts announced that his office has started investigating the wealth management arm of Well Fargo to see if the division has been steering rollover money into managed accounts or if its employees have been making investment recommendations that are unsuitable for its clients’ needs.This investigation comes almost a week after Wells Fargo, in its 10K filing, revealed that it was conducting an internal review to assess whether there had been unjustified referrals or recommendations, with respect to rollovers for 401(k) plan participants, alternative investments and referrals of brokerage customers to the bank’s investment and fiduciary services business.Wells Fargo had agreed to do a detailed investigation, only after facing probes from the financial regulators in late 2017 for forcing customers to buy products and services they did not require.The bank did find that in some cases customers were overcharged in connection with certain assets and accounts. There have been issues with incorrect set-up and maintenance in the system of record of the values associated with certain assets.However, Wells Fargo has not yet determined the number of accounts that were affected, along with the reasons that led to the wrongdoings.Shea Leordeanu, a spokeswoman for the bank’s brokerage division, recently stated that the bank has made ""significant progress in our work to identify and fix any issues, make things right and build a better, stronger company.""Thus, Galvin said that his office was seeking information about the scope of Wells Fargo’s investigation. They have asked the bank to give them information regarding “inappropriate referrals of brokerage customers to managed and advisory accounts, unsuitable recommendations of alternative investments, as well as unsuitable referrals and recommendations in connection with 401(k) rollovers.”Galvin mentioned, “Given the recent retirement savings crisis in America, referrals and recommendations involving 401(k) accounts should be closely scrutinized, in light of the Department of Labor’s Fiduciary Rule.”Troubles started for Wells Fargo since September 2016 when its employees, seeking to hit sales targets, opened millions of unauthorized accounts for its customers without their prior permission. To settle the case, the bank had agreed to pay $190 million to the federal and state regulators.Galvin said in a statement, ""Wells Fargo's recent banking scandal, which involved opening bogus accounts for their customers, leads me to believe that where there is smoke, there's fire. I need to be assured that Massachusetts residents haven't been burned by corporate greed.""We believe that while these legal expenses are likely to hurt Wells Fargo’s bottom-line growth, its consistent growth in loans and deposits, lower tax rate and expansions will likely support its growth profile.Shares of the company gained 12% in the past six months, underperforming 20.6% growth of its industry.Currently, Wells Fargo carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks from the same space are BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report), Citigroup Inc.

304,CMA,"Investors seeking momentum may have SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE  -  Free Report) on radar now. The fund recently hit a new 52-week high. Shares of KRE are up approximately 30.8% from their 52-week low of $49.31/share.But could there be more gains ahead for this ETF? Let’s take a look at the fund and the near-term outlook to get a better idea of where it might be headed.KRE in FocusKRE focuses on providing exposure to the regional banking space of the U.S. equity markets. The fund’s top three holdings are Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report), Popular Inc. (BPOP  -  Free Report) and Regions Financial Corporation (RF  -  Free Report) with 2.6% allocation each (as of Mar 6, 2018). The fund charges 35 basis points in fee per year and has AUM of $5.2 billion (see all Financials ETFs here).Why the move?The Senate is expected to take up the issue of deregulation among banks and adjust the size at which banks are subject to certain regulatory measures, driving regional banking stocks higher. This move is an attempt to exempt smaller banks from some requirements and regulatory scrutiny for loans, mortgages etc. The bill aims to change some parts of the Dodd-Frank act written after the 2008 crisis. The bill is likely to pass, as it has enough support from the Republicans and Democrats to clear the 60-vote threshold.More Gains Ahead?KRE has a weighted alpha of 19.10. Moreover, the fund has a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with a High risk outlook.

305,CMA,"CIT Group Inc.’s (CIT  -  Free Report) efforts toward streamlining operations to improve efficiency are impressive. Given a solid capital position, the company is likely to continue enhancing shareholder value through efficient capital deployment activities.The company’s price performance also looks encouraging. Its shares have gained 31.1% in the past year, outperforming 5.6% growth of its industry.Also, its Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year earnings has been revised 1.9% upward over the past 30 days, reflecting analysts’ optimism about its earnings growth potential.However, persistently rising expenses, worsening credit quality and sluggish growth in the industries, where CIT Group provides finance, continue to be the key concerns and hence make us a little apprehensive about its growth prospects. Thus, the stock currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past few years, CIT Group has been taking several initiatives to restructure and streamline its operations with the aim of improving efficiency and becoming a regional commercial banking institution. As part of these efforts, it has made several divestures. Recently, in October 2017, the company agreed to sell Financial Freedom and the reverse mortgage portfolio to exit reverse mortgage operations. Earlier, in June, it announced a deal to sell its European Rail business, while in April the company sold stakes in the joint ventures with Tokyo Century Corporation and divested its aircraft leasing business.Also, the company’s efforts toward restructuring its balance sheet through repayment and refinancing of high-cost debt should lower its funding cost and continue to support net finance margin growth.Moreover, given a solid capital position, the company remains well poised to deploy capital meaningfully, thereby continuing to enhance shareholder value.However, continuously rising expenses remain a major concern for the company. Persistent rise in compensation costs, professional fees and technology costs are the primary reasons for the elevated costs. Though the company is taking several cost-saving initiatives, expenses are expected to remain elevated because of its continued investments in franchise. Thus, higher costs are likely to hurt bottom-line growth.Also, the company has been facing deteriorating credit quality over the past few years. Provision for credit losses increased at a six-year (2012-2017) CAGR of 22.4%. Because of the company’s plans of becoming a leading national middle-market bank, loan balances are likely to rise in the future thereby leading to even higher provisions.Further, sluggish growth in the industries, where the company provides finance, remains a concern as it might hamper its prospects as borrowers may not be able to make timely payments of loans and interest.Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks from the finance space are The Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD  -  Free Report), Citigroup Inc.

306,CMA,"Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) exhibits mixed prospects for revenue growth, but cost-saving initiatives are expected to support bottom-line growth. However, litigation issues remain a concern.Expense management and streamlining operations internationally aided the company to surge 23% over the past year compared with 15% growth registered by the industry.Moreover, the company’s earnings estimates have been revised slightly upward, for the current year, over the last 30 days. As a result, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Citigroup has been emphasizing on growth in core businesses. Further, the company continues to optimize its branch network, with focus on core urban markets, improving digital channels and reducing branches. It is also making investment in several areas to stoke growth. Additionally, the ongoing investments in branded cards support the company’s growth strategy.The company’s operating expenses witnessed a negative CAGR of 9.2% over four years (2014-2017). Expenses dropped as the impact of higher volume-related expenses and ongoing investments were more than offset by efficiency savings and wind-down of legacy assets. Though revenues remained volatile over the past few years, the company recorded 2% year-over-year improvement in 2017. We expect the bank to record significant growth in revenues in the near term, backed by continued economic recovery and focus on core operations with strategic actions. Notably, for 2018, management projects top-line growth at around 3%, with stronger growth in operating businesses being offset by the persistent wind down of legacy assets.Stocks to ConsiderComerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) has been witnessing upward estimate revisions for the last 60 days.

The growth has been reflected in the company’s several major acquisitions in and outside of the United States, in the last several years. The completion of the merger with Hudson City in November 2015 expanded the company’s retail branch network in the Eastern United States, with access to 135 Hudson branches, situated primarily in New Jersey. Further, product and balance-sheet diversification, stemming from the acquisition, will likely support the company’s top line.Steady Capital Deployment: M&T Bank’s capital deployment activities remain impressive. The company announced an additional share buyback plan of up to $745 million in February 2018. Further, it’s 2017 capital plan includes a dividend hike on common stock in the range of 5-80 cents per share to be provided in second-quarter 2018.Strong Leverage: M&T Bank’s debt/equity ratio is valued at 0.54 compared with the industry average of 0.91, indicating relatively lower debt burden.

310,CMA,"Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report) has recently been fined $7.3 million by Hong Kong’s securities regulator. The Securities and Futures Commission said that the bank failed to discharge its duties of conducting proper due diligence as a sponsor for China-based Real Gold Mining Ltd.’s initial public offering (IPO) in 2009.The mining company was banned from trading since 2011 after irregularities were found in its accounting system.Yesterday, the SFC said that the bank “failed to conduct adequate and reasonable due diligence on Real Gold’s customers and properly supervise its staff when carrying out the sponsor work on Real Gold’s listing application”.While conducting interviews with the customers of the mining company, Citigroup -- without verifying their identities -- discussed the numbers that were given by the company.Notably, in case any untrue or misleading statements are found in the offer documents during an IPO, the sponsor is held accountable.Being concerned about poor and insufficient advisory work and the lack of proper due diligence, the SFC conducted investigations on almost 15 firms that acted as sponsors for IPOs in Hong Kong.The SFC stated that Real Gold’s IPO was the only listing application that Citigroup sponsored in Hong Kong. It also noted that the breaches made by the bank were not deliberate.James Griffith, a Hong Kong-based spokesman for Citigroup said, “The resolution announced by the SFC does not involve any license suspension and does not place any constraints on Citi’s business activities or on any individual in Hong Kong or elsewhere.”Notably, in March, UBS Group AG (UBS  -  Free Report) was banned from sponsoring IPOs in Hong Kong for almost 1.5 years for a sponsor work that it conducted on an IPO in 2009.Citigroup continues to encounter many investigations and lawsuits from investors and regulators. Though the company resolved certain litigations related to the sale of risky mortgage-backed securities and other issues, many of the cases are yet to be resolved.While a diversified business model, focus on core operations, streamlining of international businesses and strategic investments are expected to continue supporting Citigroup’s growth, such legal issues might lead to increased expenses, thereby hurting bottom-line growth.Shares of the company have gained 17.1% in the past year, underperforming 20.4% growth of the industry.Currently, Citigroup carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A couple of better-ranked stocks from the same space are Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) and State Street Corporation (STT  -  Free Report).

311,CMA,"Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) has landed in trouble again thanks to its employees, who reportedly modified or added false information related to corporate customers, without their knowledge, in order to meet a regulatory deadline. The news was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.Despite strict regulatory scrutiny and promises made by Wells Fargo to improve internal controls, disclosure of such misconducts continues to shake investors’ confidence in the stock. Shares of Wells Fargo dropped 1.5% in yesterday’s trading session. Per the report, the scandal happened between late 2017 and first few months of 2018. Employees at its Wholesale Banking segment added or changed some personal information such as birth dates, social security numbers and addresses of clients during that period.Citing people familiar with the matter, Wall Street Journal reported that Wells Fargo has been facing a Jun 30 deadline to comply with a regulatory order related to anti-money laundering controls.  In an internal investigation, Wells Fargo became aware of these misdoings. The matter is currently under investigation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.A spokeswoman at Wells Fargo said, ""This matter involves documents used for internal purposes. No customers were negatively impacted, no data left the company, and no products or services were sold as a result.""Last week, Wells Fargo had launched an ad-campaign — Re-Established — with an aim to gain back the lost reputation by highlighting steps it has taken to repay customers and change its practices.However, findings of these sort continue to test regulators tolerance toward Wells Fargo’s wrongdoings. In its Investors’ Day held on May 10, the bank said that it expects to continue operating with the regulatory cap on its assets till the first part of 2019. This disclosure might extend that to an even longer time.Also, the company’s bottom-line remains under pressure due to unstable revenues. However, the bank has an impressive cost-control program underway, which might help it deal with the legal costs and improve financials.Shares of Wells Fargo have gained 2.1% in the past year, significantly underperforming the industry’s rally of 20.9%.Wells Fargo currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderNorthern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report) has been witnessing upward estimate revisions for the last 60 days.

312,CMA,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 6% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is CMA due for a pullback?

Including certain non-recurring items, earnings came in at $1.59. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was $1.49.Higher revenues and improved credit metrics were recorded. Moreover, rise in loans was another tailwind. However, lower deposits and rise in expenses were the undermining factors.Adjusted net income came in at $271 million, up 46.5% year over year.

Moreover, net interest margin expanded 56 basis points (bps) to 3.41%.Total adjusted non-interest income came in at $244 million, slightly down on a year-over-year basis. Lower card fees, commercial lending fees, bank-owned life insurance and other non-interest income were mostly offset by increased fiduciary income and brokerage fees.Further, adjusted non-interest expenses totaled $430 million, up 2.4% year over year. The rise was chiefly due to higher salaries and benefits expense and restructuring charges.Notably, Growth in Efficiency and Revenue (GEAR Up) Initiative Implementation resulted in increased pre-tax income of 25%.Solid Balance SheetAs of Mar 31, 2018, total assets and common shareholders' equity were $72.3 billion and $8 billion, respectively, compared with $73 billion and $7.9 billion as of Mar 31, 2017.Total loans inched up 1.9% year over year to $49.2 billion.

This, combined with dividends, resulted in a total payout of $201 million to shareholders.Impressive Outlook for 2018Comerica guided for 2018 compared with 2017, taking into consideration the current economic and rate environment, along with the GEAR Up initiative, resulting in $270 million of benefits.The company anticipates higher net interest income, including the benefit of short-term rate increase and loan growth.

313,CMA,"Ratings of Webster Financial Corporation (WBS  -  Free Report) and its bank subsidiary, Webster Bank N.A., was recently confirmed by Moody’s Investors Service. The outlook has remained stable.Wester Bank’s long and short-term deposits have been rated as A1/Prime-1 while standalone baseline credit assessment (BCA) is rated a3 and its counterparty risk assessments are A2(cr)/Prime-1(cr).Webster Financial has a long-term issuer rating and a senior unsecured rating of Baa1. Further, the company’s shelf registration was rated (P)Baa1 for senior unsecured, (P)Baa1 for subordinate, (P)Baa2 for cumulative preferred stock and (P)Baa3 for non-cumulative preferred stock.Per Moody’s, the ratings affirmation reflects the company’s sustainable business model and ability to maintain credit quality with support from robust liquidity position and improving credit metrics.Webster has a strong deposit base accounting for about 116% of gross loans. Such impressive deposits balance enables the bank to depend less on funding from external sources. Further, the company holds liquid assets of about 25% of tangible banking assets.Also, Moody’s finds Webster’s asset quality to be strong as indicated by ration of non-performing loans to total loans of 1.5% (as of Mar 31, 2018). Also, slowdown in loan growth is considered a positive.  Further, the rating agency noted that the rising interest rates continue to benefit its bottom line as the company’s revenues are dependent on spread income, and its balance sheet remains asset-sensitive.The adjusted tangible common equity as a percentage of risk-weighted assets has been calculated as 10.9% for Webster’s as of Dec 31, 2017. Moody’s finds the ratio to match the similarly-rated peer median. However, its current capital levels limit upward rating pressure.  Ratings of Webster can be upgraded if it delivers a sustained improvement in capital and an above-average asset quality performance. On the flip side, a downward rating in its standalone BCA is plausible on account of aggressive capital actions and a reduction in liquid banking assets.Shares of Webster Financial have gained 32.9% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s rally of 8.2%.Currently, Webster Financial carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Stocks to ConsiderNorthern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report) has been witnessing upward estimate revisions for the last 60 days.

314,CMA,"With strong fundamentals and organic growth prospects, Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) appears to be an attractive pick now. In addition, interest rate hikes and improving economy are anticipated to further improve profitability.Analysts seem to be optimistic about the company’s prospects as the stock has been witnessing upward estimate revisions.

In addition to this, Goldman recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 18.13%, over the trailing four quarters.Prudent Expense Management: Goldman has been benefiting from its successful expense-reduction initiatives for the past several years.

Notably, the company carried out an expense initiative during the first half of 2016, which translated into run-rate expense savings of around $700 million. It continued this initiative in the second half of 2016 as well, and generated nearly $900 million of run-rate savings. Notably, Goldman’s $5 billion of growth initiatives is expected to drive an incremental $2.5 billion in annual pre-tax earnings, at a 30% marginal ROE.Diversification: While overall revenues have been affected by unfavorable market conditions in the last few quarters, Goldman remains well positioned for growth, backed by its sound investment banking operations and solid client franchise. In traditional banking, a diversified product portfolio has higher chances of sustaining growth than many other banks.Notably, Goldman has been undertaking initiatives to fortify the GS Bank’s business by acquiring the online deposit platform of GE Capital Bank in April 2016. It also launched a digital consumer lending platform — Marcus by Goldman Sachs. Additionally, the company is likely to benefit from its exposure to the fast growing exchange-traded funds (ETF) market.Steady Capital Deployment: Goldman remains focused on managing its capital levels efficiently and has consistently enhanced shareholders’ value with steady capital-deployment activities. The company’s 2017 capital plan won regulatory approval that includes share buybacks and an increase in its quarterly common stock dividend, along with the issuance and redemption of other capital securities. In April 2018, the company increased its common stock dividend by 6.7%.Stock is Undervalued: Goldman has a P/E ratio of 10.38 compared to the industry average of 15.66. Further, the company has a P/B ratio of 1.26 compared to the industry average of 1.87. Based on these ratios, the stock seems undervalued.Bottom LineOrganic growth, expense management, robust capital position and steady capital-deployment activities continue to support Goldman’s growth opportunities. Furthermore, business diversification remains a key strength for earnings stability.Other Stocks to ConsiderNorthern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report) has been witnessing upward estimate revisions for the last 60 days.

315,CMA,"We expect American Express Co. (AXP  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter results on Apr 19, before market opens.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that American Express has the right combination of the two key ingredients to beat earnings estimates.Zacks ESP:  Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +2.04%.

Also, focus on existing card members and increased use of digital channels is expected to drive new card issuance.Nevertheless, card spending volumes at another of the company’s segments — Global Network and Merchant Services — is expected to be under pressure due to the changing regulatory environment specifically in the European Union, Australia and China.We also expect to see higher reward expense, which will weigh on margins, as the company has made enhancements to its U.S. platinum products to woo and retain its customers.American Express Company Price and EPS Surprise American Express Company Price and EPS Surprise | American Express Company QuoteOther Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may also consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:  Humana Inc.

317,CMA,"Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.0% in second-quarter 2017, riding on higher revenues. The company’s income from continuing operations per share of $1.27 for the quarter outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.21. Also, earnings compared favorably with the year-ago figure of $1.25 per share.Despite earnings beat, investors were a bit disappointed on elevated costs of credit which led shares to decline around 0.45% to close at $66.72.Net income came in at $3.9 billion or $1.28 per share compared with $4.0 billion or $1.24 per share recorded in the prior-year quarter.Overall revenues escalated, driven by higher banking revenues. However, expenses surged. Further, Citigroup’s costs of credit for the second quarter were up 22% year over year to $1.7 billion. The rise largely reflects net credit losses of $94 million and a net loan loss reserve release of $16 million.Higher Banking Revenues, Costs Flare UpRevenues increased 2% year over year to $17.9 billion in second-quarter 2017. The rise highlighted higher revenues in institutional clients group and global consumer banking, partially offset by decline in corporate/other revenues. The revenue figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.3 billion.At Institutional Clients Group (ICG), revenues came in at $9.2 billion in the quarter, up 6% year over year. Notably, revenues from total banking climbed 13%, partially offset by a 5% decline in total markets & securities services revenues on a year-over-year basis.Global Consumer Banking (GCB) revenues increased 5% year over year, mainly driven by higher revenues in North America, Latin America and Asia GCB.Corporate/Other revenues were $653 million, plunging 45% from the prior-year quarter. The decline mainly reflected legacy assets runoff and divestiture activity.Operating expenses at Citigroup were slightly up year over year to $10.5 billion. Further, expenses elevated 2% (in constant dollars) on increased volume-related expenses, performance-based compensation and ongoing investments. These were mostly offset by efficiency savings and the winding-down of legacy assets.Strong Balance SheetAt quarter end, Citigroup’s end of period assets was $1.86 trillion, up 2% year over year. The company’s loans grew 2% year over year at $645 billion. Deposits increased 2% year over year to $959 billion.Credit Quality ImprovedTotal non-accrual assets decreased 19% year over year to $5.1 billion. The company reported a decline of 23% in consumer non-accrual loans to $2.8 billion. In addition, corporate non-accrual loans of $2.1 billion went down 15% from the prior-year period.Citigroup’s total allowance for loan losses was $12.0 billion at quarter end, or 1.88% of total loans, down from $12.3 billion, or 1.96%, in the year-ago period.Solid Capital PositionAt the end of the reported quarter, Citigroup’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio was 13.0%, increasing from 12.5% in the prior-year quarter. The company’s supplementary leverage ratio for the reported quarter was 7.2%, down from 7.5% in the prior-year quarter.As of Jun 30, 2017, book value per share was $77.36 and tangible book value per share was $67.32, both up 6%, from the prior-year period.Capital DeploymentDuring second-quarter 2017, Citigroup repurchased about 29 million of common stock. Notably, the company returned around $2.2 billion to common shareholders as common stock repurchases and dividends.Our ViewpointResults reflected an impressive quarter for Citigroup. Furthermore, restructuring efforts, including streamlining moves, should continue to ease its burden on the expense base to some extent. The company exhibits capital strength that continues to support its dividend and a share buyback program. Moreover, rise in revenues is commendable.One can consider a strong brand like Citigroup to be a sound investment option over the long term, given its global footprint and attractive core business. Additionally, the company’s growth looks encouraging amid the rising rate environment, as well as expected potential ease of regulations under Donald Trump’s administration.However, several legal hassles remain concerns for the company. Citigroup Inc.

318,CMA,"Higher interest income drove Wells Fargo & Company’s (WFC  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 earnings which recorded a positive surprise of 4.9%. Earnings of $1.07 per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.02. Moreover, the figure compared favorably with the prior-year quarter’s earnings of $1.01 per share.Shares of Wells Fargo decreased more than 2% in the pre-market session, indicating that investors have been bearish on the results. The price reaction during the full-trading session will give a fair idea about the extent of disappointment among investors.Wells Fargo witnessed organic growth aided by strong loans and deposit balances. Higher net interest income was also favorable. In addition, a solid capital position and improving credit quality acted as the key positives. However, higher expenses and lower non-interest income were on the downside.Notably, reserve release of $100 million was recorded in the reported quarter, driven by strong credit performance. Second-quarter net income came in at $5.8 billion, up from $5.6 billion in the prior-year quarter.The quarter’s total revenue was $22.2 billion, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.3 billion. Revenues were in line with the prior-year quarter figure.Furthermore, on a year-over-year basis, revenue generation at the business segments was impressive. Community Banking and Wealth and Investment Management segments’ total quarterly revenue increased around 1.0% and 7.7%, respectively, while Wholesale Banking revenues declined around 4.5%.Loans and Deposits & Interest Income Rise, Costs EscalateWells Fargo’s net interest income in the quarter came in at $12.5 billion, up 6% on a year-over-year basis. Increased interest income from trading assets, investment securities, loans held for sale and mortgages held for sale, along with higher other interest income, mainly drove results. Further, net interest margin expanded 4 basis points year over year to 2.90%, reflecting a rising interest rate environment.Non-interest income at Wells Fargo came in at around $9.7 billion, down 7% year over year, primarily due to low mortgage banking revenue, lower net gains from trading activities and debt securities, along with reduced other income.As of Jun 30, 2017, total loans were $957.4 billion, up slightly year over year. Growth in commercial loan portfolio contributed to the rise, partially offset by reduction in consumer loan portfolio. Total deposits were $1.3 trillion, up 4.8% from the prior-year quarter.Non-interest expense at Wells Fargo was $13.5 billion, up 5% from the year-ago quarter. The upsurge in expenses primarily stemmed from higher FDIC and other deposit assessments, as well as elevated other and employee benefits and salaries expenses.The company’s efficiency ratio of 61.1% was above 58.1% recorded in the year-ago quarter. A rise in efficiency ratio indicates a fall in profitability.Credit Quality ImprovedWells Fargo’s credit quality metrics improved in the quarter. Allowance for credit losses, including the allowance for unfunded commitments, totaled $12.1 billion as of Jun 30, 2017, down 4.7% year over year.Provision for credit losses was $555 million, plunging 48.3% year over year. Net charge-offs were $655 million or 0.27% of average loans in the reported quarter, down 29.1% from the year-ago quarter net charge-offs of $924 million (0.39%). Non-performing assets were down 25.2% to $9.8 billion in the quarter under review from $13.1 billion in the prior-year quarter.Strong Capital PositionWells Fargo has maintained a sturdy capital position. In the reported quarter, the company repurchased 43 million shares of common stock.Wells Fargo’s Tier 1 common equity under Basel III (fully phased-in) increased to $151.9 billion from $145.6 billion in the prior-year quarter. The Tier 1 common equity to total risk-weighted assets ratio was estimated at 11.6% under Basel III (fully phased-in) as of Jun 30, 2017, compared with 10.6% recorded in the year-earlier quarter.Book value per share increased to $36.53 from $35.38 in the comparable period last year.Our ViewpointWells Fargo reported decent revenue numbers and we expect top-line headwinds to subside, given the improving interest rate environment. However, escalating expenses remained a major drag, along with slowdown in mortgage business.Cross-selling, which has been the company’s major strength in recent years, drew regulators’ attention as they discovered that thousands of bank employees were unlawfully enrolling consumers for products and services without their knowledge or consent, in order to receive incentives for meeting the sales targets. The bank has also been subjected to severe political and public outrage, and faced several lawsuits and investigations as well.Nevertheless, we believe that over the long term, investors will not be disappointed with their investment in Wells Fargo, given its diverse geographic and business mix, which enables it to sustain consistent earnings growth. We also believe that strategic acquisitions and the bank’s efforts to address current adversities will help the company expand its business and enhance profitability.Wells Fargo & Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Wells Fargo & Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Wells Fargo & Company QuoteCurrently, Wells Fargo carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

320,CMA,"Investors had a tough time making up their minds about Fed Minutes on Wednesday.  Initially, concerns about a lack of broad-based wage growth allayed ongoing fears that rising inflation would end the markets’ rally. However, things turned around completely during the last 45 minutes of the trading day following a spike in bond yields.Overall, the Fed’s latest report indicates that an increase in economic growth and an uptrend in inflation is reason enough for the central bank to keep raising rates. This was the one clear, unequivocal inflation which came through. Rate hikes will most certainly boost banks higher, which is why adding them to your portfolio looks like a smart option.Pace of Rate Hikes Likely to IncreaseA significant number of the participants of the Fed meeting held between Jan 30-31 said that they had raised their growth projections from the preceding month. Resilient global economic growth, bullish financial markets and the stimulus released by recent tax cuts would propel the economy higher than what is being currently expected.  Others were of the opinion that these same factors had increased “upside risks” for the economy.But the majority of the participants opined that firmer expectations for economic growth have raised the odds in favor of gradual monetary policy tightening. This view was reflected in the manner in which the report’s language was changed to include an indication regarding “further” rate increases.Scanty Evidence on Wage Growth?Members of the U.S. central bank agreed that they have failed to recognize the true impact of recent tax cuts. But there was uncertainty about what impact these cuts would have on wages. Following the tax cuts, several companies have issued bonuses to their employees. But the long term impact of these recent cash transfers remains unclear at this point.Ultimately, the Fed found little evidence up to their meeting about a sector wide increase in wage growth. This part of the report gladdened the hearts of investors initially.However, they were quick to recognize that the Fed’s meeting was closely followed by strong jobs data which reflected a year-over-year pickup in wage growth. Also released almost immediately afterward was strong CPI data which exceeded most expectations.Outlook for Inflation ImprovesOnly a “few” of the 12 districts surveyed by the Federal Reserve observed that companies in those regions had relevant pricing power. Meanwhile, a small section of officials took a dovish stance, arguing that inflation would continue to come in under the Fed target of 2%. They think recent tax cuts would force businesses to engage in a pricing war to capture market share.But the overwhelming majority of officials at the Fed projected that an increase in inflation was likely to ensue. According to the minutes, the index for core personal consumption expenditure or core PCE would increase at a noticeably faster pace this year. This would imply a substantial hike over the 1.5% pace recorded in December.Our ChoicesThe overall tone of the latest Fed meeting minutes indicates that a majority of members favor a gradual step up in rates over the current year. A strong growth environment supportive financial markets and recent tax cuts have pushed up growth projections which in turn have raised the odds for rate hikes.This is why it makes good sense to pick select bank stocks at this point. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics.M&T Bank Corporation (MTB  -  Free Report) is the holding company for M&T Bank and Wilmington Trust, National Association.M&T Bank has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

321,CMA,"On Apr 30, the Department of Commerce reported that personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index increased year-over-year to 2% in March, hitting the central bank’s target for the first time in a year. This is the first proper material indication of inflation in the U.S. economy. Notably, PCE index is a key inflation measurement tool and the central bank’s preferred inflation barometer.As inflation reached the Fed’s target level of 2%, the market is expecting any of the two strategies from the central bank. The central bank may raise the magnitude of benchmark interest rate or it may increase the number of interest rate hike in 2018. It may also speed up the winding down of its bond purchases further.Whatever may be the fact, higher interest rates will boost bank profits as they increase the spread between longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities. Moreover, President Trump has decided to do away with most of the regulations set down by the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, which imposed several stringent banking regulations. Considering these positives, investment in good banking stocks will be very lucrative.PCE Inflation Reaches Target BenchmarkThe PCE price index rose to an annual rate of 2% in March from 1.7% in February. The core PCE index — excluding food and energy — increased year-over-year to 1.9% in March from 1.6% in February. This is the biggest yearly gain in the core PCE inflation rate since April 2012.Price levels have been driven up by rising cost of oil, higher home prices, and a healthy labor market operating near its full employment level raising wages and salaries. A massive $1.5 trillion tax cut (including corporate and personal income tax) has bolstered both consumer and business confidence.March data released by the Department of Labor showed that consumer spending rose for the first time in three months, adding fuel to inflation.Meanwhile, Fed’s two day policy meeting is currently going on. Investors are expecting the central bank to raise interest rate latest by its next policy meeting if not this time.Trump Administration to Repeal Dodd-Frank RegulationsOn Mar 14, the U.S. Senate approved extensive changes to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law enacted by former President Obama in 2010. The U.S. House of Representatives is likely to vote in May on the bipartisan bill to repeal the stringent financial laws which were introduced during the financial crisis of 2008-2009.The bipartisan bill will enable banks with less than $250 billion in assets to skip yearly Federal Reserve stress tests for higher capital requirements. With this, dozens of regional banks will be exempt from submitting for Fed approval, a “living will”. Notably, Fed’s “living will” guideline provides rules about the liquidation of a bank upon failure without creating market turmoil.Additionally, the bill enhanced the scope of qualified mortgages. The banks which extend 500 or fewer mortgages a year will exempt from reporting various home loan data to the regulator.Our Top PicksStrong earnings, massive tax cuts and solid economic data are likely to boost consumer spending in the coming months forcing the price level to go up. This may prompt the Fed to aggressively implement tight monetary policy.

322,CMA,"Welcome to Episode #129 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast.Every week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life.In this episode, Tracey is joined by Sheraz Mian, Zacks Director of Research, to discuss the fantastic first quarter earnings season and the possibility of peak earnings.First Quarter Earnings are FantasticEarnings are turning out as everyone expected: great.Earnings are expected to rise 22.8% in the first quarter, up from a 13.4% gain in the fourth quarter of 2017.They’re also expected to be up by more than double digits in every remaining quarter of 2018.This has many worried about “peak” earnings and that this is the best that companies will be able to do.Is it peak earnings?And how should you invest if it is?Evolution of Q1 and Q2 Growth EstimatesMonths ago, it became obvious that the first quarter earnings season was going to be phenomenal because the first quarter growth estimates were soaring.But what about the second quarter?While earnings are expected to rise 17.9% in Q2, the evolution has been flat. There hasn’t been a rise in expectations since March.That means we’re not seeing as many surprise beats and raises. The strong earnings growth is already priced in.If This is Peak Earnings, Where Should You Invest?Two sectors are seeing strong earnings and revenue growth in the first quarter: finance and energy.Here are some finance favorites:1.       PacWest Bancorp (PACW  -  Free Report) is a big California regional bank. It just raised its dividend, which now yields 4.6%. It’s a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).2.       WesBanco (WSBC  -  Free Report) is a West Virginia regional bank which recently announced it was buying Farmers Capital Corporation for $378 million. Combined with other acquisitions, that buy should push it towards $12 billion in assets by the end of next year.3.       Comerica (CMA  -  Free Report) is a Texas regional bank with a forward P/E of 14. It pays a dividend yielding 1.3%. Earnings are expected to rise 40% in 2018. It’s also a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).4.       JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report) is in the Value Investor portfolio. It’s expected to grow earnings by 30% in 2018. This large cap bank pays a dividend that yields 2.1%.5.       Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) is the black sheep of the big banks. Shares are down nearly 14% year-to-date. But it’s also the cheapest of the big banks with a forward P/E of just 11.4. It also pays a dividend, currently yielding a healthy 3%.The energy sector also appears to be under valued compared to others. If oil prices rise into the $70 - $80 range, there could be an even bigger earnings growth upside.What else should investors know about peak earnings and where to look for investing ideas?Find out on this week’s podcast.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

323,CMA,"Hancock Holding Company  remains well positioned for growth given its strategic initiatives, persistent growth in loan and deposit balances, and improving interest rate environment.The company’s price performance also looks impressive. Its shares have gained 14.9% in 2017, outperforming 3.3% growth of the industry.Also, its Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has been revised more than 10% upward over the past 60 days, reflecting analysts’ optimism regarding its earnings growth potential.However, the continued rise in operating expenses and the company’s high exposure to risky loan portfolio remain major concerns.Hancock Holding remains focused on its organic growth strategy. Its revenues have seen a CAGR of 7% over the past four years (2014-2017), supported by continued rise in loans (total loans net of unearned income increased at a six-year CAGR of 10.4% (2012-2017). Moreover, the company’s implementation of initiatives to enhance its core revenues looks encouraging. Further, its deal to acquire the asset management and trust business of Capital One will likely continue to support growth.Additionally, given the gradual improvement in the rate environment, Hancock Holding’s net interest margin (NIM) started to witness an increase after facing a declining trend over the past several years. Given the continued rise in loan demand and potential for more rate hikes, NIM is expected to improve further.Moreover, given a solid liquidity position, the company is expected to continue enhancing shareholder value through consistent dividend payments.On the flip side, mounting expenses remain a concern for the company. Total non-interest expenses (excluding non-operating expenses) have seen a four-year (2014-2017) CAGR of 4.6%. In fact, expenses are likely to remain elevated in the near term as the company continues to expand inorganically and hire additional workforce.Also, the company has significant exposure to residential mortgage, construction and land development as well as commercial real estate loans, which are expected to hurt financials. Though the housing sector has been gradually improving, any future deterioration in the real estate prices will pose a risk for the company. Additionally, while oil prices have gradually stabilized and stress in energy portfolio is no longer a big concern, the company’s exposure to such portfolio calls for higher provisions, which will strain its profitability.A few other stocks in the finance space that are witnessing improving earnings estimate revisions are Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) and Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report).Citigroup has witnessed an upward earnings estimate revision of 6.8% for the current year over the past 60 days. Also, its share price is up nearly 24%, over the past year.BB&T’s earnings estimates have been revised upward by 12.1% for the current year in the past 60 days. Also over the past year, its share price increased nearly 10%.Comerica recorded an upward earnings estimate revision of 17.7% for the current year in the past 60 days. Also, its share price has increased more than 32% rise over the last year.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

324,CMA,"At annual Investors’ Day conference, JPMorgan’s (JPM  -  Free Report) management discussed the current macroeconomic backdrop and the path the company is taking to enhance profitability over the medium term. Also, the company provided first-quarter and full-year 2018 guidance.Along with this, the company provided details about how the newly implemented Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will affect its financials going forward. While, lower taxes will decrease the income tax expense for the company, the same will have a slightly negative impact on net interest income (NII). However, this decline in NII is expected to be partly offset by the rising rate environment and loan growth.Notably, JPMorgan set its medium-term targets of cost-to-revenue ratio of 55% (despite continued investments in franchise), return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) of nearly 17%, net payout ratio of 100% and Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 11-12%.Further, JPMorgan expects pre-tax income to be nearly $44-$47 billion over the medium term, up from $40 billion recorded in 2017.First-Quarter and 2018 GuidanceNet Interest Income: In first-quarter 2018, JPMorgan’s NII will be down modestly on a sequential basis due to the impact of the change in tax rates and a lower day count. For 2018, NII will come in the range of $54-$55 billion (up from $50 billion in 2017), benefiting from loan growth and higher rates.Average core loan growth (excluding CIB loans) is expected to be in the range of 6-7% in 2018.Non-interest income: Management projects first-quarter market revenues to increase mid to high single-digit rate on a year-over-year basis, based on market conditions. Further, investment banking is anticipated to remain stable or increase slightly year over year.The new revenue recognition accounting rule is expected to increase 2018 non-interest revenues by nearly $1.2 billion, with the majority of impacts on the Asset & Wealth Management segment. Excluding this impact, non-interest revenues for the full-year are projected to be up 7%.Operating Expenses: The new revenues recognition accounting rule is expected to increase 2018 expenses by nearly $1.2 billion with the majority of impacts on the AWM segment. Excluding this impact, JPMorgan expects adjusted expenses to be less than $62 billion.Effective Tax Rate: As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, 2018, effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 19-20%.This lower effective tax rate is expected to reduce tax-equivalent revenues and income tax expenses by $1.2 billion on an annual run-rate basis.Credit Quality: JPMorgan expects net charge-off (NCOs) rate in 2018, to be relatively flat across the wholesale and consumer segments. On the other hand, NCOs rate in Cards is expected to increase to 3.25% in 2018 from 2.95% in 2017, due to the seasoning of newer origination vintages.Our TakeGiven the higher rates and persistent loan growth, JPMorgan remains well positioned for further growth in NII. While a slowdown in trading activities along with other factors has hurt the company’s non-interest income over the past few years, the expectation of a rise in markets as well as investment banking revenues might have some positive impact on total fee income in the quarters ahead.Given the upbeat outlook and improving operating environment, the company has plenty of upside left. JPMorgan’s shares have gained 23.9% in 2017, outperforming the industry’s growth of 18.8%.Currently, JPMorgan carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Some other major banking stocks carrying the same Zacks Rank include Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), BB&T Corp. (BBT  -  Free Report) and Comerica Inc. (CMA  -  Free Report).Citigroup has witnessed an upward earnings estimate revision of 6.8% for the current year over the past 60 days. Also, its share price is up 24.1%, over the past year.BB&T’s earnings estimates have been revised upward by 12.1% for the current year in the past 60 days. Also over the past year, its share price increased 10.6%.Comerica recorded an upward earnings estimate revision of 17.7% for the current year in the past 60 days. Also, its share price has seen a 32.2% rise over the last year.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

Moreover, the bottom line compared favorably with the prior-year quarter’s earnings of 57 cents per share.Results were primarily driven by an increase in net interest income and lower provisions. Moreover, the company’s overall loans and deposit balances remained strong. However, higher expenses and lower non-interest income were the undermining factors.Net income for the quarter was $85.2 million, up from $62.3 million recorded in the prior-year quarter.Net Interest Income Improves, Costs EscalateNet revenues for the quarter were $275.8 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $265.3 million.

The fall was primarily due to lower net income from resolution of covered assets.Non-interest expenses increased 3.4% from the year-ago quarter to $161.8 million, primarily due to rise in employee compensation and benefit costs, depreciation of equipment under operating lease and other non-interest expenses.Credit Quality: Mixed BagAs of Mar 31, 2018, the ratio of net charge-offs to average loans was 0.20%, decreasing from 0.38% as of Dec 31, 2017.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate was $1.49. Higher revenues and improved credit metrics were recorded. Moreover, rise in loans was another tailwind.

326,CMA,"Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share of 57 cents beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 48 cents. The adjusted figure excludes the net positive impact of gains from the Vantiv merger with WorldPay and charges related to the valuation of the Visa total return swap and adjustment to litigation reserves.Results reflect increase in revenues along with significant decline in provisions. Expanding net interest margin and rising loans balance remain key positives. Strong capital position acted as a tailwind. However, increase in expenses was an undermining factor.Net income available to common shareholders came in at $689 million or 97 cents per share compared with $290 million or 38 cents per share as of Mar 31, 2017.Higher Revenues Partly Offset by Rise in Expenses Total adjusted revenues for the quarter came in at $1.55 billion, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The reported figure was up 5.2% year over year.Fifth Third’s net interest income (tax equivalent) came in at $999 million, up 6% year over year. The rise was primarily driven by higher short-term market rates and an increase in investment portfolio balances.Net interest margin expanded 16 basis points (bps) to 3.18%, mainly due to improved short-term market rates.However, non-interest income increased 74% year over year to $909 million (including certain non-recurring items). Excluding significant items, non-interest income was up 3% to $553 million. Notably, the quarter witnessed a rise in corporate banking, card and processing fees and mortgage banking revenues.Also, non-interest expenses climbed 6% year over year to $1.05 billion. Higher compensation expenses, technology and equipment expenses were offset by lower card processing expenses.As of Mar 31, 2018, average loan and lease balances were almost stable sequentially at $92.3 billion. Average total deposits increased slightly from the previous quarter to $103.5 billion.Credit Quality ImprovesTotal non-performing assets, including loans held for sale, were $528 million, down 27.7% from the year-ago quarter.

Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 11.95% compared with 11.90% at the end of the prior-year quarter. CET1 capital ratio (fully phased-in) was 10.82% compared with 10.76% at the end of the year-ago quarter. However, tier 1 leverage ratio was 10.11% compared with 10.15% in the prior-year quarter.Our ViewpointFifth Third’s first-quarter results were impressive. Its revenues continue to get support from growing easing pressure on NIM. Also, steady improvement in loan balance highlights its efficient organic growth strategy. Significant decline in provisions was another tailwind.Further, the company’s strong balance sheet might drive results in the upcoming quarters with support from lower tax rate and improving economic conditions. However, increasing expenses deter bottom-line growth to some extent.Fifth Third carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Also, the figure compared favorably with the prior-year quarter’s earnings of 91 cents.Results were primarily driven by rise in net interest income, lower expenses as well as lower provisions. Also, an improvement in overall asset quality was a tailwind.

The decline was due to a fall in capital markets-related income, mortgage-related income as well as client transaction-related fees.Non-interest expenses declined 3% from the year-ago quarter to $1.42 billion, largely due to lower operating losses and other non-interest expenses.Credit Quality ImprovedTotal non-performing assets were $778 million as of Mar 31, 2018, down 9% from the prior-year-quarter end.

Easing margin pressure and initiatives to enhance efficiency are likely to support its revenues. However, a slowdown in the mortgage business is expected to hurt the top-line growth. This makes us apprehensive for the near-term. Also, exposure to risky loan portfolio remains a concern.SunTrust Banks, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  SunTrust Banks, Inc.

These increases were partially offset by reduced average loan balances and elevated funding costs.Non-interest income jumped 7% to come in at $507 million.

On an adjusted basis, non-interest expenses flared up 2.9% year over year to $865 million, mainly due to rise in almost all components of expenses.Balance Sheet StrengthAs of Mar 31, 2018, total loans were slightly down year over year to $79.8 billion.

332,CMA,"S&P Global Ratings recently downgraded the ratings of Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) and its subsidiaries. The Wall Street biggie’s long-term issuer credit rating has been downgraded to ‘A-’ from ‘A’ and short-term issuer credit rating from ‘A-1’ to ‘A-2’. The credit profile has also been changed to ‘a’ from ‘a+’.However, the rating firm’s outlook for the bank has been affirmed at “stable”.Rationale Behind the DowngradeFollowing the consent order by the Federal Reserve which puts a cap on increasing assets beyond $1.95 trillion (as of Dec 31, 2017) for Wells Fargo due to poor governance and controls, S&P also downgraded the bank’s ratings.Per the rating agency, the regulatory risk of Wells Fargo seems more than expected, and duration of operational and governance improvement also is likely to take longer time. It has been more than a year since the news of the banking giant’s alleged involvement in unfair sales practices hit headlines. Moreover, the Fed’s latest move has escalated reputational headwinds for the bank which might result in more customer attrition impacting financial performance and credit metrics.Rating Outlook AffirmationAffirmation of stable outlook depicts S&P’s expectations of improved compliance and operational risk management of the bank with meeting the provisions of the Fed consent order. Further, the rating agency anticipates the banking giant to receive independent third-parties’ review confirmation of its processes on improvement plan by Sep 30, 2018.Additionally, competitive position of the bank in core businesses are predicted to be minimally affected due to regulatory growth restrictions, and S&P expects the bank to maintain its earnings growth and stable asset quality over the next two years. Capital equity Tier 1 ratio is also anticipated to be above the company's long-term target of 10%, and the S&P’s risk-adjusted capital ratio is likely to remain at the higher end of the 7-10% range.Rating Action by Other FirmRecently, Moody's Investors Service, a rating arm of Moody's Corporation (MCO  -  Free Report), affirmed all the ratings of Wells Fargo and its subsidiaries. The bank’s long-term deposit rating has been affirmed at A2, senior debt rating at Aa2 and subordinated debt rating at Aa3. The bank’s counterparty risk assessments is Aa1(cr)/Prime-1(cr). The bank’s subsidiary has deposit ratings of Aa1/Prime-1 and a stand-alone baseline credit assessment (BCA) of a2.However, the rating firm’s outlook for the bank has been downgraded to “negative” from “stable”.ConclusionCurrently, the banking giant is caught in a horde of litigations over several malpractices which have come into the spotlight. Also, the recent assets cap put on the bank by the Fed has disappointed investors. Therefore, it is going to be a long and expensive journey for Wells Fargo till it gets all the dust settled.The bank’s year-to-date performance reflects investors’ disappointment. Shares of Wells Fargo have declined 5.2%, underperforming the industry’s gain of 2.3%.Currently, Wells Fargo carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Stocks to ConsiderComerica (CMA  -  Free Report) has been witnessing upward estimate revisions for the last 60 days.

333,CMA,"Moody's Investors Service, a rating arm of Moody's Corporation (MCO  -  Free Report), recently affirmed all the ratings of Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) and its subsidiaries.

Moreover, the recent move by the Fed has increased reputational headwinds for the bank which might result in more customer attrition impacting financial performance and credit metrics. Therefore, the rating firm downgraded the outlook to negative.The allegation led to many setbacks involving the bank’s shattered image, numerous lawsuits, triggered federal and state investigations, congressional hearings and the bank’s former CEO — John Stumpf — losing his job. Further, suspension of business relations of the bank with states, including Illinois and California, were noted.Thus, post scandal, the bank undertook a number of steps to restore its reputation. It initiated an internal probe and hired a consultant to review its sales practices. Additionally, management proposed to eliminate sales goals for its retail banking business earlier than planned.According to Moody’s, Wells Fargo implemented aggressive sales strategies without proper risk-management practices and governance which resulted in the sales scandal. The rating firm expects the compliance and operational risk-management program of the bank will be improved going forward as required by the Fed. Therefore, future assessments of Moody’s of the bank’s corporate governance will depend upon the effectiveness of the bank in carrying out the initiatives for improvement.    Further, on the Fed’s approval, Wells Fargo will appoint independent third-parties to conduct the review of its processes and submit the results by Sep 30, 2018. The outcome of evaluation of such review by the Fed will decide the removal of recent sanctions on the bank.Ratings AffirmationMoody’s affirmed Wells Fargo's ratings on expectations of the bank’s strong credit metrics and liquidity position.

334,CMA,"We are almost in the middle of the earnings season, with results from more than 250 S&P 500 members already out. Major Banks on the index (accounting for nearly 45% of the Zacks Finance sector's total earnings) reported 2.4% year-over-year earnings growth. This compares unfavorably with 6.5% growth registered in the prior quarter.Major banks’ results in fourth-quarter 2017 were aided by an improving economy, higher interest rates and a slight rise in lending activities. Apart from these, strength in investment banking, a strong balance sheet and solid asset quality offered support. But these were not enough to boost their financial performance.Factors that weighed on major banks’ third-quarter financial performance persisted in the fourth quarter as well. These include trading weakness and slowdown in mortgage banking. Also, increased investments in technology to enhance digital offerings led to elevated expense levels.On top of these, earnings were adversely affected by huge one-time charges related to changes in the tax law, though the act will result in gains for banks over the long term.Wondering why should one invest in major banks despite dismal fourth-quarter performance? Well, there are several factors that will likely lead to improved performance for these banks going forward.Factors to Drive EarningsFirstly, if the Federal Reserve sticks to its plan of increasing rates three times in 2018, it will further help banks in expanding net interest margin. This along with rise in loan demand will eventually drive revenue growth.In case the inflation rate improves (the latest data indicates some improvement), there are chances of aggressive rate hikes by the Fed next year. So, banks are anticipated to benefit more.Secondly, while all sectors are likely to benefit from the lower tax rates, major bank are expected to gain the most because they are amongst the highest tax payers in the United States.Also, driven by the tax legislation provisions related to repatriation of overseas cash, banks will be in a win-win situation. This is because, as overseas cash is brought back, it will likely provide an impetus to M&As activities, thereby giving a boost to investment banking. Also, as the act will lower tax rates for wealthy individuals, asset management units of these banks are projected to witness a rise in fund inflow.Finally, growing investor optimism about reduced regulations is likely to boost bank stocks. Once there is a reduction in the number of banks tagged as systemically important financial institutions, the compliance costs for the major banks will decline.Upbeat ExpectationsMajor banks’ earnings are expected to accelerate in 2018 with 22.7% growth compared with 7.1% rise for the Finance sector. Also, we note that the industry is currently positioned at the top 6% out of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our back-testing shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one.Also, major banks seem undervalued compared with the broader finance sector. The industry’s current price-earnings (F1) and price/book ratios of 12.6 and 1.8, respectively, are lower than the finance sector figures.Therefore, we believe investors will benefit by betting on major bank stocks, as the industry is likely to perform better in the near term.Picking the Potential WinnersNot all major banking stocks appear to be wise investment options at the moment. Investors need to pick those stocks that have witnessed robust growth and still have plenty of upside left.With the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have selected major banks with Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy).

335,CMA,"Issues related to past misconducts continue for Wall Street biggie Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report). On Friday, Federal Reserve chairperson — Janet Yellen — punished the lender with new sanctions for the recently-revealed malpractices and fake accounts scandal which came into the limelight in September 2016.The Federal Reserve has ordered the bank to replace four board directors and also not increase its assets position beyond $1.95 trillion (as of Dec 31, 2017). Notably, Wells Fargo has been instructed to substitute three directors by April, and the fourth by the end of 2018.“We cannot tolerate pervasive and persistent misconduct at any bank and the consumers harmed by Wells Fargo requires the firm to improve its governance and risk management processes, including strengthening the effectiveness of oversight by its board of directors,” Janet Yellen said in a statement. “The enforcement action we are taking today will ensure that Wells Fargo will not expand until it is able to do so safely and with the protections needed to manage all of its risks and protect its customers”, she further noted.Therefore, the Fed’s recent action demonstrates poor governance, compliance and risk management of Wells Fargo associated with the sales practices scandal, as well as mishandling of auto-insurance and mortgage fees. Notably, it is restricted from growth until governance and risk management improve, however, the bank is allowed to continue with current banking activities.As a consequence of the consent order which puts a cap on increasing assets, Wells Fargo estimates its profit in 2018 to be cut down by $300-$400 million. Further, the bank will submit a plan within 60 days to the regulators, including the compliance and operational risk management program of improvement. On the Fed’s approval, Wells Fargo will appoint independent third-parties to conduct the review of its processes and submit the results by Sep 30, 2018.It has been more than a year since the news of Wells Fargo’s alleged involvement in unfair sales practices hit headlines. Apart from being penalized by the regulators with a fine of about $185 million, the bank had to go through a lot of restructuring. The disclosures by Wells Fargo revealed to have identified an additional 1.4 million of fake accounts apart from the 2.1 million accounts reported in September 2016.Currently, the banking giant is caught in a horde of litigations over several malpractices which have come into the spotlight. It is going to be a long and expensive journey for Wells Fargo till it gets all the dust settled.The bank’s performance over the past year reflects investors’ disappointment. Shares of Wells Fargo have gained 13.3%, significantly underperforming the industry’s rally of 24.9%. While the current crisis at Wells Fargo will take some time to alleviate, the company’s solid capital position, growing loans and deposits, and improving credit quality position it well for growth. Furthermore, the positive outcome of the recent move is likely to help this San Francisco-based bank regain its customers’ trust.Currently, Wells Fargo carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderJPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) has been witnessing upward estimate revisions for the last 60 days.

336,CMA,"As part of its 2017 capital plan (approved by the Federal Reserve), M&T Bank Corporation’s (MTB  -  Free Report) board of directors announced a 7% hike in the company’s quarterly common stock dividend. The revised quarterly dividend now comes in at 80 cents per share compared with the previous figure of 75 cents. This dividend will be paid on Jun 29 to shareholders of record as of Jun 1, 2018.Since the financial crisis, M&T Bank has raised its dividend twice. From paying 70 cents a share as quarterly dividend during the financial crisis, the company has come a long way in displaying its capital strength. Prior to this hike, the company had raised its dividend by 7% (from 70 cents to 75 cents per share) in February 2017.Considering Tuesday’s closing price of $184.39 per share, the dividend yield is currently valued at 1.74%.Alongside, the company has an impressive share-repurchase plan. The company’s 2017 capital plan included share buyback of up to $900 million, over the four-quarter period, effective July 2017. Notably, the company recently announced an additional share-buyback plan of up to $745 million as well.Investors interested in this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock can have a look at the bank’s fundamentals and growth opportunities.Revenue Growth: M&T Bank continues to make steady progress toward bolstering its revenues. Since 2008, the company has recorded a consistent rise in net interest income. Over the last five years (ended 2017), it has grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of nearly 9%, with the trend continuing into first-quarter 2018 as well.The company’s projected sales growth (F1/F0) of 4.47% indicates constant upward momentum in revenues.Earnings Per Share Strength: Earnings are anticipated to display an upswing in the near term, as the company’s projected EPS growth (F1/F0) is 33.9% compared to the industry average rate of 30%. Also, M&T Bank recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 3.96%, over the trailing four quarters.Inorganic Growth Routes: Given its robust liquidity position, M&T Bank is well positioned to grow on the back of acquisitions.

337,CMA,"Shares of Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) closed 1.7% higher yesterday, reflecting investors’ bullish stance on the bank’s impressive expense outlook and expectations of lower impact on earnings from the regulatory cap on assets.During its Investors’ Day presentation held on May 10, Wells Fargo also mentioned that it expects to reward its shareholders with higher returns in the long term. It raised the higher end of its payout ratio target to 55-80% from 55-75% it had set in 2016.However, net interest income, which makes up more than 55% of revenues, is expected to be ‘relatively stable’ in 2018. Management expects that lower earning assets and higher deposit costs might offset benefits from higher interest rates.Let’s discuss the two keys takeaways of the presentation in details below.Impressive Cost-Savings PlanThe Sans Francisco-based bank expects to reduce expenses by $2 billion in 2018, followed by another $2 billion in 2019. It plans to achieve most of these savings by streamlining its lines of businesses along with 300 branch closures.The bank reiterated that it expects total noninterest expenses to be in the range of $53.5-$54.5 billion for 2018, excluding litigation and remediation accruals expenses.Further, Wells Fargo’s chief financial officer, John Shrewsberry said that expenses for 2020 might be between $50 billion and $51 billion along with revenues consistent with 2017. However, he cautioned that it was not a formal projection and that the bank's will remain committed to improving revenues.Such measures will help the bank combat the persistent legal expenses. Also, this move might enable it to invest in productive areas.Lesser Impact on Earnings From Asset Cap, Time Period Might ExtendConsidering Wells Fargo’s involvement in a horde of litigation issues, either due to poor risk control measures or supervision over employees, the Federal Reserve had ordered Wells Fargo to keep its assets under $1.95 trillion in February 2018.At the time, the bank said that it expects the restriction’s impact on its net income after tax to be about $400 million. However, at the Investors’ Day Wells Fargo’s treasurer, Neal Blinde said that slow growth in loans and deposits balance helped in reducing the impact to about $100 million.Also, after considering the restrictions, the bank was looking forward to continue building its balance sheet after a third-party review of its plans, to improve controls and governance, to be held in September 2018.However, on May 10, the bank said that it expects to continue operating with the cap till the first part of 2019, in order to better enforce the plans to improve operations.Our ViewpointWells Fargo’s CEO, Tim Sloan, has launched a new advertising campaign with an aim to gain back the lost reputation by highlighting steps it has taken to repay customers and change its practices. On the other hand, it continues to settle past misconducts and accept penalties.It is uncertain when the bank will be able to get past the legal hassles and strict regulatory scrutiny. Further, unstable revenues remain another key concern for Wells Fargo. However, its expense control initiative might allow some room to deal with the negatives.Shares of Wells Fargo have gained 3.1% over the past year, significantly underperforming the industry’s rally of 18%.Wells Fargo currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderNorthern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report) has been witnessing upward estimate revisions for the last 60 days.

339,CMA,"General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) signed an agreement with French manufacturing group Alstom, under which Alstom will exit three joint ventures, in return for a consideration of $3.1 billion. The transfer of all interests to GE will occur on Oct 2.The three joint ventures cover grid, nuclear, as well as renewable assets and were created as part of Alstom's €12.35-billion sale of its energy business to GE in November 2015. GE had acquired the French company’s energy business under former Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Immelt.Alstom stated that it intends to exercise options to sell its interests in the Renewables and Grid joint ventures. Per the original agreement, GE will then be deemed to have exercised option to acquire Alstom’s interest in the Nuclear joint venture.Alstom intended to exit the businesses to concentrate on the manufacturing of rail equipment. Separately, Siemens AG (SIEGY  -  Free Report) and Alstom agreed to merge their rail operations in September 2017.The 2015 acquisition of Alstom’s assets had fortified GE’s foothold in the business of servicing and maintaining gas turbines, while the joint ventures in renewable energy and electrical transmission businesses also added to its strength.However, since then, the market for gas turbines has weakened considerably. In fact, CEO John Flannery has commented that GE was late in recognizing the weakening demand. Both GE and Siemens are now overhauling their businesses and slashing jobs to endure the slump.GE Power is the biggest segment of the conglomerate in terms of corporate revenues. However, the unit has been a drag on earnings in the last few quarters, as global demand increasingly favours renewable energy sources. Also, overcapacity, lower utilization and fewer outages are other factors that are dampening demand. Industry experts opine that the acquisition of Alstom’s assets further compounded the problems for GE, as it increased operating costs and contracted margins.Nevertheless, in 2017, Flannery assured investors that energy, aviation and healthcare will continue to be the focal points of GE’s operations. It has been nearly five months since Flannery outlined his plan to divest more than $20 billion of assets.In April, GE inked an agreement to sell a trio of its health-care information technology businesses to private equity firm Veritas Capital for $1.05 billion. The deal marks one of the first notable portfolio-related moves since Flannery announced the plan to exit at least $20 billion of businesses. However, he has hinted at the possibility of the company’s disintegration into separately-traded businesses.The overhaul, along with cost cuts and cultural changes, encompass Flannery’s attempts to pull GE out of one of the deepest slumps in the company’s 126-year history. The company’s shares have lost 47.7% in the past year, wider than the industry’s decline of 12.2%.Zacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderGeneral Electric presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

342,CMA,"Last Friday, as per a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) agreed to resolve a consolidated securities fraud class action suit related to the fake-accounts scandal revoked in September 2016. The settlement amount comes to around $480 million.Wells Fargo stated it had ""reached an agreement in principle"" with the parties that brought the complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. However, though the deal awaits certain customary conditions and final court approval, the San Francisco-based bank has already fully reserved the amount, as of Mar 31, 2018. Per the filing “reasonably possible” legal charges could be equivalent to $2.6 billion beyond amount reserved as of Mar 31, 2018.Notably, Wells Fargo refrained from the allegations but said it had ""entered into the agreement in principle to avoid the cost and disruption of further litigation.""“We are pleased to reach this agreement in principle and believe that moving to put this case behind us is in the best interest of our team members, customers, investors and other stakeholders,” noted CEO Tim Sloan. “We are making strong progress in our work to rebuild trust, and this represents another step forward,” he further added.The Story So FarThe above-mentioned case relates to the revelation of a sales scam, wherein the bank’s employees allegedly opened millions of unauthorized accounts illegally, to meet their aggressive internal sales goals.This financial bigwig has been under inquiry for setting impractical sales targets for its employees, compelling them to adopt fraudulent means for meeting the same. Wells Fargo’s aggressive sales tactics were first disclosed by The Los Angeles Times in 2013, when Los Angeles City’s Attorney Mike Feuer had begun investigation. This probe led to a lawsuit accusing the bank of high-pressure sales goals that encouraged unfair, illegal and fraudulent conduct, such as issuing unwanted credit cards to customers.The scandal was agitated in September 2016 following which the bank paid a combined penalty of $190 million to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Office of Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the City and County of Los Angeles. In addition, the amount included $5 million in customer remediation.Per the above-discussed class action lawsuit, the investors’ claims included misappropriation of facts by Wells Fargo related to its cross-selling strategy which was not used for benefit of customers. However, the bank tried to ""designed to fulfill sales quotes or otherwise advance the interests of Wells Fargo or its employees and increase sources of profitability while simultaneously burdening customers with financial products they did not authorize, need and/or even know about,"" the suit claimed.Therefore, this led the shares to trade at ""artificially inflated prices,"" per the suit.Notably, investors filing the suit include buyers of Wells Fargo's shares between Feb 26, 2014, and Sep 15, 2016, following the bank’s $185-million settlement which resulted in a dip in its share prices. Union Investment — a European asset-management firm — was the lead plaintiff in the case, appointed by the court.Bottom LineCurrently, the banking giant is caught in a horde of litigations over several malpractices which have come into the spotlight. It is going to be a long and expensive journey for Wells Fargo till it gets all the dust settled.In February 2018, the Federal Reserve ordered the bank to replace four board directors and also not increase its assets position beyond $1.95 trillion (as of Dec 31, 2017).Recently, the banking giant faced a penalty of $1 billion imposed by the CFPB and OCC due to its wrongdoings in the auto insurance and mortgage-lending business. As a result, the company’s first-quarter 2018 preliminary financial results got adjusted by an additional accrual of $800 million, which is not tax deductible. The accrual reduced the reported first-quarter net income by $800 million or 16 cents per share to $4.7 billion, or 96 cents per share.The bank’s performance over the past year underlines investors’ disappointment.

343,CMA,"Over the last five trading days, major banks displayed a bearish trend. The earnings season has kick started and this time, banks are expected to be hurt by a tough operating backdrop. This seems to be one of the primary reasons for investors’ pessimistic stance.A number of factors including weak trading and investment banking activities, lower-than-expected interest rates and lesser demand for refinancing activities during the quarter must be weighing on investors’ mind. All these are expected to hurt banks’ revenue growth to some extent. With expense reduction not likely to be a major support, there is less chance of impressive growth in the banks’ bottom line.Nonetheless, the last five trading sessions witnessed streamlining efforts.

344,CMA,"Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jul 18. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.The company boasts a decent earnings surprise history. It surpassed earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 8.7%.These earnings beats along with fundamental strength helped Comerica’s shares gain 10.2% year to date, outperforming the Zacks categorized Banks – Major Regional industry’s 6.2% rally.Comerica Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Comerica Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Comerica Incorporated QuoteWill the rally in stock price continue post second-quarter earnings release? It majorly depends on whether the firm is able to maintain its trend of beating earnings estimates.Our proven model shows that Comerica has the right combination of two key ingredients – positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better – to increase the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, stands at +4.67%. This is a major indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Comerica’s Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Drive Better-than-Expected ResultsEasing Pressure on Net Interest Margin (NIM): The interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve in Mar 2017, followed by another in Jun 2017 might be successful in easing some margin pressure. However, the contraction in the three-month/10-year Treasury spread might offset some benefits.Growth in Average Loan Balance: Comerica’s average loans are likely to increase given a seasonal rebound in the mortgage banker finance. Further, clearing of some uncertainties related to Trump’s policies and a slightly better lending scenario was witnessed in the second quarter.Lower Fee income: Owing to the decline in M&As and equity issuance activities in the quarter, Comerica’s fee income might witness some pressure.Effective Cost Saving Initiatives: Expenses might trend downward in the upcoming release due to the company’s GEAR Up expense savings initiatives.Activities of Comerica during the quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence.

345,CMA,"Bank of America Corp. (BAC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to announce second-quarter 2017 results on Tuesday, Jul 18, before the opening bell. Despite investors cheering the company’s latest capital deployment plan, the same is not expected to continue following the earnings release.While BofA’s performance in the last quarter reflected improved trading revenues, an increase in interest income and higher investment banking fees, challenging operating backdrop is expected dampen the company’s second-quarter earnings.In May, at an investor conference call, the company CEO Brian T. Moynihan said that second-quarter earnings are likely be hit by fall in trading revenues and lower-than-expected interest rates.Earnings estimate revisions depict pessimism too. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter was revised 4.4% downward over the last seven days, with four out of eight estimates moving lower and none moving higher.Earnings WhispersDecrease in earnings estimates increase chances of a beat. However, our quantitative model doesn’t conclusively predict the earnings beat this time. Here’s why:BofA does not have the right combination of two main ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher – for increasing chances of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for BofA is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 43 cents.Zacks Rank: BofA’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. But we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.Nonetheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate reflects 20.5% improvement on a year-over-year basis. Further, BofA has a decent surprise history, as evident from the chart below:Bank of America Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Bank of America Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Bank of America Corporation QuoteFactors Impacting Q2 ResultsLack of volatility to hurt trading revenues: For the major part of the quarter, trading activities remained sluggish mainly due to low volatility in both bond and equity markets. While the markets witnessed a marginal rise in volatility almost at the end of quarter, it is not likely to be enough for BofA to record any improvement in trading revenues.During an investor conference at the end of May, management revealed that the quarter’s trading revenues are expected to be down 10–12% year over year.Lack of investment banking activities to curb fee income: Global M&A activity remained lackluster. Per the Thomson Reuters data, the total deal value of announced M&As across the world fell during the quarter. Debt underwriting was soft as well, while equity underwriting seems to have improved. But as BofA’s is one of the lead players in this space, it might not suffer a loss.Mortgage revenues not to be a major support: An expected higher rate environment and less-concerned lenders over regulatory restrictions might have led to a rise in demand for refinancing activities during the quarter, thus helping BofA record some mortgage revenues. However, with the refinance boom nearing its end, no big support is expected from this segment. So, the contribution of mortgage revenue gains to total revenue will not be extraordinary.Slight rise in net interest income (NII) on modest loan growth: Improvement in loan demand, particularly commercial and industrial, and real estate during quarter is expected to support NII. Nonetheless, management expects $100–$110 million reduction in NII owing to lower-than-expected interest rates and the divestiture of its U.K. consumer credit card operations, MBNA Ltd.  Reduced scope for significant cost control: Expense reduction, which has long been the main method to remain profitable, is not expected to be the primary support this quarter. In fact, BofA expects to record a charge of $100 million as it closes/sells its data centers.Nonetheless, given the success of BofA’s cost-saving efforts and other restructuring initiatives as well as absence of significant legal costs and provisions, overall expenses should remain more or less stable.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few bank stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report results on Jul 18.

346,CMA,"The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 18.Hurt by higher expenses, Goldman’s first-quarter 2017 results recorded a negative earnings surprise of 4.3%. Further, the bottom line witnessed significant deterioration on a year-over-year basis. Results were primarily affected by lower equities revenues. However, higher underwriting fees were a tailwind. Notably, the quarter witnessed political uncertainty, reduced levels of volatility and low client activity levels.This earnings miss translated into deteriorating price movement for the company. Over the last six months, shares of Goldman declined 5.7%.Will the decline in stock price continue post second-quarter earnings release? It majorly depends on whether the firm is able to beat on earnings this time. Notably, Goldman has recorded positive earnings surprise in three of the last four trailing quarters.Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (The) QuoteOur quantitative model doesn’t call for an earnings beat this time around. A stock needs to have the right combination of the two key criteria – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or at least 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Unfortunately, this is not the case here, as elaborated below:Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Goldman is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are currently pegged at $3.51. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Goldman’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further lowers the predictive power of ESP. It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsMarket Volatility: Being an investment bank, Goldman is exposed to extreme market volatility. Therefore, the company is likely to be affected by the persistent market swings experienced during the quarter.Top-line Headwinds: Trading revenues are expected to decrease year over year, mainly due to low volatility in both the bond and equity markets. The prior-year quarter’s trading results were quite unusual across the industry, with Brexit being the main driver. Apart from this, the global M&A activity remained dismal. Per the Thomson Reuters data, the total deal value of announced M&As globally fell during the quarter. Debt underwriting was soft as well. Also, overall investment banking income is likely to witness a decline, however improvement in equity underwriting is anticipated.Pressure on Net Interest Margin (NIM) Might Ease: The prolonged low-rate environment has been taking a toll on the bank’s margins for the past several years. However, the Fed’s recent rate hike for the fourth time, since the financial crisis, and its commitment to raise rates faster (one more time) this year, based on a convincing pace of economic growth, is likely to help banks get rid of shrinking margins. However, lower treasury yields during the quarter might curb margin improvement.Strong Expense Management: Goldman completed an expense initiative during the first half of 2016 which translated into run-rate expense savings of around $700 million. Further, the company continued those efforts in the second half of 2016 and generated nearly $900 million of run-rate savings. It is focused on enhancing its efficiency while maintaining strong franchise and investing in new opportunities. Thus, continuation of expense management is likely to aid bottom-line expansion in the coming quarters.Notably, this banking giant’s performance was inadequate to win analysts’ confidence during the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate decreased 5.4% to $3.51, over the last seven days.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) has an earnings ESP of +4.67% and a Zacks Rank #2.

347,CMA,"As we continue to approach earnings season, it is important to realize that earnings estimates, estimate revisions, and actual results directly affect the Zacks Rank.

348,CMA,"Driven by top-line strength, Texas Capital Bancshares Inc. (TCBI  -  Free Report) reported a positive earnings surprise of around 2.6% in fourth-quarter 2017. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.19 outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents.Results were driven by rise in revenues and lower provisions. Organic growth was reflected, with significant rise in loans and deposit balances. However, elevated expenses remained the undermining factor.Including $17.6 million or 35 cents per share write-off of the deferred tax asset related to the recent tax reform, net income came in at $44.7 million or 84 cents per share compared with $48.4 million or 96 cents recorded in the prior-year quarter.For full-year 2017, earnings per share reached $3.73 per share comparing favorably with the year-ago earnings of $3.11 per share. Net income available to common shareholders was $187.3 million, up 29% year over year.Revenues Rise, Loans & Deposits Go Up, Costs EscalateFor full-year 2017, the company reported revenues of $835.6 million, up 19.3% year over year. Moreover, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $827.6 million.Total revenues (net of interest expense) jumped 21.1% year over year to $230 million in the quarter, driven by higher net interest income and non-interest income. Furthermore, revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $219.8 million.Texas Capital’s net interest income was $210.6 million, up 23% year over year, mainly due to rise in loans held for investment. In addition, net interest margin expanded 36 basis points (bps) year over year to 3.47%. This resulted from improvement in loan yields, partially offset by high cost of deposits.Texas Capital’s non-interest income advanced 3.2% year over year to $19.4 million. The rise was primarily due to an increase in service charges, servicing income, swap fees, wealth management and trust fee income, along with bank-owned life insurance income. These were partially offset by lower brokered loan fees and other income.However, non-interest expenses flared up 25% year over year to $133.1 million. This mainly stemmed from a rise in almost all components of expenses.As of Dec 31, 2017, total loans rose 17% year over year to $21.7 billion, while deposits climbed 12% year over year to $19.1 billion.Credit Quality ImprovedNon-performing assets totaled 0.55% of the loan portfolio plus other real estate owned assets, reflecting a year-over-year contraction of 52 bps.

Tangible common equity to total tangible assets came in at 8.1% compared with 8.5% in the year-earlier quarter.Stockholders’ equity was up 10% year over year to $2.2 billion as of Dec 31, 2017. The uptrend chiefly allied with retention of net income.Our ViewpointTexas Capital’s improved top line and a better balance sheet during the quarter impress us. However, bleak economic situation might hurt the company’s performance in the future. Though its inability to control expenses may hamper near-term profitability, improvement in margin remains a favorable factor. Texas Capital Bancshares, Inc.

Results also improved 16% year over year.On a fully-taxable equivalent basis, net interest income of $396 million was up 20% year over year. This was driven by elevated levels of average earning assets and higher net interest margin.Net interest margin (NIM) was 1.39%, up 19 basis points from the prior-year quarter. The increase chiefly reflected higher short-term interest rates and reduced premium amortization. The positives were partially mitigated by an unfavorable balance-sheet mix shift.Non-interest income advanced 14% from the year-ago quarter to $1.04 billion. Rise in trust, investment and other servicing fees, along with foreign exchange trading income, other operating income, security commissions and trading income, were the primary reasons for this upswing. These were partially offset by lower treasury management fees and investment security losses.Non-interest expenses flared up 15% year over year to $1 billion in the quarter. The rise was mainly driven by an elevation in mostly all components of expenses.Improvement in Assets Under Management and CustodyAs of Dec 31, 2017, Northern Trust’s total assets under custody increased 20% year over year to $8.08 trillion, while total assets under management rose 23% to $1.16 trillion.Credit Quality ImprovedTotal allowance for credit losses came in at $153.8 million, down 20% year over year.

All ratios exceeded the regulatory requirements.Capital Deployment UpdateDuring 2017, Northern Trust repurchased 5.8 million shares for $523.1 million at an average price of $90.25 per share. Notably, during the reported quarter, the company repurchased 1.81 million shares for $170.6 million at an average price of $94.11 per share. This includes shares related to share-based compensation.Our ViewpointResults of Northern Trust display a decent performance in the reported quarter. We remain optimistic by the continued growth in assets under custody, revenues and an improving credit quality, to some extent. Furthermore, positive impact of rising rates was visible. Though escalating expenses might pose a threat to the company’s profitability, benefits of tax reform are anticipated to act as a tailwind. Northern Trust Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Northern Trust Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Northern Trust Corporation QuoteCurrently, Northern Trust carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The rise was attributable to higher earning asset yields.On a year-over-year basis, net interest income was up 17 basis points (bps) to 3.17%, mainly reflecting higher earning asset yields and lower premium amortization in the securities portfolio. This was partly offset by higher rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities.Non-interest income was $833 million, up 2% from the prior-year quarter. The modest rise was largely driven by an increase in commercial real estate related income and wealth management-related income.Non-interest expenses rose 9% from the year-ago quarter to $1.52 billion. The increase was mainly due to several non-recurring items. After excluding those, operating expenses were relatively stable.Credit Quality ImprovedTotal non-performing assets were $741 million as of Dec 31, 2017, down 19% from prior-year quarter. Non-performing loans fell 12 bps year over year to 0.47% of total loans held for investment.Further, the rate of net charge-offs decreased 9 bps year over year to 0.29% of total average loans held for investment.

This was 15% down from $213 million or 20 cents per share in the prior-year quarter.For 2017, earnings of $1.12 per share lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.31. However, earnings were up 63.8% year over year. Further, net income from continuing operations was $1.2 billion, reflecting a 59.3% jump from 2016.Higher Rates Drive Revenues, Expenses Remain StableTotal revenues grew 2.7% year over year to $1.61 billion. Further, revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.58 billion.For 2017, revenues increased 25.6% year over year to $6.31 billion. Also, revenues came in above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.25 billion.Tax-equivalent net interest income went up marginally year over year to $952 million. The rise was attributable to benefits from low deposit betas and elevated interest rates which got partially offset due to the change in funding mix into certificates of deposit. However, taxable-equivalent net interest margin from continuing operations declined 3 basis points (bps) year over year to 3.09%.Non-interest income was $656 million, reflecting an increase of 6.1% from the year-ago quarter. A rise in investment banking and debt placement fees, operating lease income and other leasing gains, and consumer mortgage income primarily drove the increase. However, it was partially offset by a decline in other income.Non-interest expenses (excluding merger related charges) remained unchanged year over year at $1.01 billion. The cost savings from the First Niagara acquisition was offset by expenses relating to investments and acquisitions, including Cain Brothers and higher operating lease expense.Loans Decline Marginally & Deposits RiseAt the end of the fourth quarter, average total deposits were $103.8 billion, up 0.7% from the prior quarter. However, average total loans were $86 billion, down 0.9% sequentially.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagNet loan charge-offs, as a percentage of average loans, decreased 10 bps year over year to 0.24%. Provision for credit losses declined 25.8% year over year to $49 million.Further, non-performing assets, as a percentage of period-end portfolio loans, other real estate owned properties assets and other nonperforming assets were 0.62%, down 17 bps year over year.However, KeyCorp’s allowance for loan and lease losses was $877 million, up 2.2% from the prior-year quarter.Capital Ratios ImproveKeyCorp's tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 8.23% as of Dec 31, 2017, up from 8.09% as of Dec 31, 2016. In addition, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 10.93% versus 10.89% as of Dec 31, 2016.The company’s estimated Basel III Tier 1 common ratio was 10.08% at the end of the quarter, up from 9.54% as of Dec 31, 2016.Share RepurchasesDuring the reported quarter, KeyCorp repurchased $199 million worth of shares as part of its 2017 capital plan.Our TakeKeyCorp remains well positioned for growth in revenues given a rising rate environment and a rise in loan and deposit balances. Improving credit quality and enhanced capital deployment activities are the other positives. Further, the corporate tax rate cut will aid profitability to some extent. However, elevated expenses owing to investments in franchise and acquisitions are likely to hurt bottom-line growth.KeyCorp Price and EPS Surprise KeyCorp Price and EPS Surprise | KeyCorp QuoteKeycorp currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The increase was primarily due to a rise in personnel expenses, net merger-related and restructuring charges and professional service costs.BB&T’s adjusted efficiency ratio came in at 57.2%, down from 58.3% in the prior-year quarter. A fall in efficiency ratio indicates rise in profitability.As of Dec 31, 2017, total deposits were nearly $157.4 billion, up marginally from the prior quarter.

These efforts will also support bottom-line growth in the near term. Also, expected growth in loans, along with an improving rate scenario, is likely to propel its organic growth trajectory in the quarters ahead. However, such acquisitions are expected to keep costs toward the higher end, which might hurt profitability to some extent.BB&T Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  BB&T Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | BB&T Corporation QuoteCurrently, BB&T carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

358,CMA,"Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. (MXIM  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jul 20.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 7.69%, with an average beat of 4.72%.However, as far as share price movement is concerned, in the last one year, the stock has loss of 56.9% compared with the Zacks Semi-Analog & Mixed industry’s gain of 15.2%.Factors to ConsiderMaxim Integrated is an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of semiconductor analog and mixed signal integrated circuits (ICs). The company has a wide range of products that allows it to serve a diverse clientele. Maxim’s product lines are primarily sold in consumer, computing, industrial, automotive and communications markets. Also, its products are extensively used in consumer goods like cordless phones, digital cameras and PDAs, data processing, industrial products, instrumentation products, medical instruments, and various communications gear and networking equipment. Also, Maxim reorganized its business structure to distribute R&D, and sales and marketing resources more efficiently between business units, speed up decision-making, improve interaction and collaboration between business units, and quickly process customer feedback for implementation.However, the concentration of Maxim’s mobility revenues at Samsung is a big concern, which is likely to impact its net revenues. For the fiscal fourth quarter, Maxim expects revenues in the range of $590–$630 million based on a quarter-end backlog of $382 million. Gross margin is expected in the range of 65–67% (excluding special items). Earnings per share are expected within 59–65 cents on an adjusted basis.Earnings Whispers?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Maxim will beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Maxim has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 62 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Maxim’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings surprise.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.

The figure came ahead of the prior-year quarter earnings of 82 cents.Easing margin pressure on rising rates was witnessed in the quarter.

Also, revenues were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.U.S. Bancorp’s tax-equivalent net interest income totaled $3.1 billion in the quarter, up 6.4% from the prior-year quarter. The rise was mainly due to loan growth and rising interest rates.Average earning assets climbed 2.8% year over year, supported by growth in average total loans and average investment securities, along with elevated average other earning assets. Furthermore, net interest margin of 3.08% was up 10 basis points (bps) year over year, driven by higher interest rates and loan portfolio mix. Higher funding costs and elevated cash balances partially mitigated the rise in margins.U.S. Bancorp’s non-interest income increased slightly on a year-over-year basis to $2.4 billion. The rise was primarily due to higher payment services revenues, trust and investment management fees and deposit service charges, partially offset by lower mortgage banking and other revenues.Provision for credit losses decreased 2% year over year to $335 million in the reported quarter.U.S. Bancorp’s average total loans climbed 2.6% year over year to $279.8 billion. The growth was backed by a rise in commercial loans, residential mortgages, total other retail and retail leasing. These increases were partially offset by a drop in commercial real estate.Average total deposits were up 3% from the prior-year quarter to $339.2 billion. The rise was due to growth in interest-bearing deposits, partly offset by lower non-interest-bearing deposits.Non-interest expenses rose 31.1% year over year to $3.9 billion. Excluding the impact of notable items, expenses increased 3.6% year over year due to higher compensation and employee benefits expenses, partially offset by lower professional services expenses.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagCredit metrics at U.S. Bancorp deteriorated in the reported quarter.

On a year-over-year basis, the company experienced deterioration, mainly in net charge-offs in the commercial real estate and credit card segment.Also, total allowance for credit losses was $4.4 billion, up1.4% on a year-over-year basis.However, non-performing assets came in at $1.2 billion, down 25.1% year over year.Strong Capital PositionDuring the quarter under review, U.S. Bancorp maintained a solid capital position.

Common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio under the Basel III standardized approach fully implemented was 9.1% as of Dec 31, 2017, in line with the year-ago quarter.All regulatory ratios of U.S. Bancorp continued to be in excess of well-capitalized requirements. In addition, based on the Basel III fully implemented advanced approach, the Tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted assets ratio was estimated at 11.6% as of Dec 31, 2017, compared with 11.7% as of Dec 31, 2016.The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 7.6% as of Dec 31, 2017, compared with 7.5% as of Dec 31, 2016.U.S. Bancorp posted an improvement in book value per share, which increased to $26.34 as of Dec 31, 2017, from $24.63 recorded at the end of the year-earlier quarter.Capital Deployment UpdateReflecting the company’s capital strength during the fourth quarter, U.S. Bancorp returned 72% of earnings to its shareholders through common stock dividends and buybacks. For full-year 2017, the company returned 77% of earnings to shareholders.ConclusionU.S. Bancorp posted a decent quarter. Along with elevated revenues, a solid capital position and increased lending activities were added advantages. In addition, rising margins were a positive. Further, improving economy and lower taxes will support its financials going forward.Nevertheless, weakness in the credit card portfolio adversely affected its asset quality.

361,CMA,"Comerica Inc. (CMA  -  Free Report) pulled off a positive earnings surprise of 5.8% in fourth-quarter 2017. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.28 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.21. Also, the bottom line compares favorably with the prior-year quarter figure of 99 cents.Results reflected an increase in revenues supported by easing margin pressure and higher fee income. Strong capital position and improving credit quality were the positives. However, higher expenses and a fall in loans balance remained major headwinds.After considering the charges from tax legislation of $107 million and other adjustments, the company reported net income of $112 million in the fourth quarter.For full-year 2017, adjusted earnings per share were $4.73 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.70.

The Finance segment incurred a net loss of $2 million compared with net loss of $60 million in the prior-year quarter.Increase in Revenues Partly Offset by Higher Expenses  For 2017, the company reported revenues of $3.17 billion, up 11.2% on a year-over-year basis. Results surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.16 billion.Comerica’s revenues for the quarter were $830 million, up 15% year over year. Also, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $819.6 million. The increase in revenues was supported by expanded net interest margin and higher fee income.Net interest income increased 19.8% on a year-over-year basis to $545 million. Moreover, net interest margin expanded 63 basis points (bps) to 3.28%.Total non-interest income came in at $285 million, up 6.7% year over year. Increased card fees, fiduciary income and service charges on deposit accounts primarily led to the rise.Further, non-interest expenses totaled $483 million, up 4.8% year over year. The rise was chiefly due to higher salaries, advertising and software expenses, partly offset by lower restructuring expenses.Loans Decline, Deposits IncreaseAs of Dec 31, 2017, total assets and common shareholders' equity were $71.6 billion and $8 billion, respectively, compared with $73 billion and $7.8 billion as of Dec 31, 2016.Total loans were down slightly on a sequential basis, to $49.2 billion. However, total deposits increased marginally from the previous quarter to $57.9 billion.Credit Quality ImprovesTotal non-performing assets decreased 31.6% year over year to $415 million.

In addition, provision for credit losses declined 51.4% to $17 million.Capital Position StrengthensThe company's tangible common equity ratio improved 43 bps year over year to 10.32% as of Dec 31, 2017. Further, common equity Tier 1 and tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 11.55%, up from 11.09% in the prior-year quarter. Total risk-based capital ratio was 13.71%, up 44 bps from the prior-year quarter.Capital Deployment UpdateNotably, during the reported quarter, Comerica repurchased 1.9 million shares under its existing equity repurchase program. This, combined with dividends, resulted in a total payout of $200 million to shareholders.For 2017, the company repurchased 7.3 million shares under its existing equity repurchase program. It returned a total of $724 million to its shareholders in the year.Impressive Outlook for Full-Year 2018Comerica provided guidance for full-year 2018 assuming continuation of the current economic environment and low rates, along with $270 million of benefits from the GEAR Up initiative.The company anticipates net interest income to benefit from loan growth and increase in interest rates. Full-year benefit from the rate hikes in 2017 is expected to be $110-$125 million (assuming a 20-40% deposit beta for the December rate increase). Notably, elevated interest recoveries of $28 million in 2017 are not expected in 2018.Non-interest income is expected to increase 4%, benefitting from GEAR Up opportunities, which will drive modest growth in treasury management, card fees, brokerage fees and fiduciary income. This expectation excludes deferred compensation of $8 million in 2017.Non-interest expenses are predicted to be up 1%, affected by restructuring expenses of about $47-$57 million and an additional $50 million benefit from the GEAR Up initiatives. Also, expenses related to revenue growth such as outside processing expenses are likely to increase. Pressure will also be created from higher technology expenses and inflationary conditions.Provision for credit losses is expected to reflect continued solid performance in its overall portfolio. Notably, net charge-offs are expected to remain low while provisions are expected to be in the range of 20-25 bps.Income tax expenses are anticipated to be approximately 23% of pre-tax income on the assumption of no tax impact from employee stock transactions.Comerica expects average loans to increase in line with the gross domestic product, reflecting rise in most lines of business while remaining stable in Energy and Corporate Banking.Our ViewpointComerica reported another strong quarter. The company remains well poised to benefit from its ongoing strategic initiatives. Additionally, its strong capital position continues to lend support.

362,CMA,"Rising interest rates and loan growth drove JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s (JPM  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 earnings of $1.82 per share, which easily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.57. Also, the figure reflects a 17% rise from the year-ago period. Notably, the results included a legal benefit of $406 million.Solid loan growth and higher interest rates supported net interest income. Further, investment banking fees recorded a rise. Apart from these, results were supported by a fall in provision for credit losses, mainly driven by reserve releases in the Oil & Gas loan portfolio.As expected, fixed income and equity trading slumped during the quarter. Also, fall in mortgage banking income, due to higher funding costs and decline in mortgage origination volume, was a headwind. Operating expenses reported a rise during the quarter.Shares of JPMorgan lost over 1.9% in the pre-market trading. Perhaps, lesser support on the expense front and lower mortgage fees led to investors’ bearish stance. Nonetheless, the actual picture will emerge in the full day’s trading session, with investors and analysts considering the core results.The overall performance of JPMorgan’s business segments, in terms of net income generation, was decent. All segments, except Consumer & Community Banking, reported a rise in net income on a year-over-year basis.Among other positives, credit card sales volume improved 15% and merchant processing volume grew 12%. Commercial Banking average loan balances increased 12% and Asset Management average loan balances rose 9%.Trading Decline Offset by Higher Rates & Loan Growth, Costs RiseManaged net revenue of $26.4 billion in the quarter was up 5% from the year-ago quarter. Also, it compared favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $24.8 billion. Rising rates, loan growth and higher auto lease revenues were the primary reasons for the top-line improvement. These were partially offset by lower trading revenues and mortgage banking fees.Non-interest expenses (on managed basis) were $14.5 billion, a rise of 6% from the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher auto lease depreciation, FDIC-related costs and absence of legal benefit recorded in the prior-year quarter.Improving Credit QualityAs of Jun 30, 2017, non-performing assets were $6.4 billion, down 17% from the year-ago period. Provision for credit losses fell 13% year over year to $1.2 billion, primarily due to reserve releases in Wholesale loan portfolio.However, net charge-offs were up 2% year over year to $1.2 billion.Strong Capital PositionTier 1 capital ratio (estimated) was 14.3% as of Jun 30, 2017 compared with 13.6% as of Jun 30, 2016. Tier 1 common equity capital ratio (estimated) was 12.6% as of Jun 30, 2017, up from 12.0% as of Jun 30, 2016. Total capital ratio came in at 15.9% (estimated) as of Jun 30, 2017 compared with 15.2% as of Jun 30, 2016.Book value per share was $66.05 as of Jun 30, 2017 compared with $62.67 as of Jun 30, 2016. Tangible book value per common share came in at $53.29 as of Jun 30, 2017 compared with $50.21 as of Jun 30, 2016.Bottom LineImprovement in investment banking fees during the quarter is expected to continue in the near term. Moreover, growth in loans and deposits reflects improvement in economy. This is expected to lead to a rise in interest income, which will further benefit from the Fed rate hikes.However, trading revenue slump owing to low volatility is expected to continue in the near-term. Further, expense control is less likely to support profitability going forward.J P Morgan Chase & Co Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  J P Morgan Chase & Co Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | J P Morgan Chase & Co QuoteCurrently, JPMorgan carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

366,CMA,"The earnings season seems to have gotten off to a decent start with the banking giants reporting improved earnings and revenues so far.The banks that have released results till now reported higher revenues supported by improved loan balances and hike in interest rates. However, lower mortgage and trading revenues impacted fee income to some extent.The last three months of 2017 saw significant changes, stretching from passage of tax reform to Federal Reserve’s goal to continue raising rates steadily. The potential rise in equity issuances and persistent increase in debt underwriting has led to strengthening of investment banking. Also, the broader trends might lend banks some respite from the prevailing low volatility in the market. However, poor commercial and industrial loan growth during the quarter remains a concern.Per the latest Earnings Preview, overall earnings for the major banks in fourth-quarter 2017 are projected to decline 2.6% year over year.Earnings releases are coming in thick with Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) reporting on Jan 16, while U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) and Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) are scheduled to report on Jan 17, before the opening bell.Let’s have a look at what can be expected from these three Major Regional Banks when they report fourth quarter and 2017 earnings.Citigroup’s earnings are expected to be $1.18, reflecting 4.4% improvement from the last-year quarter.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is $17.1 billion, slightly higher than the prior-year quarter. Rise in loans along with a favorable interest rate environment is likely to benefit the bank’s net interest income (NII). Fee income is expected to benefit from strong momentum in investment banking business, partially offset by lower volume of M&A and poor mortgage activities during the quarter.Nevertheless, the tax reform is expected to hurt its results for the quarter. The company expects a one-time charge of $16-$17 billion related to the write-down of deferred tax assets (DTAs) and charge related to cash repatriation to be around $3-$4 billion.

367,CMA,"The performance of Investment banking, one of the major revenue sources for Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), is projected to improve in fourth-quarter 2017. This could majorly support the bank’s results scheduled to be released on Wednesday, Jan 17.Investment banking income comprises underwriting revenues and advisory fees. So, now let’s dig a little deeper to see how these are expected to perform in the to-be-reported quarter.Underwriting fees, consisting of debt and equity underwriting, are projected to increase. As the interest rate hike is expected to continue, many U.S. companies have been raising fresh debt capital in the recent quarters to avoid higher interest rates later. As debt origination fees account for roughly 40% of total investment banking fees for BofA, this will provide some support.Also, despite being the seasonally weak quarter for equity issuances globally, fourth-quarter 2017 is likely to be an exception. Strong rally in the equity markets worldwide might have propelled IPOs and follow-on offerings. Therefore, equity underwriting fees are projected to increase for BofA.Talking about advisory fees, weaker M&A activity in terms of deals closed globally, despite a large number of new M&As announced in the fourth quarter, will have a slight adverse effect. But as BofA is one of the leading players in this space, it might not suffer a huge loss.Overall, management anticipates investment banking income to be up in mid-single-digits range in the to-be-reported quarter. For this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, investment banking revenues are accounted in its Global Banking segment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment revenues of $4.92 billion indicates 8.2% growth on a year-over-year basis.(You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.)Overall Earnings & Revenue ProjectionsNotably for BofA, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 44 cents reflects 10% growth on a year-over-year basis.

368,CMA,"Amid an expected trading weakness, strong investment banking results and higher rates drove JPMorgan’s (JPM  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 earnings of $1.76 per share, which handily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.69. Results exclude one-time tax related charge of $2.4 billion or 69 cents per share.Solid loan growth (driven mainly by improved credit card loans) and higher interest rates supported net interest income growth. Further, rise in investment banking fees and stable equity trading income supported the top line.As expected, fixed income trading slumped during the quarter. Additionally, a decline in mortgage banking income, due to higher funding costs and fall in mortgage origination volume, was a headwind.Apart from these, results were adversely impacted by a drastic surge in provision for credit losses, mainly due to reserve build in Card portfolio. Further, higher operating expenses was an undermining factor.The overall performance of JPMorgan’s business segments, in terms of net income generation, was decent. All segments, except Corporate & Investment Bank, reported a rise in net income on a year-over-year basis.Among other positives, both credit card sales volume and merchant processing volume grew 13%. Further, both Commercial Banking average core loan balances grew 7% and Asset Management average core loan balances rose 11%.Net income (excluding charges related to tax act) was down 1% year over year to $6.7 billion.Trading Weakness Offset by Higher Rates & Loan Growth, Costs UpManaged net revenues of $25.5 billion in the quarter were up 5% from the year-ago quarter. Also, it compared favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $25 billion. Rising rates, loan growth and increase in auto lease revenues were the main reasons for the improvement. These were partially offset by lower trading revenues and mortgage banking fees.Non-interest expenses (on managed basis) were $14.6 billion, up 5% from the year-ago quarter. The rise was primarily due to higher compensation expenses and auto loan depreciation, partially offset by a decline in legal costs.Provisions SurgeProvision for credit losses soared 51% year over year to $1.3 billion, primarily due to reserve build in Consumer and Wholesale loan portfolios.However, as of Dec 31, 2017, non-performing assets were $6.4 billion, down 15% from the year-ago period. Also, net charge-offs were down 1% year over year to $1.3 billion.Strong Capital PositionTier 1 capital ratio (estimated) was 13.9% as of Dec 31, 2017 compared with 14.1% as of Dec 31, 2016. Tier 1 common equity capital ratio (estimated) was 12.2% as of Dec 31, 2017, down from 12.4% as of Dec 31, 2016.

Tangible book value per common share came in at $53.56 as of Dec 31, 2017 compared with $51.44 as of Dec 31, 2016.Bottom LineContinued improvement in loans and higher interest rates are expected to continue supporting JPMorgan’s revenues. With the Fed expected to continue raising rates, the company’s interest income will likely increase.

Adjusted earnings per share of $2.29 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.20. Moreover, the bottom line reflected a 16.2% increase from the prior-year quarter.Continued easing of pressure on net interest margin supported the company’s higher net interest income during the quarter.

Also, net interest margin increased 19 basis points year over year to 2.88%.Non-interest income was up 10% year over year to $1.92 billion, driven by higher asset management income, consumer services income, service charges on deposits and other income, partially offset by lower income from residential mortgage.PNC Financial’s non-interest expenses were $3.06 billion, increasing 25% from the year-ago quarter. The quarter witnessed rise in all components of expenses.As of Dec 31, 2017, total loans were slightly down sequentially to $220.5 billion.

370,CMA,"The expected decline in Bank of America’s (BAC  -  Free Report) trading income is likely to adversely impact fourth-quarter 2017 earnings, slated on Wednesday, Jan 17. However, this is not expected to lead to dismal results as gains from higher rates, decent loan growth and relatively better performance of the other segments — mainly investment banking — are anticipated to offset the trading weakness.Moreover, though market volatility has not improved much in the last quarter, the decrease in trading revenues will primarily be due to comparison with the prior-year quarter that witnessed higher volatility following the U.S. Presidential election results.At an investor conference in early December 2017, BofA CEO Brian Moynihan, stated that the company’s trading business till then in the fourth quarter was down roughly 15% year over year. In fact, there has been hardly any change in the scenario since then.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Global Markets segment (under which trading revenues are accounted for) revenues of $3.54 billion reflects a marginal rise of 1.9% from the prior quarter.Here are the other factors that are likely influence BofA’s Q4 results:Continuation of investment banking strength: The trend of pocketing advisory and underwriting fees is expected to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter largely on the back of higher debt origination and equity issuances.However, weaker M&A activity in terms of deals closed despite significant new M&As announced in the fourth quarter will have a slight adverse effect on advisory fees. But as BofA is one of the leading players in this space, it might not suffer a significant loss.Overall, the company projects investment banking income to be up in mid-single-digits range in the fourth quarter. For BofA, investment banking revenues are accounted in its Global Banking segment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment revenues of $4.92 billion reflects a rise of 8.2% year over year.Steady rise in net interest income: In addition to higher interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending — particularly, in the areas of commercial and industrial, real estate and consumer — will likely result in improvement in net interest income (NII). Further, management expects NII in the to-be-reported quarter to increase sequentially, driven by modest growth in loans and deposits.Slowdown in mortgage banking: With the refinance boom nearing its end, a big help is not expected from this division. Seasonality is also expected to hurt mortgage banking revenues. Moreover, BofA hasn’t bulked up its mortgage banking businesses since the last recession. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Consumer Banking segment (under which mortgage fees are accounted for) revenues of $8.91 billion indicates 9.8% improvement from the prior-year quarter.Reduced scope of cost control: Expense reduction, which has long been the main method to remain profitable, is not expected to be the primary support this quarter. But given the success of BofA’s cost-saving efforts and other restructuring initiatives as well as absence of significant legal costs and provisions, overall expenses are likely to remain more or less stable.Adverse impact of new tax code: In December 2017 (following the passage of the tax act), BofA announced expectation of one-time charge of $3 billion in the fourth quarter related to write-down of certain net deferred tax assets.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:BofA does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for BofA is -1.14%.Zacks Rank: BofA sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. But we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 44 cents reflects 10% growth on a year-over-year basis.

371,CMA,"Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth quarter and 2017 results before the opening bell on Jan 16. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.The improving economic backdrop — stronger GDP growth, rise in consumer spending and increasing business spending — is likely to support Comerica’s results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $812.8 million for the fourth quarter reflects year-over-year growth of 12.6%.Further, management’s positive outlook for 2018 on the back of lower taxes and expectations of loan growth might lead the stock to new highs.Before we discuss why an earnings beat might also be in store, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the prior quarter.Comerica’s third-quarter 2017 results improved primarily due to a fall in expenses and higher revenues. It had surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the positives were partially offset by lower loan balance and provision for loan losses.Notably, the company boasts an impressive earnings surprise history. It surpassed earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 10.13%.These positive earnings surprises along with fundamental strength helped Comerica’s shares gain 23.2% over the past six months, outperforming the industry’s 14.6% rally.Comerica Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Comerica Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Comerica Incorporated QuoteA Surprise in Store?Our proven model shows that Comerica has the right combination of the two key ingredients —positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat in the fourth quarter.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, stands at +0.43%. This is a major indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Comerica’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Though estimates for the to-be-reported quarter have remained stable over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $1.21 reflects growth of 31.5% year over year.Factors to Drive the ResultsNet Interest Income to Rise: Comerica’s net interest income is likely to improve in the to-be-reported quarter, supported by expanding net interest margin and decent loan growth during the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets of $66.4 billion reflects a marginal sequential growth.Higher Fee Income: Trend of consumer spending was strong during the fourth quarter, which is likely to boost Comerica’s non-interest income. Also, the improvement of investment banking and equity markets might lend further support. However, poor mortgage activity during the quarter is likely to partially offset the positive.Effective Cost Saving Initiatives: Expenses might continue to trend down in the upcoming release due to the company’s GEAR Up expense savings initiatives. However, costs are likely to be affected slightly by the tax overhaul.Credit Quality Might Improve: With the improvement in oil prices during the quarter, normalization of credit metrics is likely to continue. The consensus estimate shows 3.1% and 2.9% rise in non-performing assets and non-performing loans, respectively, on a sequential basis.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around.BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.26% and a Zacks Rank of 1.

373,CMA,"The Q4 earnings season is knocking at the door and investors are keen to see how major banks will perform this time, after reporting impressive results in the first three quarters of 2017.The last year has been a roller coaster ride for banks. Though the year begun on an optimistic note with high expectations from President Trump’s electoral promises, it lost some steam in the middle only to regain the bullish trend at the end.Banks showed resilience driven by the Fed’s hawkish stance (three rate hikes in 2017) and the gradually improving U.S. economy. Also, progress on the lesser banking regulation front cheered investors.Further, the new tax act drove the banks too. While the act will result in gains for banks over the long term, the to-be-reported quarter earnings will be adversely affected by huge one-time charges related to the changes in the tax law.Additionally, factors that weighed on major banks’ prior-quarter results persisted in Q4 as well. These, including trading weakness, slowdown in mortgage banking and stable net interest margins, will likely hamper profitability of major banks. On top of these, the above-mentioned charges add fuel to the fire.Also, while the absence of considerable legal expenses is a positive, increased investments in technology to improve digital offerings is expected to escalate costs moderately.As such, major banks in the S&P 500 index (accounting for nearly 45% of the Zacks Finance sector'stotal earnings) are expected to witness a 6.3% year-over-year decline in earnings in the to-be-reported quarter. This compares unfavorably with 6.5% growth recorded in the prior quarter.(For detailed look at the earnings outlook for this industry and others, please read our Earnings Analysis article).Nevertheless, strength in investment banking driven by a potential rise in equity issuances (strong rally in the equity market globally) and persistent increase in debt underwriting (mainly on assumption of continuous increase in interest rates) is expected to provide respite to some extent.In addition to the benefits from the rising interest rates, a slight improvement in lending, particularly in the areas of commercial and consumer will offer marginal support interest income for banks.Further, credit quality is anticipated to remain strong, backed by an improving economy and conservative underwriting standards.Choosing the WinnersWhile the upcoming results are not likely to be impressive, there are still a few major banks that are expected to outshine their peers. So, this is the right time for you to select some banking stocks that are well positioned to beat earnings estimates in their upcoming releases.Choosing stocks with earnings beat potential might be a difficult task unless one knows the process to shortlist. One way to do it is by picking stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank — Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) — and a positive Earnings ESP.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in their upcoming earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.5 Major Banks Set for Earnings SurprisesHere are five major regional bank stocks that have the right combination of elements to deliver positive earnings surprises in their upcoming announcements:The PNC Financial Services Group (PNC  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Jan 12.

374,CMA,"Investors in Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jan 19th 2018 $28.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other.

However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Comerica, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Comerica is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) in the Major Regional Banks industry that ranks in the Top 11% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, two analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while two have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.22 per share to $1.21 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Comerica right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

375,CMA,"Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) displays impressive organic growth and robust capital position. Also, it remains on track to further improve financials through GEAR Up initiatives. Moreover, with the economic and industry factors taking a favorable turn, additional support shall be lent to the company.However, Comerica’s significant exposure to commercial loans and two of the challenging economies including California and Michigan remain major headwinds.Given Comerica’s strong fundamentals, its shares have gained 28.7% year to date, outperforming industry’s growth of 18.5%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Comerica's current-year earnings has remained stable, in the last 30 days. As a result, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Comerica’s efforts to improve revenues and efficiency through GEAR Up initiatives remain impressive.

Further, the company expects to achieve $125 million cost savings target in 2017 and return on capital employed between 13-15% in medium term.Moreover, it remains well poised to benefit from the rising rate environment.

378,CMA,"In order to take advantage of Japan’s prevailing easing monetary policy, JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s (JPM  -  Free Report) alternative asset management unit wants to invest in the country’s real estate and infrastructure. The news was reported by Bloomberg.Although the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve have started tightening monetary policies, Bank of Japan’s Governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, plans to continue with “powerful monetary easing” in order to encourage positive inflation in the country.According to the BoJ’s guidance for short-term interest rates and 10-year government bond yields, borrowing costs are expected to remain low in Japan.The managing partner of JPMorgan Global Alternatives, Anton Pil, said, “Leverage is still very inexpensive in Japan, so you can use a degree of leverage to enhance returns. Many foreigners want to get exposure to Japanese real estate because the Bank of Japan is on a different schedule.”In fact, Pil believes that as the Federal Reserve sells bonds with an aim to reduce its balance sheet, alternative asset classes are likely to attract more attention and become lucrative for investors.According to Pil, since investors nowadays look for non-traditional forms of fixed income, which can generate cash as well as serve as an inflation hedge, the Japanese real estate and infrastructure is becoming more attractive.However, Pil does not aim to use “significant” leverage. According to him, nearly 35% to 50% of leverage is sufficient. He stated, “If you go north of that, real estate doesn’t become the driver, but the leverage becomes the driver of your return.”JPMorgan’s shares have gained 24.6% in a year’s time, outperforming 17.4% growth for the industry it belongs to.Currently, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks from the finance space are Ameriprise Financial, Inc.

379,CMA,"This week, the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets for the final time under outgoing Fed Chair Janet Yellen, who will step down from the Fed following a four-year reign as a relatively dovish, yet consistent, head custodian of the U.S. economy. She will be replaced early next year by President Trump’s pick, Jerome “Jay” Powell.Currently the Fed funds rate is at 1.25%, and with chances just about zero that there won’t be a hike this week, market participants are already pricing the quarter-point hike to 1.5%. This is obviously the highest the Fed funds rate will have reached since the Great Recession caused the rate to be pulled all the way down to 0 (actually 0.25%).This slow and steady methodology has taken longer than many had anticipated to reach equilibrium, but we are definitely there now: with inflation currently registering at 1.6% — close to the optimum Yellen & Co. had long been seeking of 2% — while unemployment — the other half of the Fed’s dual mandate — came in at an historically low 4.1% just last Friday.Looking into 2018, however, many analysts expect big changes: the massive tax cut for U.S. businesses and some individuals looks to both lower the unemployment rate further (based on the argument that cutting corporate taxes from 35% to 20% will lead to more job creation) and spike inflation higher (because along with all these new jobs we can also expect higher wage growth, which is a key sign of rising inflation). Meaning that we look to be heading toward sub-4% unemployment, but inflation could surge well above 2% in relatively short order.Part of the Fed’s job in conducting interest rate changes is to sop up some of this inflation before it gallops out of control, so speculation is rife about how many times the Fed will raise rates in 2018. Obviously, much will pivot on if and when the tax cuts are passed through Congress and implemented into the economy; if it’s before Christmas or right after New Year’s, it’s likely we’ll see a March rate hike, if not sooner. Should things take a little longer, the Powell-led Fed may take a page from the Yellen playbook and await economic evidence of job and inflation growth before moving.There is also the issue of how much the Fed might raise when it finally decides to, again dependent on the lay of the economic land next year. Should the economy heat up faster than expected, look for speculation involving a half-point rate hike (from 1.5% to 2%) instead of a quarter point. And if this happens, look toward the finance sector — particularly the banks, like Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated Comerica Inc. (CMA  -  Free Report), and the insurers, like Zacks Rank #2 firm Prudential (PRU  -  Free Report) and MetLife (MET  -  Free Report).

380,CMA,"Monday, December 11, 2017This week, the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets for the final time under outgoing Fed Chair Janet Yellen, who will step down from the Fed following a four-year reign as a relatively dovish, yet consistent, head custodian of the U.S. economy. She will be replaced early next year by President Trump’s pick, Jerome “Jay” Powell.Currently the Fed funds rate is at 1.25%, and with chances just about zero that there won’t be a hike this week, market participants are already pricing the quarter-point hike to 1.5%. This is obviously the highest the Fed funds rate will have reached since the Great Recession caused the rate to be pulled all the way down to 0 (actually 0.25%).This slow and steady methodology has taken longer than many had anticipated to reach equilibrium, but we are definitely there now: with inflation currently registering at 1.6% — close to the optimum Yellen & Co. had long been seeking of 2% — while unemployment — the other half of the Fed’s dual mandate — came in at an historically low 4.1% just last Friday.Looking into 2018, however, many analysts expect big changes: the massive tax cut for U.S. businesses and some individuals looks to both lower the unemployment rate further (based on the argument that cutting corporate taxes from 35% to 20% will lead to more job creation) and spike inflation higher (because along with all these new jobs we can also expect higher wage growth, which is a key sign of rising inflation).

382,CMA,"Shares of the country’s biggest banks—including JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report)—surged on Monday morning after the Senate finally passed its tax bill over the weekend.The reform package, which—among other things—slashes the corporate tax rate to 20% from 35%, inspired the bulk of last week’s trading, including a noticeable rally in the aforementioned bank stocks. Now, these financial behemoths are moving even higher as investors become increasingly optimistic that some form of the bill will eventually become law.Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo were all up more than 2% in morning trading Monday. Shares of JPMorgan also gained more than 2%, touching a new all-time high of $108.40 in the process. Elsewhere, investment behemoth Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) was up over 1.5%, while smaller national banks like PNC (PNC  -  Free Report), Comerica (CMA  -  Free Report), and Fifth Third (FITB  -  Free Report) were also in the green.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, of which Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan are components, moved more than 1.2% higher in early morning hours. The SPDR KBW Regional Banking ETF (KRE  -  Free Report) gained over 2.5%, and the Financial SPDR (XLF  -  Free Report) surged about 2%.On top of the tax reform bill, investors seem excited about direction of the Federal Reserve. Last week, confirmation testimony from Fed chair nominee Jerome Powell all but confirmed another interest rate hike at the central bank’s next policy meeting.Trump’s pick to succeed Janet Yellen also hinted that he believes deregulation might be necessary in today’s banking industry (also read: 5 Bank Stocks to Buy on Jerome H. Powell Testimony).Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index was in the red on Monday, supporting the thesis that investors may finally be cashing out of the red-hot sector. Tech has dominated Wall Street throughout 2017, but as geopolitical tensions continue to rise, large funds may be shifting to the seemingly less-volatile financial world.Looking ahead, the banking rally will depend on the Fed’s monetary policy, so in addition to the rate cut, investors will want to pay attention to what the nation’s top economists say about 2018. If the tax bill passes, these bank giants could see an improvement to their bottom lines next year, but other factors could always have an influence.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

383,CMA,"BankUnited, Inc. (BKU  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 earnings per share of 62 cents, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 59 cents. Moreover, the bottom line increased 31.9% from the year-ago-quarter.Results were primarily driven by an increase in both net interest income and non-interest income. Also, the company witnessed strong growth in loans and deposits. However, higher expenses hurt results to quite an extent. Further, an increase in provisions was an undermining factor. It is probably due to these negatives that the shares of the company declined nearly 1.6% following the release.Net income for the quarter increased 33.3% year over year to $67.8 million.Revenues Improve, Costs IncreaseNet revenues for the quarter came in at $294.6 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $273.5 million. Further, the reported figure increased 19.4% year over year.Net interest income climbed 8.8% year over year to $241.3 million, led by higher interest income, partially offset by an increase in interest expenses.Net interest margin decreased 7 basis points year over year to 3.62%. Continued run-off of high-yielding covered loans and an increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities led to the margin contraction.Non-interest income was $53.3 million, increasing significantly from the year-ago quarter. The rise was primarily driven by an increase in net gain on investment securities available for sale.Non-interest expenses increased 5.9% from the year-ago quarter to $156.7 million due to a rise in all the components, except other non-interest expense and professional fees.Credit Quality DeterioratedAs of Sep 30, 2017, the ratio of net charge-offs to average loans was 0.39%, increasing from 0.13% as of Dec 31, 2016. Also, nonperforming loans to total loans was 0.99%, increasing from 0.70% as of Dec 31, 2016.Further, provision for loan losses for the quarter was $37.9 million, up from $24.4 million in the prior-year quarter.Solid Balance Sheet & Capital RatiosAs of Sep 30, 2017, net loans totaled $20.5 billion compared with $19.2 billion as of Dec 31, 2016. Further, total deposits amounted to $21.2 billion, increasing from $19.5 billion as of Dec 31, 2016.As of Sep 30, 2017, Tier 1 leverage ratio was 8.6%, while Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio came in at 11.9%. Further, total risk-based capital ratio was 12.7% as of the same date.Profitability IncreasesAs of Sep 30, 2017, quarterly return on average assets was 0.92%, increasing from 0.76% as of Sep 30, 2016. Also, return on average stockholders’ equity was 10.21%, up from 8.52% as of Sep 30, 2016.Our TakeBankUnited’s revenue growth is commendable. Also, the company’s consistent growth in loans and deposits is impressive. This testifies that BankUnited is well positioned to grow organically and through acquisitions, given its strong balance sheet position.However, exposure to risky loans and continued margin pressure, due to a liability-sensitive balance sheet, could hurt the company’s financials.BankUnited, Inc.

Also, the figure was up 16% year over year.Results were primarily driven by an increase in net interest income and a slight fall in operating expenses.

The figure was above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.29 billion.Net interest income (FTE basis) increased 9% year over year to $1.47 billion. The rise was attributable to growth in average earning assets and higher earning asset yields.On a year-over-year basis, net interest income was up 19 basis points (bps) to 3.15%, reflecting higher earning asset yields and lower premium amortization in the securities portfolio. This was partly offset by higher rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities.Non-interest income was $846 million, down 5% from the prior-year quarter. The fall was largely due to lower mortgage related income, partially offset by a rise in investment banking income.Non-interest expenses were down 1% from the year-ago quarter to $1.39 billion.

Also, this compares favorably with 30 cents recorded in the prior-year quarter.Results were supported by revenue synergies from the First Niagara Financial Group acquisition deal (completed in August 2016) and higher interest rates. Further, lower credit cost, an increase in fee income, and improving loans and deposits were the tailwinds. On the other hand, higher operating expenses were on the downside.Including merger-related charges and a merchant services gain adjustment, net income from continuing operations came in at $349 million or 32 cents per share. This was up significantly from $165 million or 16 cents per share in the prior-year quarter.First Niagara Deal, Higher Rates Drive Revenues, Expenses RiseTotal revenuesgrew 16.2% year over year to $1.55 billion. However, it was slightly below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.56 billion.Tax-equivalent net interest income jumped 22.1% year over year to $962 million. The rise was attributable to benefits from the First Niagara acquisition and a rise in earning asset yields. Also, taxable-equivalent net interest margin from continuing operations grew 30 basis points (bps) year over year to 3.15%.Non-interest income was $592 million, an increase of 7.8% from the year-ago quarter. A rise in all fee income components,except Investment banking and debt placement fees, and net gains from principal investing, drove the increase.Non-interest expenses (excluding merger related charges) rose 7.1% year over year to $956 million. The increase reflected a full-quarter impact of the First Niagara acquisition, ongoing business investments and recent acquisitions, partially offset by merger cost savings.Loans & Deposits Rise MarginallyAt the end of the third quarter, average total deposits were $103.1 billion, up 0.3% from the prior quarter. However, average total loans were $86.8 billion, up 0.4% sequentially.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagNet loan charge-offs, as a percentage of average loans, decreased 8 bps year over year to 0.15%. Provision for credit losses declined13.6% year over year to $51 million.Further, non-performing assets, as a percentage of period-end portfolio loans, other real estate owned properties assets and other nonperforming assets were 0.64%, down 25 bps year over year.However, KeyCorp’s allowance for loan and lease losses was $880 million, up 1.7% from the prior-year quarter.Capital Ratios ImproveKeyCorp's tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 8.49% as of Sep 30, 2017, up from 8.27% as of Sep 30, 2016.

However, persistently increasing expenses owing to investments in franchise and inorganic growth strategy are likely to hurt its bottom line.

393,CMA,"The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 16, before the market opens. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, the company’s earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenue growth, lower level of fee waivers and no provisions were among the positives. However, higher expenses and a decline in trading revenues remained headwinds.The company boasts a decent earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 2.1%.However, activities of Schwab during the third quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings remained stable at 41 cents. Nevertheless, it reflects a year-over-year improvement of 19.6%.Additionally, the company’s revenues for the to-be-reported quarter are projected to be $2.19 billion. The figure is expected to witness growth of 14.2% year over year.Schwab’s fundamental strength has helped its shares gain 40.9% in a year’s time, outperforming the 38.2% growth for the industry it belongs to.The Charles Schwab Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  The Charles Schwab Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | The Charles Schwab Corporation QuoteWill the stock’s rally continue post third-quarter earnings release? Let’s see how things are shaping up.A Positive Surprise in Store?According to our quantitative model, chances of Schwab beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the to-be-reported quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to be confident of an earnings surprise call.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Schwab is +0.20%.Zacks Rank: Schwab currently carries a Zacks Rank 3, which when combined with a positive ESP, increases the chances of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsGrowth in Trading Revenue to Remain Muted: Owing to an unchanged monetary policy standpoint of the Fed, most part of the third quarter did not witness much volatility. Moreover, overall trading activities remained sluggish in the quarter in the absence of any tangible development on the reforms proposed by the Trump administration. However, Schwab opened 107,000 and 123,000 new brokerage accounts in July and August 2017, respectively, indicating that investors were somewhat interested in entering the market. Moreover, the company’s efforts to lower trading fees should have also helped add more brokerage accounts. Thus, the overall slump in trading revenues should not have affected Schwab much. Its trading revenues are expected to remain more or less stable.Asset Growth Should Boost Net Interest Revenue: Schwab witnessed a rise in average interest-earning assets in July and August on a year-over-year basis. This should get reflected in the company’s results for the quarter as well. Hence, higher assets, along with improvement in the rate scenario, should help Schwab experience higher net interest revenues during the quarter.Decline in Fee Waivers: Following the rate hikes in December 2016 and March 2017, Schwab witnessed a 98% year-over-year decline in its fee waivers in the second quarter, which helped the company, earn more. Moreover, we believe that following the latest rate hike in June, the company should have been able to waive off all of its fees. This should further boost its top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few other finance stocks that you may want to consider, as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter, according to our model.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Oct 17.

394,CMA,"Morgan Stanley’s (MS  -  Free Report) third-quarter results, scheduled for Oct 17, are expected to show a decline in trading income — one of the major revenue components. While this could majorly affect its earnings, an expected improvement in revenues from other segments should offset the negative impact on earnings.    Similar to the prior quarter, slump in fixed-income trading revenues is expected to be the main reason for the decline in trading revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fixed income trading revenues of $1.18 billion reflect a decline of 5.1% sequentially and 20.5% from the year-ago quarter. On the other hand, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for equity trading revenues of $1.88 billion indicates a decrease of 12.7% from the prior quarter. However, equity trading revenues are expected to be flat on a year-over-year basis.The decline in trading revenues is largely attributable to higher-than-usual volatility (due to the Brexit aftermath and the impending U.S. presidential election) in the year-ago quarter. But trading activities remained sluggish in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Absence of any concrete development on the proposed financial reforms by the Trump administration and an unchanged monetary policy of the Fed were the primary reasons for reduced volatility for the major part of the quarter.Overall, Q3 trading revenue is expected to be $2.86 billion, down 10.3% from the last quarter and 9.8% from the prior-year quarter.Here are the other factors that might influence Morgan Stanley’s Q3 results:Underwriting fees to rise: Though equity underwriting volumes in the third quarter were low owing to seasonality, this is not likely to have any significant impact on Morgan Stanley’s equity underwriting market share, given its strong global presence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for equity underwriting fees of $297 million reflects a jump of 25.8% from the prior-year quarter.Additionally, as the interest rate hike is expected to continue, many U.S. companies have been raising fresh debt capital over the recent quarters to avoid higher interest rates later. As debt origination fees account for more than half of Morgan Stanley’s total underwriting fees, this has been leading to strong gains for Morgan Stanley. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for debt underwriting fees of $395 million reflects year-over-year growth of 8.5%.All in all, total underwriting fees is projected to witness a 15.3% year-over-year rise as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is $692 million.Stable advisory fees: With the overall improvement in global M&A scenario during the third quarter, Morgan Stanley should be able to generate decent advisory fees. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for advisory fees is $502 million, relatively stable year over year.Net interest income (NII) to increase marginally: Improvement in demand for loans — particularly, in the areas of commercial and industrial, and consumer — is expected to support NII. Further, a rise in interest rates will likely lead to an increase in interest income.Expense control to support bottom line: Morgan Stanley’s cost savings plan — Project Streamline — is likely to result in lower expenses during the quarter. Also, as much improvement in revenues is not likely, chances of a big increase in compensation expenses is low.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Morgan Stanley does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.  Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Morgan Stanley is 0.00%.Zacks Rank: Morgan Stanley carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. But we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.Nonetheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 81 cents reflects a 1.3% improvement on a year-over-year basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $9 billion indicate a marginal growth from the prior-year quarter.Morgan Stanley Price and EPS Surprise Morgan Stanley Price and EPS Surprise | Morgan Stanley QuoteStocks Worth a LookHere are a few bank stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report results on Oct 17.

395,CMA,"Expected slump in trading business is likely to adversely affect The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.’s (GS  -  Free Report) third-quarter earnings, to be reported on Oct 17. Moreover, the bank is anticipated to record year-over-year decline in earnings and revenues.Goldman’s second-quarter 2017 results recorded a positive earnings surprise of 17.6%, driven by higher equities revenues and low expenses.

During the three-month period ended Sep 30, shares of Goldman gained 6.9%.Will the upswing in stock price continue post third-quarter earnings release? It majorly depends on whether the firm is able to beat on earnings this time. Notably, Goldman recorded positive earnings surprise in three of the last four trailing quarters as depicted below:Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (The) QuoteEarnings WhispersOur quantitative model doesn’t call for an earnings beat this time around. A stock needs to have the right combination of the two key criteria — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Unfortunately, this is not the case here, as elaborated below:Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Goldman is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are currently pegged at $4.31. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Goldman’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsMarket Volatility: Being an investment bank, Goldman is exposed to extreme market volatility. Therefore, the company is likely to be affected by the subdued volatility experienced during the quarter.Top-line Pressure: Reduction in equity issuance and feeble equity trading volumes are expected to negatively influence fee revenue growth this time around. Nevertheless, persistent rise in debt underwriting (mainly on assumption of continuous increase in interest rates) will likely provide some respite. Though continued momentum in investment banking business is likely to support the bottom-line numbers, Goldman might remain under pressure due to lackluster fixed-income trading activities on low volatility during the to-be-reported quarter.Per the Thomson Reuters data, the total deal value of announced M&As globally increased during the quarter. Notably, in the third quarter, Goldman acted as an advisor and helped closed M&A deals worth over $300 billion. Therefore, M&A advisory fees for the bank are expected to lend support to revenues.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is projected at $7.64 billion, down 6.5% year over year.Rise in Net Interest Income: In addition to elevated interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending — particularly, in the areas of commercial and industrial, as well as consumer — might perk up interest income.Strong Expense Management: Goldman completed an expense initiative during the first half of 2016 which translated into run-rate expense savings of around $1.6 billion in 2016. The bank is focused on enhancing its efficiency while maintaining strong franchise and investing in new opportunities. Thus, continuation of expense management is likely to aid bottom-line expansion in the coming quarters.Notably, this banking giant’s performance was inadequate to win analysts’ confidence during the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate decreased slightly to $4.31, over the last seven days.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Oct 17.

397,CMA,"Despite weak fixed income market revenues, Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 7.6% in third-quarter 2017 on prudent expense management. Earnings per share of $1.42 for the quarter easily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.32. Also, earnings compared favorably with the year-ago figure of $1.24 per share. Notably, results included after-tax gain related to the sale of a fixed income analytics business.Net income came in at $4.1 billion compared with $3.8 billion in the prior-year quarter. Excluding the gain, earnings came in at $1.29 per share.Overall top-line strength was reflected, driven by higher banking and consumer banking revenues. Moreover, expenses declined on efficiency savings by the bank.However, Citigroup’s costs of credit for the third quarter were up 15% year over year to $2 billion. This rise largely reflects net credit losses of $1.8 billion and a net loan loss reserve build of $16 million due to hurricane and earthquake-related loan loss reserve builds.Top-Line Strength & Low Expenses RecordedRevenues increased 2% year over year to $18.2 billion in the reported quarter. The rise highlighted elevated revenues in the institutional clients group and global consumer banking, partially offset by decline in corporate/other revenues. The revenue figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.7 billion.At Institutional Clients Group (ICG), revenues came in at $9.2 billion in the quarter, up 9% year over year. Notably, revenues from total banking climbed 11%. Further, though fixed income revenues declined 16%, higher equity markets (up 16%) and securities services (up 12%) revenues offset the decline on a year-over-year basis.Global Consumer Banking (GCB) revenues increased 3% year over year to $8.4 billion, mainly driven by higher revenues in North America, Latin America and Asia GCB.Corporate/Other revenues were $509 million, plunging 55% from the prior-year quarter. The decline mainly reflected legacy assets runoff, hedging activities impact and divestiture activity.Operating expenses at Citigroup were down 2% year over year to $10.2 billion. Efficiency savings and the winding-down of legacy assets mitigated increased volume-related expenses and ongoing investments.Strong Balance SheetAt quarter end, Citigroup’s end of period assets was $1.89 trillion, up 4% year over year. The company’s loans grew 2% year over year at $653 billion. Deposits increased 3% year over year to $964 billion.Credit Quality ImprovedTotal non-accrual assets decreased 19% year over year to $5 billion. The company reported a drop of 22% in consumer non-accrual loans to $2.8 billion. In addition, corporate non-accrual loans of $2.1 billion went down 15% from the prior-year period.Citigroup’s total allowance for loan losses was $12.4 billion at quarter end, or 1.91% of total loans, compared with $12.4 billion, or 1.97%, in the year-ago period.Solid Capital PositionAt the end of the reported quarter, Citigroup’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio was 13.0%, increasing from 12.6% in the prior-year quarter. The company’s supplementary leverage ratio for the reported quarter was 7.1%, down from 7.4% in the year-earlier quarter.As of Sep 30, 2017, book value per share was $78.81 and tangible book value per share was $68.55, both up 6%, from the prior-year period.Capital DeploymentDuring third-quarter 2017, Citigroup repurchased about 81 million of common stock. Notably, the company returned around $6.4 billion to common shareholders as common stock repurchases and dividends.Our ViewpointCitigroup reported impressive results this time around also. Furthermore, restructuring efforts, including streamlining moves, will likely continue to ease the bank’s burden on the expense base. The company exhibits capital strength which continues to support its dividend and a share buyback program. Also, rise in revenues is commendable.One can consider a strong brand like Citigroup to be a sound investment option over the long term, given its global footprint and attractive core business. Additionally, the company’s growth looks encouraging amid the rising rate environment, as well as anticipated potential ease of regulations under President Trump’s administration.Nevertheless, several legal hassles and escalating costs of credit remain concerns for the company.Citigroup Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Citigroup Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Citigroup Inc. QuoteCurrently, Citigroup carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Among major banks, along with Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Amid an expected trading slump, rising rates and loan growth drove the company’s earnings of $1.76 per share, easily surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.67. Also, the figure reflects an 11% rise from the year-ago period. Notably, the results included a legal benefit of $107 million.Solid loan growth (driven mainly by improved credit card loans) and higher interest rates supported net interest income. Further, rise in advisory fees supported the top-line growth. A slight fall in operating expenses acted as a tailwind.Among other Wall Street giants, U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 earnings on Oct 18, while Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) will report on Oct 17.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

399,CMA,"The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 13, before the opening bell. Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.Before we discuss why an earnings beat might also be in store and what could influence the results, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the prior quarter.PNC Financial’s second-quarter 2017 results improved primarily due to growth in loan balances and decline in provision for loan losses. These factors also helped it in surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the positives were partially offset by higher expenses.The earnings beat translated into improved price performance. Over the last three months, shares of PNC Financial have gained 7.5% compared with 3.4% growth recorded by the industry.Notably, PNC Financial delivered positive earnings surprises in each of the trailing four quarters, with an impressive average beat of 5.1%. PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise  PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise | PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (The) QuoteWill the upcoming earnings release give a boost to PNC Financial’s stock? This depends largely on whether the firm is able to deliver a positive earnings surprise.Here’s what our quantitative model predicts:According to our quantitative model, chances of PNC Financial beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the to-be-reported quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to be confident of an earnings surprise call.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for PNC Financial is +0.07%.Zacks Rank: PNC Financial currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which when combined with a positive ESP, increases the chances of an earnings beat.Nonetheless, the estimates have remained stable over the past 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.13 per share for the third quarter reflects growth of 15.3% year over year.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsNet Interest Income to Grow: In addition to higher interest rates, moderate improvement in lending — particularly, in the areas of commercial and industrial as well as consumer — might perk up interest income.Management expects its net interest income for the to-be-reported quarter to increase in low-single digits while fee income is expected to remain stable.Expenses to Remain Stable: The company anticipates its non-interest expenses to remain stable in the third quarter.Provision for Loan Losses: The company expects the provisions to be in the range of $75-$125 million in the to-be-reported quarter. Provision for loan losses in the year-ago quarter was $87 million.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.68% and a Zacks Rank #3.

400,CMA,"The expected fall in Bank of America Corp.’s (BAC  -  Free Report) trading income will adversely impact its third-quarter earnings, slated on Friday, Oct 13. However, the bank is anticipated to record year-over-year growth in earnings and revenues.BofA’s performance in the last quarter reflected improved investment banking fees and higher net interest income while trading income witnessed a slump. The same tough operating backdrop continued in the third quarter as well.Earnings estimate revisions depict pessimism too. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter was revised 1.1% downward over the last 30 days.Earnings WhispersDecrease in earnings estimates increase chances of a beat. However, our quantitative model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat this time. Here’s why:BofA does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing chances of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for BofA is -0.66%.Zacks Rank: BofA’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. But we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.Nonetheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate reflects 10.8% improvement on a year-over-year basis. Further, BofA has a decent surprise history, as evident from the chart below:Bank of America Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Bank of America Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Bank of America Corporation QuoteFactors to Impact Q3 ResultsTrading slump: The third quarter appears to be disappointing for BofA in terms of trading business similar to the prior quarter. In September, the bank’s chief financial officer, Paul Donofrio projected nearly 15% year-over-year decline in trading income. Similar to the last quarter, slump in fixed-income revenues is expected to be the primary reason for this decline.While the fall is largely attributable to higher-than-usual volatility in the year-ago quarter, trading activities remained sluggish in the third quarter. Absence of any tangible development on the proposed reforms by the Trump administration and an unchanged monetary policy of the Fed were the main reasons for reduced volatility for the major part of the quarter.Investment banking to offer some support: Given the higher debt originations during the quarter (mainly on expectation of persistent rise in interest rates), debt underwriting fees are expected to continue rising in the to-be-reported quarter. However, overall low volumes of M&A and equity issuance during the quarter are expected to result in a decline in the related fees. But as BofA is one of the leading players in this space, it might not suffer a significant loss.Mortgage revenues not to be a major support: An expected higher rate environment might have led to a rise in demand for refinancing activities during the quarter, thus helping BofA record some mortgage revenues. However, with the refinance boom nearing its end, no big support is expected from this segment. So, the contribution of mortgage revenues to total revenues will not be much.Slight rise in net interest income (NII) on modest loan growth: Improvement in loan demand, particularly commercial and industrial, and consumer loans during quarter is expected to support NII. Further, management expects NII to increase sequentially, assuming realization of the forward curve and modest growth in loans and deposits. Nonetheless, the sale of non-U.S. consumer credit card operation will have a marginal negative impact.Reduced scope for cost control: Expense reduction, which has long been the main method to remain profitable, is not expected to be the primary support this quarter. But given the success of BofA’s cost-saving efforts and other restructuring initiatives as well as absence of significant legal costs and provisions, overall expenses should remain more or less stable.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few major bank stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.The company’s second-quarter earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were hurt by higher expenses and lower investment advisory performance fees. However, growth in assets under management (AUM) acted as a tailwind.Nevertheless, the company boasts a decent earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 1.9%.Moreover, BlackRock’s business activities and prospects encouraged analysts to revise earnings estimates recently. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.58 for the just-concluded quarter has increased 1.1% over the last 30 days.Shares of the company have gained 21.7% so far this year, underperforming the 24.6% growth for the industry it belongs to. However, we believe the positive trend in estimate revisions will translate into a better price performance in the near term.BlackRock, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  BlackRock, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | BlackRock, Inc. QuoteBefore we discuss the driving factors in detail, let’s look at what our quantitative model predicts.A Positive Surprise in Store?According to our quantitative model, chances of BlackRock beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the to-be-reported quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to be confident of an earnings surprise call.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for BlackRock is +0.40%.Zacks Rank: BlackRock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which when combined with a positive ESP, increases the chances of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsBlackRock continues to dominate the ETF market with its continued investments in its U.S. iShare core ETFs. Moreover, as investors are increasing their allocations toward ETFs rather than alternative investments with an aim to reduce management costs, the company’s iShares inflows are expected to remain strong in the quarter. This will likely further boost its AUM, which witnessed 16% year-over-year growth last quarter.The New York-based asset manager remains well diversified geographically. As a result, the average fee rate is likely to rise on the back of higher international flows amid recovering global economic conditions.However, BlackRock might witness an increase in costs in the to-be-reported quarter. BlackRock’s expenses have remained elevated over the last few years. Moreover, its plans of restructuring the traditional actively managed equities business and improving product offerings are expected to lead to a further increase in expenses.Other Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few other finance stocks that you may want to consider, as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter, according to our model.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Oct 17.

402,CMA,"The projected decline in JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s (JPM  -  Free Report) trading revenue will likely deal a major blow to its third-quarter earnings given significant dependence of its top line on this source. But this might not lead the company to report dismal results on Oct 12. Benefits of higher rates, decent loan growth and relatively better performance of the other segments — particularly investment banking — may overshadow the trading gloom.The stock, which recently showed strength on investors’ optimism over potential tax reforms as well as the Fed’s plans to unwind its giant balance sheet and keep increasing interest rates, may not take a hit due to the damage caused by the slump in trading revenue. This is because the bad news has already been factored out.Moreover, though market volatility has not improved much since last quarter, the huge year-over-year decline in trading revenue — highest since 2011 — will primarily be attributable to comparison with a quarter, which had witnessed higher-than-usual volatility due to the Brexit aftermath and the impending U.S. presidential election.While the momentum in investment banking business is likely to continue, growth in commercial and industrial loans as well as consumer lending should lend support to revenues.However, we do not expect major support from lower expenses to the bottom line this time around, as JPMorgan doesn’t have enough scope to reduce expenses further. If fact, there were some legal expenses in the quarter.While the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has not been revised over the last seven days, the trend over the last 30 days depict pessimism. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter has been revised 1.2% downward over the last 30 days to $1.67, with four out of eight estimates moving lower and one moving higher. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate reflects a year-over-year improvement of 5.6%.Decreasing earnings estimates increase the chance of a beat. However, our quantitative model doesn’t point to an earnings beat this time. Here’s why:JPMorgan doesn’t have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for JPMorgan is -0.53%. Zacks Rank: JPMorgan carries a Zacks Rank #3, but this alone isn’t enough to increase the chance of an earnings beat.JPMorgan Chase & Co. Price and Consensus JPMorgan Chase & Co. Price and Consensus | JPMorgan Chase & Co. QuoteHere is what should be at play:Major slump in trading revenue: Third quarter appears to be more disappointing for JPMorgan in terms of trading business than the past several quarters, as indicated by CEO Jamie Dimon with his projection of about a 20% year-over-year decline in trading revenue. Similar to last quarter, a slump in fixed-income revenue is primarily responsible for this decline.While this decline is primarily attributable to higher-than-usual volatility in the year-ago quarter, trading activities remained sluggish in the to-be-reported quarter in the absence of any tangible development on the reforms proposed by the Trump administration and lesser geopolitical tensions. Also, an unchanged monetary policy standpoint of the Fed did not contribute to volatility for the major part of the quarter.Likely continuation of investment banking strength: The trend of pocketing solid advisory and underwriting fees might have continued in the to-be-reported quarter primarily on the back of higher debt origination. As the interest rate hike is expected to continue, many U.S. companies have been raising fresh debt capital over recent quarters to avoid higher interest rates later. As debt origination fees account for about half of total investment banking fees, this has been leading to strong gains for JPMorgan and the other largest U.S. investment banks.On the other hand, with overall low volumes of M&A and equity issuance during the quarter, the related fees are expected to be lower for the largest U.S. investment banks. However, JPMorgan’s top ranking in this space is expected to be a saving grace.Some improvement in mortgage banking: Expectations of a higher rate environment might have encouraged refinancing activities during the quarter. However, with the refinance boom nearing its end, no major help is expected from this segment.Overall mortgage revenue might see some improvement, as fresh origination of loans was expected to increase during the quarter.However, unlike Wells Fargo and U.S. Bancorp, JPMorgan hasn’t bulked up its mortgage banking businesses since the last recession. So, the contribution of mortgage revenue gains to total revenues will not be extraordinary.Betterment in net interest income: In addition to higher interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending — particularly, in the areas of commercial and industrial as well as consumer — might perk up interest income.Lesser scope of cost containment: As the majority of unnecessary expenses have already been cut by the bank, expense reduction may not be a major support. JPMorgan was supposed to pay $4.6 million to the United States Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s (CFPB) civil penalty fund, as it failed to provide accurate screening reports. However, there were no major outflows related to legal settlements that might impact the firm’s earnings unusually in the to-be-reported quarter.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few bank stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements for an earnings beat this time around:Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report), scheduled to report results on Oct 17, has an Earnings ESP of +1.16% and a Zacks Rank of 3.

403,CMA,"Having reported a weak results for commodities in the last earnings season, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) is looking to recover by recruiting high-profile sales people and attracting new clients.The news was first reported by Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter.The bank has engaged its top executives to get corporate clients from various industries such as energy, power, mining and more. Further, Goldman has been keeping a close watch on the unit’s performance for quite some time now.Goldman’s commodities unit, which currently employs about 180 people, had been refraining itself from replacing senior employees in order to control costs.Management has decided to shift its focus from controlling costs to improving the unit’s performance.Last month, the bank’s Chief Financial Officer Marty Chavez attributed the poor performance of commodities unit to lower client activity and the market backdrop.However, these are not the only factors responsiblefor the poor performance of the unit.

404,CMA,"BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) remains well positioned for organic growth, supported by a rise in loan and deposit balances. Also, easing margin pressure should aid its top-line growth in the upcoming quarters.However, the company’s expenses remain elevated, which might curb profitability growth. Also, its significant exposure to risky loan portfolios remains a concern.The company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year earnings has been revised 1.4% downward over the past 30 days. The stock currently carries just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Looking at the fundamentals, the company’s loans and leases have increased at a CAGR of 5.2% in the last five years (2012–2016). Also, non-interest bearing deposits have increased at a three-year (2014-2016) CAGR of 14.3%.Moreover, the company has also been relying on a number of strategic acquisitions to grow inorganically.The company has an efficient share repurchase and dividend payment policy in place. Supported by a solid capital position, it should continue to enhance shareholder value through efficient capital deployment activities.Further, with the interest rate environment improving gradually, BB&T’s margin pressure seems to be easing. This is expected to aid its top-line growth. Notably, following the latest Fed rate hike, the company raised its prime lending rate to 4.25%.However, the company’s expenses have increased at a CAGR of 3.6% over the last five years (as of the end of 2016). Given that it plans to continue with its acquisitions and mergers in the future, expenses are expected to remain elevated, thereby hurting bottom-line growth.Also, the company’s significant exposure to commercial, direct retail lending and residential mortgage loan portfolios pose risks. Although it has been successfully disposing assets, it still holds a large amount of risky loans that could pose a problem in case of further deterioration in macro-economic conditions.BB&T’s shares have gained 21.2% in a year’s time, underperforming the 30.8% growth for the industry it belongs to.

410,CMA,"People's United Financial Inc. (PBCT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2015 results on Thursday, Jul 16.Last quarter, this financial savings and loan institution witnessed more than10% year-over-year rise in earnings, while at the same time managing to beat estimates. Results were aided by higher revenue, partially offset by increased expenses and provisions.Will People's United fail to impress in the upcoming release after combating the challenges witnessed by the industry in the quarter? Let's see what factors might have influenced the earnings report this time around.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsIncreasing commercial real estate and lending activities from the improving economy is likely to contribute to People’s United’s revenue growth. Notably, the company has a track record of positive loan growth (annualized) for the past 18 consecutive quarters. While continuity of such a trend is likely to drive net interest income in the second quarter, we remain cautious at the same time. We expect to witness a rise in provisions during the quarter given the rapidly growing and diversifying loan portfolio.Also, net interest margin is predicted to remain under pressure, owing to lower yield on new loans, given the current low rate environment.Additionally, bank service charges will continue to be impacted due to certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.On a positive note, as reaffirmed by the company during its first-quarter earnings call conference, growth in net interest income from its originated portfolio exceeding lost accretion on the acquired portfolio will likely continue to be a driving factor for subsequent quarters.Also, commercial banking lending fees is likely to get a boost due to moderate growth in commercial prepayment activity in commercial real estate.We believe the quarterly results are likely to reflect reducing expenses.  This is because increase in expenses owing to seasonality in the first quarter is not likely to repeat in the second quarter. Further, as previously announced, the company intends to close around 10 branches in the remainder of this year and plans to reduce real estate costs by consolidating other facilities. Such efforts are likely to reflect in the company’s expense base.Activities of People's United during the quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter remained stable at 21 cents per share over the last 7 days.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that People's United is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the second quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or at least 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, this is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for People's United is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 21 cents.Zacks Rank: People's United’s Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) increases the predictive power of ESP. But we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings surprise call.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as our model shows that these also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:KeyCorp. (KEY  -  Free Report) has an earnings ESP of +3.57% and carries a Zacks Rank #2. It is expected to report its second-quarter results on Jul 16.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) has an earnings ESP of +1.35% and carries a Zacks Rank #3. It is expected to report its second-quarter results on Jul 17.The earnings ESP for Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc. (CFR  -  Free Report) is +3.57% and it carries a Zacks Rank #2.

Earnings per share of 63 cents topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 59 cents. Also, the reported figure improved 37% year over year.Continued growth in loan and deposit balances, aiding higher revenues, was recorded. Eased margin pressure and lower provisions were the positives.

However, revenues were up 9% year over year.Citizens Financial’s net interest income increased 11% year over year to $1.03 billion. The rise is primarily attributable to average loan growth and improved margin. In addition, net interest margin expanded 13 basis points (bps) year over year to 2.97%, mainly due to enhanced loan yields and higher interest rates, partly mitigated by securities portfolio growth, and elevated deposit and funding costs.Also, non-interest income climbed 4% year over year to $370 million. The rise was driven by strength in almost all components of income, partially offset by reduced net securities gains and other income.Non-interest expenses were up 4% year over year to $864 million. The increase reflects rise in all categories of expenses except equipment-related costs.Efficiency ratio declined to 62% in the second quarter from 65% in the prior-year quarter. Generally, lower ratio is indicative of the bank’s improved efficiency.As of Jun 30, 2017, period end total loan and lease balances increased 1% sequentially to $109.8 billion while total deposits rose 1% from the previous quarter to $113.6 billion.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagAs of Jun 30, 2017, allowance for loan and lease losses increased 2% year over year to $1.2 billion.

Further, Tier 1 leverage ratio came in at 9.9% compared with 10.3% as of Jun 30, 2016.

Notably, including common stock dividends, the company returned $957 million to shareholders as of Jun 30, 2017.Outlook 2017The company’s Tapping Our Potential (TOP) initiatives remain on track. In 2016, TOP II recorded about $105 million of annual pre-tax benefits. Further, TOP III is expected to result in pre-tax revenue and expense run-rate benefits of $110 million, including $20 million of tax benefits in 2017.Further, TOP IV initiatives are expected to deliver $90–$105 million of run-rate pre-tax revenue and expense benefits by the end of 2018. These initiatives are expected to help drive continued positive operating leverage and fund investments for future growth.Our ViewpointResults highlight a decent quarter for Citizen Financial. We are optimistic as the company remains focused on several of its initiatives to grow revenues and improve efficiency. With a diversified traditional banking platform, Citizens Financial is well poised to benefit from the recovery of economies where it has a footprint.Citizens Financial Group, Inc.

412,CMA,"KeyCorp’s (KEY  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 34 cents per share were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.KeyCorp’s shares fell nearly 2.4% in pre-market trading, reflecting investors’ concern over rising provision for credit losses. Notably, the price reaction during the full trading session will provide a better idea about how investors accepted the results.Results were supported by revenue synergies from the First Niagara Financial Group acquisition deal (completed in Aug 2016) and higher interest rates. On the other hand, higher operating expenses and increase in provision for credit losses were the downsides. Notably, the company witnessed marginal loan growth while deposit balances declined.Including merger-related charges of $43 million, net income from continuing operations came in at $393 million, up significantly from $193 million in the prior-year quarter.First Niagara Deal Continues to Drive Revenues, Expenses RiseTotal revenue surged 52.1% year over year to $1.64 billion. Also, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.52 billion.Tax-equivalent net interest income jumped 63.1% year over year to $987 million. The rise was attributable to benefits from the First Niagara acquisition, a rise in earning asset balances and ongoing business activities. Also, taxable-equivalent net interest margin from continuing operations grew 54 basis points (bps) year over year to 3.30%.Non-interest income (excluding merger related charges) was $653 million, an increase of 38.1% from the year-ago quarter. A rise in all fee income components drove the surge.Non-interest expenses (excluding merger related charges) jumped 34.7% year over year to $951 million due to a rise in both personnel as well as non-personnel expenses. The quarter recorded a modest year-over-year fall in merger-related charges.Loans Rise Marginally, Deposits DeclineAt the end of the second quarter, average total deposits were $102.8 billion, down nearly 1% from the prior quarter. However, average total loans were $86.5 billion, up 0.4% sequentially.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagNet loan charge-offs, as a percentage of average loans, increased 3 bps year over year to 0.31%. Provision for credit losses increased 26.9% year over year to $66 million. Further, KeyCorp’s allowance for loan and lease losses was $870 million, up 1.9% from the prior-year quarter.However, non-performing assets, as a percentage of period-end portfolio loans, other real estate owned properties assets and other nonperforming assets were 0.64%, down 39 bps year over year.Capital Ratios DeteriorateKeyCorp's tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 8.56% as of Jun 30, 2017, down from 9.95% as of Jun 30, 2016. In addition, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 10.79% versus 11.41% as of Jun 30, 2016.The company’s estimated Basel III Tier 1 common ratio was 9.97% at the end of the quarter, down from 11.10% as of Jun 30, 2016.Share RepurchasesDuring the reported quarter, KeyCorp repurchased $94 million worth of shares as part of its 2016 capital plan.Our TakeRestructuring initiatives undertaken by KeyCorp will be supported by its robust balance-sheet position. The company’s financials will continue to benefit from the synergies of the First Niagara transaction. Further, with gradual rise in interest rates and increasing loan demand, margin pressure is expected to ease in the coming quarters.However, increased dependence on home equity and commercial real estate loans raises the exposure of the company’s profits to these avenues.KeyCorp Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  KeyCorp Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | KeyCorp QuoteKeycorp currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

413,CMA,"BB&T Corporation’s (BBT  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 78 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.Better-than-expected results were driven by an increase in revenues and lower expenses. The quarter also witnessed an increase in loans and leases. Moreover, profitability improved in the quarter. However, provision for credit losses increased, which was a headwind.Results excluded merger-related and restructuring charges. After considering these, net income available to common shareholders was $631 million or 77 cents per share compared with $541 million or 66 cents per share in the prior-year quarter.Revenues up, Costs DownTotal revenue (taxable-equivalent) for the quarter came in at $2.90 billion, up 3.9% year over year.Tax-equivalent net interest income rose 1.1% from the prior-year quarter to $1.68 billion. Also, net interest margin increased 6 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter to 3.47%.Non-interest income increased nearly 8% year over year to $1.22 billion. Rise in almost all fee income components, except mortgage banking income, led to the growth. Also, the quarter witnessed nil net FDIC loss share income.Non-interest expense of $1.74 billion decreased 3.1% from the year-ago quarter. The decrease was primarily due to a fall in amortization of intangibles, net merger-related and restructuring charges and outside IT services related costs.BB&T’s adjusted efficiency ratio came in at 58.6%, down from 59.6% in the prior-year quarter. A fall in efficiency ratio indicates a rise in profitability.As of Jun 30, 2017, total deposits were nearly $157 billion, down from $161.3 billion in the prior-quarter. However, total loans and leases were $145.1 billion, up 0.8% sequentially.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagAs of Jun 30, 2017, total non-performing assets (NPAs) were $690 million, down 22.1% year over year. As a percentage of total assets, NPAs came in at 0.31%, down 9 bps year over year. Also, during the quarter, allowance for loan and lease losses came in at 1.03% of total loans and leases held for investment, down 3 bps year over year.However, net charge-offs were 0.37% of average loans and leases, up 9 bps year over year. Further, provision for credit losses was $135 million at the end of the quarter, reflecting an increase of 21.6% year over year.Profitability & Capital Ratios ImprovedAt the end of the reported quarter, return on average assets was 1.22%, up from 1.06% in the prior-year quarter. Return on average common equity increased to 9.30% from 8.21% as of Jun 30, 2016.As of Jun 30, 2017, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 12.1%, compared with 11.7% in the year-ago quarter. BB&T's estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III (on a fully phased-in basis) was approximately 10.2% as of Jun 30, 2017.Share RepurchasesDuring the reported quarter, BB&T repurchased $160 million worth shares through open-market purchases.Our TakeWe believe BB&T to remain well positioned for revenue growth through strategic acquisitions. These efforts will also support bottom-line growth in the near term. Moreover, consistent growth in loans along with improving rate scenario should propel its organic growth trajectory.However, such acquisitions are expected to keep costs toward the higher end, which might hurt profitability. Also, the company’s exposure to risky loans continues to be a near-term concern.BB&T Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  BB&T Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | BB&T Corporation QuoteCurrently, BB&T carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Adjusted earnings per share of $1.15 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.07. The adjusted figure excludes restructuring charges and tax benefit from employee stock transactions.Better-than-expected results reflect higher revenues and lower expenses.

Also, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $770.8 million.Net interest income increased 12.4% on a year-over-year basis to $500 million. Moreover, net interest margin expanded 29 basis points (bps) to 3.03%.Total non-interest income came in at $276 million, up 3.0% on a year-over-year basis. Increased card fees, fiduciary income and service charges on deposit accounts primarily led to the rise.Further, non-interest expenses totaled $457 million, down 11.8% year over year. The fall was chiefly due to lower salaries, benefit expenses and restructuring charges, partly offset by increased processing fees and other expenses.Loans Increase, Deposits DeclineAs of Jun 30, 2017, total assets and common shareholders' equity were $71.4 billion and $8.0 billion, respectively, compared with $73.0 billion and $7.9 billion as of Mar 31, 2017.Total loans were up 2.3% on a sequential basis, to $49.4 billion.

Total risk-based capital ratio was 13.66%, up 92 bps from the prior-year quarter.Capital Deployment UpdateNotably, during the reported quarter, Comerica repurchased 2 million shares under its existing equity repurchase program. This, combined with dividends, resulted in a total payout of $185 million to shareholders.Impressive Outlook for 2017Comerica provided following guidance for 2017 assuming continuation of the current economic environment and the persistent low rates, along with contributions from the GEAR Up initiative of $30 million in revenues and $125 million in expense savings:The company anticipates higher net interest income, including the benefit of short-term rate increase in Dec 2016, Mar 2017 and Jun 2017, loan growth and debt maturities. Notably, the recent rise in short-term rates is likely to be over $30 million for the upcoming quarters, assuming a 25% deposit beta.Non-interest income is expected to increase 4–6%. The rise is expected on GEAR Up opportunities, modest growth in treasury management and card fees, along with wealth management products, including fiduciary and brokerage services.Non-interest expenses are predicted to be lower, excluding an estimated $40–$50 million restructuring expense. Notably, an additional $125 million in GEAR Up savings is expected. Technology costs and typical inflationary pressure can be offsetting factors. Including restructuring charges, expenses are projected to decrease about 4%.Provision for credit losses is likely to remain low, with steady performance in overall portfolio. Notably, net charge-offs are expected to remain low while provisions are expected to be in the range of 20–25 bps.Income tax expenses are anticipated to be approximately 31% of pre-tax income on the assumption of no tax impact from employee stock transactions.Comerica expects average loan growth to be 1%. Management expects loan growth to be 3%, if Mortgage Banker Finance and Energy segments are excluded.Our ViewpointThe company should benefit from its ongoing strategic initiatives. Additionally, its improving credit quality should support its financials in the quarters ahead. Further, the top-line continues to benefit from loan growth and easing pressure on margins.Comerica Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Comerica Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Comerica Incorporated QuoteCurrently, Comerica has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

416,CMA,"Navient Corporation (NAVI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 18, after the market closes. Both revenues and earnings are expected to decline on a year-over-year basis.The company boasts a weak surprise history. Navient lagged earnings estimates in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 2.5%.In the prior-year quarter, the company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate mainly due to lower net interest income. However, lower provision for credit losses and reduced expenses were the tailwinds.Navient Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Navient Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Navient Corporation QuoteFactors to Influence Q2 ResultsExpenses Likely to Increase: The company’s aim to defend itself against the student loan misconduct case filed against it is likely to increase legal expenses.Easing Margin Pressure: Owing to the recent interest rate hikes, we expect margin pressure to ease in the second quarter. However, lower treasury yields might offset the benefit slightly.Benefits from New Acquisitions of Student Loans: The student loans market has turned into one of the biggest consumer debt markets of the nation. Though conditions in the financial markets have been challenging lately, Navient’s seeks to acquire student loan portfolios, both Federally Guaranteed Student Loans as well as Private Education Loans, such as JPMorgan’s educational loan portfolio. These consistent efforts should lend some support to the quarterly results.Earnings WhispersOur proven model doesn’t conclusively show that Navient will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time around, as it does not have the right combination of two key components. Note that a stock with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) has significantly higher chances of beating estimates.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Navient is -2.38%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 41 cents is below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 42 cents.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Navient currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).We caution investors against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Further, for the to-be-reported quarter, the analysts have also depicted a pessimistic stance on Navient.

417,CMA,"U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 19, before the opening bell. While revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year, we can’t conclusively predict an earnings beat.Before we discuss why an earnings beat might not be in store and what could influence the results, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the last quarter.   The company’s first-quarter 2017 earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, aided by growth in net interest income and non-interest income. Further, the quarter recorded a rise in loan and deposit balances. However, on the down side, the quarter witnessed elevated expenses and higher provisions.Notably, U.S. Bancorp delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the four trailing quarters, with an average beat of 1.55%.U.S. Bancorp Price and EPS Surprise U.S. Bancorp Price and EPS Surprise | U.S. Bancorp QuoteRegarding the stock’s performance, shares of the company gained around 1% for the three-month period (ended Jun 30, 2017), underperforming growth of 4.0% recorded by Zacks categorized Banks – Major Regional industry.Will the upcoming earnings release give a boost to U.S. Bancorp’s stock? This depends largely on whether the firm is able to post a beat in the second quarter. However, our quantitative model doesn’t conclusively point toward an earnings beat this time. Here’s why:U.S. Bancorp doesn’t have the right combination of the two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or at least 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – for increasing its chances of an earnings beat. It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for U.S. Bancorp is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 84 cents. This is a major indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the company. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: U.S. Bancorp’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsExpenses to Trend Higher: Expenses might trend upward in the upcoming release due to digitization and investments in technology. Moreover, costs are expected to be seasonally higher in the to-be-reported quarter.Pressure on Net Interest Margin to Ease Slightly: Though the lingering low-rate environment has taken a toll on the bank’s margins for the past several years, the Fed’s recent rate hike for the fourth time, since the financial crisis, and its commitment to raise rates faster (one more time) this year, based on a convincing pace of economic growth, will likely help banks get rid of shrinking margins further. However, lower treasury yields during the quarter might curb margin improvement.Top-line Growth: It is anticipated that an improving economy will spur consumer activity, which will help both payments businesses and consumer lending businesses. An improved economic backdrop should also lead to a rise in business spending on development and capital investments. Further, mortgage revenue is projected to improve sequentially.Loan Growth: Per the Federal Reserve’s latest data, loans grew on a sequential basis during the second quarter. Both commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans (C&I) are anticipated to increase, while consumer loans might fall. Therefore, interest income for banks is projected to improve marginally.Management expects commercial loan growth to improve on a sequential basis. Credit card, mortgage and auto loan growth is likely to be stronger due to seasonality.Activities of U.S. Bancorp during the quarter to be reported were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter declined 1.2% to 84 cents over the last seven days.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.67% and a Zacks Rank #2.

418,CMA,"Visa Inc. (V  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jul 20, after market close.Last quarter, Visa surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.86%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Q3 FlashbackWe expect fiscal third-quarter earnings to gain traction from the company’s digital initiatives. Visa Checkout, a digital payment platform, is sustaining tremendous growth, reaching more than 20 million enrolled accounts. Its other digital initiatives Visa Direct and mVisa are continuing to expand globally.The company will likely report an increase in U.S. payments’ volumes driven by the gain of USAA and Costco clients.The company’s Service Revenue is likely to increase on higher global U.S. debit as well as credit card payment volumes.Also, growth in processed transaction is likely to push up Data Processing fees.The company’s disciplined capital allocation plan by way of share buyback and dividend payments should add to its bottom line.Fiscal third-quarter earnings are also likely to be benefited by a lower adjusted tax rate driven by the reorganization of Visa Europe and other subsidiaries.  Nevertheless, higher operating cost and forex headwinds will be the dampeners.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Visa is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Visa has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 81 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Visa carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP.

419,CMA,"Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) is slated to announce second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 19, before the opening bell. While investors cheered its enhanced capital deployment plan, we don’t think this optimism will continue following the earnings release.While Morgan Stanley’s performance in the last quarter reflected improved trading revenues and higher investment banking fees, a challenging operating backdrop is expected to dampen the company’s second-quarter earnings.Earnings estimate revisions depict pessimism too. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter was revised 2.5% downward, over the last seven days. Nonetheless, the company’s revenues and earnings are expected to grow modestly year over year.Also, Morgan Stanley boasts a decent earnings surprise history. This is evident from the chart below:Morgan Stanley Price and EPS Surprise  Morgan Stanley Price and EPS Surprise | Morgan Stanley QuoteEarnings WhispersDeclining earnings estimates increase chances of a beat. However, our quantitative model doesn’t conclusively predict earnings beat this time. Here’s why:Morgan Stanley does not have the right combination of two main ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher – for increasing chances of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Morgan Stanley is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 76 cents.Zacks Rank: Morgan Stanley carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).As it is we caution investors against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or #5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Factors to Impact Q2 Results  Trading income slump on low volatility: For the major part of the quarter, trading activities remained sluggish largely due to low volatility in both bond and equity markets. While the markets witnessed a modest increase in volatility almost at the end of quarter, it is not likely to be enough for Morgan Stanley to record any improvement in trading revenues.Underwriting fees to record a slight rise: Driven by an improving market conditions, the second quarter witnessed an increase in equity issuance while debt issuance was hit by higher interest rates. Per the data compiled by Thomson Reuters, equity market activities led to more than nearly 22% rise in equity underwriting fees, with Morgan Stanley at the top spot (recording over 50% growth in fees).However, the data indicates that global fees related to bond activity roughly totaled $6.5 billion during the second quarter, down more than 16% year over year. So, Morgan Stanley should have recorded a decline in debt underwriting fees during the quarter.All in all, total underwriting fees is expected to witness a slight rise on the basis of improved equity markets.Advisory fee revenues to suffer: Global M&A activity remained lackluster. Per the Thomson Reuters data, the total deal value of announced M&As across the world fell during the quarter. Thus, total fees earned through deal making should have declined as well. Likewise, Morgan Stanley is expected to earn $372.1 million as advisory fees in the quarter, indicating a fall of 20.9% from the prior-year quarter.Slight rise in net interest income (NII) on loan growth: Improvement in loan demand, particularly commercial and industrial, and real estate during quarter is expected to support NII. Further, a rise in interest rates will likely lead to an increase in interest income as well.Support to bottom line from expense control: Morgan Stanley has a cost savings plan – Project Streamline – in place. This is likely to result in lower expenses during the quarter. Also, as much improvement in revenues is not likely, chances of a big increase in compensation expenses is low.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few bank stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report results on Jul 18.

420,CMA,"We expect TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation (AMTD  -  Free Report) to beat earnings expectations when it reports third-quarter fiscal 2017 results, before the opening bell on Jul 18. Notably, revenues and earnings are also expected to grow year over year.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that TD Ameritrade has the right combination of two key ingredients to beat earnings this quarter.Zacks ESP:The Earnings ESP for the stock, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is pegged at +2.44%. This is a very significant and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the company. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank #2 (Buy): Note that stocks with a Zacks Ranks #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) and 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings.The combination of TD Ameritrade’s Zacks Rank #2 and ESP of +2.44% makes us confident of an earnings beat.  It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.However, the company has a disappointing earnings surprise history as depicted in the chart below:TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation Price and EPS Surprise TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation QuoteShares of TD Ameritrade declined 3.5% over the past six months compared with the slight decline recorded by the Zacks categorized Investment Bank industry.Factors to Influence Fiscal Q3 ResultsExpenses to trend high: Expenses are likely to remain under pressure given the company’s ongoing investments in technology, and advice and guidance offerings.  Further, operating expenses are expected to escalate to $530–$540 million on a quarterly basis due to Scottrade-related, sales incentives and trading-related expenses.Margin pressure might ease: A lingering low-interest rate environment has been weighing on TD Ameritrade’s net interest margin (NIM). Though spread-based revenues have increased in the recent quarters, the company has been experiencing a shrinking NIM. Nevertheless, the latest rise in the interest rates is expected to alleviate pressure on the bank’s NIM to some extent.Market Volatility: Being an investment bank, TD Ameritrade is exposed to extreme market volatility. Therefore, the company is likely to be hurt by the persistent market swings experienced during the quarter.Continued asset growth: The company has been witnessing double-digit asset growth for the last several years. Notably, during fiscal 2016, the company recorded an annualized growth rate of 9% in net new client assets, within the long-term target of increasing net new client assets at an annual rate of 7–11%. The increasing trend continued in the first six months of fiscal 2017 as well. With an innovative trading platform, consistent focus on high net-worth clients and enhanced service model to boost engagement and retention, we anticipate TD Ameritrade to display the improving trend in the fiscal third quarter as well.However, activities of TD Ameritrade during the quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter moved down 2.4% to 41 cents over the last seven days.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.67% and a Zacks Rank #2.
