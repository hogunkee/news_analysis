23,FE,"For those looking for the best dividend stocks in 2018, the Utility Leaders screen may prove disappointing right now. The list remains scant, with just six stocks as of the end of Friday's trading. They include Exelon (EXC), featured in this column on May 12 and in IBD Weekly.FirstEnergy (FE) doesn't make the current screen. One possible reason why: It could be the decline in cash payouts in recent years, as calculated by William O'Neil + Co. But the Akron, Ohio-based company makes up for that negative factor with plenty of positive ones.Consider FirstEnergy's 3-year Earnings Stability Factor, a very respectable 7 on a scale of zero (highly stable) to 99 (highly volatile). Income investors want to focus on companies that do not see big fluctuations in profits. Stable profits boost the odds that a company will sustain or even increase its dividend paid out per share.Second, the stock's annualized dividend yield of 4.2% nearly makes an embarrassment of the S&P 500's 1.8% yield.FirstEnergy is set to pay 36 cents a share Friday to shareholders of record May 7. The company has delivered that quarterly cash dividend for more than four years in a row. But it marks a decline from the 55 cents per share that First Energy paid for many years through December 2013.On April 23, FirstEnergy reported non-GAAP earnings of 67 cents a share, up 29% vs. a year ago, as revenue increased 4% to $2.98 billion""Eighteen months ago, we announced our plan to move away from commodity-exposed generation, so our company could fully focus on the tremendous opportunities in our regulated businesses,"" Charles E. Jones, FirstEnergy president and chief executive officer, said in a news release. ""Today, we are pleased to report strong earnings that represent FirstEnergy as a fully regulated company, and to reaffirm our guidance and growth projections.""FirstEnergy also raised its full-year non-GAAP profit forecast to a range of $2.25-$2.55 a share. The midpoint of that range would mark a 15% decline vs. the $2.82 it earned in 2017.The stock on Tuesday halted a five-day winning streak and closed a hair beneath its rising 50-day moving average. FirstEnergy shares are up 11.4% since Jan. 1.Watch to see if the stock musters the strength to not only retake the medium-term support and resistance line but also overcome overhead selling near 35 to 36.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary and analysis on stocks, charts, and financial markets.)RELATED:The Current Utility Stock LeadersIPO Leaders

31,FE,"As investors and Warren Buffett followers ponder what Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) will do with its swelling, record-high pile of cash, analysts say options include a major acquisition, buying more stocks like Apple (AAPL), doing nothing, or even a first-ever dividend.X The holding company held $109.3 billion in cash and equivalents at the end of the third quarter and will grow by some $3 billion more in December thanks to a bet on the burger business years ago. The record cash hoard is more than five times the $20 billion that CEO Buffett likes to keep on hand, and many shareholders want to see Berkshire put the money to greater work.Hopes are high that Berkshire could shake things up with a deal to rival its $37 billion Precision Castparts purchase in 2016 or its $26 billion Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad purchase in 2010, especially since an attempt this year to buy electric utility Oncor fizzled, while investments in a real estate investment trust and a Canadian mortgage lender hardly made a dent in Berkshire's cash.Buffett even acknowledged to Berkshire shareholders in May that it had been a while since he had pressed his ""foot to the floor"" on an acquisition, and rued keeping so much cash just lying around. But he said the question is: ""Are we going to be able to deploy it?""One challenge facing a Berkshire megadeal is stiff competition among U.S. companies looking to grow through acquisitions. Just in the last month, CVS Health (CVS) agreed to buy Aetna (AET) for $69 billion and Disney (DIS) reached a deal to buy most of 21st Century Fox's (FOXA) assets for $66 billion. The number of U.S. deals totaled 9,999 through Dec. 26, up 4.5% vs. all of 2016, according to Dealogic. And while deal values have slipped 14% to $1.492 trillion so far this year, they top the yearly average of approximately $1.137 trillion since 1995.Cathy Seifert, an equity analyst at investment research firm CFRA, thinks a key deal — or two — is likely. What she described as Berkshire's ""embarrassing"" Oncor loss may have left Buffett with the itch to prove his deal making chops, though she doesn't expect him to buy some hot tech company.""My sense is, valuation aside, there is still definitely an appetite to do deals,"" Seifert told Investor's Business Daily.A famously value-driven, opportunistic investor, Buffett's likely to scout for acquisition candidates in underperforming sectors as well as those that tend to do well late in the economic cycle. So think consumer staples, industrials, energy and telecom, Seifert said, adding that Buffett could also look abroad for acquisitions, especially Europe given the healthy recovery in many economies there.As for individual names that Berkshire could target, FactSet Research suggested Nike (NKE), Cognizant (CTSH), BlackRock (BLK), SAP (SAP) and Public Storage (PSA) among other companies. These companies check off Buffett's main acquisition criteria: sizable businesses, solid returns on equity, stable profits, low debt, able management, well-loved brands and simple business models.But any megadeal may be done with 3G Capital, which has teamed up with Buffett lately, including on the Kraft-Heinz (KHC) merger and the Burger King deal that eventually created Restaurant Brands (QSR).Actually, a splashy new deal is unlikely in the year ahead, said Robert Miles, the author of several books on Buffett. After a long bull market and stocks at record highs, a good deal is hard to find, and Buffett is ""a Walmart (WMT) shopper when it comes to stocks and companies"" — meaning, he looks long and hard at valuations.Miles said the 87-year-old Berkshire chief could bide his time ""until the next calamity in financial markets"" to jump on a megadeal.Meanwhile, the insurance segment remains Berkshire's cash cow and is its most important segment, notwithstanding this year's series of disasters that will force hefty payouts.The insurance operations require keeping a safe cushion for catastrophe claims, but it also produces a float — cash holdings from premiums collected ahead of claims that the company invests.Last year, Berkshire posted a combined $6.6 billion in underwriting profits and investment income tied to its prized and expanding float. So basically, Buffett ""got paid about 6%"" for holding his billions, Miles said. This puts the CEO in an enviable situation.""Buffett doesn't have to be in a hurry to go out and make silly investments,"" he added. ""He is getting paid to wait.""It's Berkshire's portfolio of stock holdings that draws especially intense interest, as Buffett fans try to mimic these investments. In Miles' view, Buffett could hand the cash pile over to Berkshire money managers like Todd Combs and Ted Weschler to buy more shares of Apple or smaller-cap equities.When it comes to stocks, Seifert thinks Buffett is more likely to continue to make equity investments in technology and financials.One thing he won't do? Speculate on some investment driving others to a fever pitch. ""He's not going to buy Bitcoin, I can pretty much guarantee you that,"" Miles said.Morningstar sector strategist Gregory Warren suggests Berkshire should try something new with its growing cash hoard: share repurchases and dividends.But that would mark a change of heart for Buffett. He is famously skeptical of such uses for excess cash, preferring to see it reinvested to grow businesses. But Warren argues that with more than $100 billion on its balance sheet, Berkshire should at least consider ""a large one-time special dividend"" soon.The windfall that will be seen on corporate ledgers after the GOP's tax cuts is expected to result in more repurchases and fatter dividends. And Berkshire stands to gain handsomely from lower taxes too.In September, when Congress was still discussing a 20% rate vs. the 21% that eventually passed, Barclays analyst Jay Gelb wrote that a cut to 20% could add $27 billion to Berkshire's book value by lowering its deferred tax liability and raise its earnings power by about 15%.MORE YOU MAY BE INTERESTED IN:Where Are The Early Investing Hot Spots In Artificial Intelligence?The New Stock Gems: Which Top IPOs Are The Next Googles Or Ciscos?Before You Buy Bitcoin, Read This

32,FE,"Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett, 87, ""shows no signs of slowing and could possibly be at the helm for another decade,"" JPMorgan insurance analyst Sarah DeWitt wrote in a note to clients Thursday, while observing that Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger is 93.But the issue of who will succeed Buffett, who has led the company for about five decades and is widely regarded as one of the world's most canny and successful investors, is a niggling one.""CEO succession is a major risk because Warren Buffett is synonymous with Berkshire,"" DeWitt wrote.But she went on to offer her view that the likely successor could be a man who wins regular praise from the Oracle of Omaha and who heads Berkshire's utility business.""We think Greg Abel would be a strong allocator of capital and the earning power of the underlying businesses would remain strong after Buffett,"" De Witt said.Still, she thinks a prolonged period of selling pressure is possible when Buffett exits, which could create a buying opportunity.Berkshire's class B shares closed up 0.7% to 179.89 on the stock market today, still in buy range after faltering since a July breakout from a saucer-with-handle base with a 172.80 buy point. DeWitt has a 210 price target by the end of next year.IBD'S TAKE: This mortgage insurer, a hot growth stock on the IBD 50 list, has racked strong profits and is showing favorable technical traits. Will recent hurricanes damage its performance?DeWitt is upbeat on Berkshire's individual businesses, predicting earnings will accelerate in insurance and in the Burlington Northern Santa Fe rail company, while manufacturing, service and retail could see solid profit growth. The utility business also offers ""recession-resistant earnings and attractive returns.""""The businesses benefit from best-in-class managements (and) unmatched balance-sheet strength, and many of the companies have strong brands, scale or low-cost competitive advantages,"" she wrote, forecasting double-digit annual earnings growth through 2019.Berkshire's record $66 billion in excess cash could add about 20% to annual earnings if used to make acquisitions, in DeWitt's view.RELATED:Insurance Stocks Tumble As Hurricane Harvey Impact MountsInsurers Rally As Irma Damage Less Than Expected; 2 RV Makers Hit BuysEssent Leads Its Industry, But Will Hurricanes Hurt Performance?

34,FE,"Has Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) CEO Warren Buffett found another chemical company to acquire?X Lanxess stock shot up in Frankfurt trading after it emerged that Berkshire's General Reinsurance unit is now among the six largest shareholders in the company with a newly disclosed 3% stake in the German company.Buffett may have hinted that he is again on the hunt for an acquisition during a recent trip to another chemical maker, Lubrizol, which Berkshire bought in 2011 for $9.7 billion.During the April 5 visit, he was asked how Lubrizol fit in the Berkshire portfolio. Buffett, who famously invests in old-school industries and companies with a competitive edge, replied that a ""terrific business"" like Lubrizol takes ""decades and decades to build."" It was second largest in terms of earnings in his portfolio and a very important asset to Berkshire, he added.""Find me another Lubrizol, I'll send flowers your way,"" he told an interviewer during the visit.Two recent moves by Lanxess CEO Matthias Zachert — a $2.4 billion purchase of Chemtura and a joint rubber-related venture with Saudi Aramco — could make it one of the biggest manufacturers of additives for lubricants and flame retardants, reports said.Lanxess, like Lubrizol, operates chemicals businesses around the world, including the key market of China.Indeed, Buffett's acquisition of Lubrizol was seen as a major bet on emerging markets and overseas growth. The chemical maker's products can be found in everything from heavy-duty industrial engines to personal care products.The Lubrizol purchase came under a cloud when a former director at Berkshire was forced to resign after failing to disclose a prior stake in the company. More recently, Lubrizol incurred a significant loss tied to the purchase of certain oilfield businesses from Weatherford International (WFT).Before Tuesday's news, Lanxess shares had given up 8% since May 11, after its chief executive warned that growth rates are likely to slow in the second half of the year.Berkshire's class B shares were down 0.3% at 165.12 on the stock market today.Buffett has something of a track record of buying equity stakes in a company before purchasing it outright. That happened with the 2010 buyout of railroad company Burlington Northern Santa Fe for $26 billion as well as the 2011 acquisition of Lubrizol.But not all of Berkshire's stakes turn into acquisitions. While Berkshire has loaded up on Phillips 66 (PSX) shares in recent years, ending 2016 with a roughly 16% stake in the oil and gas refiner, there has yet to be a takeover despite some talk of a possibility.RELATED:Is Warren Buffett About To Make His Next Mega Acquisition?

35,FE,"General Motors (GM) on Tuesday announced a $1 billion U.S. investment plan comprised mostly of spending on models and plants long in the works, becoming the latest automaker to answer to pressure from President-elect Donald Trump to create jobs.The nation's top carmaker will add or retain about 7,000 salaried and hourly workers, including almost 2,000 in domestic factories, spokesman Pat Morrissey said. The announcement was accelerated after Trump urged the company last week to follow Ford Motor (F) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU) and detail U.S. spending plans, said a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the matter was private.Earlier Tuesday, Korea's Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors said they'll increase U.S. investment over the next five years and consider building a new plant in the country. Trump praised Ford and Fiat Chrysler last week for plans to spend on U.S. factories after threatening for months to slap Mexico-built vehicles with a 35% import tax.The president-elect is taking credit mostly for expenditures that the companies had already planned, according to Maryann Keller, an independent auto industry consultant based in Stamford, Conn.""This is the normal course of business,"" Keller said of GM. ""All they're doing is announcing investments that they would have made anyway.""Carmakers are eager to cooperate with the incoming administration as they prepare to ask for favors including weaker fuel economy rules and lower corporate taxes. And the auto industry isn't alone: Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) will create about 10,000 retail jobs, the country's largest private employer said Tuesday.Less than two minutes into his first formal news conference since the election, Trump highlighted Ford's decision to cancel a $1.6 billion factory in Mexico and expand an existing plant in Michigan. Fiat Chrysler committed $1 billion toward making three new Jeeps in the U.S. and enabling a Michigan facility to manufacture a Ram pickup now produced in Mexico. He said he hoped GM would follow.""With all of the jobs I am bringing back into the U.S. (even before taking office), with all of the new auto plants coming back into our country and with the massive cost reductions I have negotiated on military purchases and more, I believe the people are seeing 'big stuff,' "" Trump wrote in a series of tweets Tuesday.GM will begin to bring axle production for its next-generation full-size pickups to operations in Michigan, including work previously done in Mexico, creating 450 U.S. jobs, the company said Tuesday. About 1,500 workers will be added or retained at factories detailed during the course of the year, and the company will add about 5,000 employees to develop advanced technology or join its lending subsidiary GM Financial.The automaker budgets about $9 billion a year toward capital expenditures, including for new models and factory upgrades. The U.S. is no longer the biggest market in the world for the Detroit-based company — that title goes to China, where it plans to introduce 18 new or refreshed vehicles this year.The automaker announced at least $2.9 billion in U.S. investment in 2016, bringing its total since 2009 to $29 billion.Trump targeted GM earlier this month for importing a small number of Chevrolet Cruze hatchback models from Mexico to the U.S. The company has made separate recent announcements that it would permanently cut 3,300 jobs at three passenger-car plants and temporarily slow production at five factories in states including Michigan and Ohio, due to slack demand.GM also continues to invest in Mexico. In late 2014, the company said it would spend $5 billion on new plants in the country by 2018, creating 5,600 jobs. Facilities making the Chevrolet Equinox and GMC Terrain, shown last week at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, account for about $1 billion of those outlays.The auto industry has been in Trump's cross hairs. He's threatened Japan's Toyota Motor (TM) and Germany's BMW with tariffs on Mexico-made cars. BMW sees "" no reason"" to change plans, said Peter Schwarzenbauer, who heads the automaker's Mini and Rolls-Royce brands and its car-sharing business.Hyundai and its affiliate Kia said Tuesday that they plan to invest $3.1 billion in the U.S. over the next five years, up from $2.1 billion spent in the five years through 2016.South Korea's two largest automakers group may produce Hyundai's upscale Genesis vehicles and a U.S.-specific SUV in the country, said President Chung Jin-haeng, who also oversees strategic planning for Kia.""We expect a boost in the U.S. economy and increased demand for various models as President-elect Trump follows through on his promise to create 1 million jobs in five years,"" Chung said. ""We will actively consider introducing new models that have increasing demand and profits.""Hyundai has been considering expanding its plant in Montgomery, Ala., which produces the Sonata and Elantra sedans and Santa Fe crossover. The factory is running at its top capacity of 370,000 cars a year. Kia's factory in West Point, Ga., is also at full tilt, producing 360,000 units of the Optima sedan and Sorento SUV a year.Hyundai and Kia have no additional plans to invest in Mexico and won't transfer production or jobs from the U.S. to Mexico, according to a Hyundai spokesman.Kia opened a new $3 billion, 200,000 unit-a-year production line in Mexico two months before the U.S. presidential election. The company plans to increase capacity there to 300,000 units this year and to 400,000 vehicles by the end of 2018.""When automakers such as Toyota announced their new strategies in response to the so-called Trump risk, the industry was nervous and asked 'Who's next?',"" said Kim Jin-woo, an analyst at Korea Investment & Securities in Seoul. ""This is positive news that came at the right time as the automakers were facing capacity constraints in the U.S.""

36,FE,"Treasuries rebounded from a four-month low, while the dollar retreated after mixed data on the world's largest economy supported the case for monetary policy to remain accommodative. Oil declined.U.S. government bond yields dropped as the greenback retreated against most of its major peers — after a measure of manufacturing in New York unexpectedly contracted, while national factory production grew for the third time in four months. Energy shares drove U.S. losses as investors assessed corporate earnings. Crude fell for a second day as OPEC members added supply and American producers increased drilling, threatening to compound a global surplus.Traders are monitoring economic data and rhetoric from policymakers for clues to the path of U.S. interest rates. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said its Empire State index declined this month as analysts projected expansion, while data on U.S. manufacturers signaled recovery. Investors also weighed comments from Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer on Monday, who said that he sees limits to how far the central bank can pursue a strategy aimed at continuing to reduce unemployment.""People are trying to figure out what the Fed is going to do,"" Thomas Garcia, head of equity trading at Thornburg Investment Management in Santa Fe, N.M., said by phone.Futures indicate a 66% probability that the Fed will raise rates by its December meeting, up from around 50% as recently as Sept. 27, according to calculations by Bloomberg.Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 1.77% as of 5 p.m. in New York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The yield earlier touched 1.81%, its highest level since June.The rally comes following a tumble this month in longer-dated Treasuries. Steven Major, global head of fixed-income research at HSBC Holdings, said the Fed's policy-tightening pace is too slow for rates to climb meaningfully before the next economic downturn.""To me the structural story has not changed — we are talking about the debt overhang, demographics, productivity, excess savings — all the factors for the bond market,"" Major said Monday in an interview with Bloomberg TV. ""A year out, yields will be lower than they are now. Five years out, I doubt they'd be higher than this level.""The sell-off in U.K. government bonds gathered pace as prospects of faster inflation gave investors another reason to pull back from a market hurt by the mounting economic and political cost of Brexit.

37,FE,"With Facebook (FB) user growth in developing countries soaring, mutual funds focused on emerging economies are increasing investments in the Menlo Park, Calif.-based company.Six years ago, 60% of the social platform's 482 million monthly active users lived in the U.S., Canada and Europe and the rest were from elsewhere. Now two-thirds of its 1.7 billion users are from outside of the heart of the developing world. Researcher eMarketer estimates India will surpass the U.S. next year as the country with the most Facebook users. It also ranks India, Indonesia, Mexico and the Philippines as the top four countries to see the fastest Facebook user growth until 2020.""From a monetization perspective it's still dominantly the U.S. but from a long-term opportunity perspective it's definitely emerging-markets,"" Charlie Wilson, the Santa Fe, N.M.-based managing director at Thornburg Investment Management Inc., said in an interview in New York. He has steadily added Facebook shares to the Thornburg Developing World Fund, and they now account for 3% of the $1.2 billion portfolio.While the general trend backs Wilson's thesis, it may be years before Facebook's geographic revenue mix catches up with the shift in its user-base. Three quarters of its revenue still comes from the U.S., Canada and Europe, down from 88% six years ago.IBD'S TAKE: Facebook's global user growth has helped the social networking giant accelerate for four straight quarters. And that's helping U.S. investors: Facebook shares broke out in July and again last week. And Facebook is still within 5% of the 128.43 buy point.The Thornburg fund's flexible mandate allows Wilson to allocate as much as 20% of capital to stocks whose issuers are not domiciled in emerging markets. Thornburg now holds the second-largest position in Facebook among 20 emerging-market funds with exposure to it. In all, those funds own $249 million in Facebook shares, up from $24 million three years ago but still just 0.07% of its market capitalization.""This is probably one of the most unappreciated platforms even though it's really well-known and it's a large market cap,"" he said. ""The fact that it's derating while they're still beating earnings by 5% or 15% every quarter is pretty interesting to me,"" he added, referring to analysts' moves to lower their ratings on the stock.""From a global investors perspective you are trying to gain access to some of these long-term penetration and market share opportunities that exist in emerging-markets, that allow you to compound faster than a traditional developed-markets portfolio,"" Wilson said.

38,FE,"Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) saw second-quarter net earnings rise 25% to $5 billion, or about $2.03 per Class B share, a penny above estimates.The conglomerate late Friday said revenue grew 6% to $54.46 billion, though total revenue was lighter than analyst consensus for $56.44 billion. Revenue from Berkshire's flagship insurance businesses climbed 9.9% to $43.59 billion.""Our insurance underwriting operations generated increased net earnings in the second quarter and first six months of 2016 compared to 2015,"" management said in a regulatory filing.That reflected foreign-exchange rate fluctuation for Berkshire's reinsurance activities overseas, as well as an increase in underwriting gains for its Geico business, partly offset by lower gains from General Re and Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group operations.Berkshire saw a 10.3% drop in its Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad revenue to $8.85 billion, down from $9.87 billion in the second quarter of 2015, as railroads continue to be slammed by lower shipments of petroleum, coal and other products.IBD'S TAKE: While Berkshire Hathaway and other large diversified manufacturers have generally reported middling results, smaller rivals have outperformed the market. To find out which companies in the group are the highest rated, go to the IBD Stock Checkup.Berkshire earlier in the year made a roughly $1 billion investment in Apple (AAPL) at a time when sales of its iPhone seemed to be slowing. However, in its July 26 earnings report, Apple reported stronger-than-expected iPhone sales, driving its stock up nearly 7% on July 27. Other core Berkshire holdings include Coca-Cola (KO), Wells Fargo (WFC) and oil and gas refiner Phillips 66 (PSX).But Berkshire's investment in Kraft Heinz (KHC) fell to $15.75 billion as of June 30 from $23.42 billion on Dec. 31, the company said in its 10-Q statement. Since the beginning of the year, Berkshire's total shareholders' equity has increased $7.5 billion.Berkshire's Class B shares dipped 0.1% to 145.56 in the stock market today. Its stock dropped to a 2016 low of 123.55 on Feb. 3, in sync with the early-year market pullback, and then turned up.

40,FE,"Soybean futures entered a bull market after floods damaged crops in parts of Argentina, the world’s third-biggest producer.Argentina, the top exporter of soybean meal and vegetable oil, got as much as six times the normal amount of rain this month, flooding flat fields that the Santa Fe province’s governor said will result in a crop “failure.” Adverse weather will reduce output by 5.4% to 57.6 million metric tons from a previous estimate, the national government said. Buyers may turn to the U.S., the largest grower, for supplies as the dollar’s slump against the peso makes shipments more attractive.Optimism for demand is dominating the market after China, the top buyer, reported that soybean imports in March jumped 36% to 6.1 million metric tons from February. That marked the highest-ever for the month. American farmers are benefiting as the dollar’s drop against the real in Brazil, the largest exporter, made U.S. supplies more competitive. In the past six weeks, sales from the U.S. exceeded the average in the previous five years, and the total in the week ended April 14 was the highest for the period since 2009, government data show.Soybean futures for July delivery rose 0.8% to close at $10.275 a bushel at 1:20 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. The price jumped 20% from the settlement of $8.5525 on Nov. 13, the cheapest since March 2009. That met the common definition of a bull market. Earlier, the oilseed reached $10.4375, the highest intraday level for a most-active contract since July 14.On Wednesday, aggregate trading jumped 31% to a record 804,244 contracts, or more bushels than the U.S. produced last year. Open interest, or the number of outstanding contracts held, rose to a record 895,583 contracts on Tuesday. On Thursday, estimated volume dropped to 636,881, still the second-highest ever.Investors are the most bullish since June 2014.

41,FE,"What a difference a brand can make.Just ask big-tobacco company Reynolds American (RAI), now on a roll with its newly acquired Newport, the No. 2 cigarette in the U.S. behind Marlboro and the nation’s No. 1 menthol brand. Even as tobacco consumption has fallen, Newport’s market share has kept growing.The gain was especially strong under Reynolds American’s ownership in the fourth quarter, when U.S. market share for Newport among all brands grew to 13.6% from 13% a year earlier. Newport volume over that time grew 4.8%, while overall volume fell slightly.""(Newport) has a strong and very loyal menthol franchise in the U.S.,"" Reynolds’ Chief Financial Officer Andrew Gilchrist told Investor's Business Daily.Winston-Salem, N.C.-based Reynolds has been stepping up sales and merchandising for Newport since its $26 billion acquisition last June of Lorillard Tobacco, which was the maker of Newport and other cigarette brands. The deal is often called the ""Newport acquisition,"" and for good reason.Reynolds hired new sales reps to talk up Newport to consumers and provided more shelf space and signage at retail locations such as gasoline station convenience stores, where many cigarettes are sold. Newport’s strong growth comes as lower gas prices have helped stem declines in cigarette consumption.As Gilchrist says, lower gas prices along with job and wage growth means smokers have more money to spend on cigarettes and for trading up to premium brands. Enter Newport and Reynolds' other premium brands, Camel and Natural American Spirit.Noting that 2015 was a banner year for the U.S. tobacco industry, at least in an era of declining cigarette usage, Stifel Nicolaus analysts call the last 18 months the industry’s new ""Golden Age."" They noted that somewhat higher than usual price increases last year helped boost profits.While the Stifel analysts say 2016 may show less robust growth than 2015, they still see positive industry trends. Among them are light litigation and regulatory activity, modest excise tax increases, and ""a core consumer that seems to be on the mend and improving again in 2016.""Reynolds American is the holding company for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, the No. 2 U.S. tobacco company after Altria Group (MO), which makes Marlboro. Reynolds became a stronger No. 2 when it acquired No. 3 Lorillard. Its overall market share in the U.S. rose to 34% from 26%. Altria’s remained at 51%. And since its acquisition of Lorillard on June 12, Reynolds' shares are up more than 40%.Besides Newport, the Lorillard acquisition handed Reynolds the brands Kent, True and Old Gold. As part of the deal, Reynolds sold Winston, Kool, Salem and Maverick to Imperial Tobacco Group, or ITG, the American arm of UK-based Imperial Brands. ITG is now No. 3 in the U.S., with a market share of 9.5%.Besides Camel and fast-growing Natural American Spirit, which is under Reynolds’ Santa Fe natural tobacco unit, Reynolds makes the value brand Pall Mall and leading e-cigarette brand Vuse.'The (Newport) brand should continue to benefit from improved visibility across Reynolds' retail footprint as well as its inclusion in Reynolds' retail contracts,"" wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Matthew Grainger in a recent report.""Moreover,"" he added, ""Newport has been realizing broad-based share gains across both menthol and non-menthol styles, which should drive its long-term growth potential.""Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog notes that Newport is “poised for greater than expected share gains and faster growth,” which should strengthen the company’s long-term profitability.In a recent tobacco survey by Wells Fargo, retailers expected Newport to gain 95 basis points of incremental share in 2016, up from an expected 80 basis points when they were queried in early December.One retailer in the survey said, ""RJR gained major power with Newport. It’s really a two-horse race now.""In Q4, Camel’s retail market share was 8%, the same as a year earlier, while Pall Mall’s was down 0.3 percentage points to 7.8%, though the value brand had been stable over the last three quarters. Newport, Camel and Pall Mall make up about 92% of Reynolds' total market share and are considered core growth, or ""drive"" brands.Reynolds doesn’t disclose sales for its Vuse digital vapor products. But though Gilchrist says growth was significant in 2015, sales are still relatively small and aren't broken out. That segment logged only $98 million of the $3.05 billion in total revenue in Q4, up from $87 million a year earlier.Reynolds has new vapor products in the works and a vapor collaboration is underway with stakeholder British American Tobacco (BTI) to help grow the market.British American owns 42% of Reynolds’ shares. Analysts speculate that it may try to buy the remaining 58% stake, but are divided on when that may happen, if ever.Since 1999, when it sold international businesses such as its Camel and Winston franchises to Japan Tobacco, Reynolds sells essentially all of its products in the U.S. It recently sold Natural American Spirit’s business outside the U.S. for $5 billion, money it’s using to deleverage its balance sheet.Reynolds American also operates Niconovum, which distributes nicotine-replacement gum Zonnic; and American Snuff. The latter is the second-largest maker of smokeless tobacco products, selling under the Grizzly and Kodiak brands.But Newport is the company’s big star. In Q4, Reynolds’ domestic cigarette volumes jumped 33.6% over the prior year, driven by the addition of Newport. Industry cigarette volume fell 0.5% during the quarter and 0.1% for the full year, Reynolds said, lower than the usual declines seen in recent years.The firm’s adjusted earnings in Q4 grew 9.1% to 48 cents a share. Revenue was up 43% to $3.05 billion. Management expects profits this year to rise between 13.6% and 18.7%, which translates to earnings of $2.25 to $2.35 a share. Analysts see this year's revenue rising 19% and earnings going up 18%, according to a Thomson Reuters poll.In a post-earnings conference call on Feb. 11, Chief Executive Susan Cameron said the quarter’s strong performance ""was largely the result of Newport’s growth.""Newport was added to the company’s retail contracts in mid-November after a post-acquisition standstill period. The brand’s expanded presence ""is delivering additional gains,"" she said.Meanwhile, expected cost savings will come as Reynolds continues to integrate Lorillard into the fold. Some $500 million of the $800 million expected in savings was achieved on day one of the acquisition, much of it in duplicate infrastructure.The remaining $300 million in synergies by year-end ""is a bit ahead of schedule,"" said the company's Gilchrist.

42,FE,"Kit Carson was a legend in his own time, with 70 novels recounting his imagined exploits in the Wild West. But his real adventures needed no embellishment.Carson became a beaver trapper in 1825 and was at the last gathering of the mountain men in 1840, when few beavers were left.He became famous as an Indian fighter but earned the Indians' respect for his bravery and integrity.He was the guide for John Fremont's three expeditions to map the Oregon Trail from 1842 to 1845.He helped spark California's revolt against Mexico in 1846. When riding for help, he saved American soldiers at San Pasqual, now part of San Diego.He led Union volunteers during the largest battle of the Civil War in the West at Valverde, N.M., in 1862, which involved 6,000 men and inflicted equal casualties.After the Confederacy stirred up Indians across the Great Plains against the U.S. in 1864, over 1,400 surrounded Carson's 400 men, but he led them to safety.""Carson ... mastered the rules of living on America's borders, those fluid, highly unstable regions where people of different races, cultures and languages met, mixed ... and often fought, sometimes against each other, sometimes together,"" wrote David Remley in ""Kit Carson: The Life of an American Border Man."" ""Carson was skilled, thorough, scrupulous, pragmatic. .. . He helped other people, whoever they may be, if they were harmless and in need. ... He was characteristically self-effacing . .. (and) seldom if ever took credit for decent things he did. ... He killed if he considered it necessary ... although such instances were usually in 'killed or be killed' situations.""Kentucky And Missouri RiseChristopher Carson (1809-68) was born in Richmond, Ky., on Christmas Eve, the sixth of 10 children, and a year later they moved to Boone's Lick, Mo.His father was a veteran of the American Revolution and War of 1812, but he died when Kit was 8 after a tree fell on him while he was clearing a field. His mother remarried four years later.Carson was illiterate all his life, though he grew fluent in Spanish and French, and learned to speak a dozen Indian languages. He was sent to a saddle maker in Franklin, Mo., as an apprentice, but he found the work dull and was stirred by tales of trappers and traders.He left at 16 to tend the cattle of pioneers on the Santa Fe Trail.Over the next three years, based in Taos, N.M., he worked as a wagon driver, cook, translator and miner.In 1829, at 19, he began traveling with other trappers and hunters into the unexplored wilderness.While moving along the Salt River in what is now Arizona, Carson's camp was attacked by Indians, and he repelled them.After a trek through the desert, Carson and his men reached California's San Gabriel Mission, an area he called ""a paradise on earth"" in memoirs that he later dictated.""Over the next decade, he developed a reputation throughout the West among whites and natives for the ability to overcome great odds in fights and for courage in protecting members of his group, even when it nearly cost him his life,"" R.L. Wilson, author of ""The History and Art of the American Gun,"" told IBD.Carson biographer John Abbott wrote: ""He never lost any time in deliberation; but whatever the emergency, he seemed instinctively to know at the moment exactly the best thing to be done. ... With energy and fearlessness unsurpassed, he was certainly one of the most gentle, upright and lovable of men.""In 1836, Carson married an Arapahoe, Singing Grass, who died giving birth to their second child. The baby was killed in an accident two years later. Carson sent the first child to his sister in St. Louis to receive the education he never had.Meanwhile, his skill with language and reputation for fairness drew him to mediate disputes between enemy tribes. By 1840, the beavers across North America were almost gone, and 600 mountain men gathered to do their last trading of fur and skin for cash and goods at the annual fair on the Green River in Wyoming.Carson married a Cheyenne woman in 1841, but they didn't get along and soon broke up. The next year, he wed Josefa Jaramillo, the daughter of a wealthy Mexican family in Taos, and they had eight children.In 1842, on a steamboat on the Missouri River, Carson met Fremont, an officer with the Army Corps of Topographical Engineers, and agreed to guide the outfit to Wyoming. Fremont wrote a report afterward that made a national figure of Carson, who led a second expedition the next year to Oregon and a third in 1845, spurring thousands to migrate.PraiseFremont lauded Carson for saving the lives of his men from Indians and bad weather many times.Mexico had ordered all Americans to leave California. At the end of their trip in 1846, Fremont and Carson decided to help a revolt to create an independent republic.Fremont sent Carson with the news of victory to Washington, D.C., and after riding 800 miles in a month, he stopped in Socorro, N.M., to meet Gen. Stephen Kearny and his 300 cavalry.The soldiers had been sent to enforce U.S. claims on California. Believing that the revolt was over, Kearny sent 200 troops back to Washington with Fremont's victory letter for President Polk and headed to California, with Carson guiding the 100.At San Pasqual in December 1846, the American soldiers learned that the rebellion was in the process of being put down, and Kearny's men were surrounded on a hilltop by a Mexican army.Coming ThroughIn the middle of the night, Carson and two others left their shoes behind to avoid making noise as they sneaked through enemy lines and walked barefoot through the desert to get reinforcements from an Army camp 25 miles away. Just in time, 200 cavalry rescued Kearny's men.Carson then went on marathon gallops, carrying messages to Polk three times in 1847-48. Included in his packet was news of the first California gold strike.Novels about Carson's supposed adventures began to appear and were translated even into Japanese, Arabic and Hindi. In 1849, he found one of them in an Apache camp and had it read to him.He served as an Indian agent, working with Native tribes for the U.S. government. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Carson became an officer in the Union Army leading volunteers in New Mexico. Later in 1861, he rose to colonel.In 1862, 2,600 Confederate cavalry attacked 3,800 mostly militia infantry at Valverde. Carson helped push the rebels back.He felt that his men were on the verge of victory when his general panicked and retreated into a secure fort. It was a technical victory for the rebels, but most of their horses had been killed, and they had to walk to their next fight.In November 1864, 1,400 Comanche, Kiowa and Apache surrounded Carson's 400 men at Adobe Wells, Texas. He managed their escape with only three lost, while killing 100. President Lincoln made Carson a brigadier general of volunteers in March 1865.Carson returned home in 1868, but soon thereafter, Josefa died. A grieving Carson, 58, passed away a month later. They were buried at what is now the Kit Carson Home and Museum in Taos.""He was like Zelig or Forrest Gump, always in the right place at the right time for important events,"" said Stephen Aron, a professor of the history of the American West at UCLA. ""Carson was not your stereotypical cowboy, but represented the possibility of people and cultures mixing and adapting peaceably to each other amid rapid change. He's an inspiration for today as we encounter other cultures, often in a shrinking world.""

44,FE,"Reynolds American's acquisition of Lorillard this summer has breathed new life into its product portfolio and solidified its position as the No. 2 U.S. tobacco company. A key to the $25 billion deal, completed in June, was that it brought aboard the popular Newport cigarette brand.It also helped boost Reynolds American's (RAI) Q2 revenue and earnings above consensus views, prompting the company to raise its full-year earnings estimate. Reynolds now expects 2015 EPS in the range of $1.90 to $2, up from prior guidance of $1.83 to $1.90.""They are in a much stronger competitive position, given that they now control not only the leading menthol brand, which is Newport, but they already control the fastest-growing menthol brand, which is Camel,"" Cowen & Co. analyst Vivien Azer told IBD. ""They also have exposure to the super-premium segment via Natural American Spirit, which has been growing at torrid rates.""Shifting FocusThe tobacco giant's merger comes as it explores new ways to address changing consumer preferences. It boasts an expanded portfolio that includes traditional cigarettes, electronic cigarettes, moist smokeless tobacco and other sources of nicotine in various formats.Reynolds and rivals such as Altria Group (MO), maker of Marlboro, are vying for market share in an industry that has seen cigarette volumes decline 3% to 4% per year in the U.S. in recent years. Tobacco companies also face possible new federal regulation around menthol and e-cigarettes, among other hurdles.Azer expects Lorillard's Newport brand to benefit from Reynolds' marketing and packaging expertise and from its innovative approach to the market. She sees an opportunity for Reynolds to post double-digit earnings growth in 2015, 2016 and 2017.The Newport brand provides new momentum for profitable growth in the near term, says Reynolds American spokeswoman Jane Seccombe.More importantly, she said, it provides new momentum ""in our long-term initiatives to reward shareholders and advance the product development and innovation that's essential for sustainable growth in a rapidly changing industry.""On a July 29 conference call with analysts, Reynolds American CEO Susan Cameron said that the Lorillard acquisition also will improve operational efficiencies and increase scale. As part of the merger, Reynolds divested about $7.1 billion in brands, some of which had seen consistent volume declines.Chief Financial Officer Andrew Gilchrist said on the call that Reynolds expects about $800 million in cost synergies as a result of the acquisition, with about $300 million coming within 18 months.Although cigarette sales volumes continue to decline industrywide, Reynolds actually posted an 11% year-over-year revenue gain during its second quarter. The Lorillard buyout helped. So did lower gas prices, which increased foot traffic to convenience stores, where a lot of cigarettes are sold.Reynolds also increased its quarterly cash dividend by 7.5% during the quarter, marking the 12th dividend increase since Reynolds American was formed in 2004.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Reynolds' Q3 revenue to increase 38% to $3.097 billion and EPS to rise 13% to 54 cents.The Reynolds-Lorillard merger combined two of Big Tobacco's oldest companies. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco has roots dating back to 1875, while Lorillard was founded in 1760.Reynolds American is the holding company for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, Santa Fe Natural Tobacco, American Snuff, Niconovum and R.J. Reynolds Vapor.The company's key rival is Altria, which has about 50% of the market share. The two companies combine for about 75% of the market, according to Stifel Nicolaus analyst Christopher Growe.Seccombe said that Reynolds' vision is to achieve market leadership by ""transforming the tobacco industry over the long term, which aligns well with society's expectations of how we should operate responsibly.""Shifts in adult tobacco consumer behavior and industry dynamics ""are creating opportunity in many areas,"" she added. ""We're confident that our companies have the brands, strategies and resources to win.""One of those strategies is to take advantage of the growing e-cigarette market. Reynolds' Vuse e-cigarettes deliver nicotine by way of inhaled vapor. Its line of Revo heat-not-burn cigarettes use temperature to release nicotine without any combustion.Meanwhile, the Niconovum unit's Zonnic nicotine gum is being marketed in more than 25,000 retail outlets.Morningstar analyst Adam Fleck expects the ""transformative merger"" to help Reynolds stem declines in market share.""We expect the pricing power of Camel, Newport and Pall Mall to help offset industry volume declines and keep Reynolds' cigarette revenue largely stable,"" Fleck said. ""Additionally, the firm should be able to expand its super-premium, additive-free Natural American cigarette and American Snuff smokeless tobacco segments.""Those segments represented 7% and 9%, respectively, of sales in 2014.As always with the tobacco industry, there are plenty of challenges. One is a potential menthol ban by the Food and Drug Administration. Reynolds also faces headwinds with international expansion after selling the international rights to its brands in 1999 to Japan Tobacco.Meanwhile, last week the FDA ordered Reynolds to stop sales of four cigarette brands because they don't meet the regulator's guidelines. Camel Crush Bold, Pall Mall Deep Set Recessed Filter, Pall Mall Deep Set Recessed Filter Menthol and Vantage Tech 13 can no longer be distributed in the U.S., the FDA said in a statement on Sept. 15.Pursuing InnovationCameron should be adept at helping Reynolds navigate the industry's many challengers, Azer says, because the CEO is an industry veteran who ""really understands the landscape and is a terrific brand manager and innovator.""Reynolds also has demonstrated an innovative culture. It rolled out its own line of e-cigarettes even as Altria opted to license an e-cigarette technology from a Chinese manufacturer, Azer said. Reynolds also acquired a smokeless tobacco company ahead of Altria.Wall Street has taken note. Reynolds' stock price has been on a steady rise this year and is up about 30% since the beginning of 2015.Azer expects Reynolds' momentum to continue well into the future as the company adapts to a shifting landscape.""Underlying industry fundamentals are the best we've seen in a number of years,"" Azer said. ""The view today, I think, is that the consumer is one where next-generation tobacco is not going to be a one-size-fits-all type of solution. Different consumers are going to be looking for alternative sources of nicotine in various forms.""

45,FE,"What happens when protesters learn they're being used by billionaires? They dig in their ideological heels and shout insults.As hydraulic fracturing and Canadian oil sands development sent North American petroleum production soaring, new pipelines were approved and constructed, including the Keystone system's first three phases. They augmented 2.5 million miles of liquid petroleum, gas transmission and gas distribution pipelines that already crisscross the U.S.But when the Keystone XL segment was proposed, intense opposition suddenly materialized. Protesters railed that habitat disturbance, potential leaks, climate change and ending fossil-fuel use necessitated ""no more pipelines.""Now the Sandpiper Pipeline from North Dakota's Bakken shale region across Minnesota to Superior, Wis., is meeting similar resistance. As with Keystone, the protesters say they're concerned student, hiker and Native American grass-roots activists. The facts do not support their narrative.Putin-allied Russian billionaires laundered $23 million through the Bermuda-based Wakefield Quin law firm to the Sea Change Foundation and thence to anti-fracking and anti-Keystone groups, the Environmental Policy Alliance found. Sandpiper opponents are likewise funded and coordinated by wealthy financiers and shadowy foundations, researcher Ron Arnold discovered.Several small groups are involved in Sandpiper. But the campaign is coordinated by Honor the Earth, a Native American group that is actually a Tides Foundation ""project,"" with the Tides Center as its ""fiscal sponsor,"" contributing $700,000 and extensive in-kind aid. Out-of-state donors provide 99% of Honor's funding.The Indigenous Environmental Network also funds Honor the Earth. Minnesota corporate records show no incorporation entry for IEN, and that 95% of its money comes from outside Minnesota. Tides gave IEN $670,000 to oppose pipelines. Indeed, $25 billion in foundation investment portfolios support the anti-Sandpiper effort. Vastly more backing makes the $13-billion-per-year U.S. environmentalist movement a power to be reckoned with, Arnold and I document in our book, ""Cracking Big Green.""These tax-exempt foundations do not simply give money to pressure groups. They tell them what campaigns to conduct, what tactics to use. Meanwhile, donors enjoy deductions for ""charitable giving"" to ""education, conservation and other social change"" programs.Tides Foundation combined cash flows exceed $200 million a year, Canadian investigative journalist Cory Morningstar reports. She and fellow sleuth Vivian Krause have delved deeply into troubling arrangements among Big Green, Big Government and Big Finance.Morningstar calls the San Francisco-based Tides operation ""a priceless, magical, money funneling machine of epic proportions."" It enables uber-rich donors to distribute funds to specific organizations and campaigns of their choice, without disclosing their identities.Even more interesting, among Tides' biggest donors is Obama friend and advisor Warren Buffett. Beginning in 2004, Buffett funneled $30.5 million through his family's NoVo Foundation to Tides, and ultimately to selected pressure groups that led campaigns against Keystone and other projects, Morningstar and Arnold discovered.By donating the market value of greatly appreciated Berkshire Hathaway shares to NoVo, the Omaha billionaire avoided income taxes on his gains. Even more important, while public, media and political attention was riveted on Keystone, Berkshire Hathaway quietly bought the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad and Union Tank Car manufacturing company — with no notice, dissent or interference, Morningstar observed.When Keystone XL et al. were blocked, more oil was shipped by rail — much of it via Buffett companies. In fact, oil-by-rail skyrocketed from 9,500 carloads in 2009 to 450,000 carloads in 2014. Buffett's ""investment"" in anti-pipeline activism garnered billions in rail revenues.The anti-pipeline campaigns thwarted thousands of jobs and increased risks of tank car derailments, like the Lac Megantic, Quebec, spill that destroyed much of the town and immolated 47 people. That may be one reason why Buffett recently criticized President Obama's veto of Keystone XL legislation. He now says the pipeline would be good for both Canada and America, and it is a mistake to jeopardize trade relationships with Canada.But the campaigns rage on. They are not grassroots, or even AstroTurf. Their ""green"" tint is the color of unfathomable behind-the-scenes wealth.The clandestine Buffett-Berkshire-NoVo-Tides-activist-railroad arrangement reflects ""a devious strategy on the part of both benefactor and recipient,"" Morningstar concludes. ""At minimum, it demonstrates an almost criminal conflict of interest."" Perhaps legislators and regulators should investigate.Meanwhile, pro-Sandpiper students from the Collegians For A Constructive Tomorrow presented these inconvenient financial truths to anti-pipeline protesters at an April 30 University of Minnesota rally.One red-faced protester walked away. Others intensified their chants or shouted racially tinged epithets at the multi-ethnic CFACT students. None wanted to discuss funding issues, America's need for oil or how best to transport fuels safely. Such is the state of ""environmental studies,"" ""robust debate"" and ""higher education"" on campuses today. Driessen is senior policy analyst for the Committee For A Constructive Tomorrow and co-author of ""Cracking Big Green: Saving the world from the Save-the-Earth money machine.""

50,FE,"Virginia Kennon is the rock who has lifted up her family's spirits in difficult times.Until this month, she worked 54-hour weeks caring for her sister with cerebral palsy and her ailing 85-year-old mother.For Kennon, this $8-an-hour job has been a labor of love, as it would be for no one else, and in that sense she is irreplaceable. But lately she's feared that she might have to be replaced.Kennon's employer in Deming, N.M., recently began notifying caregivers that it's capping their hours at 29 per week, just below the 30-hour threshold at which ObamaCare requires companies to make affordable coverage available to most full-time workers or else pay a fine.ObamaCare Vs. Home CareGovernment data suggest that home care workers have been hit especially hard amid new regulations. The average workweek clocked by nonsupervisors has sunk from 28 hours per week to a record-low 26.7 hours since the start of 2013.It's no coincidence that IBD's list of 450 employers who have systematically cut work hours to avoid ObamaCare employer mandate liability includes more than a few companies engaged in caring for the elderly and disabled.These are just examples that have been documented, but the real list is likely far, far longer: A group of assisted living centers in North Carolina; a Home Instead senior care franchise in Michigan; the Friendship Community group home, Firstaff Nursing Services and Lori's Angels home care, all in Pennsylvania; the Area Agency on Aging of Western Arkansas, which cut hours for 500 home health aides and drivers to 28 per week; and the Visiting Nurse Association (VNA) of El Paso.El Paso's ex-Democratic Mayor Joe Wardy told IBD last year that as CEO of financially troubled VNA, he was compelled to cut hours for 330 caregivers working 30 or more hours a week ""because there is no margin in the reimbursement (from Medicaid) for any type of benefits.""The consequences, he said, were ""disastrous"" for employees, patients and the nonprofit itself, which has since closed.New Pay Rules Kick InOne contributing factor: Some families wanting a dedicated caregiver moved their business to small providers who weren't subject to the employer mandate.ObamaCare's employer mandate isn't the only new cost challenging the ability of the home care industry to make ends meet or turn a profit. Effective January, home health care workers will have to be paid overtime wages for hours beyond 40.Facing this combination of new costs, along with local minimum wage hikes in Santa Fe, Albuquerque and Las Cruces, Kennon's employer has made an abrupt shift after previously covering the bulk of her comprehensive health insurance premiums.Perhaps management overreacted. Maybe they're overestimating the size of the ObamaCare penalties they would face. Or maybe they are correct in assuming all of these new costs would keep their business from turning a profit. IBD reached out for explanation, to no avail.'No Spring Chicken'But whether or not the business decision to cap hours was sound, the move threw the Kennon family and others for a loop.""I am considering moving away to find a good job,"" Kennon, 57, wrote in an email to IBD.""I am no spring chicken and the longer I wait, the harder it will be to find employment where I can make enough to survive. My mother and sister will have to make do with the caregivers they send. It just sucks. This was not broken until now.""Subsequently, with Kennon's hours capped and no one sent in her place, her mother had no paid caregiver to look after her.But Kennon isn't one to give up easily. ""I can't walk away,"" she decided. ""We don't want to put my sister in a nursing home because the care she needs will not be what we expect.""Her solution, for now, may be to work for one home care agency providing care for her sister and another one as caregiver for her mother.

51,FE,"ObamaCare's impact on jobs is hotly debated by politicians and economists. Critics say the Affordable Care Act gives businesses an incentive to cut workers' hours below the 30-hour-per-week threshold at which the employer mandate to provide health insurance kicks in. White House economists dismiss such evidence as anecdotal, but BLS data show that the workweek in low-wage sectors sank to a record low in July — just before the Obama administration delayed enforcement of the employer mandate until 2015.In the interest of an informed debate, we've compiled a list of job actions with strong proof that ObamaCare's employer mandate is behind cuts to work hours or staffing levels. As of September 5th, our ObamaCare scorecard included 450 employers with more than 100 school districts among them. Recently, IBD explained that a big minimum wage hike alongside the employer mandate would add to pressure on employers to cut workers to part-time, complicating the goal of reducing inequality.Click on the employer names in the list below for links to supporting records, mostly news accounts or official documents.We'll continue to update the list, which we encourage you to share and download into a spreadsheet to sort and analyze.

58,FE,"Utility company SCANA Corporation (SCG  -  Free Report) and its subsidiaries have been issued with a subpoena.  The United States Attorney’s Office for the District of South Carolina has served the subpoena to investigate the documents concerning the company’s new nuclear project at V.C. Summer Nuclear Station. Per the subpoena, the company is entailed to submit documents associated with the project.SCANA by all means has agreed to assist the government in the inquiry. However, the duration or the result of this matter has not been mentioned.Abandonment Petition Withdrawn VoluntarilyIn August, SCANA had voluntarily withdrawn its Abandonment Petition from the Public Service Commission of South Carolina that was made under the Base Load Review Act (BLRA), concerning SCE&G’s above-mentioned nuclear project.This followed two weeks after the company stated that it would stop operations on the project owing to increasing expenses. Over the past two weeks, SCE&G’s management has held discussions with various stakeholders and members of the South Carolina General Assembly, including legislative leaders, to talk about the abandonment of the new nuclear project and to listen to their concerns.  SCANA and partner, Santee Cooper, already spent $9 billion on the project before deciding on its termination. The decision attracted tremendous criticism. However, last week, rumors were making rounds relating to SCANA’s withdrawal of an abandonment plan.The company’s decision to withdraw the petition is based on concerns heard from state lawmakers and others.Growth Drivers for Other Utility Electric Power CompaniesSimilar to SCANA, whose nuclear expansion project was considered a catalyst for future earnings growth, most utility electric power companies are on a modernization drive to boost their service reliability to retain customer. Some are adding new generation assets to their portfolio, while others are strengthening infrastructure through regular capital investment and acquisitions. Some companies worth mentioning here are First Energy Corporation (FE  -  Free Report), CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP  -  Free Report) and Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp (AQN  -  Free Report).Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

59,FE,"FirstEnergy Corporation’s(FE  -  Free Report) subsidiary Jersey Central Power & Light (JCP&L) has taken a step toward trimming trees as part of its $34 million vegetation management program for 2017.The subsidiary’s forestry contractors will undertake tree trimming activities in more than 50 municipalities during the month of September to prevent tree-related power outage. The above program is anticipated to promote enhanced service reliability by helping guard against growing vegetation. Over 2,500 circuit miles of tree trimming has been undertaken and another 1,100 miles is currently underway.The Vegetation ProgramIn the electric utility industry, growing vegetation is a leading cause of power outages.  As such JCP&L’s tree-care maintenance program helps to keep vegetation away from power lines and other electric equipment.Although the vegetation management work is an expensive maintenance cost, it is essential for utility providers to take steps for providing safe and reliable service to customers. As such, the company’s tree management program since 2003, has helped to reduce tree-related outages in New Jersey service by nearly 24%.JCP&L currently serves approximately 1.1 million customers in central and northern New Jersey. JCP&L’s tree-care maintenance program is testament to FirstEnergy’s focus in providing the customers reliable and outage free power services. Toward this, the company has plans to invest nearly $600 million transmission projects through 2018.Going forward, we expect such initiatives to aid the company to retain existing customers’ while adding more customers as it continues to take steps for enhancing the quality of services.FirstEnergy’s Step toward Customer RetentionUtility is a regulated, yet highly competitive market. Upgrading and modernizing the existing infrastructure is important for giving better service to the customers. Consequently, apart from FirstEnergy other utility firms like NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE  -  Free Report), American Electric Power Company, Inc. (AEP  -  Free Report) and Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) are also strengthening infrastructure to provide better-quality services to customer base.We believe that FirstEnergy’s regulated growth strategies along with its step toward enhancing service reliability through the tree trimming program will aid the company to position itself as a successful utility operator for sustained customer service-oriented growth.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

77,FE,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and FirstEnergy Corp. (FE  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because FirstEnergyis seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for FE in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 63 cents per share for FE, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 61 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for FE, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +3.28 heading into earnings season.FirstEnergy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise FirstEnergy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | FirstEnergy Corporation QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that FE has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for FirstEnergy, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

78,FE,"The Q2 earnings season is gradually unfolding. As of Jul 25, 128 S&P 500 members came up with earnings results. Total earnings for these companies are up 7.0% from the same period last year on 4.2% higher revenues. 77.3% of the companies beat EPS estimates while 70.3% topped revenue estimates.It is going to be another busy week with nearly 800 companies – including 183 S&P 500 members – expected to come up with earnings results. Combining results of the reported index members (97 members till Jul 21) with the remaining 403 members of S&P 500, earnings are estimated to improve 8.6% on 4.7% higher revenues.Let us now focus on the utility sector, which is characterized by its defensive nature and domestic orientation. Earnings are expected to drop 2.9% this season.The utility sector is capital-intensive. These companies need huge capital to set up generation facilities, and transmission and distribution infrastructure. They also require considerable funds to maintain and upgrade the existing systems in order to meet emission-control standards. Utilities have been benefiting from the rock-bottom interest rate environment. However, the Federal Reserve has raised the rates twice in 2017 – in March and June. This will definitely hurt the utilities. The Fed has maintained its forecast for one more rate hike in 2017.With the rising interest rates, the stable, regular dividend payer utilities will face strong competition from bonds as these provide higher returns, which will make them a more attractive option for the investors.The U.S. coal-based utilities got a respite with President Trump’s decision to repeal the Climate Power Plan. Moreover, Trump has walked out of the Paris Climate Agreement.    Five out of the 16 sectors in the Zacks coverage universe are expected to witness an earnings decline this season.

This sector, along with 14 other out of the 16 Zacks sectors, is going to come up with a positive year-over-year earnings, Currently, two sectors (Autos & Conglomerates) are likely to register earnings declines.The Zacks Utility sector’s earnings are expected to increase 13% year over year, thanks to stable performance by most of the utilities. Utilities are expected to gain from tax reforms and cold weather conditions, driving the demand for electricity. However, the rate-sensitive capital intensive utility stocks also had to accommodate to the Fed rate hike. The Fed rate has now been raised for the sixth time (latest on Mar 2018) since the first hike was announced in December 2015, when the U.S. economy had pulled itself out of the Great Recession.Let’s take a look at the two Utility stocks, scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 earnings on Apr 23, 2018 and see how things are shaping up for the upcoming results.FirstEnergy Corporation (FE  -  Free Report) reported positive earnings surprise in the last four quarters with an average surprise of 6.04%.

88,FE,"Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL  -  Free Report) received the approval from Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) to use drones beyond the operators’ vision and utilize them to survey the transmission lines and perform other operations that require consistent monitoring.Over the past three years, Xcel Energy is using drones in their coal-fired plants to inspect equipments. In 2017, the company got the approval from FAA to use them for power lines inspection, within the operator’s vision. Following the approval, Xcel Energy will deploy the drones for the survey of their transmission line in Denver area. The company plans to seek further permission from FAA to inspect its 320,000 miles of electricity and natural gas infrastructure located in different regions.Technology to Boost Operations    Xcel Energy operates in eight Western and Midwestern States. Half of the states are tornado prone areas. The electric transmission and distribution lines as well as natural gas pipelines are expected to be weather resistant. Proper maintenance and repair of infrastructure enables the company to provide 24x7 services amid difficult climatic conditions. Drones ensure early detection of faults and damages of the electric transmission and distribution lines, which lower chances of outages and increase reliability of services.However, the drones will not replace previous modes of inspection and detection. The company believes that drones have advantages over trucks, helicopters or fixed-wing aircraft.  The inspection of lines will be completed at a faster pace and lower related costs, which will benefit consumers.Drone used by PeersUtility companies are investing regularly to provide safe, clean and reliable service to customers. Additionally, the companies are adopting new technologies to maintain and inspect their expansive infrastructure. Usages of drones are yet to become common among all utility service providers in the United States. However, we have seen FirstEnergy Corporation (FE  -  Free Report) and PPL Corporation (PPL  -  Free Report) among others to use drones for the maintenance of infrastructure.Considering the advantage of drones over traditional methods of inspection and maintenance of essential electrical infrastructure, we expect to witness increasing usage of the same among other providers as well.    Price MovementIn the last 12 months, shares of Xcel Energy have returned 4.7% compared with its industry’s rise of 2.3%. Zacks Rank & Other Stock to ConsiderXcel Energy has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Investors can consider CenterPoint Energy (CNP  -  Free Report) from the same space, which flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for FE, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +3.35% heading into earnings season.FirstEnergy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise FirstEnergy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | FirstEnergy Corporation QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

It has amassed assets over $427.47 M, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap ValueCompanies that find themselves in the large cap category typically have a market capitalization above $10 billion.

When you look at long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in nearly all markets. But in strong bull markets, growth stocks are more likely to be winners.CostsExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts, other things remaining the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.07%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 3.99%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsETFs offer a diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing.

Utilities and Consumer Discretionary round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Seagate Technology Plc (STX  -  Free Report) accounts for about 1.49% of total assets, followed by Firstenergy Corp. (FE  -  Free Report) and Interpublic Group Of Companies Inc. (IPG  -  Free Report).The top 10 holdings account for about 13.91% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskSPYD seeks to match the performance of the S&P 500 High Dividend Index before fees and expenses. The S&P 500 High Dividend Index is designed to measure the performance of the top 80 dividend-paying securities listed on the S&P 500 Index, based on dividend yield.The ETF has lost about -1.93% so far this year and was up about 7.73% in the last one year (as of 04/19/2018). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $34.44 and $38.74.The ETF has a beta of 0.77 and standard deviation of 12.27% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space.

106,FE,"FirstEnergy Corp. (FE  -  Free Report) and subsidiaries recently completed inspection operations and maintenance services of its equipments, in a bid to ensure operational reliability in its service territory, before winter arrives next month in the United States.Currently the company operates in six states — Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Maryland and West Virginia — wherein FirstEnergy undertook these maintenance initiatives.Details of the Maintenance WorkMaintenance work was carried out by FirstEnergy’s subsidiaries — Ohio Edison (OE), Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company (CEI), Toledo Edison (TE), Penelec (PN), Met-Ed (ME), Penn Power (PP), West Penn Power (WP), Jersey Central Power & Light (JCP&L), Monongahela Power Company (MP) and The Potomac Edison Company (PE).The company’s operations included the inspection of heating equipment for substation components. Additional inspection was carried out for batteries as well as motors of these equipments. An equipment survey was carried out to check overheating and malfunctioning in case the heaters get cranked up for higher usage.Company bucket trucks and other vehicles are also checked to ensure safe operation during the winter, while a thorough tree trimming across the year has been FirstEnergy’s custom for maintaining proper clearances around electrical systems. This in turn offers protection against tree-related outages.Notably, the company conducted helicopter patrols to lookout for damaged wire, broken cross arms, failed insulators and other hardware problems across the transmission lines located in its entire service area.FirstEnergy’s Reliability Measures - Not NewTo enhance service reliability, it has been a common practice for FirstEnergy to conduct maintenance work like the aforementioned one, each year before the winter season arrives. In fact, since 2014, FirstEnergy has been focusing on modernization efforts to upgrade or replace existing power lines, incorporate new, smart technology into the grid and substations upgrades; to serve customers more efficiently.This led to the company’s ambitious “Energizing the Future” plan for upgrading and expanding regulated transmission capabilities. FirstEnergy plans to invest nearly $1 billion in 2017 and $4.2-$5.8 billion over 2017-2021, under the initiative.Our ViewColder weather conditions increase the demand for electricity. However, heavy snow and winds can cause damage to wires and substations as well as transmission lines, thereby causing disruptions in electricity supply. Therefore, conducting inspections and maintenance of equipment before the onset of winter helps to minimize infrastructural damage and ensures better service.Following this strategy, FirstEnergy is conducting maintenance work across its service territory. Additionally, FirstEnergy has plans to transform itself into a complete regulated utility by mid-2018. The aforementioned efforts and investments to prepare for winters in its regulated operations are anticipated to aid this transformation.In line with this, we may expect other utilities like NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE  -  Free Report), American Electric Power Company, Inc. (AEP  -  Free Report) and Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) to undertake similar steps to carry out maintenance and reliability operations.Price MovementShares of FirstEnergy have returned 7.2% outperforming the industry’s rise of 4.0% in the last three months.This was been driven by the company’s strong focus on upgrading its transmission lines and moderninzing its distribution network, through solid investments.Zacks RankFirstEnergy carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

109,FE,"FirstEnergy Corporation (FE  -  Free Report) is set to release second-quarter 2017 financial results after the market closes on Jul 27. Last quarter, this power management company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 9.86%.  Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderFirstEnergy expects earnings per share for the second quarter to be in the range of 54 cents to 64 cents per share. The company secured regulatory approvals for base rate increase in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Ohio which are expected to boost the company’s top line.However, rising debt level remains a headwind for the company. FirstEnergy’s debt/capital ratio stands at 74.3% compared with the industry’s average of 49.7% and the S&P 500’s 41.9%. Moreover, the company’s current ratio stands at 0.36, which indicates that rising interest rates do not bode well for FirstEnergy. Also, the choppy return from competitive electric markets might adversely impact the company’s second-quarter result.FirstEnergy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise FirstEnergy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | FirstEnergy Corporation QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that FirstEnergy is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen.But that is not the case here, as you will see below. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Zacks ESP: The Most Accurate estimate is at 58 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 59 cents, resulting in an Earnings ESP of -1.70%.Zacks Rank: FirstEnergy has a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 or #5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few companies in the utility sector that have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Pattern Energy Group Inc. (PEGI  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +23.08 and carries a Zacks Rank #2. It is slated to report second-quarter 2017 earnings on Aug 4.The AES Corp.

124,FE,"California Water Service Group’s (CWT  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Hawaii Water Service (Hawaii Water), recently announced that it has filed a General Rate Case with the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission (“HPUC”) for a rate increase. Notably, the company is seeking to recover the cost of capital investments made toward the Waikoloa Village and Waikoloa Resort systems.The HPUC will review Hawaii Water’s ongoing operations and capital improvements as well as other factors before approving changes in rates.  Changes in the rates, if approved, will take place after the fourth quarter of 2018.Recovery of Investments & UpgradesThe rate hike, if approved, is expected to bolster the total annual revenues by $3.8 million. With respect to the Waikoloa Resort systems, the filing request is aimed at recovering additional revenues worth $0.2 million for the Waikoloa Resort water system, and $2 million for the wastewater system. Further, the rate hike is anticipated to generate additional revenues of $0.5 million for the irrigation system that offers recycled water service to customers.From the Waikoloa Village, the company anticipates to realize additional revenues worth $0.7 million for the water system and $0.7 million for the wastewater system.Among the upgrades covered in this request are Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (“SCADA”) improvements and construction of the two new water wells shared with the Waikoloa Resort system. Furthermore, improvements to a third water well and electrical building shared with the Resort system, wastewater piping repairs, construction of the wastewater treatment plant (K-plant), an extension to the wastewater treatment plant (R-plant), and purchase of a jetting/vacuum truck are also featured.Why This Move?Utility being a capital-intensive sector, major players in this space need to make ample investments from time to time, to meet the increasing customer demand as well as conduct operations seamlessly. In particular, water utilities are frequently required to upgrade and replace old pipelines and water mains. Being no exception, Hawaii Water has also made significant investments to strengthen existing infrastructure. In line with this, we have witnessed the company’s capital investments totaling to $180.4 million during the first nine months of 2017, reflecting an increase of 8.4% compared with year-ago period.Naturally being a profitable organization, Hawaii Electric will certainly try to recover the cost of those investments. We believe the filing for rate hike by the company is one such initiative to recoup capital expenses.Interestingly, Hawaii’s tourism industry — a significant driver of Hawaii’s economy — ended with growth of 4.9% in visitor spending and 7.1% in arrivals, during third-quarter 2017. This expansion in tourism industry reflects solid increase in demand for water service and potential improvement in days ahead. To make most of the situation, the rate hike decision seems to be a wise move on Hawaii Water’s part.In fact, given the growing opportunities in this state, California Water is currently aiming to extract higher revenues from Hawaii, by making similar rate case proposals. Evidently, in October 2017, the HPUC approved an increase in the company’s annual revenues by $0.7 million 771,000 in Pukalani wastewater system. If approved, the latest rate case will add impetus to the company’s top-line growth.Price MovementCalifornia Water has outperformed the industry in the last three months.

125,FE,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (CNP  -  Free Report) recently unveiled capital expenditure plan for 2018-2022 time period, wherein the energy provider plans to invest $8.3 billion. Notably, this represents 18% growth from the prior five-year plan (2017-2021).Details of the Capex PlanCenterPoint Energy aims to spend $1.66 billion in 2018, and almost the same amount in each of the following four years.Per management, solid growth, reliability and grid strengthening duly witnessed in operations enhanced the capital expenditure.The projected capital plan incorporates the Freeport transmission project worth $250 million that has been approved by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, last month. CenterPoint Energy expects a decision from the Texas Public Utility Commission on the project in 2019.How Will CenterPoint Energy Benefit?The Utility sector is a fundamentally capital-intensive sector, where in service providers need to focus on strengthening their transmission and distribution lines. Since Center point Energy provides both electricity as well as natural gas, the company has to spend a lot for upgrading and strengthening its existing infrastructure, like replacing old distribution lines and repairing old gas pipelines.To withstand severe weather conditions as well utilities have to keep their transmission and distribution systems upgraded. During third-quarter 2017 earnings call, the company hinted at increasing its next five-year capital expenditure for both electric as well as gas distribution businesses. The latest investment plan worth $8.3 billion duly reflects the company’s commitment toward offering improved and safe utility services to customers.With increasing demand for utility services, we believe this enhanced capital spending plan will attract more customers to take up the utility services those CenterPoint Energy provides, which in turn will add on to the company’s profitability.Moreover, last week the company issued an updated 2017 guidance hinting at an improvement in its full-year earnings. Therefore, it is reasonable to deduce that the solid capital investments that CenterPoint Energy has made so far got duly payed off in terms of the company’s improved bottom-line guidance. The latest investment plan can also be expected to provide further impetus to CenterPoint Energy’s bottom-line growth.Price MovementCenterPoint Energy’s stock has moved up about 12% over a year compared with the broader industry’s gain of 5.4%. This outperformance must have been led by significant customer growth as well as investments to upgrade infrastructure.  Zacks Rank & Key PicksCenterPoint Energy carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Investors interested in the same space can consider some better-ranked stocks such as FirstEnergy Corporation (FE  -  Free Report), PPL Corporation (PPL  -  Free Report) and DTE Energy Company (DTE  -  Free Report) , all of which carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

126,FE,"ONEOK Inc. (OKE  -  Free Report) announced that it is going to issue 19 million shares and expects gross proceeds from the issue, before deducting offering expenses, to be nearly $1.0355 billion. The company will allow the underwriters of the issue to purchase up to 2.85 million additional common shares to cover over-allotments, if necessary.The company has plans to utilize the net proceeds from the equity issue to fund capital expenditures — including a portion of its recently announced natural gas liquids growth projects — to pre-fund additional projects, which are in the late stages of development. It also aims to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include repaying a portion of outstanding indebtedness.Reasons Behind the IssueAt the end of third-quarter 2017, the diluted outstanding shares of the company were 383.4 million. With the fresh issue of equity, the total diluted outstanding shares will go beyond 400 million.It is a well-documented fact that utilities are capital intensive companies and are in constant need of funds.  At present, debt to capital of ONEOK is 59.46%, which is higher than the industry ratio of 47.77%. So, rising debt burden would further increase interest expenses. In addition, its current ratio is 0.55, much lower than the S&P 500 average of 1.35. Interest rates have increased four times in last five quarters, which will definitely make borrowing costlier than before.So ONEOK had to depend on the equity holders to get additional funds to carry on its capital projects and lower its debt levels.Capital Projects ONEOK, at present, has nearly $2.5-$3.5 billion of capital projects under development, which include Natural gas and NGL pipelines and development of export infrastructure. Most of the capital projects, which are underway, already have some degree of commitments from its customers.  The completed projects will be accretive to earnings and further strengthen performance of the company.Price MovementShares of the company have returned 6.8% in the last six months compared with the Zacks Gas Distribution industry’s rally of 1.4%.ONEOK has already completed projects worth $9 billion between 2006 and 2016 in highly productive regions, which is driving the performance of the company.Zacks Rank & Key PicksONEOK currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

128,FE,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (CNP  -  Free Report) recently provided an updated 2017 guidance, which hints at an improvement in full-year earnings. The company currently expects earnings per share to exceed the range of $1.25-$1.33 in 2017, compared to its prior guidance of earnings at or near the high end of this range.The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.31, higher than the mid-point of the company-provided range.Details of the Updated OutlookPer management, recent adjustments made in CenterPoint Energy’s bottom line, including a re-measurement of deferred tax liabilities and a credit to income tax expenses, primarily led to the raised earnings projection. This updated guidance also takes into account the company’s midstream investments as well as amortization of CenterPoint Energy's basis difference in Enable Midstream.The guidance is also takes factors like Enable Midstream's most recent public outlook for 2017 provided on Nov 1, 2017, and projected effective tax rates. However, it excludes potential impacts such as any change in accounting standards or Enable Midstream's unusual items. The outlook also excluded one-time items like changes in accounting standards or unusual items, earnings or losses from the change in the value of the ZENS securities and related stocks, or the timing effects of market-to-market accounting in the company's Energy Services business.What Led to the Upbeat Guidance?The recently passed $1.5-trillion tax bill by the U.S. Senate, which includes a deep tax cut for corporates, seems to have played a major role in the lifting of the guidance. In fact, during the third-quarter earnings call, the company did give an indication that a favorable tax reform might result in a lower tax rate for CenterPoint Energy. So, shelling out less in form of tax will boost the bottom line.Moreover, the company had earlier projected income tax rate at 36% for 2017 despite witnessing a slightly higher rate of 37% in the third quarter. The latest tax reform might have pulled down the rate further for the company, thereby leading to the raised outlook.Moreover, CenterPoint Energy’s venture in Enable Midstream has been consistently boosting the bottom line. Considering the fact that Enable Midstream continues to see a strong level of activity on their system with 40, it must have also contributed to this raised bottom line guidance.What Lies Ahead?CenterPoint Energy has been investing substantially to expand its operations to cope with increasing utility demand. The company is currently focused on upgrading infrastructure and improving reliability. Toward this end, the company maintains its capital outlay of $7 billion from 2017 through 2021. With respect to bottom-line growth, CenterPoint Energy expects to witness 4-6% annual EPS growth or exceeding the high end of the range through 2018, inclusive of Midstream Investments.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.41 for 2018, reflecting year-over-year improvement of 7.8%.Price MovementCenterPoint Energy’s stock has moved up about 10.4% in the last 12 months compared with the broader industry’s gain of 4.7%.

131,FE,"The third-quarter earnings season is fast approaching its peak. As of Oct 20, 87 S&P 500 members came up with their quarterly earnings. By end of Oct 27, nearly 267 members of the index are expected to release their numbers.Total earnings for these 87 S&P 500 members are up 9.4% year over year on 7.3% higher revenues, with 71.3% beating earnings per share estimates and 70.1% surpassing revenue estimates.Amid this positive performance so far let us focus on the Zacks Utility sector, which is characterized by its defensive nature and domestic orientation. Earnings are expected to drop 4% this season. Notably, at present, nine out of the 16 sectors in the Zacks coverage universe are expected to witness an earnings decline this season. Read more details in our weekly Earnings Preview.Utilities have been benefiting from the rock-bottom interest rate environment. However, the Federal Reserve raised the rates twice in this year — in March and June. This will definitely hurt the sector’s stocks. In addition, the hurricanes also adversely impacted the utilities operating in Texas and Florida.With the rising interest rates, the stable, regular dividend payer utilities will face strong competition from bonds as these provide higher returns, which will make them a more attractive option for investors.Let us take a sneak peek at few utility stocks that are scheduled to release third-quarter earnings on Oct 26.NextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report) reported a positive earnings surprise of 5.7% in the previous quarter. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

We expect the increase in total revenues to be driven by higher contribution from its FPL segment.However, Hurricane Irma is likely to adversely impact the company’s earnings. NextEra Energy’s earnings are projected to be $1.75 per share, reflecting a sequential drop by a penny.NextEra Energy’s Earnings ESP is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.75. According to our proven model, stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 (Buy) or 3 have higher chances of beating estimates.

(AEP  -  Free Report) reported a negative earnings surprise of 8.54% in the previous quarter. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.American Electric Power is expected to benefit from the improving economic conditions in its service territories and its efficient cost-management initiatives.Ohio and Texas operations contributes a major share of company's utility revenues. Power generation from these states is deregulated, consequently leading to the current lower price environment. This, in turn, is expected to hurt earnings of American Electric Power.Hurricane Harvey that hit the coasts of Texas last month, hampered the smooth flow of electricity through the transmission lines leading to widespread outages in the state. American Electric Power’s subsidiary, AEP Texas, is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric power to approximately 1 million retail customers.

132,FE,"FirstEnergy Corporation (FE  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release third-quarter 2017 results after the closing bellon Oct 26. Last quarter, this utility company earnings broke even. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayFirstEnergy expects its third quarter earnings in the range of 75 -90 cents per share, while Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at 85 cents, reflecting an increase of 11.8% year-over-year.The company’s modernization drive and its “Energizing the Future” plan will help in upgrading and expanding its transmission capabilities.FirstEnergy’s competitive business customers at the end of the second quarter were 850,000, much lower than 1.5 million in the year-ago quarter. The drop can be attributed due to the company’s transition from its Competitive Generation to a fully transition to a regulated company. For the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FirstEnergy’s revenue is pegged at $3,571 million much lower than $3,828 million in the year-ago period.While the ongoing transition has adversely affected FirstEnergy’s customer count, we expect the company’s constant upgradation and modernization efforts to provide some cushion and maintain load growth for the company.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that FirstEnergy is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat consensus estimates.

136,FE,"Alliant Energy Corp.’s (LNT  -  Free Report) Iowa Utility recently entered into an agreement with Apex Clean Energy for the construction of the 300-megawatt Upland Prairie Wind Farm, located in Clay and Dickinson counties, IA. The project is expected to power approximately 130,000 homes a year. The farm’s construction is anticipated to commence in the spring of 2018.Other DetailsAlliant Energy expects the wind farm to provide local tax benefits approximately worth $40 million over the life of the project. The company also forecasts to makelease payments of $45 million for the next 25 years to landowners, on account of this project.Notably, the company had received approval to add up to 500 megawatts (MW) of wind energy in 2016. In 2017, it filed for expansion of another 500 MW wind energy from the Iowa Utilities Board, which in turn will add new wind generation of 1,000 MW in Iowa. Cumulatively, the wind energy thus generated will be sufficient to power up to 430,000 Iowa homes a year. The combined projects represent an investment worth $1.8 billion.Our ViewWe believe that the above deal is in line with Alliant Energy’s long-term plans to invest heavily in natural gas and renewable assets over the next 10 years. Evidently, it has plans to invest nearly $11.3 billion over the 2016-2025 time frame. The company is currently concluding major construction projects on time and at or below budget.With the increasing demand for renewable energy resources, companies are adopting clean energy procurement as a strategic business decision to support their growth and business bottom line similar to Alliant Energy’s efforts to introduce cost-competitive wind energy for its customers. The latest project can be expected to boost up its future growth trajectory. Notably, such projects also enhance the company’s service reliability by adding more customers to its grid.Further, its expectation to add more construction and jobs is a testament to the fact that the company is focused to achieve its desired long-term growth through economic development in service areas.Price MovementAlliant Energy’s shares rallied 5.1% in the last three months compared with 4.3% gain of the industry it belongs to.The new electricity rates which were implemented during the month of April bolstered performance.Zacks Rank & Stocksto ConsiderAlliant Energy currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
