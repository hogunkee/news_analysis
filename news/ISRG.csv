1,ISRG,"The $8.3 billion American Century Growth Fund (TWCGX) is feeling its oats. The fund was up 30.92% this year going into Thursday, thanks in part to gains by aerospace giant Boeing (BA), up 91% this year; video game provider Activision Blizzard (ATVI), up 80%; and robotic surgical systems maker Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), up 72%.X The fund's gain is better than double its 12.37% three-year average annual gain. And it tops the 28.01% average this year by his large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Direct as well as the S&P 500's 22.04% gain.Information technology and consumer staples were the fund's first and fifth largest sectors as of Nov. 30, with weightings of 41% and 9% respectively. That reflects the outlook expressed by managers Gregory Woodhams and Justin Brown, who noted in their Sept. 30 commentary that growth prospects appear strong in tech and that valuations in consumer staples are compelling.Those factors matter to the managers because they seek to invest in companies whose fundamentals are strong and improving but whose share price performance does not fully reflect those traits.Activision is one of the fund's tech holdings. So are Facebook (FB) and Applied Materials (AMAT). The latter two both happen to be members of the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks. Facebook is also a member of Leaderboard — IBD's premium service that spotlights play-by-play moves of top stocks.Trading around 178, Facebook shares are up 55% so far this year. IBD readers see that Facebook is in a buy range from a prior 175.59 flat-base buy point. Big volume during its Nov. 29 slide was a bad sign, but the stock is holding up so far. The number of daily active Facebook users has climbed above 1 billion. Facebook's growing mobile platform is pulling in the bulk of the company's total advertising revenue.The managers like Activision because it's a video game publisher that they think should continue to benefit from an ongoing shift to online subscription models, away from reliance on console-based video games. The shift to a subscription model tends to boost a business's margins.American Century research shows that capital spending by semiconductor companies is rising. Applied Materials is a semiconductor equipment provider that is seeing rapid growth due to increased demand for chips used in artificial intelligence and big data applications, Growth Fund's managers told shareholders.IBD'S TAKE: Apple, Alphabet's Google, Microsoft and others are racing to develop artificial intelligence hardware and software. Bookmark IBD's AI page to follow the latest developments.In consumer staples, the fund's managers noted that Dollar Tree (DLTR) is bucking the trend of weakness among brick-and-mortar retailers. Dollar Tree benefits from focusing on lower-income consumers, the managers said. And the company has boosted its results due to its acquisition of the Family Dollar chain.Dollar Tree shares are up 41% so far this year. Earnings per share grew 10%, 37% and 40% the past three quarters.Wal-Mart Stores' (WMT) earnings per share inched up a modest 2%, 1% and 2% the past three quarters. That reflects the competitive challenge faced by brick-and-mortar retailers in general as they compete with online retailers such as Amazon (AMZN) — which is also a holding of this American Century fund.Wal-Mart sales rose 1%, 2% and 4% the past three stanzas. Yet Wal-Mart shares are up 43% so far this year. Why such bullishness by investors? In the third-quarter, reported last month, Wal-Mart's U.S. e-commerce sales jumped 50% and gross merchandise volume leapt 54%. The company appears to be learning how to compete online.As IBD recently reported, Wal-Mart's 2016 acquisition of Jet.com has beefed up its online capabilities. And acquisitions in 2017 such as ModCloth, Bonobos, Moosejaw, are helping the megastore build its indie and fashion cred. Those enabled the firm to beat Q3 forecasts last month and give upbeat holiday-quarter guidance.Wal-Mart also announced last month that it will start to sell Lord & Taylor's department store products on Walmart.com. That will broaden its assortment of products and fashionable apparel, IBD has reported.American Century Growth appears poised to continue its run by aiming for leadership stocks. Seven of its 10 largest holdings as of Sept. 30 had IBD Composite Ratings in the 90s. So did two of its five top new buys. A third top new buy had a Comp Rating of 89. IBD's Composite Rating is scored on a scale of 1 to 99. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher. RELATED:How The New Tax Bill Affects YouYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

3,ISRG,"The S&P 500 index and other major averages hit record highs amid a wave of earnings and a weaker dollar, though the greenback rebounded somewhat. Netflix (NFLX) skyrocketed on blowout subscriber growth and a bullish outlook. Celgene (CELG) will buy Juno Therapeutics (JUNO). Intel (INTC) surged on its earnings and outlook, while Texas Instruments (TXN) and some other top chips failed to impress with their quarterly financials, but Apple (AAPL) continued to lag amid a growing chorus of concerns regarding iPhone X sales and production. Airline stocks plunged as United Airlines (UAL) said it would expand rapidly, setting the stage for a renewed price war.X The S&P 500 index, Dow industrials and Nasdaq all rallied solidly to hit fresh record highs as earnings season heated up. The falling dollar, which has acted as a tailwind for U.S. multinationals' stocks and profits, rebounded from three-year lows Thursday as President Trump said he expects a stronger greenback. Netflix (NFLX) was a big earnings winner. Intel (INTC) also did while after Texas Instruments (TXN) and Lam Research (LRCX) were among several leading chip stocks to struggle on earnings. Airline stocks plunged on United Airlines (UAL) while Apple (AAPL) and iPhone-related stocks sold off as several analysts cited evidence of weaker iPhone X demand.Shares rocketed to record highs as Netflix (NFLX) added 8.33 million streaming subscribers worldwide, crushing its fourth-quarter target of 6.3 million. The Internet TV streaming giant ended 2017 with 117.58 million total streaming subscribers, with one analyst predicting 200 million Netflix subscribers in 2020. The gains came despite Netflix implementing price hikes to its service plans in the U.S. and Europe. Netflix credited hit original content such as TV series ""Stranger Things"" and ""The Crown"" and movies like ""Bright"" for its subscriber gains in the period. For the March quarter, Netflix is predicting it will add 6.35 million net new subscribers.Chipmakers Intel (INTC), Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM), STMicroelectronics (STM) and Xilinx (XLNX) beat their December-quarter targets, but got mixed reviews from investors. Texas Instruments (TXN) posted in-line results and its shares were punished. The sector continues to wrestle with concerns that the chip cycle has ebbed. Top chip-gear makers Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) beat views, but sold off on the news. Meanwhile, Xilinx joined Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) in benefiting from the sale of high-performance chips for mining Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.RELATED:Intel Beats Fourth-Quarter Targets, Offers Cheery 2018 OutlookBiotech mergers heated up with Celgene (CELG) agreeing to pay $9 billion for the 90% of CAR-T drug developer Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) it didn't already own while Sanofi (SNY) reached a deal with Biogen (BIIB) hemophilia spinoff Bioverativ (BIVV) for $11.6 billion. Celgene's acquisition comes as it prepares to lose exclusivity for cancer drug Revlimid in 2022. Juno rivals Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Novartis (NVS) in making CAR-T drugs to treat blood cancers. Sanofi's deal follows two failed mergers in 2016 and 2017.Early Wednesday, Novartis (NVS) reported core earnings of $1.21 per share on $12.92 billion in sales, up a respective 6% and 2% on a constant-currency basis, and easily beating the consensus. On Thursday, Biogen (BIIB) reported sales grew 15% to $3.31 billion and topped the consensus. Adjusted earnings grew 4% but were short. Also Thursday, Celgene beat lowered analyst views. AbbVie (ABBV), on Friday, topped expectations with adjusted profit up 23% and sales climbing 14% to $7.74 billion in sales.United Airlines (UAL) sent airline stocks into a tailspin after the carrier told analysts that it planned to expand flight coverage through 2020. Investors fear the move, done in part to regain relevance in the smaller cities United once abandoned, risks more competition and cheaper fares, helping passengers but threatening profits. American Airlines (AAL), during its Q4 earnings call, signaled that it wouldn't change its profit and growth targets based on United's ambitions — for now. Southwest Airlines (LUV), JetBlue (JBLU) and Alaska Air (ALK) also reported.General Electric (GE) missed on earnings and disclosed an SEC probe, though core units did well and GE kept its 2018 outlook. Three industrial members of the Dow industrials, Caterpillar (CAT), 3M (MMM) and United Technologies (UTX), reported strong earnings and guidance. Insurer Travelers (TRV) and consumer products giant Procter & Gamble (PG) also beat on earnings views. Verizon (VZ) missed on EPS but topped on revenue. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) topped views, but fell on a patent ruling vs. its blockbuster arthritis fighter Remicade.President Trump slapped tariffs of up to 50% on imported large washing machines and parts, and up to 30% on solar panels. The tax on washing machines decreases and then expires after three years, while the duty on solar cells and modules phases out after four years. Solar technology providers Suniva and SolarWorld charged that China was providing unfair subsidies and financing to its solar producers. Whirlpool (WHR) complained that Korean makers were dumping washing machines in the U.S. at excessively low prices.Whirlpool, which also reported quarterly earnings, rallied 11%. First Solar (FSLR), which initially popped, closed up less than 1%. China-based Daqo New Energy (DQ) lost about 4%.U.S. crude topped $65 a barrel and Brent edged above $71 briefly as oil inventories continued to drop. Oilfield service provider Halliburton (HAL) crushed quarterly forecasts, with international growth outpacing domestic growth. Shares shot up 5%, clearing a buy point.

But shares fell nearly 6% as markets priced in the possibility that GE would fully spin off the business.Northrop Grumman (NOC), Raytheon (RTN) and General Dynamics (GD) topped Q4 profit forecasts, though Raytheon and General Dynamics missed on revenue. Northrop gave strong 2018 guidance and lifted its dividend. Raytheon and GD said orders and backlog were strong. All three defense firms surged to record highs. Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Boeing (BA) report next week.Steel Dynamics (STLD) earnings rose 26%, topping views modestly, as sales climbed 22% to $2.34 billion. The No. 1-ranked company in IBD's Steel-Producers industry group said 2018 is shaping up to be a good year, thanks to more moderate inventory levels, improvement in global demand and pricing, and incremental investment driven by tax cuts. Specialty steel producer Allegheny Technologies (ATI) nearly doubled profit estimates. Revenue grew 14% to $910 million, fueled by its high-performance materials for jet engines. Freeport McMoRan (FCX) benefited from higher copper prices, boosting Q4 earnings by 104%, ahead of estimates. Revenue grew 15% to $5.0 billion. Negotiations with Indonesia about ownership of its massive Grasberg mine are progressing but haven't erased uncertainty about the company's outlook.Casino operators Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and Las Vegas Sands (LVS) both put up Q4 results that beat on the top and bottom line, helped by the rebound in Macau, the world's largest gaming market. Sands CEO Sheldon Adelson cited an acceleration in the mass gaming market in the Chinese administrative region, the only area of the nation where gambling is legal. But Wynn shares plunged Friday, erasing nearly all its weekly gains, on a report of allegations of serious sexual misconduct by CEO Steve Wynn.Ford Motor (F) saw EPS climb 30% to 39 cents as revenue grew 15% to $41.3 billion. Analysts had expected EPS of 42 cents on sales of $37.5 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research. Ford is buying mobility startups Autonomic and TransLoc.

TAL enrollments swelled 85%.TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and E-Trade Financial (ETFC) beat on both their top and bottom lines.

4,ISRG,"Many of the same exchange traded funds that performed best last year continue leading the broader market so far this year.

13,ISRG,"Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) popped to a record high Friday as frigid investors warmed to its third-quarter sales and earnings beats, which came partially on the back of deferred revenue and tax benefits.XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, Intuitive climbed 3.4% to finish at 369.58, though earlier rose as much as 4.9%. But late Thursday, following its earnings release, Intuitive sank more than 1% despite crushing sales and earnings expectations.For the quarter, Intuitive reported $806 million in sales and adjusted earnings of $2.77 a share, both easily topping the consensus and growing a respective 18% and 34.5% vs. the year-ago period.Sales, however, benefited from $21 million in revenue deferred from a customer trade-out program. Adjusted income was bulked by a 59-cent tax benefit and a 9-cent benefit from the trade-out program. Even without those benefits, sales and earnings still would have beat estimates.The firm also raised its 2017 procedure and gross margin guidance, RBC analyst Brandon Henry wrote in a note to clients. For the year, Intuitive sees gross margins minus certain items at 71%-71.5%, up from earlier views for 70%-71.5%. It sees 15%-16% growth in procedures, up from 14%-15%.IBD'S TAKE: Earnings season is about to kick off in earnest next week for a number of stocks. Keep tabs on each day's actions by visiting IBD's Investing Action Plan.Henry boosted his price target on Intuitive to 350 from 333, and kept his sector perform rating.""Overall, Intuitive Surgical continues aggressively spending to accelerate development work on several pipeline technologies, which will expand its total addressable market and allow the company to remain a premium player in the surgical robotics market despite new/upcoming competition,"" he wrote.During the quarter, system placements were better than expected in the U.S. and globally, he wrote in a note to clients. Worldwide, Intuitive placed 169 systems with 107 in the U.S. and 62 internationally, above analyst views for 148, 93 and 55, respectively.Morgan Stanley analyst David Lewis noted expectations were high going into the quarter, ""but Intuitive Surgical delivered."" Even adjusting for the deferral and one-time tax benefit, the firm beat top- and bottom-line expectations by about 5%, he wrote in a note to clients.""The greatest source of upside on the quarter was system placements and margins,"" he said. ""Evidence of inflection is clear as gross system placement growth over the last three quarters is three times the prior three-quarter rate.""Guidance for 15%-16% procedure growth in 2017 implies, at the top end, 15% year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter, Lewis said. That's likely conservative given momentum across procedures, especially in U.S. hernia and outside the U.S., he said in a note to clients.Intuitive stock was likely depressed late Thursday on management's margin commentary for 2018, Lewis said. The firm expects flat margins into next year, as Intuitive as outperformed sales expectations for 2017, driving higher-than-expected margins.""This could reflect conservatism as the company preserves flexibility to invest in growth, but it also potentially avoids a repeat from last year when a disconnect in consensus earnings expectations led to management using $2 billion in accelerated share repurchase to bridge the difference,"" he said.RELATED:Intuitive Surgical Rockets After Topping Q3 Earnings, SalesDow Component J&J Pops After Topping Views On Pharma StrengthIntuitive Surgical Hold A Lesson, And It Might Not Be Over

14,ISRG,"Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) was down late Thursday despite reporting third-quarter sales that crushed views by $54 million and adjusted earnings per share that beat expectations by more than $1.XIn after-hours trading on the stock market today, Intuitive was volatile, initially rocketing 4.4% before falling below the break-even point. Shares were down 1.2% in after-hours trades, after ended the regular session up 0.9% at 357.46. It was unclear what was suppressing shares, though the company did include deferred revenue in the results.For the third quarter ended Sept. 30, Intuitive reported adjusted income of $2.77 per share, rising 34.5% year over year and topping the consensus for $1.61. Sales came in at $806 million, beating analysts' views for $752 million and growing 18%.Part of the sales beat was due to $21 million in deferred revenue from a customer trade-out program that Intuitive offered to some customers in the first quarter of 2017. Without that deferred revenue, sales still would have beat expectations and grown 13%.Intuitive shipped 169 da Vinci Surgical Systems in the quarter, up 26.1%. The systems use robotics to help surgeons perform operations with just a few incisions. Globally, the number of da Vinci procedures grew by about 15%, driven by growth in U.S. general surgery and worldwide urologic procedures.Revenue from instruments and accessories grew by about 15% to $401 million, Intuitive said in a news release. This was driven by growth in da Vinci procedure volume. Service revenue rose about 13% to $147 million.Systems revenue increased by approximately 26% to $258 million, though Intuitive noted that the increase included revenue related to the customer trade-out program.RELATED:Hottest Stocks For Busiest Day Of Earnings: Investing Action PlanDow Component J&J Pops After Topping Views On Pharma StrengthIntuitive Surgical Holds A Lesson, And It Might Not Be Over

16,ISRG,"When Fidelity Investments needed a new manager of $17.4 billion OTC Fund (FOCPX) in September, it didn't need to look far. The Boston-based mutual fund behemoth tapped its own Sonu Kalra. Kalra was the manager of Fidelity's market-beating $23.3 billion Blue Chip Growth (FBGRX).X With help from leading stocks like Alibaba Group (BABA), PayPal (PYPL) and Five Below (FIVE), Blue Chip Growth gained 34.93% this year through Nov. 30, outperforming 91% of its large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Direct as well as the S&P 500's 20.49%.He was also the manager from early 2005 through mid-2009 of OTC. Now he remains helmsman of Blue Chip Growth and lead manager of OTC.Kalra is on track to guide both funds to IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner status. As of Dec. 1, both funds had outperformed in all four time periods — year-to-date and trailing 3-, 5- and 10 years — needed to join the elite club, if they maintain those outperformances through year end.In a talk with IBD from his office in Boston, 46-year-old Kalra discussed his investment strategy, his early mentors at Fidelity, why shareholders should not fear that he is stretched too thin by adding OTC to his workload, and more.IBD: You nearly doubled your assets under management by taking on OTC Fund. How do you know you can handle two funds that large?Kalra: I have gotten that question a few times. There are a couple of reasons why I'm not spread too thin. The biggest reason is that I have a co-manager on OTC, Christopher Lin. He was an integral part of the growth team here, a research analyst in the tech sector.List Of Mutual Fund Six Month LeadersBest Performing Mutual Fund CategoriesSome Mutual Funds Get A Boost From Value Stock TiltWhich Stocks Are The Top Fund Managers Buying?Bond Fund Decline In November: Turning Of The Tide?So he covered some of the larger growth stocks in the technology sector, companies like Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN). And those companies have been key contributors to strong performance by both OTC and Blue Chip Growth funds. For him to come on as co-manager makes it possible for us to manage and for me to not be stretched too thin.Another reason is that I ran OTC before, so I'm familiar with this product. And overall, 80% of the assets in OTC I owned in Blue Chip Growth.IBD: Are the funds run the same way?Kalra: There is a lot of overlap in the portfolios. But the nature of the funds differ (at the individual stock level). Their risk profiles are different. There are similar names but different weightings. They are both growth funds. But their mandates differ.Blue Chip Growth is more of a large-cap Steady Eddie growth fund, whereas OTC is more aggressive and has more smaller names as well as some younger, faster growing companies. Blue Chip Growth is benchmarked to the Russell 1000 Growth. OTC is benchmarked to the Nasdaq (Composite). That's why OTC has a larger tech component, given the Nasdaq's larger tech component.IBD: Summarize your overall investment approach for these two funds, Sonu.Kalra: I'm trying to find companies where the market is not only mispricing the absolute rate of growth but also the sustainability of that growth. We think of ourselves as long-term investors, trying to take advantage of the market's myopic short-term focus.IBD: Do you think of all growth stocks as the same?Kalra: I try to look at three buckets. One is the business model, how a company makes money. What's the company's potential to generate free cash flow? At the end of the day, the value of a company is all of its future cash flow discounted backward. Some companies get mispriced by some investors misunderstanding its potential to generate free cash flow in the future.Second, I pay attention to whether a company's incremental business opportunities are going to be better than they are today or are they deteriorating?Last, I focus on revenue growth. It's a number you can't make up. I'm really trying to find companies that can grow regardless of what's happening in the economy.IBD: As of your latest disclosure, tell me why you hold Alibaba in both funds.Kalra: I've owned it in Blue Chip Growth for some time. I introduced it to OTC in September when I took over. They are leaders in China of e-commerce, and e-commerce is growing there. About 15% to 20% of overall retail sales happen in China online. That's higher than in the U.S. because retail infrastructure is not as developed in China. So they don't have to compete with entrenched bricks-and-mortar competitors there.IBD'S TAKE: Alibaba has agreed to let Netflix (NFLX) globally distribute a popular detective drama series owned by Youku, which is owned by Alibaba.IBD: Why have you built your Blue Chip share count in PayPal?Kalra: The investment thesis is about the online growth of e-commerce. They provide the payment mechanism that makes it easy to purchase online. Their hidden gem is Venmo, a peer-to-peer payment mechanism. It lets people share payments with a social twist that's appealing to millennials. If they go out together for dinner with friends, they Venmo each other. It's almost become a verb. Eventually PayPal will begin to monetize it, but now they're piggybacking on the growth of online commerce. My guess is we're still a few years away before Venmo makes a material impact on the parent company from monetization.IBD: Five Below is another name you've been building. Is their secret sauce the fact that they sell products for $5 or less to a teen audience?Kalra: You hit the nail on the head. Brick-and-mortar stores have difficulties. What does work is when you have a great value proposition. That enables companies to drive traffic into stores. Having a price point of $5 says it all. They have iPhone cases, power cords, chargers. They are a beneficiary of the spinner (fad) inside schools.But there's more to their story. They have a fast supply chain. They can spot trends quickly and come to market fast and provide unbelievable value to consumers.They have a differentiated store model and also a store rollout that is growing their square footage more than 10% a year. So that shows healthy top- and bottom-line growth.IBD: Do you like the way Facebook is developing new platforms?Kalra: I started as a media analyst at Fidelity. One of the first things I learned was that advertising dollars follow eyeballs. Facebook has been a key contributor to and beneficiary of the change over the past five to 10 years in how people spend time across various media.Facebook is a core platform, but they also have Instagram and WhatsApp. Those have audiences spending more time on their applications, driving up ad dollars.IBD: OTC also has stocks that are not household names, like Atlassian (TEAM). What's your thesis?Kalra: They provide project management and collaboration software — software as a service. They went public in late 2015. Their software lets teams work on projects. They can seamlessly collaborate inside an organization. They're showing strong revenue growth, in excess of 30% a year for the past two years. They're in an underpenetrated market, and they are one of the leaders.IBD: What made you introduce Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) to OTC fairly recently?Kalra: They use technology to change the way surgery is done. Their system enables doctors to do surgery through robots. The outcomes are better. Fewer injuries. Safer. More cost-efficient for hospitals as well. It's a win-win for everyone, hospitals and patients.IBD: Which Fidelity managers have been your mentors?Kalra: I feel fortunate to be at an organization with a history of great investors and to be able to learn from them, watch how they work.Will Danoff (who runs giant $124.6 billion Fidelity Contra (FCNTX) and $28.1 billion Advisor New Insights (FNIAX)) and Steve Wymer (manager of $41.7 billion Fidelity Growth Company (FDGRX)) have been wonderful mentors. I've watched their work ethic, their ability to identify great growth companies early and stick with them for the long-term.I've worked closely with Steve Wymer. We've been on the same growth team here. We've traveled together, visiting companies, attending trade shows. Same with Danoff — we've been part of the same team.I was a tech analyst starting in 1998. For six years I was part of the research team focused on tech, so I supported guys like (Robert) Stansky (who ran Fidelity Growth Company and now-$16.9 billion Magellan Fund (FMAGX) from 1996 to 2005), Danoff and Wymer. So I've worked with some high profile managers here at Fidelity, identifying great companies.RELATED:Where To Find Income Without Taking Big Risks

25,ISRG,"Dow component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) surpassed Wall Street's third-quarter expectations early Tuesday on strength in its pharmaceutical unit and boosted its 2017 guidance — prompting shares to pop in premarket trades.XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, J&J stock jumped 3.4% to finish at 140.79. Shares broke out of a flat base with a buy point at 137.18 on Oct. 12.For its third quarter, J&J reported $19.7 billion in sales and adjusted income of $1.90 per share, up a respective 10.3% and 13.1% vs. the year-earlier quarter. Both metrics topped the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for $19.28 billion in sales and $1.80 a share in earnings.RBC analyst Glenn Novarro attributed J&J's sales beat to upside in its pharma unit. Global sales were $300 million above his forecast and $360 million above the consensus.Pharma revenue topped Novarro's estimate by $270 million, but medical device sales lagged.Worldwide pharma sales of $9.7 billion increased 15.4% on a year-over-year basis. Key products included cancer drugs Darzalex, Imbruvica and Zytiga, with the latter beating Novarro's views by $125 million. Sales from the new Actelion brands were $30 million below Novarro's model.IBD'S TAKE: J&J isn't alone in reporting quarterly results this week as earnings season kicks off in earnest. Keep tabs on IBD's Investing Action Plan for what's on deck each day.Medical devices sales grew 7.1% to $6.6 billion, but that included some shortfalls and was slightly below Novarro's view for $6.61 billion. Orthopedic and vision care revenue both were light by $25 million and $40 million, respectively, he wrote in a note to clients.J&J's consumer unit grew 2.9% to $3.4 billion and were just ahead of the RBC estimate for $3.31 billion. On an operational basis, over-the-counter and beauty sales each grew 4.4%, but all other categories fell ""highlighting the continued pressure in the segment.""The firm also raised its 2017 guidance to sales of $76.1 billion to $76.5 billion, up from $75.8 billion to $76.1 billion. It sees adjusted income of $7.25-$7.30 per share vs. earlier expectations for $7.12-$7.22, Novarro wrote. Analysts had modeled $75.9 billion in sales and $7.19 in per-share earnings.J&J disclosed that its medical devices segment sustained a negative impact of 30 basis points following hurricanes in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico. J&J is among a number of firms with manufacturing facilities in Puerto Rico. Investors have been wary of the effects of the storms.The negative impact was attributed to lost surgery days in areas affected by stormwater, wrote Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges in a note to clients. There was no supply disruption and all six of the firm's sites in Puerto Rico are open with generator power and running at different capacities.Porges notes that J&J's results could extend to others in the biotech space.""Given J&J's reliance on Puerto Rico for pharmaceutical manufacturing, and their lack of disclosure regarding demand and supply impacts, we are increasingly confident that companies in our biopharma coverage will not experience material storm-related Q3 headwinds,"" he said.But RBC's Novarro is a bit less bullish. J&J's results point to ""continued soft U.S. market trends"" in medical devices and diagnostics, he said. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, J&J's medical devices and diagnostics unit grew just 1.2% year over year.Overall, U.S. hospital admissions were down 50 to 100 basis points with U.S. surgical procedures down about 250 basis points, on a year-over-year basis, Novarro wrote. J&J's orthopedic sales were short on weak performance in its knee and spine segments.""Weak knee performance was blamed on the negative impact of India implant pricing legislation,"" he wrote, estimating a $10 million sales impact in the quarter. Worldwide, knee revenue declined 4.4% year over year. Revenue from hip products, though, grew 1.5% on pricing declines.J&J likely lost share to Stryker (SYK) in its knee-products unit, Novarro said. Global spine-product sales declined 7%. It's losing share in its U.S. spine-product segment, which benefits NuVasive (NUVA) and K2M Group (KTWO). This also suggests continued weak growth in the quarter for the U.S. spine-product market.Separately, it looks like J&J lost some share of the U.S. trauma-product market to Stryker, though worldwide sales grew 2.1%.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) and Medtronic (MDT) are taking pieces of J&J's surgery unit, Novarro said.RELATED:Why It Might Be Time To Buy Dow's J&J, A 'Dividend Machine'Dow's J&J Flirts With Buy Point On Bullish Pre-Earnings ReportThese Medtech Players Are Flailing On Hurricane-Related Headwinds

47,ISRG,"The major averages turned in a narrowly mixed finish Tuesday after weak company earnings and strong economic news left stocks battling to a stalemate.X The Nasdaq composite dipped 0.1% despite the day's powerful performance by Apple (AAPL). The S&P 500 slipped a fraction into the red, while the Dow Jones industrial average ended the session clinging to a faint gain.Preliminary data showed overall volume was quiet, lower on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq relative to Monday's action.Stocks received some positive strokes from economic news, with better-than-expected July retail sales growth and a surge in New York region manufacturing. Growth in business inventories outpaced estimates for June, and the National Association of Homebuilders' Home Price Index rebounded to 28 in August, a three-month high.That may have helped Apple pull off its 1.1% gain, while among FANG names, Facebook (FB) rose 0.15%.

53,ISRG,"The rules regarding the shapes of bullish chart patterns are strict.A solid cup-with-handle pattern must take a minimum seven weeks or more to form. A flat base needs at least five weeks.Seven weeks for a cup? What's wrong with four or five?  The answer: time.Before a true market leader stages a breakout and runs to new highs, it needs time to weather market pullbacks and profit-taking by some shareholders. The stock needs time to bottom out and regain upward price momentum before getting in the right position to rally to new highs.In its research of major market winners over the decades, IBD has discovered that many of the best stocks built cup patterns that took months or even more than a year to form. So, what if you find a cup pattern that's only three, four or five weeks in length? You might have just spotted a subtle topping pattern.IBD'S TAKE: There are seven common patterns that the best growth companies create in the stock market before they break out and go to new highs. And when a stock is at new highs, all the long-holders are happy. Learn more about the No. 1 key pattern, the cup with handle, and others at Investor's Corner.This sell signal, called ""sharp pullback and recovery to new highs"" and first introduced at IBD's Chart School workshops (now featured as a home study course available via Investors.com), constitutes one of 11 offense-related sell signals that help you nail profits near the top, even while the stock is rising.There are several varieties of this pattern. After a long run-up, a stock might fall hard for two straight weeks, then rush higher the next two weeks to new highs before eventually peaking.In some cases, it might be three weeks down, three weeks up. Or simply one big weekly drop and two big weeks up.  No matter what the combination, you're trying to spot excessively volatile action.A sharp pullback, followed by a fast surge to new high ground, suggests that some late fund managers and individual investors are desperately buying shares and throwing caution to the wind. While it's nice to see a stock shoot quickly back to new highs, the resulting V-shaped base pattern tends to bear a higher risk of failure.In contrast, a sudden run-up after a breakout from a sound base is exactly what you like to see.Let's say you're viewing a 13-week cup base with a handle that formed near the cup's high and slants gently lower. The handle action indicates that the few remaining frustrated shareholders who bought at high prices have finally exited the stock. When an investor with deep pockets suddenly starts to buy shares heavily, the spike in demand sends the price screaming higher.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) broke out of a long saucerlike base with a 125.77 buy point in heavy volume in April of 2007 (1). The market was in a decent uptrend at the time.In July that year, an excellent Q2 report by the Sunnyvale, Calif.-based firm sent the stock catapulting 34% to new highs in monstrous volume (2). At the time, earnings per share rocketed 80% above year-ago levels as sales climbed 61%. The after-tax margin was 21.9%.The stock offered several chances to add shares, such as mild pullbacks to the 10-week moving average in May and June (3), before its javelin-like spike.From late June to late October, Intuitive rose in 15 of 17 weeks, gaining 139%. But after a climactic 22% jump in the week ended Oct. 27, Intuitive carved a three-weeks-down, three-weeks-up base (4).Although it posted a new high of 359.59 (5), Intuitive quickly reversed and fell fast. Over the next seven months, the stock formed a jagged cup base that featured some weeks of accumulation, but the shape was not smooth.By March 2, 2009, Intuitive shares plummeted to 84.86, 76% below the 359.59 peak.(This column originally ran in the Jan. 7, 2011, edition of IBD.)RELATED:Know This Sell Rule I: The Largest Single-Session Point Drop, In Heavy TurnoverKnow This Sell Rule II: Why A V-Shaped Cup Base Usually Spells TroubleWhat Can Individual Investors Learn From The October 1987 Market Crash?

Revenue rose 9% to $24.7 billion after forecasts for $24.27 billion. Microsoft credited demand for cloud-computing services like Azure and Office 365 as well as its acquisition of LinkedIn. But the Dow component gave cautious guidance for the current quarter. Shares dipped Friday but remain in buy range.RELATED:Microsoft Crushes Earnings Estimates; Stock Dips On OutlookGeneral Electric fell 2.9% on Friday after saying full-year EPS is trending to the low end of its $1.60-$1.70 target, citing oil and gas weakness. GE reported smaller earnings and revenue declines for Q2, though some analysts cited some weakness below the headline figures. Fellow industrial conglomerate Honeywell International (HON) also beat on top and bottom lines, but guided full-year estimates slightly higher. Honeywell shares rose Friday, retaking a buy point.RELATED:General Electric Stock Dives On Earnings OutlookAmerican Express beat on the top and bottom lines, though provisions for losses jumped 26% due to loan-portfolio growth and a rise in the rate for lending write-offs. Visa earnings also topped, with strong cross-border travel – helped by the stronger dollar – and global payment volumes driving results, according to Mizuho analyst Thomas McCrohan. The company also hiked its full-year revenue growth outlook above views. Visa and American Express, both Dow components, rose 2.8% and 0.4%, respectively, with both still in buy range.TD Ameritrade (AMTD) stock broke out from a long consolidation on July 18 as the online broker beat on both the top and bottom lines, even as industry trading fees for stocks and ETFs have plunged this year.

Novartis' $1.22 a share, excluding various items on $12.24 billion in sales, topped analyst views.Both drug stocks rose during the week, but were both still in buy range as of Friday's close.Goldman Sachs' fixed-income trade revenue plunged 40% in Q2, the second straight quarter that the trading-heavy bank said it misread the market. Weaker trading and net-interest income also hurt Bank of America (BAC), though Fed rate hikes have helped the bank and it said it expected net-interest income to rise in Q3. Morgan Stanley (MS) reported that trading revenue fell, but less so than rivals. JPMorgan (JPM) and Citigroup (C) have also signaled caution amid slow loan growth and longer-term bond yields, which can indicate flagging confidence over the chances for long-term economic gains. Morgan Stanley cleared a buy point while Goldman undercut its 50-day and 200-day moving averages.Check Point Software (CHKP) reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings on Thursday, but gave weak guidance for the current Q3. Check Point tumbled 7.2% that day, falling below its 50-day moving average. Check Point on Wednesday briefly topped a buy point but closed below that trigger.

United said it could take at least several months out for plans — like expanded service to different parts of the U.S. and the rollout of cheaper ""basic economy"" fares — to pay off.The No. 1 U.S. health insurer's earnings per share rose 25.5%, topping forecasts. Revenue grew 8% to $50.05 billion, roughly in line, though it was the smallest gain in nine quarters.  UnitedHealth (UNH) has exited the ObamaCare exchanges, though it's a big player in Medicare and Medicaid coverage. The Optum services unit saw a 9.9% revenue rise. UnitedHealth now sees adjusted full-year profit of $9.75-$9.90 a share. Analysts had expected $9.81 before Q2's results.UnitedHealth rose 2.6%, with Republicans' health care struggles also influencing shares of insurers and hospitals.RELATED: UnitedHealth Raises Full-Year Target After Q2 Earnings Jump 25.5%Top U.S. rail companies topped quarterly forecasts, but CSX (CSX) said crude oil train shipments have fallen to zero and hinted that returns to shareholders may be more cautious.

62,ISRG,"On Thursday, Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP) reported better-than-expected earnings, with Apple (AAPL) iPhone chipmaker Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) on tap tonight.X Check Point was one of six cybersecurity stocks on the verge of breakouts as Tuesday night (including Fortinet (FTNT), Proofpoint (PFPT) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW)), with all but one crossing buy points intraday.Meanwhile, Skyworks will provide clues to Apple's business and those of other iPhone chipmakers, with Broadcom (AVGO) just below an entry point.During Wednesday's session, the Nasdaq composite rose 0.6% and the S&P 500 index 0.5%, both hitting record highs.

Still, it was striking how many cybersecurity plays acted like Check Point. Fortinet, FireEye (FEYE), Imperva (IMPV) and Palo Alto Networks all cleared entries intraday, only to close just under those levels. Proofpoint closed near session highs, moving into position for a possible breakout. All six are within 2% of valid entry points.Fortinet and Proofpoint will report quarterly results next week.Skyworks Solutions reports fiscal third-quarter earnings late Thursday. Skyworks is one of the earlier chipmakers to report, and one of the very first Apple iPhone chipmakers to do so. (Qualcomm (QCOM) reported late Wednesday, but its ongoing royalties feud with Apple doesn't make it a great bellwether for the iPhone ecosystem.)Skyworks is expected to report earnings per share of $1.51 vs. $1.24 a year earlier. That would be a 22% EPS gain. Revenue should be $890 million, with the 18% yearly gain matching fiscal Q2's.Skyworks rose 1.5% to 105.41 on Wednesday, closing in on a 112.21 entry from a cup base. Skyworks retook its 50-day moving average last Friday.Apple shares finally regained their 50-day line on Tuesday, but they've risen for nine straight sessions now.

65,ISRG,"Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Medtronic (MDT) and others are trying to challenge the dominance of Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) in the robot-assisted surgery space, but so far have failed to disrupt the market leader.The maker of the da Vinci surgery system saw its IBD SmartSelect Composite Rating jump to 96 Tuesday, up from 94 the day before.The revised score means Intuitive Surgical now tops 96% of all other stocks in terms of key performance metrics and technical strength. The best stocks tend to have a 95 or better grade as they begin to launch a significant move.Intuitive Surgical has climbed about 37% above a 688.74 buy point in a cup with handle that it cleared in February. On Tuesday, it moved past a 937.25 follow-on buy point in a three-weeks tight pattern. Intuitive pulled back from its a session high to close in positive territory at 939.23.One weak spot is the company's 75 EPS Rating, which tracks quarterly and annual earnings-per-share growth.

66,ISRG,"There could be upside to Intuitive Surgical's (ISRG) 2017 guidance, but an analyst suggested Tuesday that investors are ""already paying for that"" and downgraded the stock on the likelihood of subdued demand in Asia.Canaccord analyst Jason Mills also sees Medtronic (MDT), known for making heart-valve replacements that rival those of Edwards Lifesciences (EW), as a stout competitor in surgery robotics in 2018-19.Year to date, Intuitive Surgical stock is up 44% after a ""phenomenal year"" in 2016, Canaccord analyst Jason Mills wrote in a note to clients. Intuitive ended the year with 18% sales growth, 26% earnings growth and $5 billion in cash.""As the health care sector has been a top performer so far in 2017, Intuitive Surgical has been leading the charge,"" Mills said. ""However, investors' exuberance about the company's strong performance over the past few years has driven the stock to unprecedented valuation levels.""Mills downgraded Intuitive Surgical stock to a hold rating from buy after two years, though he kept his 870 price target. At the close on the stock market today, Intuitive Surgical was up 0.5%, to 914.43.""While we expect Intuitive Surgical to deliver solid results in 2017 and 2018, we believe the risk/reward setup tilts too much to the former at the present,"" he said. The stock hasn't traded at this valuation since 2012 and is now at a 34% premium to its own five-year average.IBD'S TAKE: Intuitive Surgical stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 96 out of a best-possible 99. It's ranked fourth in IBD's 58-company Medical-Systems/Equipment industry group. Idexx Laboratories (IDXX) stock leads the group, with a CR of 98. For a look at the group setup, head to IBD Stock Checkup.Guidance has played a big role in Intuitive Surgical's stock, Mills said. The company typically offers conservative guidance that it easily outperforms, thus investors expect ""positive guidance revisions through the balance of 2017.""But that might not be the case. The Easter weekend tailwind in the first quarter will become a headwind in the second quarter, and outside-U.S. business is slowing, Mills wrote. Procedure growth is expected to be subdued in Japan and to moderate in China.""While we think there could be upside to current guidance, we think you're already paying for that,"" he wrote.In the meantime, competition is looming, he said. Intuitive Surgical makes robotics that assist in performing surgery. Medtronic reiterated on its earnings call last week its plan to launch its surgical robotics outside the U.S. before April 2018 and in the U.S. during fiscal 2019.""Medtronic's competitive approach seems to be centered on its ability to target the customer across myriad surgical spectrums, but we also deduce from our conversations with management they will target the cost side of the equation as well,"" Mills said.Though Medtronic might not become much of a competitor until late 2018 or early 2019, as its domestic launch creeps closer Intuitive Surgical investors ""may begin to account for the upcoming competition vis-a-vis the multiple afforded these shares,"" he said.RELATED:Robot Surgeon Maker Launches To Record High On Strong Q1

""As opposed to taking a broad view of the health care sector, which we do like overall, we see some great opportunities in the medical device space, to which investors can get exposure through the iShares Medical Device ETF,"" he said.He also noted that the fund's top five holdings account for nearly 40% of the portfolio, which may increase the risk profile. IHI is extended past a 152.83 buy point cleared in April.IBD'S TAKE: Find out which biotechs stand to benefit the most under President Trump's proposed tax reform in this recent tech column.SPDR S&P Health Care Equipment (XHE) returned 16.2% YTD through May 30 and 19.4% for the five-year average.

Shares led IBD's 58-company Medical-Systems/Equipment industry group, which broadly rose 2.8%.Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar called the results especially strong for such a big name.""Generally for high growth/high (price/earnings value) names like Intuitive Surgical, the numbers have to be pretty solid all around to sustain multiples,"" Kumar said. ""We think Intuitive Surgical managed to put up enough to satisfy elevated expectations.""Procedure growth launched to 18% in the first quarter following a change in guidelines for testing prostate-specific antigen by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. The group now encourages men ages 55-69 without signs or symptoms to talk with their doctors regarding the potential benefits and harms of screening. Men above the age of 70 should not be screened as the potential benefits don't outweigh the harms.Intuitive's robotic tools are used in a number of urologic and gynecologic settings. During the recent Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons conference, experts said hernia treatments are likely to grow 40% in 2017.""Along with a change in PSA testing guidelines by (the task force), we think procedures should trend in the midteens range for Intuitive Surgical,"" Kumar said. On Tuesday, Intuitive guided to 12%-14% procedure growth in 2017, up from earlier views for 9%-12%.IBD'S TAKE: In 2008, Intuitive Surgical was a leader in the medtech world. Can it get there again? Head to Investor's Corner for more.System updates were somewhat mixed, though. Intuitive Surgical plans to delay its single port launch by one or two quarters. But it also unveiled the da Vinci X, an upgrade that sits between the da Vinci Si and da Vinci Xi, third- and fourth-generation platforms.Da Vinci X ""leverages many of the benefits of the Xi and provides hospitals with an entry point to Intuitive Surgical's advanced technologies,"" Wedbush analyst Tao Levy wrote in a note to clients.Meanwhile, the delay to submit the single port to the FDA was ""a disappointment,"" but RBC analyst Brandon Henry says he had expected a slow rollout of the single port tech anyway, and ""this shouldn't detract from an otherwise strong start to 2017 for Intuitive Surgery.""Henry boosted his price target on Intuitive Surgical stock to 800 from 777, and kept his outperform rating.

Adjusted earnings rose 15.2% to $5.09 a share, beating views for $4.95.The company shipped 133 da Vinci surgical systems compared with 110 in the year-earlier quarter. Growth in da Vinci procedures by 18% was driven by growth in U.S. general surgery procedures and worldwide urologic procedures, Intuitive Surgical said in a news release.""We are pleased with broad-based da Vinci procedure growth during the first quarter and are encouraged by trends in key global markets and our U.S. surgery business,"" Chief Executive Gary Guthart said in a prepared statement. U.S. procedures grew 14% and outside U.S. procedures grew 28%.Procedure growth was the ""strongest we have seen so far,"" Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar said in a note to clients following the earnings release. The growth benefited from timing elements, but helped give Intuitive Surgical a ""solid start to the year.""IBD'S TAKE: Intuitive Surgical was a leader in 2008 after five bases. Will it lead again? Head to Investor's Corner for a deep dive on the stock.Management sees 2017 procedures growing 12%-14%, up from earlier guidance for 9%-12%. The company expects interest in leasing da Vinci systems — rather than outright buying them — to grow. Subsequently, pricing on outright purchases is likely to drop.Intuitive Surgical didn't give sales and profits guidance for 2017 on the conference call. Analysts expect $730.74 million in sales and adjusted earnings of $5.87 a share for the second quarter. On a year-over-year basis, sales would be up 9% with profits rising by 25%.RELATED:Can The U.S. Come From Behind In The Robot Race?

The news lifted defense plays led by Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon (RTN), as well as National Oilwell Varco (NOV) and others.  Boeing and Lockheed Martin ended up nearly 2%.Ford (F) held its early gain, ending Monday up more than 2% after announcing it had replaced Chief Executive Mark Fields with Jim Hackett, the former CEO of Steelcase (SCS) who has headed Ford's Smart Mobility experimental operations unit.

But keep in mind that in the next three quarters, Nvidia faces absolutely steep year-over-year comps, as Q2, Q3, and Q4 profit rose 56%, 104% and 117%, respectively.Given the giant gains in 2016, Nvidia's current correction is very respectable, falling no more than 21% from its all-time high of 120.92.Celgene (CELG), $98 billion market value: The highly respected biotech pioneers treatments for chronic and difficult diseases including multiple myeloma. The stock jumped 2% to 125.87 after finding vital support at the 50-day line.

Watch for an expected positive change in both comparable restaurant sales and see if restaurant-level operating margins show stability or improve.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), $31 billion: The robotic surgery firm, which recently posted double-digit top and bottom-line growth in Q1, is up more than 31% since Jan. 1. It bolted out of a saucerlike base at 727.23 in late February.Intuitive gets a rock-solid 96 Composite Rating in IBD Stock Checkup, among the top 5 in IBD's Medical-Systems/Equipment industry group. That group is ranked No. 1 among 197 industry groups and subgroups for six-month relative price performance.Watch for potential new buy points to emerge, in the form of a new base or a gentle pullback to the 10-week moving average, as seen on a weekly chart.In some cases, a stock may not fall back to the 50-day line but find support at the 10-week line. So it's crucial to study a stock's price action on both the daily and weekly charts.RELATED:The Case For A Future New Bull Market In GoldEarnings Results Today: Chipotle Leads 5 Big Reports After The CloseStock Market Today: Is It Time To Buy Hasbro Now?

82,ISRG,"Stocks are showing an impressive rebound after Monday's opening sell-off, with the Nasdaq composite turning a near 1% loss into a 0.2% gain.The Nasdaq 100, reflecting resilience in large- and megacap techs, rose 0.2%. The Dow Jones industrial average is turning a drop of nearly 1% into a loss of just 0.2% after falling more than 1% last week.Early Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average briefly clipped its 50-day moving average for the first time since it fell to the south side of the key support and resistance line Sept. 9. Back then, it took nearly two months for the 30-stock Dow to rebound back above the 50-day line.Helping the Dow were DuPont (DD), which was the sole component to rise 1 point or more. At 80.66, the diversified manufacturer is a legitimate leader in the stock market today, up 9.9% since Jan. 1. Shares also are up by 13% from a recent breakout on Nov. 30, past a 71.19 flat-base buy point.The S&P 500 was down less than 0.2%.IBD Best Mutual Fund Awards: View The Winners By CategoryAmong new issues, Snap (SNAP) is getting plenty of attention on the back of positive comments from analysts and new buy ratings. Shares strode more than 6% higher to 24.18, possibly setting up its highest close in more than two weeks.On its market debut, the Snapchat social media site operator leapt past its 17-per-share IPO to finish at 24.48, then catapulted another 20% to as high as 29.44 before coming down to earth. Over the next 10 sessions, Snap slid 36% to a low of 18.90. In a normal cup or double-bottom base, the decline usually runs no more than 33% to 35% from high to low — based on IBD's research of big winners over the past 22 bull- and bear-market cycles. So, in Snap's case, the decline is on the heavy side, especially given the fact that the gain from the 17-per-share IPO did not exceed 100% or more.Despite recent positive Wall Street comments, Snap is on course to lose money in 2017 (consensus estimate of a net loss of 45 cents a share) and 2018 (-$0.32).Still, the stock deserves a close watch if the rebound continues and the stock gets to within 5% to 15% of its 29.44 peak.In most excellent cup-with-handle patterns, a stock tends to form the handle — the last final shakeout of uncommitted holders before a big breakout to new highs — while trading no more than 15% off its 52-week or all-time high.While the Trump-supported American Health Care Act never saw the light of day Friday, investors should continue to watch leading names in the medical and health care services industry groups.

Celgene is No. 1 in that field, and also is becoming a force in the treatment of chronic illnesses such as psoriasis.Celgene gets a wonderful 98 EPS Rating from IBD Stock Checkup due to its consistent pattern of long-term profit increases and solid gains in the short term as well. Over the past six quarters, earnings per share rose 27%, 17%, 23%, 17%, 28% and 36% vs. year-ago levels. That's an average EPS gain of 24.7%, which is outstanding for companies with market caps of $15 billion or higher.Celgene has a $96 billion market value and 775 million shares outstanding, which is large but not excessively so. As a point of comparison, Pfizer (PFE) has 5.95 billion shares outstanding.The Street sees fiscal year 2017 profit rising 22%, to $7.22 a share, on an 18% lift in revenue to $13.29 billion. Revenue rose 24%, 27% and 26% vs. year-ago levels in the prior three years.Intuitive, meanwhile, remains top of the hill in the field of robotic surgery systems. Wall Street sees earnings rising 12% to $4.93 a share in the current quarter, which would accelerate the 3% increase seen in Q4 2016.Sales are seen rising 13% to $670.2 million in Q1, up from 12% growth in Q4.Intuitive presented two buy points in 2017 so far. On Feb. 21, the stock spurted past a 72.35 cup-base entry in volume expanding nearly 40% above its 50-day average,  a sign of healthy demand by mutual funds, large investment advisers, pensions, insurers and the like. But go to a daily chart, and you'll also see a very narrow handle that formed from Jan. 26 to Feb. 1, creating a hard-to-see 700.52 early buy point.Add 10 cents to the highest price within any handle to obtain a handle entry point. Notice on a daily chart how the stock gapped up in huge volume on Jan. 25 in reaction to decent fourth-quarter results (EPS up 3%, revenue up 12%).Intuitive currently gets a solid 93 Composite Rating, better than Regeneron's 80 score. Watch to see if Regeneron musters the strength to rise back above the 50-day and 200-day lines, create some space above those key resistance lines, and earnest start forming the right side of a new base pattern.RELATED:How To Invest: Add The 10-Week-Line Pullback To Your Trading PlaybookHow To Invest: The Keys To A Great Cup-With-Handle BaseStock Market Today: Do These 7 Leading Chipmakers Deserve A Spot On Your Watch List?Inside IBD 50: What Do These 5 Big Winners Have In Common?Tech News At IBD: Why Snap Is Getting Some Love On Wall Street

83,ISRG,"The field of robotics has captured the imagination like no other industry, as companies develop machines that once were the stuff of science fiction.Today, robotics are expanding in manufacturing, where they first got a foothold. In the military, drones are now in every battalion and are used in naval warfare. Robo Global Robotics & Automation (ROBO) ETF captures that wave of innovation through a portfolio of about 80 companies either developing or using robotic technology.Those companies include names in 3D printing, health care, energy, consumer products and other industries. With such a large portfolio, many of the ETF's components are only partially involved in robotics, while others could be regarded as pure plays. The firm says 40% of the fund consists of ""bellwether"" companies that are leading robotics companies and the rest are firms ""that enable robotics/automation with growing revenue contributions.""For example, Nvidia (NVDA) is making strides in the field of self-driving cars but its main business is graphics chips. Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) pioneered robotic-assisted surgery and has been one of the better-performing stocks in the ETF this year.IRobot (IRBT) is best known for vacuum cleaning and pool cleaning robots. AeroVironment (AVAV) makes drones for industrial and military use, but has other businesses such as electric-car chargers. Cognex (CGNX) makes electronic vision equipment for industrial inspection.Advances in robotics are accelerating, as digital technology makes it increasingly possible to automate functions with computers. The market for robotics and automation is expected to grow from $64 billion to $1.2 trillion, according to research noted in Robo Global's website. Experts also see a 17.4% compounded annual growth rate in service and consumer robotics from 2015 to 2020.Robo Global Robotics & Automation is the sole ETF product from Robo Global ETFs, a Dallas-based firm. All components are about equal in weighting of 1% to 2% each. By market capitalization, about 23% of the portfolio is made up of big-cap companies, 37% midcap and 40% small cap.It is not the only robotics ETF, however. Global X Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (BOTZ) is a newer ETF; it started trading in September. It has fewer than 30 stocks, many of them are in Robo Global Robotics. The ETF, which started trading in October 2013, has surged more than 50% from a low in February 2016. It broke out of a base in December but is now having trouble maintaining support at its 50-day moving average.RELATED:This Cloud-Computing ETF Is Loaded With FANG Stocks

84,ISRG,"Big-cap techs are having a superb first quarter so far. Just look at the Nasdaq 100. The tech-heavy index covers the 100 largest nonfinancial firms on the all-electronic exchange and is up 11.4% since ending last year at 4863.62. Growth investors know that strong market leaders tend to get stronger until the market itself shows signs of tipping the other…
"
85,ISRG,"Thematic ETFs are many things to many investors — not all of them good — but one thing they tend not to be is dull. While some chase fads, others are underpinned by sound strategies.Exchange traded funds based on specific themes begin the investment process by identifying macroeconomic trends.Like Tesla (TSLA) and Mobileye (MBLY)? Two top-performing thematic ETFs will give you exposure to those stocks and related stocks that share the same underlying drivers of growth.Consumers want electric vehicles with one eye to the environment and another to their pocketbooks. They also want mobile devices that allow them to always stay connected to the broader world.Those trends are unlikely to disappear anytime soon and are benefiting the companies that mine, refine or use lithium — a metal that powers electric cars and smartphone batteries.Global X Lithium & Battery Tech (LIT) targets 26 global companies benefiting from lithium demand, including Tesla, Samsung and Panasonic.The ETF jumped 8% in March as Tesla steamed ahead on a report that vehicle delivery in March was more robust than expected.Alphabet's (GOOGL) self-driving cars, Amazon's (AMZN) Alexa and Apple's (AAPL) Siri put a consumer-friendly face on machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). However, robots, AI and automation have widespread industrial and commercial uses.Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence (BOTZ) seizes the companies that stand to gain most from the trend. Its stock holdings include Mobileye, Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) and iRobot (IRBT).The ETF advanced 4.7% in March as shares of Mobileye spiked on news of its acquisition by chip giant Intel (INTC). Mobileye, an Israeli technology firm, develops vision-safety software that makes roads safer.LIT and BOTZ are up 16% and 15% year to date, respectively, vs. a 6% gain for the S&P 500. The latter is a relatively new ETF and should be traded with care.Thematic ETFs appeal to investors seeking to beat the S&P 500 or an absolute return benchmark over the long term, according to Global X.These funds have shortcomings too. Some track indexes with stocks that are just ""loosely affiliated"" with the investment theme, according to a Morningstar report.Some make for a hairy ride. Global X Uranium (URA) is up 18% this year but sits 21% under its Feb. 15 high.Investors pay up for these specialized investments. LIT, for example, has a 0.76% expense ratio.RELATED:What Is Going On In The ETF Market?

86,ISRG,"Stocks charged ahead Tuesday following last week's big gains, and the advance showed good breadth once again.Plastics, hospital, fiber-optic, automaker and chip-equipment stocks jumped the highest. Yet buying was strong in some defensive areas of Wall Street as well, as confectionery, gas distribution and long-term medical care stocks also rallied 1% or more.The S&P 500 rallied 0.6%, adding to last week's 1.5% rise, its fourth weekly gain in a row. The Dow Jones industrial average lifted nearly 0.6% and the Nasdaq composite almost 0.5%. The Russell 2000, a popular small-cap benchmark, rolled more than 0.7% higher and is now up 3.9% since Jan. 1.Volume edged slightly higher on the NYSE vs. Friday and rose a little more sharply on the Nasdaq. Such turnover increases are impressive considering that Friday was a witching day in which weekly and monthly options expired, tending to boost turnover.Winners thumped losers on the NYSE by more than a 2-to-1 margin on Tuesday, while on the Nasdaq the margin was still bullish at roughly 4-to-3. Confidence in the economy and corporate earnings continue to encourage flow of money into big caps.Home Depot (HD), which reported yet another quarter of double-digit EPS growth (up 23% in the January ended quarter), rose 2.02 to 145.02 and is now 5.5% past a 137.42 saucer-with-handle entry. Revenue rose 6% to $22.2 billion, repeating a 6% increase in the fiscal third quarter that ended in October.As noted in this earnings review by IBD news reporter Bill Peters, Home Depot was able to increase its profit by a faster rate than sales thanks to its continued shareholder-friendly action of heavily buying back shares. Management also hiked its cash payout to shareholders by 29% to 89 cents per quarter and approved a new $15 billion share buyback plan.Meanwhile, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Priceline Group (PCLN) and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) are also rising further past recent proper entry points.Advanced Micro, fierce rival to Intel (INTC) in the personal-computer core processors space, gapped up at Tuesday's open and roared 6.6% higher to 14, nearly clearing a two-week pause. The stock with a $13 billion market cap, putting it squarely in the midcap to big-cap range, has acted very well since propelling past a 7.63 low-priced base breakout.Notice on a daily chart how AMD found bullish buying support during a nearly three-week dalliance with its fast-rising 50-day moving average. AMD lost money in both 2015 and 2016, but Wall Street expects a turnaround in earnings (7 cents in 2017, then 27 cents in 2018).AMD's RS Rating is a maximum 99 on a scale of 1 to 99.Intuitive, the pioneer in robotic surgery, rose 1% to 732.17 in heavy trading and rolled mildly past a 727.35 cup-base buy point. One could also see, on a daily chart, the stock forming a narrow five-day handle that started on Jan. 26, yielding an early entry at 700.52.Given Intuitive's slower moves vs. its hypergrowth years in the mid-2000s, it's not at all surprising to see the RS Rating be a middling 66 and the RS line still off its recent highs. However, that ""middling"" 66 RS is a vast improvement from a lowly 27 just 8 weeks ago.A 66 RS means Intuitive is now outperforming two-thirds of all companies in IBD's stock database over the past 12 months. The RS Rating puts a greater weighting on the latest three months' worth of action.Also, the company continues to post steady top- and bottom-line growth. In the past five quarters, sales have risen 12%, 12%, 14%, 16% and 12% vs. year-ago levels. In Q4, revenue eclipsed the $750 million mark.Meanwhile, Intuitive's medical systems and equipment group ranks a not-too-shabby 54th out of 197 industry groups for six-month relative price performance.See the entire list of 197 industry groups here or by going to the IBD Data Tables section inside ""Stock Lists"" at Investors.com.Apple (AAPL), one of the top performing megacap stocks so far in 2017, added 0.7% to 136.67, rising further past a 118.12 cup-with-handle buy point. It broke out initially in dull volume on Jan. 6-9. Apple has led the way among battered blue chip names in breaking out after ending deep declines and building constructive bottoming base patterns.Apple is also up more than 23% since it cleared an initial cup with handle with a 110.33 entry on Sept. 14.Holders would not be wrong at all in taking at least some profits, based on the 20%-to-25% sell rule, which helps savvy investors capture gains during a stock's upside.Of course, those with supreme conviction in Apple may decide to be patient and hold longer. Indeed, some leading names are capable of rising 30% to 40% before staging a significant price correction. These corrections are the genesis of new bases during a confirmed market uptrend.U.S. equities are not rising alone. Chinese stocks have risen sharply in the past few sessions. Through Tuesday's trade, the mainland China-focused Shanghai Composite gained nearly 1.6% over two straight sessions; at 3253, the composite stood up a hearty 4.6% year to date.And despite fears of escalating tension between North Korea and its neighbors over continued nuclear tests, Japan's Nikkei 225 index bounced off its 50-day moving average in the past two sessions as it staged a 0.7% overnight on Tuesday.RELATED:The Big Picture: The Current Price Pattern In The Major Indexes Right Now Why Home Depot Is Sharing The Spoils With ShareholdersHow To Invest: Is The Trump Delay Of The Fiduciary Rule A Boon For The Banks?How To Invest: Why Apple Formed A Bottoming Base Pattern In 2009

88,ISRG,"On the same day that atomic scientists behind the Doomsday Clock spread worry about a possible global catastrophe, a venture capital firm launched a Robot Fear Index to track public concerns ranging from automation taking jobs to a full-scale robot apocalypse.On Thursday, members of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists reset their symbolic Doomsday Clock to its closest time to midnight in 64 years. They said the world is closer to catastrophe due to threats such as nuclear weapons, climate change and Donald Trump's election as U.S. president.Also Thursday, Loup Ventures debuted its Robot Fear Index, which is based on surveys of U.S. consumers about their attitudes toward automation, artificial intelligence and robotics.On a scale of 0 to 100, with 0 meaning no fear or robots to 100 meaning widespread and extreme fear of robots, the Robot Fear Index has an initial score of 31.5.""Our Robot Fear Index value of 31.5 suggests that, on balance, we're cautiously comfortable with robots,"" Andrew Murphy, a Loup Ventures managing partner, said in a blog post. ""But the Robot Fear Index could very well rise. For example, we would expect the index value to increase following a fatal crash involving a self-driving car or a faulty surgical procedure performed with robotic assistance.""Consumer familiarity with AI and robotic technology has increased significantly in recent years. People frequently ask virtual assistants like Apple's (AAPL) Siri and Amazon's (AMZN) Alexa spoken questions. They also use self-checkout kiosks at the grocery store and robotic vacuum cleaners from iRobot (IRBT).Plus, they've grown comfortable with idea of robotic surgery tools from Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) and self-driving cars from Tesla Motors (TSLA) and others.However, people are still concerned about where AI and robotics technologies are headed.""We fear that they'll replace our jobs or somehow overthrow us; and to be blunt, those fears are valid,"" Murphy said.

96,ISRG,"Through May 31, the S&P 500 was up 1.3% year to date. Not a savory number for index investors. The Nasdaq composite rose 7.8%. And the IBD 50 gained 5.1%.While the list of premier growth companies has outperformed the large-cap benchmark by nearly fourfold, have some of the individual names done even better? You bet.Use the IBD 50 as a timesaving screen for picking great stocks at the right time. You know that making the IBD 50 means a company has top-notch fundamentals and wonderful relative strength. But the IBD 50 remains a watch list, not a buy list.What does this mean? Let the chart analysis at the bottom of every mini chart in IBD Weekly be your compass. If a stock is breaking out and in the permissible buy range, the analysis will say so. If not, then stay alert for follow-on buy points.Such additional entry points may include first and second rebounds off the 10-week moving average. Or a stock may thrust out of a three-weeks-tight pattern.Let's consider Viper Energy Partners (VNOM), Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), SVB Financial (SIVB), Trade Desk (TTD) and TAL Education (TAL). All five made the IBD 50 during the week of Feb. 26. February was a pivotal month in 2018 so far; the S&P 500 suffered its first 10%-plus correction since February of 2016. Yet these five companies flexed strength.They also help teach stock traders the importance of being nimble.Viper Energy finished the week ended Feb. 23 with a tiny gain, up 0.3%. That trailed a 0.5% rebound by the S&P 500. Then the U.S. oil and gas play fell for three weeks in a row.On the surface that sounds bad, right?Well, not necessarily. This is where careful analysis of Viper's weekly chart comes into play. While the stock did fall three weeks in a row, it limited the overall decline to 3.2% — skimpy and stingy losses.Check out the week ended March 16. Viper bounded off its lows of the week and cut the loss to just 0.4%. It was a tight weekly close. Tight weekly closes within a base matter. Viper had a lot of them. Treat them as a subtle clue that institutional investors are not that willing to dump shares.The Midland, Texas-based firm uncoiled out of its base with a breakout past 26.29 on April 5. Volume wasn't hissing quietly; 1.3 million shares exchanged hands, 219% above the 50-day average. Big price move, big volume on the breakout? Good results usually follow.Viper is now trading near 32, up 22% past the proper entry.Intuitive Surgical, noted as a ""stock of the day"" in IBD's social media coverage, hit a new high of 452 on Jan. 25, then began falling a few days before the major indexes did. Shares basically floated within a relatively tight trading range of 400 to 450.But on April 18, the stock's character changed. After reporting strong Q1 results (earnings up 43%, revenue up 25%, the biggest top-line jump in more than four years), Intuitive jammed out of an 11-week base. Both 452.10 and 445.20 are valid entry points.The robotic surgery systems pioneer has not gained a lot since then. But at 459, the medical stock leader has stretched its advance from an early breakout at 242.49 in February 2017 to 89%.SVB Financial, TAL and Trade Desk have also cleared new bases in recent weeks and are spanking the S&P 500 with year-to-date returns of 33%, 43% and 87%.You can trade the IBD 50 efficiently with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) by Innovator Capital.

99,ISRG,"Barclays analyst Geoff Meacham on Thursday said he expected Gilead Sciences' (GILD) 2017 outlook to be hindered on limited hepatitis C sales. He also sees Merck (MRK) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) issuing sluggish views, though he is more bullish on Biogen (BIIB) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).RBC Capital on Wednesday said much the same about Gilead, and also was more bullish on Biogen as well as on Amgen (AMGN).Hepatitis C drug prescriptions dipped 6%-7% quarter over quarter in Q4, according to market tracker IMS. Gilead makes Sovaldi and Harvoni to combat hepatitis C.Merck and Alexion, meanwhile, will guide to declining metrics on heavier spending and new management, respectively, Meacham predicted. ""Though we'd argue this is widely anticipated,"" Meacham said in a research report.He sees Biogen offering upside guidance on its Spinraza launch with Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS), and Johnson leveraging cost controls to offer a better 2017 view.IBD'S TAKE: As hepatitis C sales fall, where will Gilead go? Check out IBD's Industry Themes for the full scoop on how biotech's five biggest are expected to do in Q4.Ahead of the Q4 pharma earnings season, which starts next week with reports from companies such as J&J, Stryker (SYK) and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), Meacham boosted his price target on Incyte (INCY) stock, noting that company's phase three tumor efforts with Merck. The duo are testing immunotherapy Keytruda and epacadostat in four tumors.Meacham expects Incyte, in its Q4 earnings conference call, to give some color on Jakafi trials in graft vs. host disease, as well as its tumor efforts with Merck. He bumped his price target on Incyte stock to 135 from 105. Incycte hasn't yet set a date for its Q4 earnings report.Incyte stock, which last week touched a 14-month high just shy of 119, rallied 2% to close at 117.53 in the stock market today.For Q4, the consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expects Incyte to report $324.8 million in sales and 14 cents earnings per share, up a third and down 52%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter.Merck's spending is likely ramping on Keytruda which was granted priority review last week in combination with Eli Lilly's (LLY) chemotherapy Alimta to treat non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients with a high expression of the PDL1 gene.Keytruda-plus-Alimta is in phase three testing. If data are strong, Merck could open itself up to a larger patient population vs. the 25%-30% of patients with a 50%-plus PDL1 expression. Keytruda is already approved as a monotherapy in high-expressing PDL1 patients with NSCLC.RELATED:Merck, Biogen, Lilly Top 2016 Approvals Despite FDA SlumpTrump's 'Disastrous' Pharma View Doesn't Rattle JPMorgan Drug ConferenceWill Trump Break With Republicans And Push Major Drug Reform?

101,ISRG,"Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) stock weighed on the medical sector Wednesday, as it tanked near a sell zone on slowing growth of procedures that use its robotic-surgery products, though the company late Tuesday posted a massive Q3 sales and earnings beat.In the stock market today, Intuitive Surgical stock fell 5.6% to 681.58, after earlier falling as low as 680.50. That put the stock nearly 6% below a 720.10 entry point achieved Sept. 27 out of a flat base. Investors are advised to sell if a stock falls 7% or 8% below its buy point.IBD's 60-company Medical-Systems/Equipment industry group — which Intuitive Surgical leads in terms of market cap — fell nearly 2% Wednesday. It was the fourth worst-performing group out of 197 tracked.IBD'S TAKE: Intuitive Surgical stock may lead the group in terms of its $26.5 billion market cap, but Cantel Medical Group is No. 1 in terms of key growth metrics. It has an IBD Composite Rating of 99, meaning it performs in the top 1% of all stocks. Keep tabs on the Stock Checkup for the best stock bets.Total procedures rose 14% during Q3, with the U.S. up 11% and non-U.S. up 25%, Intuitive Surgical said Tuesday. But the firm said urology procedures via its da Vinci prostatectomy equipment slowed to low-single-digit growth.Patrick Clingan, the company's vice president of finance and sales, said the U.S. growth level was consistent with the overall rate of new prostate cancer diagnoses. Meanwhile, U.S. gynecology procedures grew ""modestly"" year over year, led by malignant and benign complex hysterectomies.U.S. general and thoracic surgery remained strong, led by hernia repair, but cholecystectomy surgeries declined with ""growth in multiport procedures being offset by declines in single-site procedures,"" Clingan told analysts during the company's earnings conference call late Tuesday.Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar was bullish late Tuesday on Intuitive Surgical stock. During Q3, consumable revenue per procedure grew to $1,870 from $1,810 in the prior quarter. It was the first time since Q4 2014 that the metric topped $1,850, he said.""For us, the Q3 print reaffirmed our view that the Xi upgrade cycle is on a nice adoption cycle and higher consumable revenue per procedure was a very positive sign,"" he wrote in a research report. ""While some of this was order timing, we think mix contributed as well.""Kumar blamed the stock decline on investors going over the ""results of high-multiple stocks with a fine-tooth comb, causing volatility around earnings.""He said nothing has changed on the company's medium-term outlook. Kumar reiterated his buy rating on the stock and boosted his price target to 785 from 775.RELATED:J&J Tops Q3 Views; Could Buoy Intuitive Surgical, Says EvercoreIntuitive Surgical Q3 Earnings, Revenue Beat

102,ISRG,"Every success-minded stock investor desires to sell every stock at the top. Alas, every investor is also human.It's impossible to be perfect. Yet you don't need to be perfect to bag a large chunk of profits from your best stocks.This is why IBD's Investor's Corner column, since 1999, has published hundreds of articles on the best rules in selling big winning stocks. One of these rules involves properly drawing a trend line and using that trend line to identify a serious decline that is spurred by active institutional selling.With practice, anyone can draw a proper trend line on a weekly chart. When a good stock breaks through a properly drawn trend line in heavy volume, it's usually time to sell.The best stocks tend to pull back numerous times throughout their long run, making higher highs and higher lows.Nevertheless, watch each pullback carefully. One of them will be the sell-off that kills the rally.The trend line starts at the low of the first pullback to or near the 10-week line after a breakout from a proper base such as a cup with handle or flat base. The trend line extends through the lows of two subsequent pullbacks.Draw the line on a weekly chart over a span of at least 18 weeks. A line drawn on a daily chart, or one drawn over a shorter period, may compel you to sell too early.The trend line method is not designed to trigger a sell right at the top, but it's been repeatedly shown to work for growth stocks. Investors should also consider overall market health, stock fundamentals and other chart signals in deciding whether it's time to sell. The Big Picture column will help you understand market health. Be aware of the general reaction toward individual stocks following corporate earnings reports, too.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), the pioneering maker of da Vinci robotic surgical systems, broke out above a 19.20 buy point from a cup-with-handle base in July 2004. The company turned years of net losses with a strong profit that year.That breakout unleashed a torrid run; Intuitive climbed 626% over the next year and a half to a peak of 139.50 on Jan. 31, 2006, then spent the next 12 months forming a new base.The year 2007 was good for stocks. Intuitive broke out again, rising 9% in the week ended March 23 and surpassing a new 118.07 buy point within a long base that resembled a shallow double bottom with handle. Over the next three months, the medical tech firm climbed steadily, finding support at or near its rising 10-week moving average.Then shares really took off with a nearly 34% jump in the week ended July 27 (1). A trend line could be drawn with the first point being the low of that week at 146. Using a logarithmic chart, the second and third points of the trend line could be connected at the lows during the weeks ended Oct. 19 and Nov. 16. Total time period between the first point and the third point of the trend line: 18 weeks.In January of 2008, Intuitive changed in character. The stock traded in a volatile manner, then fell four weeks in a row (2). In the second and third weeks of that decline, the stock slid a combined 20% in price. That action violated the properly drawn trend line.Time to sell.Intuitive made a giant rebound off its 40-week moving average a month later, and went on to complete a new base. But it was wide and loose, and thus flawed. A breakout past a deep handle at 315.90 lacked the power to send Intuitive hitting a new high. Faulty late-stage bases also flash a valuable sell signal for alert shareholders.By late November 2008, amid the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy and subprime debt meltdown, Intuitive dropped to as low as 110.35, 69% off its 359.59 peak.(Editor's Note: This column originally published in the May 1, 2013, edition of IBD.)RELATED:Is Your Stock Making A Lot Of Share Splits?

103,ISRG,"Early Tuesday, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) posted better-than-expected Q3 earnings, including double-digit sales growth in advanced surgery that Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar says could prove a boon for Intuitive Surgical (ISRG).The two stocks, however, had diverged by the closing bell on the stock market today. Johnson & Johnson finished the day down 2.6% to 115.41. Intuitive Surgical stock closed up 1.7% to 721.73, for a gain of 12.29 a share. Intuitive Surgical is set to report its Q3 earnings after the close Tuesday, as shares try to gain traction after breaking out a flat base at 720.10 on Sept. 27.IBD'S TAKE: Johnson & Johnson is facing an upcoming rivalry in its pharmaceutical unit, where Celgene, Gilead Sciences, Galapagos and Biogen are all also working on drugs to treat Crohn's disease.For Q3, Johnson & Johnson reported $17.82 billion in sales and $1.68 earnings per share minus items, up a respective 4% and 13% vs. last year. Both metrics topped the consensus of 24 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $17.74 billion and $1.66.But sales fell 1.6% in its huge consumer segment. On the other hand, pharmaceutical and medical devices sales grew 9.2% and 1.1%, respectively. J&J pulled in $884 million in its still-small advanced surgery device unit, up 11.2%.""In general, this seems to be bode well for Intuitive Surgical ...,"" Kumar wrote in his research report. Intuitive Surgical is known for its Da Vinci robots surgery system.For A3, analysts expect Intuitive Surgical to report $5.14 EPS ex items on $650.5 million in sales.

104,ISRG,"Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) reports third-quarter earnings after the close Tuesday. The company, with its da Vinci system, is a leader in robotics-assisted, minimally invasive surgery. After five quarters of 20% or more year-over-year growth in EPS ex items, earnings are expected to fall a tad as the comparisons get tougher, but sales growth is expected to remain fairly steady. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) early Tuesday posted a solid 11% rise for its advanced surgery device business, which could be a good sign for rival Intuitive.Estimates: EPS ex items are seen falling 2.1% to $5.13, on 10% revenue growth to $650.5 million, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.Results: EPS ex items of $6.19, up 18% from Q3 2015, on revenue of $683 million, up 16%.

Drilling, exploration oilfield services and oil machinery were among the oil & gas industry groups in the top 10 of today's trading.Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) followed through on yesterday's breakout, adding almost 1% in heavy volume.Earnings continue to sway Wall Street, as some major financial, technology and health care companies were on the day's docket.Morgan Stanley climbed nearly 1% after the bank beat profit expectations. It was the latest investor-pleasing quarterly report from the major banks. Revenue also topped views, as a surge in bond trading helped the quarter. The stock is slightly above a 32.47 buy point.Intel (INTC) slid nearly 6%, erasing all gains from the 36.03 buy point of a breakout in early September. It also gapped below the 50-day moving average in heavy volume, which puts the stock in a perilous position. The chipmaker's guidance was weak when it reported Q3 results late Tuesday.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) fell nearly  4% despite that the company's Q3 sales and earnings beat expectations. Operating earnings were $6.19 a share, up 18%, on revenue of $683 million, an increase of 16%. The stock slid as much as 5.5% below a 720.10 buy point, from which Intuitive had difficulty climbing. The stock also pierced its 50-day moving average in heavy volume, leaving shares compromised.On Wednesday, Canaccord Genuity analyst Jason Mills raised his price target to 800 from 750. He cited expanding margins, increases in procedures and a spike in revenue per procedure.IBD's homebuilding industry  group edged up 0.1% but other construction-related industry groups fell after a mixed industry report.Housing starts of an annualized 1.047 million in September were down 9%,  to the slowest pace since March 2015. Economists had expected a slight increase to a 1.18 million pace. But the drop was due to volatile multifamily starts. Single-family starts jumped 8.1% in September, the highest since February.

106,ISRG,"A new high is fine, if an individual investor already has a position in the stock. For others, the new high is actionable only if the stock is clearing a valid base.If the stock is flirting with a new high but not quite able to break out, this too could be useful.Another possibility is a new high with no volume or a new high that reverses lower. These are cases where the new high can communicate trouble.Tuesday's market had a bit of everything.RV maker Thor Industries (THO) gapped up to a new high in torrid volume, but the stock is too extended to buy at this point. Ditto for computer-networking company Gigamon (GIMO) and heart device maker Abiomed (ABMD).Online marketplace operator Amazon.com (AMZN) also is extended. The stock rose to a new high in volume 27% above average. While a 40% spike is generally considered the minimum level for bullish action, Amazon's size makes that less of an issue. The 27% spike is quite good for a mammoth stock.Other stocks pegging new highs in below-average volume include telecom play Lumentum (LITE), health accounts operator HealthEquity (HWY), network equipment maker Arista Networks (ANET) and online food delivery and restaurant order facilitator GrubHub (GRUB).IBD'S TAKE: Intuitive Surgical's stock chart looks good, but there are some flaws on the fundamentals side. Use IBD Stock Checkup to do a fast yet comprehensive research on any company's fundamental, technical, and institutional sponsorship strength. All three are critical to the making of a true stock market winner.Of all the stocks mentioned here, robot surgery aid Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) probably has the most inviting chart situation. Technically the stock cleared a 720.10 buy point, but the stock closed only 9 cents above the entry. An individual investor could watch for a better breakout: Volume was only 13% above average.The weekly chart shows some net accumulation in the pattern. The relative strength line is at a new high, which is bullish. But Intuitive is only No. 7 in its group at Stock Checkup.RELATED:FedEx's Stock Rises AgainGrubHub Called Long-Term Winner In Food Delivery

As FierceBiotech reported last month, Verb Surgical is aiming to develop a next-generation system that ""incorporates robotics, advanced visualization, machine learning, data…

111,ISRG,"Your mom might have told you to never judge people by their looks. But it's OK to do that with stocks.This is especially the case if you are an individual investor or a professional advisor and you wish to use charts to your full advantage.Do you have a sharp eye? Or do you want to improve your chart-reading skills? If you do, you'll be able to improve your returns in the stock market by avoiding stocks that form the V-shaped base.And if you harbor a big gain in a stock that carves out this faulty pattern, then you know the market has presented you the gift of insight from IBD's research that the stock is very close to peaking, and thus must be sold.Investors should be discriminating against bases that are V-shaped. Not only does a V-shaped cup pattern differ greatly from winning cup bases, but it also may bring about other sell signals.Just because a stock with strong fundamentals shapes a base doesn't mean that it's an automatic buy. You still have to pore over the stock's chart and decipher the good and the bad on its price-and-volume action.A V-shaped base may initially look like good action as the stock stages a fast recovery after selling off. But sometimes this type of action is akin to being too fast, too furious. This is not healthy.V-shaped bases don't allow a stock to go through a more natural correction. After a sharp pullback, it's good to see a stock consolidate for two or three weeks to wear out the remaining weak holders. This creates a better foundation and results in a U-shaped pattern.While a cup or cup-with-handle base can be as short as six or seven weeks, respectively, the bases of some of the biggest stock market winners have taken months or more to form. Qualcomm (QCOM) cleared a five-month cup with handle in January 1999 and staged an astronomical run.SunPower (SPWR) blasted out of a 10-month cup-with-handle pattern in 2006 and more than quadrupled before topping.Sometimes in a V-shaped base, a stock will fall hard for a couple of weeks and then rally for a couple of weeks of gains into new-high ground. This fast recovery into new highs is a sell signal and means that a stock could be topping.At times, the pullback will send the stock to its 10-week moving average, typically in heavy volume. This two weeks down and two weeks up sell signal generally occurs after a long uptrend.Keep watch for variations of this sell signal. Sometimes it can be one week down, followed by two or three weeks up to a new high.In late October 2007, Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) fell for three straight weeks (1), but found support at its 10-week moving average.At this point, the decline looked normal; it was a fine start to a potential new base. Volume during the latter two weeks cooled down, another good sign.The leading maker of robotic surgical systems then rose for three weeks in a row. The result: a faulty V-shaped base that was five weeks long, one week short of the six-week minimum length for a cup pattern.The good times didn't last, as Intuitive Surgical soon reversed lower and slumped 37% over the next few weeks before getting support at its 40-week line (2).What if you had bought the stock as it cleared the V-shaped cup? By keeping losses small, you would have avoided serious pain in your portfolio. So always cut your losses short at 7%-8% maximum. If the stock action doesn't look right, by all means sell more quickly.(Editor's Note: This piece originally published in the April 30, 2013, edition of IBD.)

112,ISRG,"Someday C-3PO and R2-D2 could be taking your fast-food restaurant order and cooking your burger and fries instead of saving the galaxy in ""Star Wars.""Before you say, ""I have a bad feeling about this,"" consider the current business and technology trends.The political push to raise the minimum wage nationwide to $15 an hour has motivated many restaurants and other businesses with low-skilled workers to think about replacing some human staff with automation and robots.At the same time, such technology is improving by leaps and bounds and costs are coming down.IBD'S TAKE: There always are some good stocks, with top fundamentals, at or near breakouts, and the IBD Stock Spotlight can flag them for you. Learn why Domino's makes the current list.Already restaurant chains like McDonald's (MCD) and Wendy's (WEN) are adding self-service kiosks to take orders and payments from customers at thousands of locations. Domino's (DPZ) is testing four-wheeled pizza-delivery robots that drive to your home; you unlock the storage compartment with your smartphone.McDonald's stock rose 3% in the stock market Friday after the company posted better-than-expected Q3 earnings. Domino's stock, one of the restaurant industry's rare top-performers, touched a record high for the fourth straight day and ended trading up 0.6%. Wendy's stock rose 0.8% Friday, helped by the positive McDonald's earnings report.Restaurant kitchens will be the next area for automation to take hold, industry experts say.In Silicon Valley, some entrepreneurs are taking restaurant automation to the next level.The Eatsa fast-food restaurant chain, which has two locations in San Francisco, one in Berkeley and one in Southern California (Woodland Hills), is fully automated on the front end. Customers place their order at iPad kiosks and pick up their food from vending-machine-like cubicles without seeing a human worker. Eatsa serves vegetarian quinoa bowls with a variety of toppings. Kitchen staffers prepare the meals in a back room.Andy Puzder, CEO of CKE Restaurants Holdings, told Business Insider last March that he was inspired by a visit to Eatsa to explore more automation for CKE's chains, which include Carl's Jr. and Hardee's.San Francisco-based startup Momentum Machines has built a machine that can crank out up to 400 made-to-order hamburgers an hour. A robot grills a patty, adds toppings, and assembles and wraps the burger without help from humans. Momentum plans to open a restaurant soon in San Francisco.Mountain View, Calif.-based startup Zume Pizza is using robots to make pizzas.In the realm of food-service innovation, engineers also have created robots to make and cook burritos, bratwursts, noodles, sushi and other eats.Costs are a big driver. As labor costs rise, businesses either can pass the increases on to consumers or look for ways to reduce their overhead. And raising prices for consumers can lead to reduced sales.Quick-service restaurants are turning to technology to improve efficiency and lower costs, just as other industries have. Automation has gone from ATM banking to self-service airport kiosks and self-checkout grocery aisles. Amazon.com (AMZN) famously automated much of its fulfillment warehouses after its acquisition of Kiva Systems in 2012.Restaurant automation would be happening even without the pressures caused by the ""Fight for 15"" movement, Jeff Burnstein, president of the trade group Association for Advancing Automation, or A3, tells IBD.""Whether it's manufacturing or other businesses, companies are looking at better ways to do things that will improve productivity and lower costs,"" Burnstein said.Industry experts say the Fight for 15 movement has accelerated the automation push in the near term.But automation has benefits for the restaurant industry beyond lowering costs, Dan Kara, practice director for robotics at ABI Research, tells IBD. Benefits include avoiding worker injury and preventing food contamination, he says.The move to more automation in the quick-service restaurant business is in the early stages. Automating the order-taking and cashier functions is the easy part, Kara said. Next-generation customer kiosks will move from touchscreen order-taking to speech recognition to simplify and speed the process, he says.People are more accepting now of self-service and automation technologies at retail.""In Wendy's or McDonald's today, you get your own sodas now. At one time, somebody did that for you,"" Kara said.Travis Briggs, CEO and partner at Robo Global, is keeping an eye on the workforce automation movement for investment opportunities. His firm created the Robo Global Robotics and Automation Index ETF (ROBO), which consists of more than 80 stocks focused on robotics and automation. The 3-year-old fund hit an all-time high earlier this month. It was up 0.2% on Friday.""The people component of the restaurant business is an extremely expensive one,"" Briggs said. ""That's just a natural area (for more automation). We're moving from the stage where it's interesting and a novelty to a new era where it's a necessity.""The ROBO index includes industrial automation firms ABB (ABB) and Hollysys Automation (HOLI), asset-tracking specialist Zebra Technologies (ZBRA), machine-vision firm Cognex (CGNX), automated driving technology firm Mobileye (MBLY), speech-recognition tech firm Nuance Communications (NUAN) and robotic surgery pioneer Intuitive Surgical (ISRG).But even if restaurants shift to more automation, they'll still need human workers.""If the robot breaks down, who's going to make the hamburgers or the sushi?"" Burnstein said. Employment will shift from low-wage burger flippers to higher-wage technicians and engineers to service and maintain restaurant systems, he says.RELATED:Wendy's Serves Up Big Kiosk Expansion As Wage Hikes Hit Fast FoodMcDonald's CEO Dodges Harsh $15 Fast-Food Wage RealityBlame Minimum Wage, Not Carl's Jr. CEO, For Automated RestaurantsThe Top 10 Jobs Robots Could Steal From Humans By 2025

114,ISRG,"Major stock indexes held solid gains in early afternoon trading Tuesday, helped by a round of mostly healthy earnings reports.The Nasdaq composite led the way, rising just over 1%. The S&P 500 added 0.8% and the Dow Jones industrial average lagged, rising 0.5%.UnitedHealth (UNH) and Goldman Sachs (GS) outperformed in the Dow on strong earnings, but Wall Street frowned on earnings from Dow components IBM (IBM) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).In the stock market today, Alphabet (GOOGL) jumped more than 2% to 826.56 in good volume. After a modest pullback, the owner of Google is back above an 813.98 buy point and still in buy range. Credit Suisse on Monday reiterated an outperform rating and raised its price target to 1070 from 940.Netflix (NFLX) surged nearly 20% after quarterly profit of 12 cents a share doubled the consensus estimate. Sales growth accelerated for the third straight quarter, rising 32% to $2.29 billion.Leaderboard name Domino's Pizza (DPZ) jumped 7%, also on strong earnings.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) continues to hold up well ahead of its earnings report after the close. Shares rose 1% to 718.20. A slightly out-of-the-money weekly call option with a 720 strike price recently offered a premium of around $16, presenting a trade with reasonable downside risk of just over 2%.IBD'S TAKE: Using options around earnings is less risky than buying the stock outright ahead of earnings.

115,ISRG,"Stocks held on to decent gains with one hour left in the session. Tuesday's advance has been fueled in large part by positive earnings results, and the market will closely watch the news from more companies reporting after the close.They include robotic surgery firm Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) (EPS estimate of $5.14 a share, down 2%), Hawaiian Airlines operator Hawaiian Holdings (HA) (EPS $1.84, +43%) and Intel (INTC) ($0.73, +14%).The Nasdaq composite held above its 50-day moving average as it ran more than 1.1% higher and near session highs. The Nasdaq 100 slightly outperformed, up 1.2%.The NYSE composite and the S&P 500 gained around 0.8%, while the Dow Jones industrials lagged with a 0.5% gain. Volume was higher on both exchanges vs. the same time on Monday.Restaurant stocks are showing some life despite the continued woes for burrito and taco chain Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), which edged up 0.5% to 396.18 and is 48% below its all-time high of 758. Wall Street expects Chipotle's third-quarter profit to fall 65% to $1.62 a share.In contrast, Del Taco (TACO), the Lake Forest, Calif., fast-food chain, bolted 10% higher to 13.93 for its fifth straight gain. The small-cap dining play has a market value of $529 million, much smaller than Chipotle's $11.5 billion market cap. However, Del Taco is rising sharply after reporting a 1,200% gain in earnings to 13 cents a share.Sales grew 6% to $104.4 million, remaining in single-digit mode. But Del Taco's after-tax margin jumped from 0.2% in the year-ago quarter to 4.7%. Systemwide same-store sales rose 6.7%.Del Taco management in a news release cited progress with its ""UnFreshing Believable 2.0"" campaign to highlight its use of fresh ingredients. Restaurant-level margin grew to 20.9%, up 120 basis points on a non-GAAP basis.The stock launched out of a long, deep bottoming-style cup with handle, breaking out past an 11.71 buy point. While the stock is extended from that entry, note on a weekly chart how shares have encountered upside resistance near 15 and 16. Thus, more pivot points could develop.Del Taco is one of only nine companies in IBD's 60-member Retail-Restaurants industry group with a Relative Strength Rating of 80 or higher. Del Taco (RS 87) has a middling Composite Rating of 78 out of a maximum 99, but that's likely to improve quickly amid Tuesday's big gain.Domino's Pizza (DPZ), part of IBD Leaderboard, surged more than 6% to 162.35, getting extended from a follow-on buy point near 150 during a second test of buying support at the 50-day moving average near 150. Domino's earns an 88 RS Rating.Domino's first entered the Leaderboard Leaders list of elite growth companies on Feb. 25 this year.Industry peer Jack In The Box (JACK), operator of the Qdoba Mexican Eats fast-casual chain, rose nearly 2% to 97.19, just shy of rising on the north side of its 50-day line. The leading stock is up nearly 27% since Jan. 1. Wall Street sees Q3 earnings jumping 42% to 88 cents a share; the company is likely to report September-ended fiscal Q4 results in November.Elsewhere in the stock market today, Tesla Motors (TSLA) rebounded nearly 2% to 197.60 after briefly undercutting a recent low of 193.45 on Monday.

117,ISRG,"In a global market starved for growth, lead manager Justin Kelly thinks his $14.7 billion MainStay Large Cap Growth Fund (MLAAX) is about to feast like a shark amid a school of tasty fish.After losing more than twice as much ground in the first quarter than its average large-cap growth rival tracked by Morningstar Inc., the fund doubled its peer group's Q2 gain. And so far this quarter it is ahead 5.49% vs 5.21% for its peer mutual funds, going into Thursday.So what's behind the fund's sudden burst of speed? The market has tilted back toward the types of stocks favored by the fund. That includes stocks like UnitedHealth Group (UNH), which is up about 20% this year.And lead manager Justin Kelly thinks the party for growth stocks is still ramping up.""Growth stocks underperformed this year vs. what I call safety stocks,"" Kelly said. ""Safety stocks do best when the 10-year bond is declining in yield. Those are utilities, staples, telecom and REITs. They all did well in the first half of the year. But since June 30, this fund has been on a tear.""The fund focuses on stocks that grow faster than the broad market. And in the current global market, where growth overall is slow, stocks that can manage to generate above-average growth will be in greater demand, Kelly says. ""If that happens, growth stocks will do better than value, and this fund will rip!""One key to how the fund maneuvers through various markets phases: It adjusts its allocations among three types of growth stocks the managers seek.One bucket contains stocks that the fund sees as long-term sustainable earnings growers. The second bucket contains quality cyclical growers. And the third holds stocks in newer industries with rapid growth.Sustainable growers have some competitive advantage that lets them grow year after year. UnitedHealth Group is an example. Revenue for the provider of health care coverage and benefits services has grown at a double-digit pace for six quarters in a row.Broadcom (AVGO) is one of the fund's cyclicals.""They have radio frequency filters that are highly desirable and the best in the market to allow mobile phones to jump from one frequency to another,"" Kelly said. ""That gives them pricing power that few other vendors in their semiconductor industry have.""Broadcom's filters, Kelly adds, enable phones to work on networks in different countries and as a user moves from one cell tower to another.Facebook (FB) is in their bucket of stocks in newer industries with rapid growth. A top-10 holding as of June 30, its rapid growth comes from market-share gains in advertising. ""Its return on investment (for advertisers) is better than they get on other platforms like television and print,"" Kelly said. ""As more advertisers shift their dollars to the higher ROI on Facebook, we think growth will continue for years.""Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) is also in the rapid-growth bucket.""Intuitive's robot (system) was starting to catch on in new surgical markets, especially for hernia cases,"" Kelly said. ""They had become widely used for prostatectomies and hysterectomies, but growth there has lagged since their heyday. Our estimate of earnings growth was above the Street's for 2016 and '17 and perhaps '18.""In the current slow-growth economic environment, the managers think their best prospects are companies with fast or steady earnings and sales growth.""We see the best opportunities in newer, faster-growing companies,"" Kelly said. ""We also like consistent growth. We are substantially overweight in newer, faster-growing companies and consistent growers, and we are underweight in cyclicals.""Still, the managers -- Clark Winslow and Patrick Burton also run the fund -- don't hibernate during markets that tilt away from their strategy. ""We took advantage of the broader pullback in the market in the spring,"" Kelly said. That's when the fund started its position in Intuitive Surgical.Also, the fund increased its stake in UnitedHealth, another top-10 holding. It was taking market share in the Medicare Advantage and Medicaid markets, said Steve Hamill, health care analyst for Winslow Capital, the fund's subadvisor. And Optum, its health services business, ""has been a tremendous growth business,"" Hamill said. It generates about 40% of UnitedHealth's earnings.Among other holdings, Activision Blizzard's (ATVI) earnings per share jumped 44% and 315% the past two quarters. The company is shifting to online gaming, away from reliance on console-based video games. That boosts margins, Kelly says.""Their next growth will come through e-sports, turning video gaming into a sport with spectators, such that people will go to Madison Square Garden to watch other gamers,"" he said.Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) is a newcomer to the portfolio. The fund began its current stake in the spring. ""Our thesis here is that this is a steady grower,"" Hamill said. ""They're the leading company in orthopedic implants and some related surgical categories.""Fundamentals slid after the merger of Zimmer and Biomet, which closed in June 2015, due to redundant sales forces and other inefficiencies, Hamill says. But now the company has cut costs. And surgeons like Zimmer Biomet's products, Hamill adds.Earlier this year, many Wall Street analysts expected the company to continue to lose share, especially in the hip and knee markets. ""We think they will grow at least as fast as the market,"" Hamill said. He thinks the company's growth will be even better in the spine and trauma markets. Revenue growth and margin expansion will be key drivers, he adds.The fund's institutional shares (MLAIX) carry no load and a 0.74% expense ratio.

118,ISRG,"A handful of new highs involved breakouts Wednesday, giving bullish investors some buy candidates.Caterpillar (CAT) broke out from a shallow, base-on-base pattern. Volume was 111% above average. The move was good enough for a 52-week high, but the stock still could be facing some overhead supply from a decline that began in July 2014.Analysts expect Caterpillar's earnings to drop 30% this year and then rebound 1% in 2017. That might not be enough of a turnaround to attract disciplined investors.A base-on-base pattern often forms in response to a shaky market. A stock fails to gain at least 20% from the breakout and then consolidates. The second consolidation often sketches the lowest of its pattern atop the highs of the previous pattern. If the market turns more bullish, the base on base can deliver big gains.June 2015 initial public offering Mindbody (MB) broke out from a cup base as the stock marked a new high. Two drawbacks cast a shadow on the stock. First, daily average dollar volume is $6 million, putting the stock on the thin side. Second, the pattern is third stage.Why is third stage a problem? As a stock rises, it pauses to consolidate. Breakouts from the first two bases are more likely to work than those from a later base.Mindbody develops software for the health sector.Worthington Industries (WOR) broke out of a base-on-base pattern in volume almost triple its usual pace. The pattern is second stage. Worthington is a steel processor.Tucow (TCX) broke out in volume more than 300% above average. The pattern could be seen as a cup with handle or as a cup within a larger consolidation. The stock is thinly traded. Tucow provides internet and telecom services.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) continues to flirt with a breakout. The stock has sketched a base-on-base pattern but hasn't been able to break out.

120,ISRG,"""To make money, buy some good stock, hold it until it goes up, and then sell it,"" said Will Rogers. ""If it doesn't go up, don't buy it.""In his own way, Rogers pointed out one of the fallacies of the ""buy low, sell high"" investment myth. How low is low? How high is high? Without parameters, you're flailing about in the dark.But Rogers started out right: Buy some good stock. What's ""good""?You probably already know. Outstanding earnings and sales growth in recent quarters and over the past three years. Solid accumulation by institutions. Sweet margins and return on equity. And a new product or service that takes the country by storm.What does ""buy low"" mean to you? That's bargain-hunting. Some investors do well by this approach, but they don't end up with Apple (AAPL) or Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), two major winners that initially broke out at high share prices, then kept going higher.More likely, a bargain-hunting approach would lure you into buying someone else's problems. Dated technology, a waning customer base, stiffer competition, patent expirations, or — worst of all — a world that had moved on without your ""bargain"" company.You'll pick up some out-of-favor airline stock. Or solar energy. Sure, maybe it's the future, but right now those stocks are deep in the toilet.Are you afraid to pay the higher price-earnings ratios? Those are the real bargains. This is buy-high, sell-higher. And this is how you end up with the great winners.Look at Baidu (BIDU), China's leading search engine. Baidu was in the lead of every market uptrend from 2006 through 2011.At the bottom of its first base, the stock traded at a split-adjusted 4.44 in February 2006 (1) (monthly chart is shown). At the time, the P-E ratio was still near 100. But when it finished a long, deep base and broke out to 52-week highs in May 2007, the P-E contracted to a still-high 69 (2). Baidu rallied 220%, then went into a correction.At the worst of the panic selling of 2008 (3), Baidu fell to 10.05 per share — for a P-E ratio of 24. But the P-E rebounded as the stock formed new bases and hit new highs.So we can see that P-E ratios can fall, as a company's earnings catch up with optimistic projections. Remember, too, that P-Es can rise along with the stock's price as it breaks out and builds big gains.(Editor's Note: This column originally published in the March 23, 2012, edition of IBD.) 
"
121,ISRG,"The conventional wisdom sometimes advises caution when boldness is required. For example, when a stock gaps up out of a base, it's natural to think it's too late to buy.You'll hear remarks like this: ""You should've bought it last week. After today's big gain, it's way too late to buy.""That kind of thinking paralyzes many investors.If IBD was about momentum investing, then the too-late argument would be valid. The investor who buys a junky or mediocre stock simply because of a big price gain is assuming more risk than is prudent.Sometimes you'll see a stock with weak fundamentals notch a big gap-up gain, often within a sloppy base. Those moves seldom hold up.That's not too surprising: If a stock has weak fundamentals, there's no reason to buy it.But what if certain conditions are met? What if the market is in a confirmed uptrend? What if the stock has strong fundamentals and its industry group is a market leader? What if the stock breaks out of a base in heavy volume?If those conditions are met, then the huge gap-up gain is one of the least risky stocks you can buy. Yes, it's counterintuitive to think you should buy a stock that you could've bought much cheaper a day earlier. But that's exactly what you should do.Let's consider a few examples. (Gains were calculated from the closing price of the gap-up rather than the ideal entry that the stock skipped.) In each case, the market was in a confirmed uptrend.A year after its IPO, MasterCard (MA) gapped up 10% on May 2, 2007, clearing a saucerlike base (1). Volume was 556% above average (2). In 2-1/2 months, the stock rose an additional 38% (3). The Composite Rating was 90 on the day before the breakout.The next day, Green Mountain Coffee Roasters gapped up 9% in huge volume. The stock rose 79% further in three months. The Composite Rating was 95.On July 20, 2007, Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) gapped up 32%. Surely, this was too much to consider a buy. Not at all: The stock advanced an additional 71% in three months. The Composite Rating was 96.Priceline Group (PCLN) gapped up 22% on Aug. 8, 2007, after a quiet trip to its 50-day line. The stock rose 52% further in four months. The Composite Rating was 98.(Editor's Note: This column originally published in the Feb. 7, 2012, edition of IBD.

123,ISRG,"Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), a maker of robotic-surgery systems, late Tuesday posted Q2 earnings and revenue that handily beat Wall Street expectations, sending shares rising after hours.Earnings per share minus items rose 23% from the year-earlier quarter, to $5.62, while sales rose 14%, to $670 million.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected $4.97 and $640.7 million.The maker of da Vinci surgical systems, for minimally invasive surgery, didn't provide guidance in its earnings release. Analysts expect EPS ex items this quarter of $5.16, down 1.5%, on sales of $647.5 million, up 10%.Intuitive Surgical stock was up nearly 5% in after-hours trading, after the company released its results. Shares rose a fraction in Tuesday's regular session, to 671.90. Intuitive stock hit an all-time high of 681.59 on July 11, after moving out of a flat base at a 654.98 buy point on June 23. So, shares remain within buy range.Da Vinci's success has spawned more competition. Alphabet's (GOOGL) Verily unit, formerly Google Life Sciences, has teamed with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) on advanced surgical robots. Early Tuesday, J&J posted a Q2 earnings beat, and Johnson & Johnson stock hit a record high Tuesday, closing up 1.7% at 125.25. Medtronic (MDT) made a big move into this field with its acquisition last year of Covidien.The company said the number of da Vinci procedures rose nearly 16% in Q2 vs. Q2 2015, while it shipped 130 da Vinci systems vs. 118 in Q2 2015.In a pre-earnings research note, Leerink analyst Richard Newitter said Intuitive was increasingly benefiting from the ""next leg of growth"" for its da Vinci Xi system, launched in 2014.

124,ISRG,"Buyers maintained the upper hand in late-afternoon trading Wednesday, with the Dow Jones industrial average poised for its ninth straight gain. Dow component Microsoft (MSFT) gapped up to the top of long consolidation on strong earnings.Facebook (FB), meanwhile, broke out of a base with a 121.18 buy point ahead of its earnings report next week. But Facebook volume was slightly below average, signaling a lack of institutional buying.The Nasdaq gapped up at the open, helped by several strong earnings reports. It was the clear leader, up 1.1% with about one hour left to go in the session. The S&P 500 added 0.5%, and the Dow rose 0.3%.

131,ISRG,"While many medical stocks have been having a tough year, makers of medical devices and systems have been popular lately, especially large-cap names that offer stability in uncertain times. This week some of the biggest names will show whether their Q2 performance justifies investors' trust.Reporting late Tuesday, robotic-surgery specialist Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) is expected to continue its recent growth rebound, though at a slower pace as year-over-year comparisons have been made tougher by a strong 2015. Analysts currently expect both earnings and sales to grow 9% over the year-earlier quarter, after growing 24% and 12%, respectively, in Q1.In a July 15 preview of the second half of the year, Leerink analyst Richard Newitter wrote that he'll be watching the continued uptake of the da Vinci Xi surgical system, whose 2014 launch helped Intuitive Surgical turn around after a rough couple of years.""Importantly, we see Intuitive Surgical at a turning point as it transitions to its next leg(s) of growth (general surgery, outside-U.S. expansion) -- amid stabilization in urology/gynecology franchises -- and increasingly begins to benefit from the Xi new product cycle,"" Newitter wrote.Intuitive Surgical's stock hit an all-time high of 681.59 on July 11, after moving out of a flat base in June. Intuitive rose fractionally to 670.54 on the stock market today.On Wednesday morning, medical-device titan Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and the company it's in the process of acquiring, St. Jude Medical (STJ), are both due to report earnings. Both companies have struggled in the growth department in recent quarters, but St. Jude's top line has been accelerating: from 1% in Q4 to 8% in Q1 and an estimated 10% in Q2. Abbott, which did not grow at all the previous two quarters, is expected to report single-digit percentage growth on both the top and bottom lines.The global footprint of both companies hit them with foreign-exchange headwinds, which RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro expects to continue in the Q2 report.""Given a stronger U.S. Dollar, especially against several emerging-market currencies, we are lowering our 2016 sales forecast (for Abbott) by $55 million to $20.7 billion (up 1% reported, up 4% constant currency),"" Novarro wrote in a July 11 preview note. ""Despite the greater FX headwind for 2016, we would expect management to reaffirm its 2016 revenue guidance (up low-single digits reported, up mid-single digits constant currency) and EPS guidance range.""Abbott has also said it would buy diagnostics company Alere (ALR) for $5.8 billion, but the closing has been in doubt since the company has admitted to accounting problems. Last week Alere reported preliminary 2015 and Q1 financials, leaving some analysts to believe the deal will go through. They will no doubt be interested in what Abbott's management has to say about this on the conference call.Abbott shares shaved off a penny to close the day at 42.09. St. Jude shares inched up 7 cents to 80.56. Alere slipped 0.8% to 43.26.IBD'S TAKE: Medical device stocks have lately been a mainstay of IBD's Big Cap 20, stocks chosen for strong potential gains without the volatility of smaller growth stocks. See who else is on the Big Cap 20 list.Finally, late Thursday orthopedics giant Stryker (SYK) is set to report a Q2 of modest but accelerating growth, with an estimated 15% sales rise that would be the highest since 2011. Stryker's been having a gangbusters 2016, with its stock up more than 30% and an IBD Composite Rating putting it in the top 6% of all stocks.""Stryker has been growing its top line in the 5.0%-6.0% range for the last couple of years, and we see this momentum continuing over the next several years, as U.S. reconstructive volumes are stable, U.S. hospitals' capital spending is stable, and recent tuck-in acquisitions should drive faster sales growth than the corporate average,"" analyst Novarro wrote in a preview note Friday, in which he raised his estimates and his price target on Stryker. ""Furthermore, the company is gaining share in each of its core segments (Orthopedics, MedSurg, and Neurotechnology/Spine).""Styker stock ended trading down 0.4% to 121.62.

143,ISRG,"Varian Medical Systems (VAR) got a mostly favorable reception from Wall Street Tuesday after it announced late Monday that it's spinning off its imaging-components business into a separate company.Varian said that it will complete the spinoff by year's end through a tax-free distribution that will turn the imaging unit into a stand-alone company. The business is ""fundamentally different"" from Varian's core business in radiation oncology, Varian CEO Dow Wilson said in a statement, so the two will be better off apart. Varian said that it will incur $35 million in charges but financial guidance for this year is otherwise unchanged.Varian's management said the spinoff will bring $20 million in ""dis-synergies"" for the remaining company, mostly through increased general and administrative expenses, but that after a couple of years this should be offset by a combination of cost-cutting and service agreements between the two companies.RBC Capital Markets analyst Brandon Henry gave a thumb's up and raised his price target on Varian stock to 88 from 85, while affirming a sector-perform rating.""Varian's Imaging Components business has weighed on the company's topline growth for the last five quarters,"" Henry wrote in a research note, citing slowing customer demand along with competitive and pricing pressures. ""However, we expect Imaging Components to return to low-single-digit year-over-year growth in fiscal year 2017.""Varian's revenue growth has been stuck in single digits for the last four years, and in the most recent quarter was flat. Henry sees the spinoff as an opportunity for the remaining company to broaden its reach in the cancer market.""We do not expect any transformational M&A, as management likes to keep a relatively conservative balance sheet,"" he wrote. ""However, we expect slightly more topline growth going forward to be from tuck-in M&A than in the past.""Varian stock finished trading up a fraction to 83.37 on the stock market today. The stock holds a decent IBD Composite Rating of 76, helped partly by being in the highest-ranked of all the medical groups, Systems & Equipment, which currently stands at No. 19 in IBD's ranking of 197 industry groups. Top stocks in the group include Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), Masimo (MASI) and Cantel Medical (CMN).

146,ISRG,"For clues about ways to fight the current up-and-down market, take a look at the investment strategy of mutual funds that have outperformed over the long haul.The $8 billion American Century Ultra Fund (TWCUX) beat 66% of its large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. over the past 52 weeks going into Friday. Over the past three years, the fund's 11.38% average annual gain topped 80% of its peers, which averaged 9.48%, while the S&P 500 averaged 10.41%.The fund seeks highly profitable companies that look poised to keep growing. It aims for large, industry-leading companies that have sustainable accelerating earnings growth and positive price momentum.Where does the fund expect the best odds of finding such companies? A look at the fund's portfolio weightings offers a clue: As of March 31, managers Keith Lee, Michael Li and Jeff Bourke had their key overweights in the information technology and health care sectors. In tech, the fund was finding opportunities in Internet software and services, IT services and communications equipment.The fund's top 10 holdings reflect that tilt toward tech and health care. Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB) were the top four as of Feb. 29. The top 10 also included health care names UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Celgene (CELG).Social networking giant Facebook is still in a buy range from a 117.09 buy point after gapping up April 28 on strong earnings.Its recent action in the stock market is not perfect. Its IBD Accumulation/Distribution Rating has improved to a C- from a worst-possible E, but the weak rating is still a sign of more recent selling than buying by mutual funds over the past 13 weeks.But earnings-per-share growth has sped up, going from 16% four quarters ago to 33%, 46% and 83% in the past three frames, respectively.And the stock's IBD Composite Rating is a solid 99. The Composite Rating combines IBD’s five performance ratings, including EPS and Relative Strength ratings, with 99 being the highest.Managed health-care services provider UnitedHealth's EPS rebounded to 17% growth in the most recent stanza after falling 15% in the previous quarter.Shares are up 13% over the past 52 weeks, even after falling nearly 1% on Thursday as a federal judge ruled that the Obama administration is unconstitutionally spending federal money to fund ObamaCare.Shares of many key health care stocks went down after the decision. U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer's ruling was a win for House Republicans who brought the legal challenge. The government was slated to pay $175 billion over 10 years to health insurers, lowering copayments for lower-income people.Robotic surgical system developer Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) is a health care name that was unharmed by the ObamaCare ruling. Shares rose nearly 1% on Thursday. They're up more than 28% over the past 52 weeks.The stock's EPS grew a respective 34%, 20% and 24% over the past three quarters.Bank of America/Merrill Lynch recently said Intuitive was one of 16 S&P 500 stocks that could soon start paying a dividend. It cited the company's low debt compared with its industry, at least 2% of its market cap coming from cash, a stable earnings trend and EPS growth the prior fiscal year, as well as growth expected in the current year.

148,ISRG,"When it rains, grab an umbrella. The managers of $799 million Oppenheimer Discovery Mid Cap Growth Fund (OEGAX) are applying that adage about finding shelter in a storm to their mutual fund.Amid a blah macroeconomic environment, they've been betting that the few companies capable of generating superior growth will be increasingly attractive to investors. Those are the stocks they are aiming for, according to their March 31 commentary.Hasbro (HAS), the world's second-largest publicly traded toy company, was a key contributor to fund performance in the first quarter. It was helped by holiday-season sales of toys based on the big success of ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens,"" a film that was released in December.Q4 sales rose 13% as earnings per share climbed 14%. Hasbro has quickened its pace. Q1 revenue rose 16%, driving an 81% EPS surge. EPS have grown three quarters in a row.Shares are up 29% so far this year, going into Friday.The stock has a 2.4% dividend yield. And it as a 99 Composite Rating from IBD.The stock got powerful free advertising in recent days. Texas mom Candace Payne donned a mask depicting ""Star Wars"" character Chewbacca that emitted the Wookiee’s trademark growl every time Payne opened her mouth. A video of Payne laughing hysterically as the mask growled -- dubbed ""Happy Chewbacca"" -- was posted on Facebook (FB), drawing over 140 million views as of Tuesday.As IBD reported, Piper Jaffray said the video could drive sales of 1 million units or more of the $30 mask, generating 2 to 3 cents of near-term EPS for Hasbro.Kohl's (KSS) posted a video of Payne and her family, further promoting Hasbro products.Then Payne appeared on CBS’ (CBS) ""The Late Late Show,"" recreating her viral video hit, with host James Corden and ""Star Wars"" director J.J. Abrams also wearing the Hasbro-made masks.The highest Comp Rating is 99. The Comp Rating combines IBD’s five performance ratings, including EPS and Relative Strength ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a high Comp Rating.Seven of the fund's top 10 holdings as of March 31 had Comp Ratings of 80 or higher. So did eight of the fund's 10 top new buys.Trading around 256, top-10 holding Acuity Brands (AYI) is extended from an earlier entry at 225.28 and from an alternate entry at 242, as IBD's markets team points out. The stock has a 98 Comp Rating and a dividend yield of 0.2%.
"
149,ISRG,"It's now working on a new flat base with a 260.93 buy point. Its Accumulation/Distribution is neutral at C, but the rating is offset by a strong up/down volume ratio.The supplier of lighting products is seeing strong demand. On April 6, Acuity reported earnings per share in the February-ended fiscal second quarter of $1.80 a share, up 53% and nicely above analysts' consensus estimate of $1.51. Sales rose 26% to $777.8 million. Analysts were modeling $752.3 million.Ulta Salon (ULTA), another top holding, is up 14% so far this year.
"
150,ISRG,"Ulta has a 99 Comp Rating.In after-hours trading, Ulta jumped 7% after the big-box cosmetics retailer reported that fiscal Q1 profit rose 39% to $1.45 a share on a 24% increase in sales to $1.07 billion. Wall Street was looking for $1.29 in per-share profit on $1.03 billion in revenue. EPS grew 22%, 22% and 27% in the previous three quarters.Ulta, which rose 1% to a new high during the regular session, has climbed out of buy range following a March breakout past a 188.58 buy point.Previously, the beauty segment has been lauded as Amazon (AMZN)-proof by analysts who cite the strength of Ulta and Sephora’s loyalty programs and the fact that customers like to sample cosmetics in-person.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), a top new buy, is suturing up gains within the medical sector. The company is debt free.After EPS shrank in all four quarters of 2014 and grew just 1% in Q1 2015, it has grown at a double-digit pace in four frames since then. Revenue grew 7%, 12% and 12% the past three stanzas.Intuitive Surgical was not hurt by a May 12 U.S. District Court ruling that, if upheld, would bar government payments of billions of dollars to insurance companies participating in ObamaCare, enabling the insurers to reduce customers' out-of-pocket costs, such as deductibles for low-income people.Shares of many insurance-oriented health care stocks went down after the decision.Ronald Zibelli Jr. took the fund's helm on June 5, 2007. Justin Livengood has been on the job with him since early 2014. The fund is an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards winner among midcaps for outperforming the S&P 500 over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods ended Dec. 31.The fund's 7.36% average annual gain over the decade going into Thursday ranks in the top 35% of its midcap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. Its peers averaged 6.81% and the S&P 500 averaged 7.36%.Over the past three years the fund outperformed 86% of its peers. So far this year, its 0.30% loss tops 44% of its direct competitors.

"
154,ISRG,"Look out, index huggers! The stock market is shifting in a direction that favors active managers and stock pickers, says T. Rowe Price fund manager Ann Holcomb. That should boost prospects for the stock mutual funds she helps run, whose portfolio holdings include leading stocks like Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), Red Hat (RHT) and Mastercard (MA). Two of her funds have already done well in a variety of past markets, having outperformed the S&P 500 in calendar 2017 as well as over the three, five and 10 years ended Dec. 31.Only 10% of U.S. diversified stock funds with at least $100 million in assets pulled off that four-for-four feat, which makes them winners of the 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner.The market is rotating to the benefit of active managers and stock pickers because of heightened volatility, says Holcomb, one of three managers of $635 million T. Rowe Price Capital Opportunity (PRCOX) and its institutional clone, $654 million Institutional U.S. Structured Research (TRISX).Holcomb's funds bear an additional distinction. While Holcomb and her co-managers Jason Polun and Tom Watson oversee the portfolios and keep their eyes on the big picture, T. Rowe Price lets a team of some 30 analysts make buy and sell decisions for the fund. Each analyst runs his or her own sleeve, or segment, of the portfolio. It's like a professional sports team. Coaches oversee the team, but it's the players who score and play defense. Delegating that much responsibility to analysts is rare in the stock mutual fund world.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseHolcomb, who is 46 years old, discussed the funds' investment approach with IBD from her office in Baltimore, Md.IBD: How does the market environment impact Capital Opportunity?Holcomb: We've had years of low volatility, high correlations (among stock performances) and compressed dispersion. That's challenging for stock pickers. There's no extra reward for good stock picking if all stocks move together.But now, volatility is increasing and correlations are going down. That should continue as interest rates rise. That helps active managers in addition to stock pickers. They're the ones who can take advantage of mispricing vs. underlying stock values that our analysts discover.IBD: Why do rising rates cause that dispersion?Holcomb: They're not necessarily the cause, but they help. Companies that have been supported by free or low-cost money now get (somewhat) taken out of the market. High quality companies take market share.IBD: Your two funds are the only T. Rowe Price portfolios that let analysts make buy-sell decisions. Why use that approach? Is it because 30 minds are better than three?Holcomb: It was the idea of our current CEO, Bill Stromberg, when he became director of research in the late 1990s. Our analysts are experts. Bill wanted to showcase their stock picking by having them manage a portfolio within a risk-controlled framework. We limit how much their industry and sector weights deviate from the S&P 500.IBD: What's left for you portfolio managers to do?Holcomb: We have what we call an oversight committee. It consists of the named PMs and portfolio specialist Jennifer Martin. We decide which analysts join the team. We also look at how much of the S&P each analyst covers.We monitor the overall profile of the portfolio daily. This comes in the form of risk monitoring, looking at components of active risk, any tilts that develop in terms of looking more growthy or valuey. We're also analyzing the analysts' performance.We're also ensuring that there is consistency between their positioning in this portfolio and what they advocate (for other funds). We engage with our large, institutional clients as well.Also, we manage a monthly rebalancing process in which any positions that are outside our risk limits are brought back in line.IBD: Intuitive Surgical has been volatile since November. But it's in a long uptrend. What's driving that?Holcomb: Its fundamentals continue to improve. Analysts have raised their estimates. When companies deliver like that, sometimes it takes time for the market to catch up.We've had a big position for some time. Our analyst Jon Wood has a very favorable view. It's a bet on computer assisted robotic surgery, a bet that it becomes more mainstream. It's been adopted in urology and gynecology. Our analyst sees it being used more in general surgery.IBD'S TAKE: Learn why Intuitive Surgical hit a record high after reporting first-quarter results.IBD: The fund has trimmed its exposure to Red Hat. Do you still like it?Holcomb: Red Hat is the prime beneficiary of the increased use of open source software, driven by cloud computing. They have leadership in Linux. So Red Hat has a strong core, which is successfully expanding into cloud software.Analysts change their positioning for many reasons.... (In trimming the position in) Red Hat, which remains overweight in the fund relative to its weight in the S&P 500, analyst Ken Allen used it as a source of funds to reduce his underweight in Oracle (ORCL) (due to) the analyst's view that its prospects are improving.IBD: You hold Mastercard as well as Visa (V). Do you like one more than the other?Holcomb: They are largely doing the same thing. Looking at Mastercard, our analyst Jon Friar sees it as a sustainable mid- to high-teens earnings per share grower. Both companies benefit from the movement of payments from cash and checks to electronic. They have high incremental margins, pricing power and strong free cash flow conversion.With regard to Mastercard, they have a willingness to invest in next generation products, such as their acquisition (last year) of (U.K.-based payments technology company) Vocalink.Mastercard has a very attractive business model, with high barriers to entry.IBD: Why has the fund trimmed its stake in PayPal (PYPL)?Holcomb: Our analysts prioritize within their own sleeves. Our PayPal thesis has been that it can materially outperform due to monetizing their Venmo asset, or using their balance sheet to buy back shares or for some accretive M&A or if they have some core business surprises.Our trim in PayPal was because its valuation was not as attractive as some other names. We used it as a source of funds for those more attractive names. But, long-term, we see some PayPal characteristics that can still be in play, so it's still in the portfolio.IBD: Earnings per share growth in SVB Financial (SIVB) has accelerated for five quarters in a row. What's your thesis for this stock?Holcomb: Generally, SVB does well heading into a Federal Reserve (money) tightening cycle like the one we're in, and the market has not fully valued its deposits strength. We're looking at the potential for it paying a dividend. Usually, paying a dividend opens your investor base. So we started a position in March.IBD: Which do you prefer with S&P Global — its index business or its ratings business?Holcomb: It does have a lot of businesses. It is a compounder. It should grow earnings per share at a double-digit pace. It should improve its margins through cost cutting and price increases.Its ratings business has a market-leading share. And it is returning capital to shareholders.Also, its tax rate fell with implementation of tax reform.After the financial crisis, regulation of its space increased, but that just made it more difficult for competitors to get into their business, deepening the moat around their business.Like PayPal, Red Hat and Mastercard, S&P Global is a leader that is pulling further ahead of rivals.They're also shifting to a recurring revenue model, which makes their financials less lumpy and can lift their valuation. About 75% of their revenue is recurring vs. less than 60% five years ago.IBD: What's your thesis for Salesforce.com (CRM)?Holcomb: It pioneered SaaS (software as a service) applications. It remains by far the biggest company in that market. It benefits from a large ecosystem of software, hardware and IT services partners to make its products more valuable and make its market position even larger. And they're another company with a recurring revenues model.IBD: How does Diamondback Energy (FANG) fit into a growth portfolio?Holcomb: Well, we're a core portfolio with exposure to all S&P 500 sectors, including energy. Diamondback is one of the leading operations in the Permian Basin, where they've got a lot of low-cost acreage and can grow production faster with better results than a lot of competitors.They have low financial leverage, and their execution over the last several quarters has been excellent.IBD: Give me an example please of a play that is not part of the S&P 500.Holcomb: Worldpay (WP) is one. They're a combination of merchant acquirer and payments processor. This was Vantiv (until its takeover of Worldpay early this year). It has the best collection of assets among public merchant acquirers, and should grow earnings per share at a mid-double-digit pace for an extended time.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE THESE:Want To Be A Millionaire?

Last week, PayPal agreed to buy Sweden's iZettle for $2.2 billion. That would be its biggest acquisition since being spun off by eBay (EBAY).Potential new investors have balked at PayPal's high level of stock-based compensation, according to Morgan Stanley analyst James Faucette.Health care is another sector where the managers find a lot of growth stories. The fund's overweight in health care vs. its Russell 1000 Growth Index benchmark was its second largest overweight as of March 31.""Valuations of drug and medical supplies companies have corrected, and we see opportunity where earnings growth is driven by innovation,"" the managers said in their commentary. ""Despite potential measures to control drug pricing, drug pipelines are robust, with ample clinical trial readouts.""A maker of cardiac pumping devices, Abiomed is another stock with IBD's best-possible Composite Rating of 99. Trading around 390, shares are extended from a 304.38 buy point in a late-stage base.The stock ranks No. 1 in IBD's medical-products industry group.

188,ISRG,"Major stock indexes were spooked in the early going Wednesday on news China thinks U.S. debt is less attractive than other asset classes at the moment. That fueled speculation that the world's second-largest economy could start to slow down bond purchases.But the Nasdaq composite recovered, down 0.3% in late afternoon trading, after a 0.7% intraday drop. The S&P 500 gave back 0.2% and the Dow Jones industrial average eased 0.1%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking close to Tuesday's levels in the stock market today.After jumping 7 basis points Tuesday to 2.55%, the 10-year Treasury yield got close to 2.60% Wednesday but was back near 2.55% in late trading.Financials led the IBD 50 higher as Essent Group (ESNT), Leaderboard name SVB Financial (SIVB) and Grupo Supervielle (SUPV) showed gains of around 2%.Department store operators were among the top performers.

Still, Workday's price action is bullish as it cleared the 110 level.Elsewhere, Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) gapped out of a cup-shaped base with a 405.15 buy point, rising nearly 7% to 423.97, after the company announced bullish Q4 preliminary results.

Earnings are estimated at $1.66 a share, up 6%.Despite its muted growth, Johnson & Johnson stock hit a record high of 110.40 in trading Friday (closing the day at 110.18, up a fraction), and has maintained an IBD Relative Strength Rating in the 80s for the last six weeks.The mood on Wall Street going into the quarter seems bullish. Late Thursday, RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro raised his estimates based on his reading of drug-prescription and foreign-exchange trends.""IMS (IMS) script trends for several key drugs suggest another strong pharma quarter in 1Q (+9% year-over-year ex-FX and Olysio),"" Novarro wrote. (Olysio is a hepatitis C treatment.) ""Additionally, our analysis of currency movements since the beginning of the year suggests the negative FX impact on full-year results should be less than initially expected.""Novarro noted that one likely topic of conversation on the conference call will be this month's FDA approval of Pfizer’s (PFE) Inflectra, a biosimilar version of J&J's blockbuster immunology drug Remicade.• Robotic-surgery specialist Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) is due to report after the close Tuesday. Analysts estimate that its Q1 earnings rose 21% over last year's Q1 to $4.33 a share, with sales up 11.5% to $593 million.Intuitive Surgical has also been a top-performing stock lately, as the company has been making a comeback financially with the rollout of its da Vinci Xi surgical system and improving procedure growth. Intuitive Surgical stock hit a new high of 630.67 on Wednesday, up more than 15% this year, and boasts an excellent IBD Composite Rating of 98. It closed Friday at 624.22.""Heading into 1Q, the key question for investors is whether the stock is baking in too much optimism or is this the start of a new product cycle,"" Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Kumar wrote in an email to clients Friday. ""We expect procedure volumes to be healthy, with growth in general surgery leading the way (extra day from leap year should also help).""• Similar concerns about an over-optimistic market seem to be dogging orthopedics giant Stryker (SYK), which is due to report after the close Wednesday. The stock has also been on a roll, on Wednesday hitting a new high of 110.40 that was 19% above where it wound up last year. Shares closed Friday at 109.80.Stryker stock kept climbing last week even though Robert W. Baird downgraded it to neutral and Barclays resumed coverage at underweight. The latter wrote that Stryker's valuation appears to be full going into its Q1 and that it's facing more competition from a rejuvenated Zimmer Biomet (ZBH).Analysts covering Stryker estimate that sales rose 3.9% in the quarter to $2.47 billion, with earnings up 8% to $1.20 a share.

Intuitive Surgical filed for approval in December.

209,ISRG,"Each of the so-called FANG stocks – Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) – are baring their teeth as they move aggressively to expand market share in their core industries and enter new ones.But which of these tech titans is having the most success in generating continued growth?3-Year Sales GrowthDriven by Mark Zuckerberg’s successful pivot to mobile right as mobile advertising started to skyrocket, Facebook leads the pack in this metric, with a three-year annual sales growth rate of 54%. That’s followed by Netflix (24%), Amazon (22%) and Alphabet (14%).It’s worth noting here that CEO Jeff Bezos said growth in its Amazon Web Services cloud unit is outpacing its e-commerce business and could reach $10 billion in sales this year.3-Year EPS GrowthNetflix edges out Facebook for the top spot in this category with a 75% three-year annual earnings-per-share growth rate, compared to the social media giant’s 71% pace. Alphabet ranks a distant third with a 13% rate.Pre-Tax Profit MarginFacebook (55.6%) and Alphabet (33.1%) dominate the FANG family in terms of annual pre-tax profit margins, with Netflix (2.1%) and Amazon (1.5%) trailing far behind.That high level of profitability is what allows Facebook to make multi-billion dollar bets on Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus VR – as well as invest heavily in mobile advertising and new apps like Facebook Messenger.It also allows Google-parent Alphabet to explore its so-called ‘moon shot’ projects, including Verb Surgical, a joint venture between its Verily unit and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) to develop advanced surgical robotics to compete with Intuitive Surgical (ISRG).Q4 Earnings And Sales GrowthAmazon bounced back with drones-a-blazing in Q4 to deliver a 122% gain in earnings, easily topping Facebook (46%), Alphabet (28%) and Netflix (-30%).On the sales side, Facebook defanged the competition with a 52% increase year-over-year. But Netflix (23%), Amazon (22%) and Alphabet (18%) each posted solid gains.Accumulation/Distribution RatingThe Accumulation/Distribution Rating shows if fund managers and other institutional investors have been heavily buying or selling a stock over the trailing 13 weeks.Netflix, with a B- rating that shows moderate institutional buying, is the only FANG stock that currently gets a passing grade. Facebook and Amazon both have the lowest-possible rating of E, which points to heavy selling over the last three months (i.e., 13 weeks). Alphabet is only a little better – and still gets a failing grade -- with its D+ rating.Composite RatingThe Composite Rating ranges from 1 (worst) to 99 (best) and provides an overall grade for each stock, showing how it stacks up in terms of both technical and fundamental strength against all other stocks on the market.Facebook and Alphabet both earning the highest-possible score of 99, meaning they’re outperforming 99% of other stocks. Amazon’s rating has been moving higher and now stands at 81. Netflix has a decidedly mediocre score of 52.Among Top 5 Stocks In Its Industry Group?IBD Stock Checkup shows the five top-rated stocks within each industry group. Among the FANG stocks, only Facebook (No. 1) and Alphabet (No. 2), both members of the Internet – Content group, earn that distinction.Amazon ranks No. 7 within its Retail – Internet group, with Stamps.com (STMP) and Alibaba (BABA) holding the No. 1 and No. 2 spots, respectively.Netflix comes in at No. 11 among its peers in the Leisure – Movies & Related industry group.Excerpt from IBD Extra Newsletter.Image provided by Shutterstock.

212,ISRG,"In growth stocks, a base is sort of like a mattress. The new, high-quality ones have good bounce and spring. An old mattress tends to lose the strength and support you need for a good night's rest.The late-stage base is like that old mattress. You don't want to be lying on it when it finally gives in.As a growth investor, if you learn to count bases correctly, you will be able to avoid the pitfall of a big loss in what was once a hot-performing stock.A late-stage base could be the third, fourth or even fifth base that appears on the chart. Even a third-stage base can be pushing the envelope. At that point, your stock's uptrend may be getting old.Counting bases is crucial. Even good stocks can peter out and go into a deep correction after finishing just two bases.Which stocks can make a fourth- or fifth-stage base? Perhaps only a handful during a bull market. They are almost always the very best in terms of profit and sales growth, expanding institutional sponsorship, and the quality of their products or services. You can sometimes tell just by scanning their IBD SmartSelect ratings and the strength of the Stock Checkup evaluation. In short, they're the market's longtime leaders.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut you can become complacent. That's often the prelude to a nasty surprise. After all the hard work you've done, sifting for the stock and tracking its price for the moment it breaks out, what a shame it would be to miss this one flaw.Most often the case, most stocks reset their base counts by the end of a nasty bear market, such as the ones in 1990, 1998, 2000-2002 and 2008-2009. At that point, as the new bull emerges, all base counts reset to zero. Everything is fresh and new.There isn't that much difficulty in counting bases. How do you do it?When a stock has broken out, look for a minimum 20% rally from the proper buy point before looking for a second base to emerge. A base-on-base pattern counts as a single base, because the upper base forms before a stock has advanced 20%.IBD research has discovered a second way that a stock can reset its base count in the midst of a long-term market uptrend. A failed breakout can send the stock in a downward spiral. If the stock declines far enough to undercut the most recent base's lowest price, then you can reset the base count to zero.Consider a longtime market favorite, Intuitive Surgical (ISRG).Count the bases: A cup-with-high-handle base appeared in February-July 2004 (1) (the accompanying chart is a monthly; please go to MarketSmith via the link on the home page of Investors.com to view a historical weekly chart); a cup-with-handle in April-July 2005 (2); a double bottom in August-October 2005 (3), which is best seen on a daily or weekly chart; and a vast cup-with-handle from February 2006 through March 2007 (4).That last pattern, the most dramatic, can't be said to have been a failure. The stock tripled from its 118.07 buy point.Now look at the action from December 2007 through April 2008. The robots-in-the-operating-room pioneer formed a five-month cup with handle (5). It broke out in April, reversed lower (6) and ultimately fell apart. The huge decline reset the base count.Let's fast-forward to today. The stock has shown enough strength to actually emerge as a new leader in yet another bull market.Such instances are rare. New bull runs tend to produce a brand-new set of solid winners. But don't ignore the truly great companies that somehow continue to find ways to keep growing and stay at the top of their respective industries.Since the major market bottom in March 2009, Intuitive has become that rare big cap that has become a leader again. While its growth metrics have certainly slowed down, it still succeeded in achieving mild double-digit gains in earnings per share (up 20% in 2015, up 16% in 2016) and revenues (up 12%, 13% the past two years).From July to September 2016, Intuitive created a shallow flat base, then cleared the 240.03 buy point during a three-week rally in heavy volume (adjusted for a 3-for-1 split in October last year). However, the rally lacked oomph, and the big-cap member of IBD's Medical-Systems/Equipment group fell sharply in the fourth quarter of last year, undercutting that flat base's low of 223.50.The base count went back to zero. Yet Intuitive fought its way back up. And Intuitive's breakouts continue to be winners. They include a move out of a four-month early-stage saucer base at 242.49 in  the week ended Feb. 24, 2017. Shares have gained more than 95%.The S&P 500 has climbed only 21% over the same time frame.(A version of this column was originally published in the Dec. 23, 2010, edition of IBD.

Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""This impressive top line was mostly driven by systems (sales), which contributed two-thirds to the revenue beat with systems coming in about 33 above consensus,"" Kumar said in a note to clients. ""The remaining one-third beat came from higher instruments and accessories consumable revenue.""Worldwide, Intuitive shipped 185 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 133 in the year-earlier quarter. The number of procedures performed using da Vinci systems grew 15% on a year-over-year basis, driven by growth in surgical and urologic procedures.The lion's share of growth stemmed from system sales, which increased 46% to $253 million. But the biggest chunk of sales came from instrument and accessory revenue, which grew 21% to $460 million. Service revenue also rose 11% to $153 million.Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure came in at $1,935, which is seasonally strong, Kumar said. The number of procedures in the U.S. grew 14%, though international sales dipped 20%. Investors will likely look for updates on the system's performance in China and Japan, he said.Intuitive didn't offer 2018 guidance.

240,ISRG,"With artificial intelligence now firmly entrenched in many hospital operating rooms, the field of robotic surgery is starting to get competitive.Giant companies like Alphabet (GOOGL), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Medtronic (MDT) are training their sights on Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), the king of robotic surgery companies. But analysts say the booming medical technology segment has lots of room to run.Robotic surgery is an area that could grow by billions of dollars as more machines are used to treat patients. Intuitive commands the space with $3.3 billion in annual sales. Its signature da Vinci robotic surgeons, however, are limited in the types of procedures they handle. The multi-limbed da Vinci can be used in a variety of procedures — including cardiac, colorectal, gynecological, head and neck, thoracic and urologic surgeries — but only as long as they're minimally invasive.How big the market could be is still unclear, yet analysts agree the potential has yet to be tapped. So more players are moving in, and quickly.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""I think investors need to understand that the robotics and AI (artificial intelligence) revolution is happening, and it's touching every sector of the economy,"" said Jeremie Capron, the director of research and managing partner for Robo Global, an index and advisory firm specializing in robotic industry investments. ""This is a technological revolution that investors can't afford to miss.""Analysts say that in March, Auris Health became the first company to pose a formidable threat to Intuitive when its catheter-based Monarch Platform gained U.S. approval. Intuitive will counterpunch by seeking approval for a flexible catheter similar to the Auris device, likely this year, RBC analyst Brandon Henry said in a recent report.Meanwhile, others are working in areas where Intuitive Surgical doesn't have a foothold. Smith & Nephew (SNN) has a robotic assistant for knee replacements. Stryker (SYK) has a robotic joint replacement system. Mazor Robotics (MZOR) and Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) have robotic offerings in brain and spinal surgery. Mazor alone could see around $3 billion in sales just from its systems.But these players have a long way to go to take Intuitive Surgical's throne.In 2005, Intuitive had a market cap of $1.3 billion. Today, it's worth nearly $52 billion. Capron calls Intuitive ""an amazing stock.""""I think the investment community has been scratching their heads trying to figure out the impact of those new entrants for Intuitive Surgical,"" he told Investor's Business Daily. ""We feel pretty relaxed about it. The size is big enough for small players to come in.""Shares of medical tech companies have been relatively insulated from the woes frustrating biotech and pharmaceutical stocks of late. The stocks of medical equipment makers such as Intuitive and Mazor have collectively spiked 15% year to date.Intuitive's ""blowout quarter"" in April helped to spur excitement, Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar said in a recent note to clients. Recent investor days from J&J and Medtronic are helping to drive that frenzy.""Robotic surgery is the topic currently in medtech with a blowout quarter from Intuitive Surgical hinting that the pace of manual-to-robotic transition might be picking up,"" Kumar said. ""The topic of competition elicits various responses from investors.""Intuitive Surgical stock is up 33% this year, after climbing 78% in 2017. Kumar expects Intuitive Surgical's competition to become more apparent over the next 12 to 18 months. Intuitive's da Vinci Surgical System now boasts ""five million patients and counting.""The da Vinci systems are also moving deeper into hernias and are seeing early-stage adoption in bariatrics surgery performed to induce weight loss.Myriam Curet, executive vice president and chief medical officer for Intuitive, noted in an email to IBD that an estimated 82% of prostatectomies in the U.S. are performed via robotic-assisted surgery. The same is true for about 80% of malignant hysterectomies.""General surgery is our fastest-growing specialty, and one where we are still in early stages of adoption for procedures such as ventral and inguinal hernia repair, colorectal and bariatric surgery,"" she said. ""We believe there is substantial opportunity to expand robotic usage in these categories, and we are developing additional tools and technologies to do so.""For the year, Intuitive guided on its first-quarter earnings conference call to 12%-15% growth in the number of procedures performed with its systems this year. That followed what many considered a strong fourth quarter in which recurring revenue — including instruments and accessories for its da Vinci systems — grew 11%. Recurring revenue represents 73% of the sales pie.Still, even Intuitive Surgical sees itself in the early innings and expects robotic surgery to present a huge total addressable market. The number of da Vinci procedures performed each year grew nearly 68% from 2013 to 2017.Among other robotic surgery companies, Intuitive's closest competitor, Auris, doesn't trade publicly. Until recently it was in ""stealth mode,"" Kumar said. But in May the medical technology company signed a commercialization agreement with a division of J&J. The agreement came two months after Auris' Monarch system grabbed approval in the U.S.Monarch is a flexible catheter. Surgeons thread it through a patient's mouth and into the lungs by remote control. Before its approval, investors believed ""credible competitors"" to Intuitive would be years away, Kumar says. But Monarch got approval months ahead of views. Intuitive Surgical plans to seek approval of its own flexible catheter later this year.On its website, Auris says Monarch's first target is lung cancer. Some experts estimate half a million lung biopsies are performed in the U.S. each year. Surgeons could also use flexible catheters in urinary tract procedures, which number roughly 400,000 procedures a year.Intuitive isn't sweating the competition. Auris' chief executive, interestingly, is Frederic Moll, who founded Intuitive Surgical in 1995. Intuitive's current CEO, Gary Guthart, joined the medical technology firm in 1996 and took over as CEO in 2010.""We have built technologies and made decisions about our architecture based on first principles, not by looking over our shoulder at what other people are doing, but by really engaging customers deeply and understanding their clinical needs,"" Guthart said on a recent earnings call.RBC's Henry notes Auris' Monarch has a 25% larger catheter than Intuitive's to allow for its camera. Intuitive sees a benefit in a smaller catheter that can move deeper into the lungs, Henry wrote in a recent report. That would allow surgeons to potentially use it to remove diseased tissue.Meanwhile, J&J has teamed up with Google on a company called Verb Surgical. Analysts are unsure what system the team is creating. They do expect it to enter the robotic surgery market in 2020, though.At the same time, Medtronic is partnered with Mazor. Medtronic also expects its own robotic surgery system to launch in 2020.It's not unreasonable to suggest Intuitive could keep 80% of the market, Evercore's Kumar told IBD. New robotic surgery companies will have to differentiate themselves.""They can't have a straightforward, 'me too' product,"" he said. ""Investors have put a pretty punchy marketable valuation on Intuitive Surgical because we're still in the early stages of this robotic conversation.""But, he added, ""This market is big enough to sustain multiple players.""That's where companies like Mazor and Zimmer Biomet, which makes systems called ROSA, come in. Both have systems that surgeons use in brain and spinal procedures.Like others, Mazor CEO Ori Hadomi says sizing the opportunity for robotic surgery companies is difficult. Surgeons use the $1.1 million Mazor X system in spinal surgeries. The company's Renaissance system can perform spinal and brain surgeries and costs $500,000.Disposable instruments and materials comprised 40% to 60% of Mazor's revenue, Hadomi told IBD. For each surgery performed with the Mazor X, the list price is $1,500 in terms of disposable items. An estimated half a million procedures would generate $750 million.Stakeholders expect spine procedures to grow rapidly.""People are being more and more active,"" he said, meaning they will suffer more injuries and require surgery more often. ""The procedures will become less invasive. The safer the procedures will become, the more patients will be willing and interested to be treated, to be operated on.""The benefits of robotic surgery are plentiful, Hadomi says. Revision surgery — surgery to correct mistakes or tweak prior surgeries — are significantly lower with a robot assisting. The precision of the robot helps to curb potential errors, he says.Last October, Mazor unveiled the results of a 379-patient study. It found a fivefold reduction of complications for surgeries performed with its Mazor robotic surgery technology. Notably, there was also a sevenfold reduction in revision surgery compared with freehand lumbar fusion surgeries.""There's no doubt from the patient's perspective, I would not consider going to surgery without the robot there knowing the chance of going through revision (surgery) is seven times higher,"" he said. Revision surgery is also costly for the hospital, which can face reimbursement hurdles.All agree that robotic surgery won't replace human surgeons. Hadomi likens his system and others like it to ""the toolbox of the surgeon"". These are simply medical technology tools that make operating easier on the surgeon and safer for the patient, he says.The benefits are also growing for investors, says Robo Global's Capron.""What's really exciting is the fact that we are at an inflection point where the technologies that enable robotic surgeries and the price point are attractive,"" he said. ""Now there's a lot of action around J&J and Medtronic. I see that as confirmation that this is a substantial, addressable market.""RELATED:Looking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

242,ISRG,"Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) broke past a buy point on heavy volume and hit a record high Wednesday after ""knocking it out of the park once again"" during its first quarter, an analyst said.Shares of Intuitive jumped 8.2% to close at 471.03 on the stock market today. The stock broke out of a consolidation that began forming in late January with a buy point at 452.10. Intuitive also joined Investor's Business Daily's Leaderboard.All signs point to a strong 2018, Canaccord analyst Jason Mills said in a note to clients.""The firm continues to produce best-in-class results in large-cap medtech, knocking it out of the park once again in the first quarter,"" he said. The lion's share of first-quarter metrics ""all handily eclipsed expectations.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut analysts were more split on procedure growth and expectations. During the quarter, the number of procedures using Intuitive's da Vinci Surgical System rose about 15%. Intuitive cited growing demand for U.S. general surgery and worldwide urologic procedures.In the U.S., the number of da Vinci procedures performed grew 14%. Growth was 18% for the rest of the world. Intuitive raised the bottom line of its 2018 outlook to 12%-15% growth in procedures. Placement of new da Vinci systems in hospitals also was a highlight, growing 46% year over year.""Ultimately, procedure growth should remain the key focus for investors, as procedure volume growth has historically been a leading indicator of additional system placements,"" Mills said.Intuitive expects it's still in the early innings of the large hernia repair market, Mills said. Hernia and general surgery are expected to be the biggest procedure volume bucket.Whereas Mills sees Intuitive as firing ""on all cylinders,"" Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar notes Intuitive didn't raise the top-end of its 2018 outlook for procedure volume. In 2017, procedures grew by 16%, he said in a note to clients.The question comes down to valuation for Intuitive stock, Kumar said. If hospitals are, in fact, purchasing da Vinci systems in anticipation of future procedure demand, then a lofty price/earnings ratio could be justified.""However, given historical comments that procedures are a leading indicator for system placements, procedures coming in-line with expectations would argue against a greater than 40 times price/earnings ratio on capital expenditures revenue beat,"" he said.Maintaining a high valuation also depends on whether Intuitive can maintain its standing as the predominant player in the market, Kumar said. Auris Health recently launched its Monarch Platform for lung biopsy. At the same time, Dow Jones component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Medtronic (MDT) are moving into the robotic surgery market.""Investors are more comfortable paying premium price/earnings ratios for assets perceived as having monopoly power,"" he said. But with other entrants coming, ""one could make a case against the sustenance of this monopoly power.""Bulls may argue that Intuitive has a technological lead on rivals. The debate is likely to come to a head in the next 12 months, Kumar said.In the meantime, Kumar says he is staying on the sidelines. Canaccord's Mills, though upped his price target on Intuitive to 430 from 410, and kept his hold rating.RELATED:How Much Volume Should You Look For In A Stock?Looking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

S&P 500 futures nosed up 0.4%, while Nasdaq 100 futures scratched out a 0.4% gain.Along with IBM, Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), Lam Research (LRCX), railroad CSX (CSX) and United Airlines (UAL) were among the leading names active in early trading.Medical and tech stocks had powered the market Tuesday, as the major indexes seized powerful gains in rising trade. Netflix (NFLX), Goldman Sachs (GS) and UnitedHealth (UNH) posted first-quarter results that all carried elements of upside surprise. Investors sent more stocks to news highs than any session in the past five weeks.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 all climbed above their 50-day moving averages in Tuesday's session. That technical line had presented a possible barrier to the market's week-old uptrend. The test through the remainder of the week is whether the benchmark indexes are able to maintain that new level of support.Among the top tech stocks in early motion, Intuitive Surgical bolted 5.4% higher. The maker of the da Vinci robotic surgical system reported a 25% EPS gain and an 18% rise in revenue for its first quarter late Tuesday. The number of surgical systems shipped soared 39% during the quarter, with procedures performed using the da Vinci system rising 15%.Intuitive's shares rose 4.7% in regular trade Tuesday, the stock's best session since January. Shares are more than two months into a new base, closing Tuesday less than 4% below the potential buy point at 452.10.Lam Research tumbled 6.6% in late action, despite a largely positive fiscal third-quarter report. The chip equipment leader's earnings swept up 71%; revenue jumped 34%. Both were above consensus targets. Q4 guidance also surpassed expectations. Lam is the first chip-sector name to report results during a season in which investors are feeling flighty about chip stocks in general.Lam shares surged 4.3% in Tuesday's regular trade. The stock has been consolidating for nearly six weeks.United climbed 3% in premarket trade. Its first-quarter revenue and earnings squeaked past analysts targets. Second-quarter guidance was positive. The company's quarterly conference call is set for 10:30 a.m. ET today.  United shares are consolidating, but have a long way to go before reaching a valid buy point.On the Dow, IBM dived 4.8% after Tuesday's close. The legacy tech brand posted stronger-than-expected Q1 results, and reported a second straight quarter of year-over-year revenue growth for the first time in more than four years.

Still, the three major indexes held or gained ground above their 50-day moving averages.The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 0.2%.

Both stocks are extended above cup bases.CSX, Intuitive Surgical and Textron all scored gap-up breakouts in the stock market today.CSX was up 7.9% as it broke out past a 60.14 buy point in a four-month-long base. The breakout, fueled by healthy first-quarter results, remains in play: The buy range extends through 63.15. The base is a second-stage pattern, which is good. The stock's relative strength line has been trending higher since February and made a new high from the time the stock was basing.Intuitive Surgical swelled to an 8.2% gain.

249,ISRG,"Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) tumbled Friday after it issued underwhelming 2018 guidance despite beating Wall Street's fourth-quarter sales and adjusted profit expectations late Thursday.X Shares dipped 2.1% to close at 440.24 on the stock market today. Shares earlier toppled as much as 7.3%, making for Intuitive Surgical's biggest intraday decline since early December.RBC analyst Brandon Henry blamed lackluster guidance for the stock plunge. Earlier in the month, Intuitive Surgical pre-announced its fourth-quarter sales and procedures growth, so investors were keyed in on guidance.""Intuitive Surgical's initial 2018 guidance may underwhelm given heightened investor expectations,"" Henry said in a note to clients.For the year, the firm expects procedure growth in the range of 11%-15%, driven by U.S. general surgery and procedures outside the U.S. But the first quarter is expected to be the weakest due to year-over-year headwinds and the timing of Good Friday.""Capital sales are ultimately driven by procedure growth, catalyzing hospitals to establish or expand robotic system capacity,"" said Calvin Darling, Intuitive Surgical's senior director of finance and investor relations, on the earnings conference call.IBD'S TAKE: Intuitive Surgical is a longtime market favorite — it's managed to show enough strength to emerge as a new leader in the bull market. Get more on Intuitive Surgical's history, including stock patterns, by visiting the Investor's Corner.The firm also projected a ""modestly lower"" gross profit margin in 2018 based on higher costs associated with new products. Pro forma operating expenses are seen growing 16% to 18% above 2017 levels. The tax rate is likely to be in the 20%-22% range, down from 22.5% in 2017.""Given heightened investor expectations, we believe Intuitive Surgical's higher-than-expected operating expense growth guidance and slightly lower than expected gross margin guidance may underwhelm,"" RBC's Henry said.But he called the procedure growth and gross margin guidance prudently conservative and noted operating expense growth will allow Intuitive Surgical to continue ""aggressively reinvesting"" in international growth and its technology.Henry raised his 2018 estimate for sales to $3.52 billion, which would be up 12% year over year ""as we expect Intuitive Surgical's accelerated investments to continue to drive topline growth."" He also expects adjusted profit to grow 9% to $9.80 per share, based on higher revenue and a lower tax rate, partially offset by higher operating expense growth.Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar notes Intuitive Surgical has a long runway in replacing older da Vinci Si robotic surgery systems with the new da Vinci X product. This is Intuitive Surgical's ""low end system"" with a price tag of $1.3 million.The da Vinci X launch has been very successful, Kumar said in a note to clients. Many systems were placed in Europe. There are about 2,500 Si systems that could potentially be available for upgrades in the next few years.RELATED:Why This Biopharma 'Behemoth' Could Soon Become AcquisitiveWhy Insurers Haven't — And Won't — Push Back On Rare Disease DrugsCelgene Reverses In Fourth Quarter As Otezla Sales Rebound

250,ISRG,"Robot surgeon-maker Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) topped the Street's fourth-quarter sales and adjusted earnings guidance, but shares fell late Thursday after the firm reported a $318 million expense related to new U.S. tax laws.X In after-hours trading on the stock market today, Intuitive Surgical stock toppled 1.5% after rising 2.8%, to 449.81, in the regular session. Shares broke out of a flat base at 405.15 earlier this month and are now 11% extended from that point.For its fourth quarter, Intuitive reported adjusted profit of $2.54 per share, rising 25% vs. the year-earlier period and topping views for $2.27 a share. Sales advanced 18% year over year to $892 million, beating the consensus estimate for $864 million.But Intuitive also posted a $318 million loss as an income tax expense related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the firm said in a news release.IBD'S TAKE: Intuitive has an IBD Composite Rating of 96 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it performs in the top 5% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. But it's still not ranked first in IBD's Medical-Systems/Equipment industry group. To see which two stocks outrank Intuitive, visit IBD Stock Checkup.During the quarter, worldwide procedures using Intuitive's da Vinci system grew about 17%, driven by growth in U.S. general surgery procedures and worldwide urologic procedures.

253,ISRG,"The stock market is in a confirmed uptrend. But $41.5 billion T. Rowe Price Growth Stock (PRGFX) is still way off its late-2015 high (it's down 10.36% this year going into Tuesday), like a lot of growth-oriented mutual funds. So what's the fund doing to position itself for the future and to resume the outperformance charted by helmsman Joe Fath since he took the tiller a little more than two years ago?After becoming manager in early 2014 and then reshaping the portfolio to reflect his strategy, Fath guided the fund to a 10.85% gain in 2015. That topped 96% of its large-cap growth rival mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. Its peer group averaged a 3.60% gain. The S&P 500 edged up 1.38%.It will be increasingly hard to find growth in 2016, Fath said in his year-end commentary. Durable growers will be crucial to good performance. And he wants to use market volatility to find good growers whose price gets knocked too low -- relative to their long-term prospects.Eight of his top-10 holdings as of Dec. 31 have strong Composite Ratings from IBD of 80 or higher.He's already seeing gains out of names like Ross Stores (ROST). The apparel, accessories, footwear and home-fashions discounter is up 5% since its Jan. 20 low. Trading around 56, shares on Tuesday rose through their 55.74 buy point ahead of the company's after-the-close earnings report. Analysts were expecting a 7% gain for fiscal Q4.

254,ISRG,"After the close, Ross reported a 10% gain in fiscal Q4 earnings to 66 cents a share. That beat analyst expectations, though the company guided lower for fiscal Q1 sales and full-year earnings. Shares continued higher after hours Tuesday.PayPal (PYPL), a top new buy of the fund, is up 5% this year and is up 22% from its Jan. 20 low. Trading near 39, the digital and mobile-payment provider's shares were still in a buy range from an early entry at 38.62.

258,ISRG,"A Day 5 follow-through in both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq on Tuesday gives IBD readers the proverbial ""green light"" to deploy capital in fresh new leaders.Question is, how bright is that ""green light?""Indeed, every IBD-style growth investor should know these two things: 1) not all follow-throughs are the same; and 2) the success and breadth of the breakouts by high-quality stocks ultimately determine the quality of a follow-through.Right off the bat, this new uptrend is hampered by a much smaller pool of stocks that are towering in both EPS and sales growth as well as price strength. The small list of stocks making Inside Your Weekly Review reflects this clearly.Nevertheless, the market's rally can heat up. Spring always follows winter. In 2016, watch to see if a comeback in crude oil prices, better-than-expected fourth-quarter results, or other positive external events help provide a spark.Keep a close eye on how this Weekly Review list changes. Does it grow in size in weeks to come? If yes, that's positive.In the Jan. 22 edition, just 36 names made the stringent screen. Only companies scoring an 85 for both EPS Rating and RS Rating and trading within 15% of their 52-week highs make the cut. The Jan. 15 list showed 37 stocks.A quick scan of today's YWR shows that quite a few different industry sectors get represented, but only by a handful of stocks or less. These companies are true leaders in their specific industry niches.You won't find many stocks hailing from the medical sector in today's list, but Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) (90 EPS, 89 RS) made the grade. It's fallen in recent days, but still trades not so far from a 580 high that it hit in a recent breakout. No one has yet come up with a better system of robotic surgery.Ross Stores (ROST) truly excels in buying excess inventory from department store chains and selling the merchandise at deep discount in a clean, well-lit atmosphere. The stock is not far from a 55.74 handle buy point. Fiserv (FISV), O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) and Public Storage (PSA) also are tops in their fields.

259,ISRG,"With Frank Caruso at the helm since mid-February 2012 -- almost exactly four years -- the $2.7 billion AB Large Cap Growth Fund (APGAX) has topped 98% of its peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. through Jan. 31.The fund notched a 14.55% average annual gain in that time vs. 10.71% for its direct rivals and 12.08% for the S&P 500. It garners an A+ 36-month Performance Rating from IBD, meaning it's performance is among the top 5% of all mutual funds in that time.Lately, the mutual fund has shown it can outperform in ugly markets as well as in beautiful ones. By losing less than its peers and the broad market over the turbulent past three months, the fund ranked in the top 8% of its category. It fell 6.08% last month, a little better than the average U.S. diversified stocks fund's 6.25% decline.Caruso, who is 59 years old, is a member of the AB fund complex, which last year changed its name from AllianceBernstein. Caruso, the lead manager on this fund, discussed with IBD at his Manhattan office how his team invests.IBD: How have you achieved outperformance in bad markets as well as good?Caruso: It's our focus on great businesses, our obsession with the fundamental integrity of holdings and the way we manage risk. Looking at data from March 31, 2012, through Dec. 31, in the 28 up months in that time we were in the 23rd percentile of our peers. In the down months, we were in the 2nd percentile, beating 98% of our peers. The risk-adjusted performance of the portfolio is extremely good.IBD: Business cycles are not your focus, right?Caruso: I don't want people to associate with us any overarching concern about business cycles. We look for consistent performance. That's particularly important in growth stock investing. Companies we want need to have the kind of business that has a long runway to invest those high returns and earn returns in excess of their cost of capital. So it's a combination of persistence and duration that creates and unleashes the power of compounding. Rather than saying we look for high-growing companies, we look for returns and look for that in these really good businesses.IBD: You are looking for companies that can meet your requirements for several years, right?Caruso: Our window is three to five years. For companies in the Russell 1000, you've got a high-teens number of earnings forecasts for this year and next, then it falls off a cliff. As you get fewer estimates three, four, five years out, the variability about forecasts increases a lot. Longer time horizons lead to inefficiency in growth stock investing.IBD: In other words, by having a longer time horizon than most other investors, it's easier for you to find companies that are priced inefficiently?Caruso: It is. Absolutely.IBD: What's a recent example, please?Caruso: Most investors look at Nike (NKE) and see one of the most efficiently priced stocks in the market. But that changes longer-term. What's provocative is that they've been experimenting with new manufacturing technology, a weaving technology. Most people would say Nike's biggest cost is labor. But it's not. It's shipping, tariffs and duties. You can eliminate a lot of those if you localize manufacturing. Weaving technology might let them do that. Instead of (needing a lot of low-paid) workers cutting, banging, stitching, gluing, coloring and packing products, what if they have . . . smaller factories all over the world, decreasing those shipping, tariff and duties costs?So when we model Nike, we can push the profitability up by hundreds of basis points. That gives us confidence in the long term. It informs us about how we might want to behave in the short term if there's volatility.IBD: For a manager who pays little attention to the short term, you're doing well in the short term. Luck or design?Caruso: The fact that stocks go up and down doesn't impact the way we manage the portfolio. Having said that, a year ago we had had good, consistent performance for the last four years. We started to see a lot of risk exposure to momentum (stocks), and we spent the entire year managing that down to more conservative levels. And we have seen reversion to the mean.IBD: In the recent months of volatility, what have you trimmed and what have you added to?Caruso: Part of why we've done well in 2016 is that the market continues to be concerned about earnings, and our portfolio is delivering. But we've reduced our size in excess winners last year and redeployed into more, not defensive, but more edgy, controversial companies that had not been leadership stocks. Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) is one of those names.IBD: Which of the FANGs do you own, and which have you trimmed?Caruso: We don't own Amazon.com (AMZN) or Netflix (NFLX). We have Facebook (FB) and Google (Alphabet (GOOGL)), and haven't trimmed them.We've been more inclined to trim some discretionary stocks. We took profits and reduced positions in Starbucks (SBUX) and Nike because we thought in the moment it was pretty fully valued. But we would welcome an opportunity to build that back through volatility.Disney (DIS) was trimmed. Monster (MNST) and Staples (SPLS) -- which has been a phenomenal performer -- were trimmed.What we've added to: Last summer, we were basically market weight in health care, a little overweight. Those were put through the grinder in late summer, early fall. Into and emerging from that correction, we started increasing our exposure there. We added to Intuitive Surgical last summer. We rebalanced into Biogen (BIIB). We introduced (a position in) Edwards Lifesciences (EW).We did a number of things in tech. We introduced Adobe (ADBE) and Cognizant (CTSH), and we did some adds to longer-term positions, such as ServiceNow (NOW).IBD: Why do you like Intuitive Surgical?Caruso: The company has unbelievable returns. It has $3 billion in enterprise cash and no debt. We’re seeing the utilization of robotics in an ever-increasing number of procedures.For this company to win long-term, we must see more surgeon adoption of robotics, and we’re seeing that. The stock suffered a fair amount of underperformance the past couple of years. But we stuck to our knitting. We added to our stake opportunistically, and we’re starting to see a contribution to fund performance from this stock.IBD: You weren’t in on Facebook’s IPO, but you bought when many others were fleeing. What’s your thesis?Caruso: We were controversial buyers when the rest of the Street was puking it out. We’re proud of that.If you go back to the IPO in the summer of 2012, every banker that bought them had a five-year forecast model -- 2016 was the terminal year. Now their current forecasts are 40% to 60% higher than they were back then. My point is that fundamentals overachievement is really hard to model. But Facebook has potential to drive tremendous excess performance.IBD: Go back to Monster Beverage: Why did you trim it?Caruso: They were on the verge of deploying a lot of capital to be able to sell overseas. Then Coke (KO) took a strategic position in the company. As shareholders, we appreciated before many others that Monster would not have to spend $1 billion to become a global company. They would be able to leverage Coke’s best-on-the-planet global distribution platform. They would get to profits we thought they'd see in 2017-18 in the year 2016.The growth opportunity is increasing exponentially. So the sizing decision was really another one of those Starbucks-type decisions, where these have been unbelievably successful stocks. But the valuations got a little uncomfortable in the short term, so we reduced our exposure. There’s no diminution of our long-term conviction.IBD: You boosted your current stake in Cognizant in between September and November. What’s the attraction?Caruso: They bring a level of expertise in software-as-a-service and mobility solutions to companies that are trying to figure out how to get their IT architecture to the next level.Positioning in key technologies interests us. Cognizant was a stock we talked about at the end of 2013. We stepped away and more recently started to build it back.IBD: Adobe posted earnings-per-share gains for five quarters after suffering EPS declines in seven of the eight prior stanzas. What’s the crux of why things are working?Caruso: They used to put a product in a shrink-wrapped box and sell it. They’ve switched to a subscription model. That allows them to be consistent in how upgrades are managed and deployed. Customers don’t have to wait for upgrades. That model is destined to compress the ups and downs of their business. The lower volatility that results is good from a valuation point of view. And this model lets them manage the risk of piracy in a more head-on fashion. So the long-term value of their subscription model is more attractive than their old model.IBD: Are you among the investors who started to like Alphabet more when the company brought in Ruth Porat as CFO?Caruso: Yes, we became excited when they brought in Porat from Morgan Stanley (MS).Google had a great business, focused on search. But they used cash flow to fund a variety of initiatives that in many cases didn’t appear to make a lot of sense.With the appearance of a strong CFO, we hoped there was finally an adult in the room who would bring financial discipline to the way they thought about allocating capital. So far, she’s done that.Now they’ve got two companies, basically. One is focused on advertising, whether it’s YouTube, which is growing into an economically handsome property, or search.Then you’ve got essentially all of these call options about driverless cars, robotics. They’ve been deploying capital to build out telecom networks in cities. So it’s a portfolio of early-stage companies, some acquired, some nurtured, some ready for prime time, some needing more incubation.The split in the company lets investors have more transparency to properly value the businesses.

260,ISRG,"Medical systems maker and IBD 50 stock Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) beat analysts' Q4 estimates late Thursday, while reporting sales in line with its pre-announcement last week.Intuitive's earnings, excluding one-time items, rose 20% over the year-earlier quarter to $5.89 a share, beating analysts' consensus by 85 cents, according to Thomson Reuters. Consensus, however, had not been updated to reflect Intuitive's preliminary Q4 sales number of $677 million announced the previous week, which was $22 million above Wall Street's estimate. That amounted to a 13% increase over the year-ago sales.For the full year, earnings climbed 20% to $19.28 a share, with sales up 14% to $2.4 billion.Intuitive and its partner Hill-Rom Holdings (HRC) also said that the FDA had cleared the latest accessory to Intuitive's da Vinci Xi robotic surgery system, called Integrated Table Motion. This allows operating-room teams to reposition the table while the robotic arms are docked.Intuitive said it had placed 158 da Vinci systems — both the Xi and earlier versions — in the quarter, up from 137 in Q4 2014. Procedures using the da Vinci systems increased 15%, driven by urologic and general surgery procedures, the company said.Intuitive didn't provide overall sales or EPS guidance for 2016, but said it expects procedures to increase 9% to 12%. On the conference call discussing Q4 earnings, Intuitive executives said that equipment sales will likely be more seasonal than last year, with Q1 being the slowest quarter. Operating expenses were forecast to rise 9% to 13%, with gross profit margins at 68% to 69.5% and a tax rate of 26.5% to 28.5%. Consensus had expected 67.2% gross margins.Intuitive stock was up more than 1% in after-hours trading on the stock market today, after the company released its results. Shares rose a fraction in the regular session, closing at 555.60. It's one of those rare stocks up in 2016 — up by 1.7%. Intuitive stock touched a nearly three-year high of 572.01 on Jan. 13.""While the positive pre-announcement (big revenue beat on systems placements) had taken some of the surprise out of the print, Intuitive Surgical still managed to surprise us on the upside with a massive EPS beat driven by gross margin improvements and impressive operating leverage,"" wrote Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Kumar in an email to clients.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter @IBD_Areeves and on Facebook.

263,ISRG,"Alphabet, the world's Internet search leader, is prospecting beyond its core business to strike success in the health care world.The company's glucose monitoring contact lens for diabetics is inching closer to drugstore shelves, while sales of its $200 self-stabilizing spoon, designed to help people with uncontrollable hand tremors eat comfortably, topped 1,000 in the first six months.Google — which restructured last year to become the largest operating unit within a new parent, Alphabet (GOOGL) — bought biotech company Lift Labs in 2014, just a few months after the health-focused startup began product sales.Pointing to its broadening emphasis on that and other health and medical advancements, Alphabet last month renamed its Google Life Sciences division Verily Life Sciences. The division brings together clinicians and scientists and is focused on understanding and improving chronic conditions that impact massive numbers of people — health issues including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, neurodegenerative disease and mental health.""This is a development in health care that I think is far-reaching and will be long-lasting because we are seeing a period of convergence between the technology companies and the health care companies,"" California Life Sciences Association trade group CEO Sara Radcliffe told IBD.She said changes driving health care and tech firms into partnerships include ""the explosion of Big Data"" and the resulting demand for ways to manage all that patient information.Growth of access to data via the Internet cloud and mobile technologies such as Fitbit (FIT) wearables are ""shifting health care to maintaining and tracking health, rather than simply treating disease,"" she said.Companies Teaming UpRecent notable health-tech partnerships include Alphabet's Verily division teaming up last month with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) to develop surgical robots. That news followed a September 2014 announcement that Google life-science spinoff Calico had entered a 10-year collaboration with North Chicago, Ill.-based pharmaceutical firm AbbVie (ABBV) to research age-related diseases.Verily has another partner, too. Medical device firm Dexcom linked up in Q3 with Verily to create a new class of disposable 24/7 glucose monitoring systems that are faster, cheaper and smaller than the products that are currently available.Johnson & Johnson and Verily announced last year that they had created Verb Surgical to develop a new surgical robotics device that's smaller and less expensive than the Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) da Vinci system, which now controls that minimally invasive surgery segment.Others looking to join forces across the health-tech divide include medical device maker Medtronic (MDT), which is collaborating with Big Data solutions provider IBM (IBM) Watson Health to analyze the waves of information gleaned by diabetes insulin pumps.Data Vs. DiseasesAlphabet is not the only tech heavyweight seeking to blend medical altruism with Big Data and big moneymaking plans. Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and others are also using their deep technology expertise to create medical-related products and services.This year, Apple introduced health-tracking tools that monitor users' footsteps, heart rates and sleep activities. Microsoft and Samsung already offer a number of so-called wearable devices that also allow people to monitor their daily movements.Advances in mobile computing, artificial intelligence and new analytics software are driving their efforts.""In recent years, there has been increased interest in health care applications from companies that traditionally are seen to be consumer-focused companies,"" said Iain Simpson, a drug delivery specialist at Cambridge Consultants. ""Companies such as Google, Apple, Facebook (FB) and Amazon.com (AMZN) have built consumer-focused businesses based on the creation of a compelling and sustainable user experience.""Now, Simpson said, various tech companies are heading into health, driven ""by the increasing relevance of these capabilities in a market which creates new high-value business opportunities for them, particularly when they work in collaboration with established health care players such as pharma and medical device companies.""With U.S. health care spending weighing in at $3.2 trillion in 2015 and projected to reach $5.1 trillion by 2023, according to the California Health Care Foundation, profit potential is an obvious incentive.But other factors are also at work. Part of the reason behind Alphabet's focus on moving the needle on Parkinson's treatment is personal.Google co-founder and now Alphabet president Sergey Brin's mother Eugenia has Parkinson's, and Brin himself was diagnosed in 2006 as carrying a mutation of the LRRK2 gene, which has been associated with higher rates of the degenerative disorder of the central nervous system.""Generally the pace of medical research is glacial compared to what I'm used to in the Internet,"" Brin told Wired in a 2010 interview about how Google could amplify the process. ""We could be looking lots of places and collecting lots of information. And if we see a pattern, that could lead somewhere.""Legislative changes are another factor that has helped open the door for tech firms to put their massive computing muscle into health care.Data-driven medicine is a key element of the Affordable Care Act, the federal law that ushered in President Barack Obama's health care reforms and is a major force at the center of the boom in new health technology.The law provides major financial incentives for doctors and hospitals to prove their care is effective. Those ""value-based"" payment rules are sparking demand for new software that can track and analyze patient data, says Lynne Dunbrack, research vice president at IDC Health Insights.Patients Prescribed SoftwareFor example, Dunbrack said, ""some hospitals are finding it cheaper to send Medicare patients who have congestive heart failure home with a weight scale, an electronic tablet and a connected app rather than risk too many readmissions within 30 days of discharge, which would result in the hospitals getting federal reimbursement rate cuts.""""There have been some real financial incentives for health care organizations to purchase and use these technologies, which is then helping to drive demand, and is why companies are now seeing new opportunities,"" Dunbrack said.Along with the shift to value-based care, other top areas of focus for the health care industry include sequencing the human genome and digitizing health care data, said Cowen and Co. analyst John Blackledge in a September report about Alphabet's health care strategy.All three of those health care trends ""are not occurring in a vacuum, but are being accommodated by technology advances in areas such as social, mobile, analytics and cloud computing. These are all areas of Google's expertise,"" Blackledge said.The swirl of changes and tech advances is also helping fuel medical ambitions of tech heavyweight Apple.At its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in June 2014, Apple introduced a new HealthKit app, which monitors users' heart rates, sleep, weight and blood pressure, among other health-related measurements, and lets home health devices such as heart monitors and fitness monitors exchange data. HealthKit will allow clinicians at the Mayo Clinic to send that health information to a user's app, which can in turn transmit the data to a user's physician.HealthKit is ""a logical extension to Apple's existing products and digital ecosystem keeping users engaged and increasing Apple's App Store business,"" while also keeping ""Apple's products and services relevant in a growing but increasingly competitive consumer health market,"" said Simpson, of Cambridge Consultants.Another Apple tech framework, ResearchKit, lets people who want to remotely participate in clinical medical trials do so using specially-designed apps on their iPhone instead of having to show up in person.In March, Apple displayed apps that it says helps diagnose a range of conditions, from diabetes to heart disease. Apple says it won't see the data transmitted and people can opt out of sharing with researchers if they want. ResearchKit can help address a few problems with medical research in its current state, such as limited patient participation and infrequent data sampling, Apple's Jeff Williams, now chief operating officer, said at the time.About 11,000 people signed up for a single medical study at Stanford University in the first 24 hours after the release of ResearchKit, Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC in March.""To put that in perspective, Stanford has told us that it would have taken normally 50 medical centers an entire year to sign up that many participants. So ResearchKit is an absolute game changer,"" said Cook on the call. ""Discovering and curing some of these diseases will push our life expectancy much longer than it currently is.""Alphabet's Google has its own initiative, called ""Fit,"" which includes developer tools and an online platform for collecting data.Connect with Michele Chandler on Twitter @IBD_MChandler and Facebook.

264,ISRG,"A falling stock market has whittled the Weekly Review down to a fraction of its bull-market self. To make the list, a stock needs Earnings Per Share and Relative Price Strength ratings of at least 85. That's why the list makes up IBD's 85-85 index. In a healthy market, 120 stocks make the cut for publication. But as the market has fallen in recent weeks, not enough stocks are highly enough rated in both categories to fill the list.The list is sorted by industry group, with the highest-ranking groups close to the top. One of the few groups with solid representation is the real estate investment trust group. Six stocks made the cut.Constellation Brands (STZ) makes and distributes beers, such as Corona; wines, such as those made by Robert Mondavi; and spirits, such as those made by Black Velvet.The stock continues to be a winner, trading near all-time highs as it bounces along the north side of its 50-day moving average. It's extended from a base. Remember: Only the first two pullbacks to the 50-day line are safe secondary entries.On Jan. 7, the company reported earnings 15% above those of a year earlier. The stock gapped to a new high that day, but it has since given back that gain.Chuy's Holdings (CHUY) made the cut. It's broken out of a base with a 34.19 buy point but gave back a good part of its gain in recent days. It operates more than 60 Tex-Mex restaurants in 14 states with an ""upbeat, funky, eclectic, somewhat irreverent atmosphere.""The stock has three quarters of good earnings growth, but analysts expect a 7% year-over-year decline in the next report.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) is back among the leaders, reporting accelerating earnings and sales over the past several quarters. The company makes the da Vinci robotic surgical system. The stock built a cup-with-handle base and attempted a breakout Wednesday, but it reversed before the day was out and fell below the buy point.

279,ISRG,"The market is back in an uptrend, but the S&P 500 is still trading below its high from May. It is easy to see eight months of a struggling market reflected in IBD’s blue chip Big Cap 20 list. Fully 14 stocks on the current list qualify as defensive names.Utilities including Southern Energy (SO), Consolidated Edison (ED) and WEC Energy Group (WEC) are defensive because their prices to consumers are generally locked, and customers have little choice but to use the product. Also, the stocks typically offer healthy dividends.Another factor: Utilities are a segment into which mutual funds working to maintain minimum levels of investment rotate into during choppy markets. This demand can hold share prices steady or even drive them higher while the general market corrects.On the other hand, four stocks on the list qualify as solid growth stocks: Cognizant Technologies (CTSH),  Equinix (EQIX) and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG).McDonald’s (MCD) carries some combined traits of defensive and growth stocks, giving it an interesting leg up in the current market. The fast-food chain’s turnaround under new Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook has made the stock a growth contender with regard to a number of fundamental and technical attributes: earnings growth, same-store-sales, relative strength and accumulation/distribution.McDonald’s still falls short on the standard punch list of CAN SLIM elements. But the turnaround has made the stock much more attractive for investors looking for healthy dividend names and/or double-threat defensive plays.McDonald’s, which fell off the list Monday, was extended after last week’s bounce off its 10-week moving average, and from a breakout in October.Dollar General (DG) was a double-threat growth/defensive stock from its re-entry to public markets in November 2009 through July 2012. It and its now-merged competitors Family Dollar and Dollar Tree (DLTR) were grabbing market share from Wal-Mart (WMT) and buying up smaller, regional chains across the U.S. Dollar General’s EPS growth is forecast at a healthy 13% for the year ended in January, and 15% in 2017. Revenue growth has slowed to high single digits.O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY) torqued up nearly 1290% from October 2008 to October 2015. During that period, when the market was choppy or in a correction, auto parts chains were seen as dual growth/defensive plays because they were consolidating and gaining market share while benefiting from consumers holding on to their cars longer than they had in the past.O’Reilly, which announces its Q4 results on Feb. 10, is forecast to remain in the camp through 2015 with full EPS growth forecasts of 24%. Revenue growth is seen slowing to 8%. For 2016, analyst consensus puts EPS growth at 14% and sales growth at 7%.Big Cap 20 stocks tend to be stable, healthy performers, but they are not a list of pick-and-play buy opportunities. Investors need to look carefully at the fundamentals and make sure they understand both the company and its value proposition. Sudden changes in market direction can generate significant changes in the companies on the list.

Since inception, the fund has posted an average annual return of 11.06% through May 31. That compares to an 11.3% return for the S&P 500.

They continue to invest and break down barriers to new areas.""So far this year, Alphabet is up about 9% while Amazon is up about 46%. Gains by Alibaba, Booking and Microsoft range in between.The fund is large-cap focused, all $10 billion or more, mostly domestic with only 8% in foreign stocks as of March 31. Still, the fund has additional international exposure through its large-cap U.S. stocks, many of which have multinational operations.To bring a stock into the fund, Fath needs to see double-digit growth in earnings and free cash flow year-over-year.Fath assesses a company's total addressable market by asking: Is it in an area ripe for disruption? Who are the new entrants? He looks for stocks where the market under-appreciates the speed, pace and durability of a company's growth.Online retailer Amazon is the fund's top holding because it's the ""perfect example"" of the innovative disruptor.""It's going into many different directions at the same time and disrupting many different parts of the marketplace,"" Fath said.The biggest area is e-commerce, driven by its Prime membership. The second is its cloud offering, Amazon Web Services. But it has other irons in the fire. The two biggest are advertising and hardware. Amazon is doing more advertising for third-party merchants that use Amazon as their storefront. It's also moving into home devices with the Alexa speaker system to compete with Google and Apple (AAPL).Fath said Booking, the online travel agent that runs Booking.com, has a powerful business model. He said it's accumulated an inordinate amount of supply in Europe by adding a lot of branded and independent hotels, as well as alternative vacation homes and bed-and-breakfasts.He said it's put pressure on aggregator travel sites such as Trivago by being more efficient with its marketing spend to drive people to its own site.Another big holding is Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant. Fath said it has probably one the best business models and is very cash-flow generative. It's at the epicenter of taking advantage of China's rising middle class, which can buy more and more goods and services.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) has seen its shares rise more than 60% over the past year. First-quarter earnings per share jumped 43% as revenue and profits topped expectations. The company makes the robotic da Vinci Surgical System. Its profitability is based on the classic razor-razor blade business model. It makes money on its robotic surgical system, then creates a recurring revenue stream with additional profits through sales of service contracts and disposable items like surgical blades and other instruments and accessories.Fath also likes Nike (NKE), which has been out of favor as competitor Adidas (ADDYY) hustled its way to a resurgence in the U.S. He said Nike is beginning to ramp up its innovation engine, and will soon pump up a number of products, including its React sneaker line. Going forward, Fath said, ""We feel very good about the fundamentals.""YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeNew ETF Aims To Provide A steady 7% Annual Distribution Rate

294,ISRG,"Medtronic (MDT) shares sank early Tuesday after the firm suggested the first uses of its surgical robot, Hugo, on humans likely will be pushed into 2019, an analyst said.X The share drop came as the medical device maker topped Wall Street's quarterly expectations with diabetes business revenue that ""handily"" beat the consensus as Medtronic puts production issues in its rearview mirror, RBC analyst Brandon Henry wrote in a note to clients. But on the stock market today, Medtronic sank 2% to close at 81.61, on robotic issues.Previously, Medtronic had said the competitor to Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) would begin operating on patients at the end of fiscal 2018 with a full launch in fiscal 2019. On its call, though, the firm said software/hardware integration and testing is taking longer than expected.""We believe that commentary suggests first in-human cases with Medtronic's surgical robot will slip into fiscal 2019,"" Henry said.

Shares ran up more than 1.6% to 51.46, stretching a year-to-date advance to more than 48%. Square was a huge winner in 2017 as well.In addition to Square, TransUnion (TRU), Charles Schwab (SCHW), E-Trade Financial (ETFC) and Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL) all showed bullish action, blasting gains of 2% to 10% or more.Schwab continues to work on a new base, while eTrade is now extended after recently retaking a 56.10 entry point in a six-week cup without handle.The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond continued to soar, rising to as high as 2.94% and practically eclipsing the Feb. 21 year-to-date high. Higher interest rates help boost net interest profit margins for banks and other financial firms.Square, the San Francisco-based digital transactions and business analytics innovator, rose 1.6%, climbing as high as 52.50 in below average turnover.

Volume was lower from Thursday's level, according to preliminary data. At 7138, the leading index still clung to a weekly gain of roughly 0.5% and is up 3.4% since Jan. 1.So the tech-centered index was still up for the week, but closed below the key 50-day moving average. The Nasdaq 100-tracking PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) ETF fell 1.6%. It too slipped mildly beneath the 50-day moving average for the first time in nearly four weeks.Hand tools, shoes, paper, and numerous defensive industry groups paced the downside.The S&P 500 saw its weekly gain slim down to 0.5%. In the prior week, the large-cap benchmark rallied 2%.Turnover climbed roughly 14% higher vs. the same time on Thursday on the NYSE. Overall, though, trading volume has been holding below the 50-day average on the Nasdaq for at least two straight weeks. On the NYSE, trading has been muted for nearly three weeks in a row.Typically, the best follow-throughs, which give alert investors a chance to hunt for breakouts among leadership-quality stocks in terms of excellent fundamentals, relative stock price strength, and fund sponsorship, take place on Day 4 through Day 7 of a new rally attempt. But they can also occur much later than that.Home Depot (HD) was the sole stock among the 30 components of the Dow Jones industrial average to initially gain 1 point or more. Shares retreated just a fraction to 177.01. Volume was 10% below usual levels.Home Depot, the DIY home improvement chain, has been in correction mode since striking a new high of 207.61 on Jan. 29. That peak came right before the first of this year's intermediate market corrections. The stock hasn't fallen much, though, losing just 18% of its market value. That's well within range of a normal decline within, say, a cup with handle base or a saucer base chart pattern, which is common among Dow industrials-type issues.Home Depot has pounded out steady if not rip-roaring profit growth. Earnings per share have lifted 24%, 15%, 18%, 23%, 16%, 14%, 15% and 17% vs. year-ago levels in the past eight quarters. The Street sees fiscal Q1 profit rising 24% to $2.07 a share.Consumer tech titan Apple gapped below its 50-day moving average. That's a sign of weakness for the iPhone and iPad giant. The stock fell more than 4% and hit an intraday low of 165.43 in intense turnover.Apple is now tickling its long-term 200-day moving average and is trading around 9% below an all-time high of 183.50.Apple has already rallied 55% since it burst out of a cup with handle at 118.12 way back on Jan. 6, 2017. So it's due for a rest, but keep watch for a base to complete itself.As noted in a new Click tech blog post, Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty trimmed her price target on the consumer electronics and digital services firm to 200 from 203, citing concerns on iPhone sales. However, Huberty also reportedly advised clients to buy shares on any price weakness after Apple reports its fiscal Q2 sales (for the March-ended quarter) on May 2 after the close.A 3-point slice of the price target does not amount to much in terms of market value. At 166, the stock's market value is $841 billion. Apple has 5.07 billion shares outstanding.Google operator Alphabet (GOOGL) lost just 1.1% to 1,077.32 in weak turnover and still managed to post a stout weekly gain of nearly 4%. Watch to see if it holds above the 50-day moving average, painted in red on IBD daily charts.The megacap tech may be forming a new double bottom base. The middle peak between the stock's first and second lows is 1,178.16. If the stock can continue rebounding, it could set up a potential breakout at 1,178.26, 10 cents above the middle peak.Alphabet is expected to increase first-quarter profit 20% to $9.29 a share. That follows EPS gains of 7%, 28%, 27%, 32% and 28% in the prior five quarters.Among the 11 names currently in Leaderboard, new entrant Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) cooled off a second straight day in normal fashion. The big cap medical play remains in buy range from a 445.20 entry in a shallow cup with handle. Shares eased 1.4% to 456.27 in above-average volume.Going back to TransUnion, the credit-reporting agency and financial data expert has held a spot on the Leaderboard watch list for more than two weeks. On Friday, the stock gapped up at the open and jumped 10%. Shares got as high as 67.32, easily surpassing a 59.72 buy point in a shallow cup with handle.The base is better viewed as a flat base with an entry at 61.52, 10 cents above the left-side high. In this case, TransUnion was within proper buy range right at the open price of 64.03, 4% above the flat-base entry.The expert in consumer financial data posted a 36% jump in first-quarter earnings to 57 cents a share, spanking the Thomson Reuters consensus estimate by nearly 10% and issuing the biggest year-over-year increase in five quarters. Revenue grew 18% to $537 million, marking a third quarter in a row of accelerating top-line growth. TransUnion also announced the acquisition of U.K.-based Callcredit.Skechers (SKX) got body slammed, gapping down more than 27% and finishing the session at 30.70. That sell-off wiped out five months' worth of gains.Volume soared past 27 million shares, more than one quarter of its total float of 94 million shares. The stock's 50-day average turnover is 2.4 million shares per day.The company reported a 13% rise in Q1 earnings to 68 cents a share, sharply undercutting Wall Street's expectations. Sales rose 17%, easing from a 27% Q4 top-line increase, but moving at a faster pace than the year-ago quarter's weak 10% rise.Net margin edged 20 basis points lower to 8.6%.

EBay shares are rebounding from support at their 40-week line, within a two-month consolidation.On the Dow, Home Depot (HD) and Caterpillar (CAT) staked out early leads, up 2.1% and 1.6%, respectively. Caterpillar is working on a second weekly advance in its rebound from support at its 40-week line.IBM foundered 6.3% in early trade. The legacy tech brand late Tuesday posted stronger-than-expected results for the first quarter. It also reported a second straight quarter of year-over-year revenue growth for the first time in more than four years. Full-year earnings guidance was just shy of consensus views, however. The stock has had little success in attempts to climb out of a 13-month consolidation.Earnings news drove the lion's share of Wednesday's premarket session, with action among stock futures sharply divided after reports.In addition to IBM's early loss, chip equipment makers Lam Research and ASML Holding (ASML) dropped 5.4% and 3.6%, respectively. Broadband cable systems maker Adtran (ADTN) tumbled 6.6%.On the upside, Morgan Stanley (MS) rose 2.9%, United Airlines (UAL) surged 2.4%, CSX throttled up 6.9% and Interactive Brokers Group (IBKR) gained 1% following their quarterly results.Intuitive Surgical trimmed its early gain to 3.4%, pulling back below its buy point at 452.10. The maker of the da Vinci robotic surgical system reported a 25% gain in earnings per share and an 18% rise in revenue for its first quarter late Tuesday. The number of surgical systems shipped soared 39% during the quarter, with procedures performed using the da Vinci system rising 15%.Defense contractor Textron powered up 7.2% in the stock market today, after scoring big beats in its first-quarter revenue and earnings. The premarket move implies a starting bell breakout above a 62.29 buy point in a two-month flat base.

301,ISRG,"Tuesday's premarket trading received several shots in the arm. First was Netflix (NFLX), which surged after reporting strong first-quarter results late Monday. Then a cohort of blue chip names kicked in and posted early advances, following above-expectation quarterly results.The result: futures for the Dow Jones industrial average vaulted 1%. The S&P 500 traded 0.8% above fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures pressed 1.1% higher.Netflix was the premarket trading powerhouse, up more than 7% and easily the largest gainer among Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 stocks. Merck (MRK) bolstered the Dow in early trade, following an analyst upgrade. But the drugmaker quickly surrendered its lead as investors waded into an early batch of blue-chip earnings reports from Goldman Sachs (GS), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH).The positive premarket trading poised the week-old uptrend to hurdle resistance. The uptrend is in good standing, carrying no distribution days. But the 50-day moving average remains the key test for all three major indexes. The Dow failed to hold above its 50-day line on Monday, and the Nasdaq and S&P 500 have yet to break back above the critical level of support.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UsePremarket action suggested the Dow and the S&P 500 would open above their 50-day lines. Keep in mind that futures-driven premarket trading does not always translate to action during the regular session.On the Dow, UnitedHealth rolled up an early 2.5% gain on first-quarter results that were stronger than expected. The stock retook its 50-day line of support with a 2.6% gain on Monday, attempting to start up the right side of a four-month consolidation.Also on the Dow, Merck buzzed ahead 2.1%, after Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock to overweight, from equal weight. The drugmaker surged 2.6% in heavy trade Monday, after the company's lung-cancer treatment outperformed competitors in clinical trials. Merck is up 11% from an early April low and, like the overall Dow index, stands poised to test resistance at its 50-day moving average.Further down the list of early Dow advancers, Johnson & Johnson trimmed its early gain to 0.3%. The medical products leader reported first-quarter results in which earnings and revenue topped analysts' targets, and full-year guidance met or beat expectations.Goldman Sachs reversed an early loss, stepping up 0.9% after clobbering first-quarter earnings expectations and raising its quarterly dividend nearly 7%.  The stock has spent three days fighting resistance at its 50-day moving average.IBD Leaderboard stocks churned out some strong early moves, drafting Netflix's early advance. The streaming entertainment leader reported first-quarter sales and earnings only narrowly above consensus targets. But a blowout beat in subscriber growth surprised investors and launched shares higher in premarket trading. Netflix shares remain extended after a rebound from support at their 10-week moving average.Planet Fitness (PLNT) popped 1.6% ahead of the open.  The gym network ended Monday a bit more than 2% below a 40.14 buy point in a second-stage flat base.Leader peer Lululemon Athletica (LULU) pared its early surge back to 0.3% in premarket trading. The company late Monday named Patrick Guido its chief financial officer, effective April 30. The stock has jumped 18% over the past three weeks.China-based stocks were mixed, as after markets in Hong Kong and Shanghai ended lower Tuesday, despite data showing the country's GDP expanded 6.8% during the first quarter. Retail sales surged 35.4%, while investment in education soared 26.9%. China's Commerce Ministry also announced its would impose 179% tariffs on sorghum imported from the U.S. The ministry said an investigation found the grain was unfairly subsidized by the U.S. government.March IPO IQiyi (IQ) jumped 2.3% in premarket trading. Shares of the Netflix-like platform advanced over the past six sessions, rising 9.7% above their March 29 IPO price.Housing starts jumped in March to an annualized rate of 1.32 million, the Commerce Department reported. That was a healthy uptick from February's disappointing 1.295 rate of home starts, startling economists who had projected a rate of 1.264 million new projects.Building permits, which gauge upcoming activity, posted an even larger increase — to an annualized rate of 1.354 million. February's permits clocked a 1.321 million pace. Economists had expected March permits issued at a 1.315 million rate.Industrial production numbers from the Federal Reserve are set for release at 9:15 a.m. ET.A busy slate for Tuesday's after-hours session includes quarterly reports from railroad CSX (CSX), Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) and United Airlines (UAL).  Lam Research (LRCX) also reports after the close, kicking off the first-quarter reporting season for the chip sector.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Why Strength In This Sector Is Good For The BullsUnitedHealth, Lam Research, IBM Earnings Due: Investing Action PlanAmazon Report Sends CVS, Walgreens, These Drug Distributors Soaring

It's sort of like those studies that show a pretty woman or a handsome man is more likely to be hired than someone who is ugly.Stocks are no different. A stock will be forgiven chart flaws more readily if the fundamentals are not just good but beautiful. Different rules for different folks? Well, yes. Who said life was fair?Netflix (NFLX) is a good example of a beautiful stock. Earnings grew 191% last year and are expected to surge 118% this year.The stock broke out in January and then advanced more than 60% to a March 12 high. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq scored an intraday high within a day of Netflix's high.The Nasdaq then corrected about 11%. Netflix fell almost 19%.If a stock has so-so fundamentals, then that bigger-than-average pullback might be regarded as a serious flaw.

The bounce provided a secondary entry, or did it?Volume was quiet on the rebound until Wednesday when turnover was 29% above average.

310,ISRG,"Wall Street is settling into the first earnings season of the calendar year, and after the long weekend, IBD 50 stocks Starbucks (SBUX) and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) are set to disclose quarterly results.Coffee giant Starbucks, which reports Q1 results after the close on Thursday, is expected to experience 12.5% earnings growth to 45 cents per share on a 12.3% revenue rise to $5.39 billion, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. The growth would mark a slowdown from previous quarters.The company remains bullish about expanding market share in China, even as that country experiences market volatility and less rapid economic growth. Starbucks plans to open 500 stores there in 2016, with the goal of opening 3,400 stores in China by 2019. CEO Howard Schultz says that China has the potential to become the company's biggest market.While other retailers flounder, Starbucks has remained a bright spot. Shares fell 1.7% in the stock market Friday but gained 2.4% for the week despite a broader market dip. It is currently trading below its 50-day line.Intuitive Surgical also reports Thursday. The robotic surgery leader released preliminary Q4 results on Wednesday saying that revenue climbed 12% to $677 million, vs. Wall Street views for 8.8% growth to $653.5 million.Analysts expect earnings to rise 1.6% to $5 a share.

Shares edged down 0.3% for the week.Its IBD 50 counterpart, TAL Education (XRS), experienced a sharper decline of 4.8% for the week that ended Jan. 15. TAL reports Q3 earnings on Jan. 27, when earnings are seen falling 16.7% to 15 cents per share and revenue is expected to jump 37.7% to $136.9 million.Both New Oriental and TAL are trading below their 50-day moving averages.Alaska Air (ALK), which announces Q4 results on Thursday, is seen logging 50% EPS growth to $1.41 and 5.6% revenue growth to $1.38 billion. The stock received a downgrade to neutral from Credit Suisse earlier in the month, while American Airlines (AAL) received an upgrade to outperform from the firm.Shares were essentially flat on Friday but stumbled 2.3% for the week.A fellow carrier that currently occupies a seat at the IBD 50 table, Hawaiian Holdings (HA), announces Q4 earnings on Jan. 26.

Dow futures steered more than 200 points above fair market value, up 1.3%. S&P 500 futures gained 1.5%. Nasdaq 100 futures were ahead 1.9%.The stock market today took some early strength from oil prices, which perked back above $31 a barrel, up more than 5% as a broad range of factors — including potential eurozone stimulus, terrorist attacks on Libyan oil sites, and cold weather in Europe and the U.S. — lifted prices and appeared to scare some short sellers out of their positions.Economic news starts with a preliminary estimate on January manufacturing from researcher Markit at 9:45 a.m. ET.

Emergency generator maker Generac (GNRC) jumped 5%, and Home Depot (HD) rose more than 1%.Dow stocks were generally positive. Nike (NKE) and Chevron (CVX) topped the index with 3% gains in premarket trade.

Boeing said late Thursday it will take a Q4 charge.Oil- and energy-related plays posted most of the big gains on the S&P 500: Williams (WMB) swept up 7%; Marathon Oil (MRO) and Freeport-McMoran (FCX) vaulted 6% each.Irish drugmaker Mallinckrodt (MNK) lapped the pack with a 9% gain.

The move implied an opening back above the 556.70 buy point around which the stock has been caught up, but premarket moves do not always carry through to regular trade.LinkedIn (LNKD) hammered out a 4% premarket gain. The professional networking site ended Thursday with a 3.3% loss this week after falling in seven of the past eight weeks.Overseas, rising oil prices and possible stimulus action in Europe helped boost China's markets. The Shanghai Composite rose 1.3% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng jumped 2.9%. That left Shanghai up a half-point and the Hang Seng down 2.3% for the week.In Japan, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 bolted 5.9% higher, its biggest move in five months.

314,ISRG,"For Dennis Lynch, investing is a family affair. The 45-year-old lead manager of $3.5 billion Morgan Stanley Growth is following in the footsteps of his father, who was a money manager and co-founder of Lynch & Mayer, starting in the 1970s.The elder Lynch (also named Dennis) can be proud. Morgan Stanley Growth was the 25th-best-performing U.S. diversified stock fund in 2015. It outperformed 95% of its peer mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. over the past five years.And with a 9.4% gain in the fourth quarter that topped 97% of his direct rivals, Lynch was again among the top-performing mutual fund managers.With Lynch at the helm since mid-2004, the fund has focused on its managers' best ideas rather than on overdiversifying. It has aimed for securities in the stock market that benefit from competitive advantages such as a network effect among site visitors and from a steady flow of subscription-based revenues.And in an industry that employs battalions of analysts who are experts at diving into the details of earnings reports, a key member of Lynch's team is a futurist whose job is to spot emerging investment trends years before they generate revenues and profits.Lynch talked with IBD about his investment approach from his office in Manhattan.IBD: Dennis, your fund has outperformed in 2015 and long-term. But in 2012 and 2014 it was middle of the pack. What went against the fund's approach in those years?Lynch: We try to add value through stock picking and identifying what we think are mispriced or undervalued companies, companies that are undervalued because investors don't understand the quality of their business or how they can grow over time.Along the way, there can be periods when specific ideas are not working or the market is not in agreement with our ideas. We had a challenging period in 2012. In the back part of the year we did poorly, given a large allocation to Facebook (FB). It came public with a lot of public enthusiasm, then went through a vicious and challenging period when the stock price more than halved.We actually added to our position during that challenging period, then later on we benefited as the stock price rebounded.Generally, when we have ups and downs relative to the market or peer groups, sometimes it's because we're going through a period when the market thinks we're wrong. And we also make mistakes from time to time.IBD: Your concentrated portfolio is the flip side of your long-term approach, right?Lynch: Yes. Why we do well in any given year reflects decisions made in previous years rather than anything we do in the current year.Amazon.com (AMZN) is a company we've owned continuously for roughly 13 years. The reasons we got involved were a combination of the online advantages that made them tough to beat. They offer inventory that they don't necessarily possess themselves, but which they have access to.At the same time, they've slowly built a very large logistical infrastructure in the physical world.And they target increasingly technology through their Amazon Web Services.IBD: Is there anything that could disrupt a juggernaut like Facebook?Lynch: You don't have to worry that another social network will get bigger. That's highly unlikely.But is there something out there that can take people's attention away, like virtual reality or some other technology that still in its early stages now?In the absence of something like that, it's unlikely that Facebook's network effect will be challenged anytime soon.IBD: LinkedIn's (LNKD) third-quarter profit jumped 50%, a nice rebound from Q2. This is another network-effect play, isn't it?Lynch: Both holdings have strong network effects of users connected to each other.Both have users who cross-connect. It's hard to displace them. Even though both have that at their core, they make money in different ways. So we're not exposed to the same end markets or even the same spending patterns.Earlier in the year, LinkedIn made changes to its workforce that surprised people. But each quarter, results have seen the fruits of LinkedIn's longer-term thinking.IBD: The key to Monster Beverage (MNST) is how their deal with Coke (KO) gives them a shot at foreign expansion, right?Lynch: With Coca Cola becoming a substantial owner, it opens opportunities for distribution to become more efficient in the U.S. and increases chances of capturing more global share. They've had less success outside the U.S.IBD: Is Salesforce.com (CRM) one of those subscription-revenue companies you like?Lynch: They provide customer relationship management services that in the past were sold on a high license-fee basis. They had a novel approach of offering those services in a subscription format rather than requiring large upfront fees, which can be costly.It gives customers the ability to benefit from upgrades to the whole system rather than having to buy a new version of the software for each upgrade cycle.As a result, they built a high recurring-revenue business. On an annual basis, revenue renewal is over 90%. So that gives their revenue a lot of visibility.They are figuring out how to meet other important needs for large organizations. They're expanding into marketing.IBD: Why has Athenahealth's (ATHN) share price been choppy recently?Lynch: Athenahealth is the dominant provider for doctors to get reimbursed by insurers.And the way their system works, every doctor can learn (about methods for improving insurance reimbursements) from the experience of other doctors on the platform.Once Athena figures out how to apply new rules for one doctor, all doctors benefit.So it's hard for a doctor not to join the network. This is an inherent network effect. But their penetration is still less than 10% of the overall doctor market, so they've got a lot of room for growth.And they've diversified into electronic health records. Once you get a lot of doctors to join, you can provide other services, which draws in more doctors.IBD: After a rough patch,Intuitive Surgical's (ISRG) earnings-per-share growth is accelerating again. Is this improvement for real?Lynch: That rough period was when they were transitioning from a first-generation platform to the next generation.And it's a razor-and-razor-blades model. There are a lot of consumables that need to be reordered each time.So it's a high recurring revenue model. It continues to take share.When a company has an upgrade cycle, customers wonder if they should order the old system or the new one. Sales can slow. It happened a couple of years ago. Now things are heading back in the right direction.IBD: Dennis, how does your team differ from its rivals?Lynch: One thing I try to emphasize when I talk with people who are thinking about whether to put money in the fund is what skin in the game do people running a product have?Here, we're not going to do well every quarter or every 12 months. There can be periods when things go badly, but through Morgan Stanley's deferred compensation program, the vast majority of team pay is deferred, and most goes into our products.We have significant personal exposure through co-ownership with our clients in the products we make for them.IBD: Tell me about the person on your team whose job is to scout ahead for emerging trends or disruptive new technologies.Lynch: Yes, in addition to our expert work, meetings with companies, looking at financial statements — those conventional activities — we've dedicated one person to research topics that have the potential to be disruptive in industries or sectors.IBD: What is your change researcher looking at these days?Lynch: More recently, he's been focused on Bitcoin and virtual reality. These are potentially powerful emerging themes and disruptive trends.IBD: Who is your disruptor expert?Lynch: Stan Delaney.IBD: How do you and the five other managers on this fund — David Cohen, Sam Chainani, Alexander Norton, Jason Yeung and Armistead Nash — divide your workload? Is each manager responsible for different industrial sectors, for example?Lynch: I act as a generalist. Outside of me, everyone has a sector and industry expertise. Sam follows the Internet and financials. David follows consumer, which sounds like one industry but is really multidimensional. Jason follow health care and some consumer staples. Armistead follows business services and software. Alex does technology — we think of technology differently than the Internet. Companies use the Internet to create. They are not selling semiconductors or software. Alex focuses on those kinds of business models and things like industrials.My dad managed large- and midcap growth stocks, starting in the 1970s in a time when managers tended to be generalists. Today people tend to be experts in a category but lacking the perspective of knowing multiple categories and being able to compare. We believe we benefit from taking the generalist approach, and we can leverage the experts.

321,ISRG,"FANG stocks Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) have logged notable losses lately. But as old leadership fades, new leadership rotates in. Could the AI, robotics and automation field become the new FANG stocks? According to Bill Studebaker of ROBO Global, ""we're definitely in a new world order.""""The FANG companies clearly were the past growth,"" Studebaker, the president and CIO of ROBO Global, told Investor's Business Daily at the Inside ETFs conference earlier this year. ""We think what we call RAAI — robotics, automation and artificial intelligence — is the future FANGs.""He added that the FANG companies are RAAI ""ambassadors,"" because they use AI, robotics and automation in many aspects of their businesses. This can be likened to investing in the picks and shovels during the gold rush, according to Studebaker. For example, Amazon and Google are using AI for their smart home devices. Amazon also uses robots in its warehouses.There are several robotics, automation and AI-focused ETF offerings in the market.

328,ISRG,"Alphabet, the world's Internet search leader, is prospecting beyond its core business to strike success in the health care world. The company's glucose monitoring contact lens for diabetics is inching closer to drugstore shelves, while sales of its $200 self-stabilizing spoon, designed to help people with uncontrollable hand tremors eat comfortably, topped 1,000 in the first six months.Google — which restructured last year to become the largest operating unit within a new parent, Alphabet (GOOGL) — bought biotech company Lift Labs in 2014, just a few months after the health-focused startup began product sales.Pointing to its broadening emphasis on that and other health and medical advancements, Alphabet last month renamed its Google Life Sciences division Verily Life Sciences. The division brings together clinicians and scientists and is focused on understanding and improving chronic conditions that impact massive numbers of people — health issues including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, neurodegenerative disease and mental health.""This is a development in health care that I think is far-reaching and will be long-lasting because we are seeing a period of convergence between the technology companies and the health care companies,"" California Life Sciences Association trade group CEO Sara Radcliffe told IBD.She said changes driving health care and tech firms into partnerships include ""the explosion of Big Data"" and the resulting demand for ways to manage all that patient information.Growth of access to data via the Internet cloud and mobile technologies such as Fitbit (FIT) wearables are ""shifting health care to maintaining and tracking health, rather than simply treating disease,"" she said.Companies Teaming UpRecent notable health-tech partnerships include Alphabet's Verily division teaming up last month with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) to develop surgical robots. That news followed a September 2014 announcement that Google life-science spinoff Calico had entered a 10-year collaboration with North Chicago, Ill.-based pharmaceutical firm AbbVie (ABBV) to research age-related diseases.Verily has another partner, too. Medical device firm Dexcom linked up in Q3 with Verily to create a new class of disposable 24/7 glucose monitoring systems that are faster, cheaper and smaller than the products that are currently available.Johnson & Johnson and Verily announced last year that they had created Verb Surgical to develop a new surgical robotics device that's smaller and less expensive than the Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) da Vinci system, which now controls that minimally invasive surgery segment.Others looking to join forces across the health-tech divide include medical device maker Medtronic (MDT), which is collaborating with Big Data solutions provider IBM (IBM) Watson Health to analyze the waves of information gleaned by diabetes insulin pumps.Data Vs. DiseasesAlphabet is not the only tech heavyweight seeking to blend medical altruism with Big Data and big moneymaking plans. Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and others are also using their deep technology expertise to create medical-related products and services.This year, Apple introduced health-tracking tools that monitor users' footsteps, heart rates and sleep activities. Microsoft and Samsung already offer a number of so-called wearable devices that also allow people to monitor their daily movements.Advances in mobile computing, artificial intelligence and new analytics software are driving their efforts.""In recent years, there has been increased interest in health care applications from companies that traditionally are seen to be consumer-focused companies,"" said Iain Simpson, a drug delivery specialist at Cambridge Consultants. ""Companies such as Google, Apple, Facebook (FB) and Amazon.com (AMZN) have built consumer-focused businesses based on the creation of a compelling and sustainable user experience.""Now, Simpson said, various tech companies are heading into health, driven ""by the increasing relevance of these capabilities in a market which creates new high-value business opportunities for them, particularly when they work in collaboration with established health care players such as pharma and medical device companies.""With U.S. health care spending weighing in at $3.2 trillion in 2015 and projected to reach $5.1 trillion by 2023, according to the California Health Care Foundation, profit potential is an obvious incentive.But other factors are also at work. Part of the reason behind Alphabet's focus on moving the needle on Parkinson's treatment is personal.Google co-founder and now Alphabet president Sergey Brin's mother Eugenia has Parkinson's, and Brin himself was diagnosed in 2006 as carrying a mutation of the LRRK2 gene, which has been associated with higher rates of the degenerative disorder of the central nervous system.""Generally the pace of medical research is glacial compared to what I'm used to in the Internet,"" Brin told Wired in a 2010 interview about how Google could amplify the process. ""We could be looking lots of places and collecting lots of information. And if we see a pattern, that could lead somewhere.""Legislative changes are another factor that has helped open the door for tech firms to put their massive computing muscle into health care.Data-driven medicine is a key element of the Affordable Care Act, the federal law that ushered in President Barack Obama's health care reforms and is a major force at the center of the boom in new health technology.The law provides major financial incentives for doctors and hospitals to prove their care is effective. Those ""value-based"" payment rules are sparking demand for new software that can track and analyze patient data, says Lynne Dunbrack, research vice president at IDC Health Insights.Patients Prescribed SoftwareFor example, Dunbrack said, ""some hospitals are finding it cheaper to send Medicare patients who have congestive heart failure home with a weight scale, an electronic tablet and a connected app rather than risk too many readmissions within 30 days of discharge, which would result in the hospitals getting federal reimbursement rate cuts.""""There have been some real financial incentives for health care organizations to purchase and use these technologies, which is then helping to drive demand, and is why companies are now seeing new opportunities,"" Dunbrack said.Along with the shift to value-based care, other top areas of focus for the health care industry include sequencing the human genome and digitizing health care data, said Cowen and Co. analyst John Blackledge in a September report about Alphabet's health care strategy.All three of those health care trends ""are not occurring in a vacuum, but are being accommodated by technology advances in areas such as social, mobile, analytics and cloud computing. These are all areas of Google's expertise,"" Blackledge said.The swirl of changes and tech advances is also helping fuel medical ambitions of tech heavyweight Apple.At its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in June 2014, Apple introduced a new HealthKit app, which monitors users' heart rates, sleep, weight and blood pressure, among other health-related measurements, and lets home health devices such as heart monitors and fitness monitors exchange data. HealthKit will allow clinicians at the Mayo Clinic to send that health information to a user's app, which can in turn transmit the data to a user's physician.HealthKit is ""a logical extension to Apple's existing products and digital ecosystem keeping users engaged and increasing Apple's App Store business,"" while also keeping ""Apple's products and services relevant in a growing but increasingly competitive consumer health market,"" said Simpson, of Cambridge Consultants.Another Apple tech framework, ResearchKit, lets people who want to remotely participate in clinical medical trials do so using specially-designed apps on their iPhone instead of having to show up in person.In March, Apple displayed apps that it says helps diagnose a range of conditions, from diabetes to heart disease. Apple says it won't see the data transmitted and people can opt out of sharing with researchers if they want. ResearchKit can help address a few problems with medical research in its current state, such as limited patient participation and infrequent data sampling, Apple's Jeff Williams, now chief operating officer, said at the time.About 11,000 people signed up for a single medical study at Stanford University in the first 24 hours after the release of ResearchKit, Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC in March.""To put that in perspective, Stanford has told us that it would have taken normally 50 medical centers an entire year to sign up that many participants. So ResearchKit is an absolute game changer,"" said Cook on the call. ""Discovering and curing some of these diseases will push our life expectancy much longer than it currently is.""Alphabet's Google has its own initiative, called ""Fit,"" which includes developer tools and an online platform for collecting data.Connect with Michele Chandler on Twitter @IBD_MChandler and Facebook.

Investors were jittery over the widely expected rate rise this week by the Federal Reserve.They were also worried about stock market news concerning slumping oil prices, weak commodity prices and weakness among technology-sector shares.""The Fed and oil were the big problems,"" said Erik Ristuben, Russell Investments' chief investment strategist.History provided a potential silver lining to the dark cloud of the week's market blahs. ""The market often shows weakness before a rate rise,"" Ristuben said. ""But it often recovers right after the rise.""Oil's weakness stems from a price war. Saudi Arabia is determined to protect its market share, so it is pushing its OPEC partners into keeping production high. The Saudis expect low prices to drive North American producers out of business, Ristuben says.The good news is that outside the energy sector, the economy is in moderately good shape — fueled in part by low energy prices.""Eventually the market will see past the Fed rate increase and see that U.S. economic growth is likely to continue, even if modestly,"" he added. ""Earnings growth will drive stock prices. We expect mid-6%, single-digit returns for equities next year.

347,ISRG,"Francis Pulizzi wouldn't think of scrimping on his pets' health care, even if it's a bit pricey.The New York City native and owner of three Chihuahuas figures that he spends a minimum of $300 each time he takes one of the dogs to the veterinarian.A recent visit to the vet for his 9-month-old puppy, Sebastian, took an even bigger bite out of his cash flow. It cost Pulizzi around $500 for the exam, various tests and medication.But Pulizzi isn't squawking.""I'll go without going out to dinner to make sure my pet has the proper health care,"" he told IBD. ""This is my priority. It's like having a child.""Judging by the performance of high-rated Idexx Laboratories (IDXX), Pulizzi has plenty of company. Idexx manufactures and develops diagnostic and information technology-based products and services for the companion animal veterinary, livestock and poultry, water testing and dairy markets. Around 80% of its revenue comes from its Companion Animal Group, the division that provides diagnostic products and services to vet practices, says Raymond James analyst Nicholas Jansen.Its Livestock, Poultry and Dairy segment provides diagnostic and health-monitoring products for those markets.Products Selling WellThe company's vast lineup includes in-clinic diagnostic solutions comprised of both its VetLab suite of in-clinic chemistry and hematology analyzers as well as associated proprietary consumable products — tests and supplies.The chemistry analyzers, which include products such as the Catalyst Dx and Catalyst One, are used by vets to measure levels of certain enzymes and other substances in blood or urine.Another offering is VetConnect PLUS, a cloud-based technology that lets vets access and analyze patient data from Idexx's diagnostic modalities.Around 40% of its revenue comes from outside the U.S.Idexx delivered good news to investors Wednesday when it pre-announced some results for the fourth quarter, which it reports Jan. 30.The company said it saw record total placements of over 2,000 premium chemistry and hematology analyzers globally in the fourth quarter. In America, it saw a 9% increase vs. a year earlier in placements of Catalyst analyzers and an 18% rise in premium hematology analyzers. It also saw a record in total U.S. premium instrument quarterly placements.International placements of premium analyzers grew 27%.""Our fourth-quarter results capped a year of excellent progress, reflected in full-year Catalyst placement gains of 29%, including growth of 20% in the U.S. and 40% in international,"" said CEO Jonathan Ayers in a press release.The company also raised its guidance for full-year 2014 organic revenue (excluding the impact from the distribution change on channel inventories related to a transition to an all-direct product distribution model in the U.S. for its Companion Animal Group diagnostics) to a range of 9.5% to 10% from its prior guidance of a 9.5% gain.Wednesday's upbeat report comes in the wake of a move from a hybrid to an all-direct product distribution model in America for Companion Animal Group diagnostic products, all elements of which became fully operational in the fourth quarter. The move was announced last July.Sales Go DirectGoing direct means Idexx has dropped its U.S. distributors, which it used in the past, and is selling the group's diagnostic products directly through its own sales force.Under the direct approach, Idexx takes orders, ships product, invoices and receives payment, and recognizes revenue for all rapid assay test kits and instrument consumables in the U.S.That aligns with its direct model for instruments, reference lab service and other Companion Animal Group products, Ayers adds.The change will allow a ""significant expansion in our direct sales coverage and capacity, including an estimated 40% increase in the veterinary diagnostic consultant field sales role and a 60% in customer field call frequency,"" Ayers said.Cutting out the distributors also means Idexx can keep the margin it had been paying them, Jansen says.""There was some controversy over whether there would be a mixed performance during the transition or if Idexx would lose a little share to competitors,"" he said.Wednesday's announcement allayed some of those concerns: ""The distribution changes appear to be having very little impact on the company's business momentum, which seems to de-risk the primary concern on IDEXX shares,"" wrote Jansen in a research note following the announcement. ""While we acknowledge that (the) currency headwind will only get bigger, given recent exchange rate volatility, we believe underlying fundamentals are strengthening.""Guidance ReaffirmedAlso on Wednesday, the company reinforced its guidance for 13% to 14% organic revenue growth in 2015. The 2015 outlook ""reflects expectations for organic revenue growth of 9.5% to 10.5% excluding the benefit of margin capture associated with the U.S. all-direct sales and product distribution strategy,"" the company said in a statement.Idexx stock hit a new high Wednesday and closed up 2.9%. It gave back a little over 1% Thursday.The company has been enjoying a nice run. Earnings have grown by double digits in all but one of the past 15 quarters. But analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect fourth-quarter earnings to slip 1% to 81 cents a share.""Reported EPS is not going to be a relevant metric for the fourth quarter as the company is impacted by the transition (to the direct model), which weighs on reported margins,"" said Jansen. ""This normalizes in 1Q, and everything should be back to normal.""Analysts expect full-year 2014 earnings to rise 10% to $3.82 a share, and a 16% lift in 2015.Jansen says Idexx's primary strength is its innovation, which is fueled by its R&D spending.Its R&D spending represents about 80% of all the industry's diagnostic product R&D, he says.Package ApproachAnother strength, he adds, is the fact that Idexx offers a complete solution of diagnostic products and services, which they can bundle.Idexx has a ""razor/razor blade"" model, says Jansen. It not only sells the diagnostic equipment, but it also develops and sells the tests — or consumables — that the equipment analyzes.""Once you placed the system (with a vet or an animal hospital), you have a highly recurring revenue stream,"" said Jansen.The overall landscape for its business has been improving post-Great Recession, says Jansen.""Now, with unemployment down and consumer confidence (up), that translates into more spending on people's pets,"" said Jansen. ""And diagnostics is a faster growth area within pet spending.""Idexx is part of IBD's Medical-Systems/Equipment industry group, which is a strong performer, ranking No. 6 of the 197 groups tracked. Idexx gets a 97 score out of a possible 99 in IBD's Composite Rating, a metric that factors in things such as earnings growth and stock gains.The group also includes Steris (STE) and Cantel Medical (CMN), both of which have a Composite Rating of 98. Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) is the group's largest firm by market cap and has a Composite Rating of 91.

"
349,ISRG,"If you've ever wondered why you can't just buy a stock at whatever price it's currently trading at, you're not alone. And in actuality, you can buy a stock no matter what the price. But if you're trying to maximize the upside potential of a leading stock, getting in at the proper buy point is your best bet. Why?""If you try to buy before this point, you may be premature,"" IBD Chairman and founder William O'Neil wrote in ""How to Make Money in Stocks."" ""In many cases, the stock will never get to its breakout point but rather will stall or actually decrease in price.""Stocks need time to consolidate their gains, particularly after a big advance. That's why following a move up, they will often form a base. Some common base patterns include the cup, cup with handle, double bottom, and flat base.The ideal time to buy — assuming the company's fundamentals, stock price and volume action, as well as the overall market, all check out — is when the stock crosses its proper buy point.Even if you don't get in at the precise buy point, don't fret. There is a 5% chase zone that gives investors the chance to buy before a stock is considered extended.Beyond that 5% threshold, risk becomes elevated, so it's best to wait for a secondary entry, like a future bounce off the 50-day or 10-week moving average, or for a new base to form.""If you buy at more than 5% to 10% past the precise buy point, you are buying late and will more than likely get caught in the next price correction,"" O'Neil wrote.There is one exception to the 5% buy range: the breakaway gap. On rare occasions, a leading stock may gap up at the open, soar right past the buy point and end up well above the prior session's high and the proper entry.For instance, if a company reports an upside earnings surprise after the close, the stock may gap up at the next open. Such a breakaway gap is a sign of unusual strength, so investors could consider buying beyond the normal 5% chase zone.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) cleared a series of flat bases back in 2005. It gapped up out of a base July 27 (1) after its Q2 earnings report, then triggered the eight-week hold rule the next day.After a 36% advance, shares began consolidating in late August. After the close on Oct. 25, the surgical-gear maker reported Q3 earnings that surged 224% and topped views by a wide margin. It also raised its full-year guidance.The stock gapped up and soared 25% the next day, blowing past a 79.52 buy point and the 5% chase zone, which extended to 83.50. In this case, the general rule of thumb is to buy as close to the opening price as possible.Intuitive sported solid fundamentals at its breakout, including a 99 Composite, 77 Earnings Per Share, 99 Relative Strength and a B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating. Its medical systems industry group was ranked an A as well.Shares rallied 37% from the buy point in less than three weeks to trigger the eight-week hold rule (2). By January 2006, Intuitive rallied 75% before diving into a new price correction.

Nowadays, there are fewer splits.Some company managers think nothing of letting their stocks run up to $100 or $200 a share, or even $1,000. But among this small subset of leading stocks, you might encounter an extreme share split.The sharp increase in shares outstanding will have long-term consequences. But if the stock's fundamentals and technicals are very strong, there might not be any negative effect in the near term.Here's a dramatic statistic: When the IBD 100 (which later became the IBD 50) was unveiled on April 14, 2003, not a single issue traded above the century mark. The highest priced stock? It was eBay (EBAY), which traded near 88.Fast forward to the IBD 50, published July 1. Thirteen names were priced above 100. Regeneron Pharmaceutical (REGN) is just north of 500.Eleven of the original 100 traded in the teens. Only one of the most recent IBD 50 stocks trades below 20.Amazon.com (AMZN) in the late 1990s is typical of what usually happens. Its stock split three times in the 1998-1999 bull market. On the second, a 3-for-1 split in January 1999, the stock shot up 50% in a week to a price near a December 1999 high that it would not surpass for 10 years.Also in the dot-com boom, Qualcomm (QCOM) split 4-for-1 in the last week of 1999. From the Nov. 2 stock-split news to the ultimate high on the first trading day of 2000, the stock rocketed 250%, topping at precisely 200.A more recent example is Baidu (BIDU), which was trading above 800 when it split 10-for-1 in May 2010. The stock rose 16% that week, then built a two-month base. Baidu broke out again and advanced for more than a year. The top Chinese search engine then corrected for a year before breaking out again in September 2013.Apple (AAPL) split 7-for-1 in June 2014. It seemed to have little effect, and the stock marched higher for months. The split seemed tailored to make Apple fit comfortably into the Dow Jones industrial average.Now comes Netflix (NFLX), which announced a 7-for-1 split effective July 14 to shareholders of record July 2. The June 22 announcement had little impact on the stock. It will be interesting to see what happens.Some growth companies have shown little interest in splits. Priceline Group (PCLN) saw its shares rise above 1300 with no split in sight. Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) rose to nearly 600 and has never split.IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil wrote in ""How To Make Money in Stocks"" that he preferred to see companies split their shares 3-for-2 or 2-for-1 rather than conduct more extreme splits. Companies, he added, often split their stock extravagantly near the end of a bull market.He said a stock is likely to top after the second or third time a stock splits. O'Neil's own study of winning stocks showed that only 18% had split in the year before they made their big move.

"
553,ISRG,"How do you know when it's time to sell a big winner? Is the latest dip a sign that it's finally going to collapse? Or is the pullback just a blip on the way to bigger gains?The best stocks tend to pull back numerous times throughout their long run, making higher highs and higher lows.Nevertheless, watch each pullback carefully. One of them will be the sell-off that kills the rally.A high-volume break below a trend line connecting a series of higher lows usually tells you it's time to sell. The line starts at the low of the first pullback to or near the 10-week line after a breakout and extends through the lows of two subsequent pullbacks.Draw the line on a weekly chart over a span of at least 18 weeks. A line drawn on a daily chart, or one drawn over a shorter period, may compel you to sell too early.The trend line method might not trigger a sell right at the top, but it's been repeatedly shown to work for growth stocks. Investors should also consider overall market health, stock fundamentals and other chart signals in deciding whether it's time to sell.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), the maker of da Vinci robotic surgical systems, broke out above a 19.20 buy point from a cup-with-handle base in July 2004. The company turned years of net losses with a strong profit that year.The first major pullback came during the week ended Oct. 29, when the stock sliced through the 10-week line to a low of 21.12. Yet the stock didn't undercut its buy point, and it soon rebounded to a new high in strong volume.Intuitive retreated for a second time in April 2005, piercing the 10-week line, plunging 14% in big volume and hitting a low of 40.15. Only an investor who had a solid profit cushion would have been able to sit through such a decline.The stock didn't fall further below the 10-week line. It eventually formed the second point of the trend line with a low near 46 and broke out again.The third retreat came in October, when Intuitive again sliced through its 10-week line to a low of 63.77. This was a milder drop.A trend line connecting the three lows showed that the stock should have been sold in February 2006. (1)Were there additional sell signals? Yes. A month earlier, it made new highs near 135 in weak trade. In early February, it crashed through its 10-week moving average in massive trade. (2) Intuitive fell 38% by January 2007. It took nearly a year and a half before it broke out again to hit new highs.

"
561,ISRG,"At the end of the year, it's important to take a look at your past mistakes. It's also helpful to go over the market's best performers. Doing both can help you do better in the coming year.One of the winners of 2013 that's worth studying is Facebook (FB). Despite being the most highly anticipated new issue of 2012, Facebook quickly fizzled after its debut. But the stock redeemed itself this year.Like the general market, Facebook started off 2013 with a bang, surging 19% in the first two weeks. Then it got rocky, as the stock slumped 30% from its late January peak.Still, the correction let Facebook carve out a double-bottom base with a 29.17 buy point (1).The buy point from the double-bottom pattern is 10 cents above the high in the middle of the pattern. Sometimes this can be tough to spot.On July 25, Facebook staged a breakaway gap past the buy point. It opened nearly 27% above the close of the prior session in reaction to solid second-quarter earnings announced the night before.Breakaway gaps give the impression that once they happen, it's too late to buy. Yet they are signs of powerful demand, and investors should not shy away from them.Former leaders such as Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (GMCR) and Qualcomm (QCOM) all had breakaway gaps in the course of their stellar runs.In most cases, investors should not buy once a stock moves 5% past a buy point in a base. On breakaway gaps, it's OK to do so. But you still must cut losses short at 7% or 8% if the stock falters.By late October this year, the stock had run to 54.83 before settling into what would become a cup-without-handle base. Before that, the stock cleared an alternative entry at 39.42 in the week ended Aug. 23 in heavy trading. From there, it jumped 39% by October.Just before it staged the breakaway gap, Facebook had mixed IBD ratings.It had a Composite Rating of 78, which is not great. Its Earnings Per Share Rating of 86 was good. But its Relative Price Strength Rating of 29 was weak.The Q2 report changed the outlook for Facebook, because a 75% surge in mobile ad sales showed a promising line of business.Also, there's no denying that Facebook had a breakthrough product that changed the way people communicate and keep in touch with friends and family.And Facebook gave other companies another avenue to promote their products and services.Facebook had mixed fundamentals. Profit was flat to up 13% in the four quarters before the July breakout. But sales grew 32% to 40% over the same period.

Intuitive shares fell more than 4% in early after-hours trading after rising modestly to record highs during the regular session. It wasn't immediately clear why shares were down late.The company planned a 4:30 p.m. Eastern conference call.(Original story follows).***Investors await Intuitive Surgical's (ISRG) Q4 results after the close Thursday with the stock already in orbit, wondering if a company with a history of beating views can pull it off again.The stock reversed modestly lower in the morning but hit record highs in mid-afternoon trading, rising 1.1% to 475.88 as of 1:44 p.m. Eastern. The company, which sells the da Vinci robotic surgery systems, has turned out consistent double-digit profit and sales growth for nearly three years, keeping it in the IBD 50 rankings of top stocks for much of that time and driving shares up more than 60% in the past 12 months.Yet 12 out of 18 analysts following the company rate the stock a hold, as some have wondered just how many of these expensive systems the company can sell. Big institutions also have some caution. Including Thursday, Intuitive's shares have risen for six straight sessions, but mostly on average or sluggish volume, suggesting mutual funds and other big players aren't buying in bulk. That followed three straight days of declines in higher turnover.Still, analysts expected continued growth in the fourth quarter; average profit forecasts call for $3.35 a share, up 10.9% from the year-earlier quarter, with sales rising 24% to $483.7 million.For the full year, the consensus calls for earnings of $11.90 a share, up 25.7% from 2010. Sales were estimated at $1.74 billion, up 23.4%.The fourth quarter didn't see any dramatic developments for the company, though as IBD reported last month, it did win a regulatory nod for its Single-Site set of instruments.

649,ISRG,"RELATED: Intuitive, Other Medical Gear Makers Fall On ObamaCare Ruling.Robotic surgery specialist Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) will go for a 13th straight quarterly earnings beat when it reports its Q2 Thursday after the market close, facing analysts' expectations of slowing growth.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the company to report profit of $3.53 a share, up 21% from the year-ago quarter. Sales are expected to rise 23% to $523 million. For the full year, analysts expect 20% earnings growth, dipping into the teens in each of the two years after that. Profit jumped 30% last year and 60% in the post-recession bounce of 2010.The expected slowdown reflects the maturity of the company, which has been essentially riding one product — its da Vinci surgical system — and its various add-ons. After the last quarterly report in April, when it beat Wall Street's estimates for the 12th time in a row, shares hit an all-time high of 594.89, which they have yet to regain.

650,ISRG,"When Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) broke out in the middle of 2004, it gave investors an opportunity to enter the stock a little earlier than the traditional buy point.
"
651,ISRG,"The maker of robotic surgical systems had set up in a cup-with-handle base with a buy point of 19.20, or 10 cents above the high of the handle. But, unlike most stocks, it also offered an earlier buy point that allowed investors to lessen their downside risk.
"
652,ISRG,"The stock began forming a cup in March 2004 with a peak of 19.20 on its left side, as seen on a daily chart (1). It fell 21% before building the right side .
"
653,ISRG,"The handle formed just below the top of the base and began sloping downward in volume that was for the most part quiet, what you want to see (2). The conventional buy point, as previously mentioned, was at 19.20 (3).
"
654,ISRG,"The earlier entry was established by drawing a trend line from the high of the handle to the peaks in the price bars that followed it. Doing so would have revealed an alternate buy point of 18.80, or 2% below the traditional buy point (4).
"
655,ISRG,"Intuitive surged past both its early buy point and its traditional buy point on July 8, up 4% in more than four times its average daily turnover (5). From there, it climbed 726% in 19 months, or 742% for those who had bought at the alternate buy point.
"
656,ISRG,"An early buy point helps to reduce the risk that you'll be kicked out of the stock due to fluctuations soon after the breakout.
"
657,ISRG,"Intuitive pulled back to its 50-day moving average line at 18 in late July (6), representing a 6% paper loss for those who had bought at the traditional buy point and a 4% loss for those who had bought at the alternate entry.
"
658,ISRG,"Though such a difference may seem small, it gives the investor a little extra cushion should the stock pull back. That's because IBD-style investors are urged to sell any stock that falls 8% below its buy point to preserve capital and minimize downside risk.
"
659,ISRG,"Minimizing risk was especially important in the case of Intuitive Surgical. Its breakout came while the Nasdaq was still in a correction. The tech-heavy index didn't follow through until Aug. 18, several weeks after Intuitive's breakout. The Nasdaq rose 2% that day, the fourth day of its rally attempt, in volume that was higher than the previous session.
"
660,ISRG,"Another advantage of buying at the early buy point is that you can purchase more shares when the stock hits its traditional entry point.
"
661,ISRG,"As always, make sure the company's fundamentals are strong before buying. On the day of its breakout, Intuitive Surgical had an Accumulation-Distribution Rating of B, pointing to moderate demand for the shares.

672,ISRG,"First-Quarter Results
"
673,ISRG,"The importance of this business was apparent in Intuitive's first-quarter results, reported April 19. The company beat analysts' views for the quarter with sales up 18% over last year to $388.1 million and profit up 22% to $2.59 a share. It affirmed its outlook for the rest of the year with 16% to 20% sales growth.
"
674,ISRG,"But systems sales rose just 8% in the quarter vs. 28% growth in instruments and accessories. Intuitive placed a net 88 new machines, down sequentially from the first quarter, and trimmed its gross margin outlook for the year as the average selling price was on the low side. Goldman Sachs promptly cut its EPS outlook through 2014, citing the declining margins.
"
675,ISRG,"Husain says he's not so concerned, though, as Intuitive keeps developing new extras for new procedures. In December it launched the Skills Simulator, an enhanced version of the training program surgeons deploy to learn to use the da Vinci system. During the Q1 call, officials said demand for the simulator was so great that 32 deliveries had to be put off until next quarter.
"
676,ISRG,"In February, regulators approved the Fluorescence Imaging System, which monitors blood flow beneath tissue surfaces. A vessel sealer and a surgical stapler are awaiting approval.
"
677,ISRG,"Given all this, the company tracks its success not just by the number of products sold, but by the number of procedures performed on the systems. Intuitive reported about 30% growth in procedures during the quarter, with revenue of $1,940 per procedure.
"
678,ISRG,"A crucial way to wrest more procedures out of the installed base is to keep expanding the types of surgeries that can be done on the machine. In its 11 years on the market, the da Vinci's core procedures have been in gynecology and urology — tasks like removing prostates, urinary obstructions and uterine fibroids.
"
679,ISRG,"More recently, Intuitive has branched out into cardiothoracic, colorectal, and head-and-neck surgery. Officials say the last two were growth drivers in the first quarter.
"
680,ISRG,"The systems themselves also have an upgrade cycle, albeit a much longer one. After the standard da Vinci system was approved in 2000, the da Vinci S followed in 2006 and the da Vinci Si in 2009.
"
681,ISRG,"The da Vinci Si's most notable change is its dual monitors, allowing more than one surgeon to work at the same time. Intuitive reports that surgeons are slowly but surely upgrading to the new system. In the first quarter, 13 customers traded in their standard da Vincis for Si's, while 19 traded in their S's.
"
682,ISRG,"The machines have all been hits in the U.S., where the installed base totals 1,344 systems. The numbers are much smaller elsewhere: 330 in Europe, 166 in the rest of the world. Sales outside the U.S. outpaced domestic sales in the first quarter, but Gleacher analyst Amit Hazan says penetrating foreign markets has long been a challenge for Intuitive. Its success depends on the relative power of the users and the bean counters.
"
683,ISRG,"""The model is very much patient-driven and physician-driven,"" Hazan said. ""In terms of return on investment of the system, it's very debatable. The model doesn't necessarily translate to other countries very well.""
"
684,ISRG,"Encouraging Research
"
685,ISRG,"To back up its case, Intuitive has been working the conference circuit, encouraging studies showing that robot surgery isn't just cooler but actually has better outcomes. During the Q1 conference call, Vice President Aleks Cukic cited a recent study comparing robotic hysterectomies with the laparoscopic type. Robotic procedures showed less blood loss, shorter hospital stays and fewer complications, it said.
"
686,ISRG,"But acceptance in the medical community can be a slow and pain-staking process at a time when hospital and government budgets are still tight.
"
687,ISRG,"Japan represents a potential $300 million market opportunity for Intuitive, according to analyst Tao Levy of Collins Stewart. But the company has sold only a handful of machines there as it's lobbied for nationwide reimbursement for the purchase. Analysts expect a decision next year, assuming the post-earthquake recovery goes smoothly.
"
688,ISRG,"Still, Levy is optimistic about Intuitive's prospects abroad.

Officials say the last two were growth drivers in the first quarter.The systems themselves also have an upgrade cycle, albeit a much longer one. After the standard da Vinci system was approved in 2000, the da Vinci S followed in 2006 and the da Vinci Si in 2009.The da Vinci Si's most notable change is its dual monitors, allowing more than one surgeon to work at the same time. Intuitive reports that surgeons are slowly but surely upgrading to the new system. In the first quarter, 13 customers traded in their standard da Vincis for Si's, while 19 traded in their S's.The machines have all been hits in the U.S., where the installed base totals 1,344 systems. The numbers are much smaller elsewhere: 330 in Europe, 166 in the rest of the world. Sales outside the U.S. outpaced domestic sales in the first quarter, but Gleacher analyst Amit Hazan says penetrating foreign markets has long been a challenge for Intuitive. Its success depends on the relative power of the users and the bean counters.""The model is very much patient-driven and physician-driven,"" Hazan said. ""In terms of return on investment of the system, it's very debatable. The model doesn't necessarily translate to other countries very well.""Encouraging ResearchTo back up its case, Intuitive has been working the conference circuit, encouraging studies showing that robot surgery isn't just cooler but actually has better outcomes. During the Q1 conference call, Vice President Aleks Cukic cited a recent study comparing robotic hysterectomies with the laparoscopic type. Robotic procedures showed less blood loss, shorter hospital stays and fewer complications, it said.But acceptance in the medical community can be a slow and pain-staking process at a time when hospital and government budgets are still tight.Japan represents a potential $300 million market opportunity for Intuitive, according to analyst Tao Levy of Collins Stewart. But the company has sold only a handful of machines there as it's lobbied for nationwide reimbursement for the purchase. Analysts expect a decision next year, assuming the post-earthquake recovery goes smoothly.Still, Levy is optimistic about Intuitive's prospects abroad.""Pretty much in any given quarter you have 20-ish percent of systems placed internationally,"" he said. ""They continue to place an increasing number of systems in Europe, and outside Europe as well.""Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Intuitive's EPS to grow 17% in each of the next two years, to $11.16 and $13.09, respectively.

715,ISRG,"Return on equity is an important financial gauge commonly used in value investing. So what's it doing in a growth strategy like IBD's CAN SLIM?
"
716,ISRG,"The simple answer: It works as an indicator of financial well-being.
"
717,ISRG,"When IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil studied the characteristics of the most successful stocks, a high return on equity emerged as a key factor.
"
718,ISRG,"Thus, return on equity (or ROE for short) is one of a handful of financial metrics adherents of CAN SLIM consider in their stock research.
"
719,ISRG,"Return on equity is a measure of financial efficiency, gauging how much profit a company is able to generate from the company's financial net worth (that is, assets minus liabilities).
"
720,ISRG,"For any stock you research, look for an annual return on equity of at least 17%. That's the level that tends to set apart the winning stocks from the ordinary, based on the findings of O'Neil's research.
"
721,ISRG,"A few examples from history:
"
722,ISRG,"Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) had 17.1% ROE in the year before its March 2007 breakout. The stock more than tripled until it peaked in December 2007.
"
723,ISRG,"Southwestern Energy's (SWN) ROE was 18.4% before its June 2004 breakout that led to a 556% surge over 83 weeks.
"
724,ISRG,"Ctrip.com (CTRP) had a 24.3% ROE when it broke out in February 2006 and roared 331% in 115 weeks.
"
725,ISRG,"Brazil's Banco Bradesco (BBD)registered a 20% ROE before the October 2004 breakout that led to a 317% rally over 66 weeks.
"
726,ISRG,"That doesn't always mean that a company with smaller ROE is a poor investment. Some of the big winners were shy of 17% return on equity when they started their major advances.
"
727,ISRG,"But when ROE is strong, it gives investors a sense that it's better poised to continue a solid earnings performance.
"
728,ISRG,"To be sure, a high ROE is only part of the fundamentals a solid company should have. Excellent earnings and sales growth, superior profit margins and big operating cash flow are other key elements investors must seek.
"
729,ISRG,"To figure out return on equity, IBD divides net income for the past fiscal year by average shareholders' equity over the past two years.
"
730,ISRG,"Be aware that a high amount of long-term debt can indirectly inflate return on equity because debt reduces shareholder equity.
"
731,ISRG,"If you don't want to do the math, a company's return on equity is found in the IBD Stock Checkup at Investors.com. It is also shown in the charts that appear in the IBD 50, Your Weekly Review, Stock Spotlight, Big Cap 20 and Sector Leaders.

"
781,ISRG,"Just because a stock with strong fundamentals shapes a base doesn't mean that it's an automatic buy. You still have to pore over the stock's chart and decipher the good and the bad on its price-and-volume action.
"
782,ISRG,"One pitfall in a base is a V-shaped appearance. This may look like good action as the stock stages a fast recovery after selling off. But sometimes this type of action is akin to being too fast, too furious. This is not healthy.
"
783,ISRG,"V-shaped bases don't allow a stock to go through a more natural correction. After a sharp pullback, it's good to see a stock consolidate for two or three weeks to wear out the remaining weak holders. This creates a better foundation and results in a U-shaped pattern.
"
784,ISRG,"While a cup or cup-with-handle base can be as short as six or seven weeks, respectively, the bases of some of the biggest stock market winners have taken months or more to form. Qualcomm (QCOM) cleared a five-month cup with handle in January 1999 and staged an astronomical run.

785,ISRG,"SunPower (SPWR) blasted out of a 10-month cup-with-handle pattern in 2006 and more than quadrupled before topping.
"
786,ISRG,"Sometimes in a V-shaped base, a stock will fall hard for a couple of weeks and then rally for a couple of weeks of gains into new-high ground. This fast recovery into new highs is a sell signal and means that a stock could be topping.
"
787,ISRG,"At times, the pullback will send the stock to its 10-week moving average, typically in heavy volume. This two weeks down and two weeks up sell signal generally occurs after a long uptrend.

790,ISRG,"The good times didn't last, as Intuitive Surgical soon reversed lower and slumped 37% over the next few weeks before getting support at its 40-week line (2).Your mom might have told you to never judge people by their looks. But it's OK to do that with stocks.Investors should be discriminating against bases that are V-shaped. In many cases, these are bad and they can bring about other sell signals.Just because a stock with strong fundamentals shapes a base doesn't mean that it's an automatic buy. You still have to pore over the stock's chart and decipher the good and the bad on its price-and-volume action.One pitfall in a base is a V-shaped appearance. This may look like good action as the stock stages a fast recovery after selling off. But sometimes this type of action is akin to being too fast, too furious. This is not healthy.V-shaped bases don't allow a stock to go through a more natural correction. After a sharp pullback, it's good to see a stock consolidate for two or three weeks to wear out the remaining weak holders. This creates a better foundation and results in a U-shaped pattern.While a cup or cup-with-handle base can be as short as six or seven weeks, respectively, the bases of some of the biggest stock market winners have taken months or more to form. Qualcomm (QCOM) cleared a five-month cup with handle in January 1999 and staged an astronomical run.SunPower (SPWR) blasted out of a 10-month cup-with-handle pattern in 2006 and more than quadrupled before topping.Sometimes in a V-shaped base, a stock will fall hard for a couple of weeks and then rally for a couple of weeks of gains into new-high ground. This fast recovery into new highs is a sell signal and means that a stock could be topping.At times, the pullback will send the stock to its 10-week moving average, typically in heavy volume. This two weeks down and two weeks up sell signal generally occurs after a long uptrend.Keep watch for variations of this sell signal. Sometimes it can be one week down, followed by two or three weeks up to a new high.In late October 2007, Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) fell for three straight weeks (1), but found support at its 10-week moving average.

796,ISRG,"Buying thinly traded stocks generally isn't a good idea.The lack of liquidity makes it hard for big players to quickly unwind or build a significant position. Quality funds seldom buy such stocks.Exceptions, however, happen.Penske Automotive Group (PAG) trades about 300,000 shares daily. That figure might not be thin if Penske were a high-priced stock. Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), for example, trades less than 300,000 shares daily. However, with a per-share price near 500, Intuitive can't be called thin. With Penske's share price in the 30 neighborhood, it qualifies as thin.Yet, at least one quality fund has been building a position. Through the third quarter, Fidelity Contrafund has added to its position in each of the past four quarters.Penske owns and operates 171 franchised car dealerships in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, 170 internationally and 30 collision repair centers. The international dealerships are primarily in the U.K., but Penske also has dealerships in Germany and Italy.About 38% of sales are from outside the United States. Penske doesn't hedge against currency fluctuations.On Tuesday, Penske reported it acquired a BMW and Mini dealership in Ontario, Calif. The move will add $125 million in annual revenue.The customer base is mostly upscale. About two-thirds of revenue are tied to premium brands, such as Porsche, Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz.Penske grew earnings 53% in 2010 and 35% last year. Revenue expanded 9% and 11%.The Street expects a 22% EPS pop this year on 13% revenue growth.Q3 results will be reported Oct. 30 at 2 p.m. ET. Analysts expect earnings to advance 14% on a 10% sales gain.Return on equity was 15% last year, up for a third year in a row. While that's below the 17% minimum ROE associated with elite stocks, Penske's ROE was 17.3% in Q1 and 16.6% in Q2.Penske pays a quarterly dividend of 12 cents a share, which represents an annualized yield of 1.6%. In February 2009, the company suspended the dividend. The dividend was reinstated in mid-2011.

"
843,ISRG,"There are two keys to Frank Caruso's investment strategy.
"
844,ISRG,"First, the lead manager of $2 billion AllianceBernstein Large Cap Growth directs his team to seek what he calls dynamic gaps.
"
845,ISRG,"Those gaps are big differences between how fast Caruso's team expects a stock's earnings to grow and Wall Street's consensus expectation.
"
846,ISRG,"The second key is where Caruso has his team look for that gap: four to five years out.
"
847,ISRG,"Caruso is adamant about avoiding a focus on the near term.
"
848,ISRG,"This approach had the fund up 32.46% this year through Nov. 30. That topped 78% of its large-cap growth peers, which averaged 29.96%. The S&P 500 was up 29.12%.
"
849,ISRG,"Over the past three years the fund's average annual gain is 18.14% vs. 15.70% for its peer group and 17.73% for the big-cap bogey.
"
850,ISRG,"Caruso, age 57, discussed his investment process with IBD from his office in Manhattan.
"
851,ISRG,"IBD: How does your search for leading stocks differ from other growth investors'?
"
852,ISRG,"Caruso: We think of equities generally (in terms of) a combination of growth and capital returns in the form of dividends and share buybacks, which support the valuations of equities over a long period.
"
853,ISRG,"And we take a long-duration approach to investment opportunities. But most growth investors are dangerously focused on the moment, growth in the short term. We try to exploit this phenomenon where not a lot of analytical work is being done four to five years out.
"
854,ISRG,"IBD: Give me some examples that show how your tack works, please.
"
855,ISRG,"Caruso: In the spring of 2012, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) missed a couple of months of sales estimates and the stock was crushed. It went from about 440 to 230 a share. But our research let us be marginal buyers in that lurch. We were confident in the caliber of management. We bought a distressed stock in a great long-term franchise (between May and July 2012 between 380 and 400). Later, they began to execute and sales improved. (We added to our position) through the beginning of October 2012 at prices between 284 and 330.
"
856,ISRG,"IBD: Is Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) another example? You added a big chunk to your stake a few quarters ago.
"
857,ISRG,"Caruso: They have a great core competency in technologies that are increasingly desired by clients: in the cloud and in mobility. It's been growing in the high teens and low 20s for years. It has no debt, and it has excess cash.
"
858,ISRG,"After putting up a strong quarter, they got caught up in the immigration debate. They rely on a lot of foreign visas to conduct their business. The stock went down about 25% in a heartbeat.

859,ISRG,"That was an opportunity for us to reload. In the spring of 2012 we started initiating. The stock broke down into the high 50s (from 78). We met with Cognizant managers for three or four hours, and we left convinced they still had a great business and plan. The stock moved higher. The immigration debate percolated, and we bought in the 60s. Now it's in the 90s.
"
860,ISRG,"IBD: Are you looking for investment opportunities created by the prospect of the Federal Reserve tapering its bond buys?
"
861,ISRG,"Caruso: We don't try to overthink the macro environment. So our marching orders to our analysts are to focus on company fundamentals.
"
862,ISRG,"But when (Fed Chairman Ben) Bernanke started the tapering discussion, after having underperformed the broad market and value in particular the prior 12 to 15 months, growth securities started to do well. So the market response to tapering seems to have catalyzed a shift on the margin to growth stocks.
"
863,ISRG,"IBD: Is that because growth stocks tend to have more foreign exposure?
"
864,ISRG,"Caruso: Yes, growth stocks generally have a little more exposure to foreign earnings growth. And U.S. value stocks have more exposure to, let's say, earnings that are fueled by Federal Reserve stimulus steps. This is speculation on my part, but the discussion regarding tapering might auger well for future growth stock performance.
"
865,ISRG,"IBD: Computer services, software and systems are your largest category of holdings at 12.36% of assets. Why do you expect good things from them?
"
866,ISRG,"Caruso: Cognizant is one, with close to a 4% weighting. The portfolio is built around companies like that and Google (GOOG). We think of Priceline (PCLN) as a service company. Some people think of it as a technology company.
"
867,ISRG,"Ansys (ANSS) is an engineering simulation software company. People think of this as a company that benefits from innovation.
"
868,ISRG,"In the old days, you had a team of engineers design a new product, build mockups, then software would run calculations that tested stress characteristics. It was on the tail end of the innovation. And it might take weeks to run those simulations.
"
869,ISRG,"Today you can run millions of simulations before you even get to the real engineering side of things.
"
870,ISRG,"IBD: Biotech is your second-largest industry group, with 5.45% of assets. Why are you focused there?
"
871,ISRG,"Caruso: Biotech came out of a very long, severe stock price underperformance. Now we're seeing far greater pipeline productivity emerging from a couple of leaders. We've centered our investments on Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Gilead (GILD). Each is in a different area of disease management.
"
872,ISRG,"Biogen has been mostly a multiple sclerosis story. They've come to market with a new oral medicine called Tecfidera, which has experienced one of the most unbelievably successful product launches in pharmacology history. But (investors) have been so focused on MS that they haven't paid attention to some of the products that are in development.
"
873,ISRG,"There is a hemophilia product (Eloctate) that we expect to launch in mid-next year. It has the opportunity to take share from Baxter (BAX) and drive growth. And there's upside left for Tecfidera for a long time to come.
"
874,ISRG,"Gilead is basically an HIV and hepatitis C story. It has new product launches on the horizon. We expect Gilead to remain dominant in HIV in the near- to midterm. Their hepatitis C portfolio is starting to contribute meaningfully to corporate growth.
"
875,ISRG,"Celgene is a multiple myeloma story, a cancer story. We see expanding use of the marketplace.
"
876,ISRG,"All of these companies were coming off of pretty conservative valuations for the kind of growth we envision them experiencing for the next couple of years.
"
877,ISRG,"IBD: Why did you trim your Facebook (FB) stake recently? You could not have foreseen the pullback that began in mid-October.
"
878,ISRG,"Caruso: The stock had an amazing run after reporting Q2 earnings. They demonstrated great acceleration in their mobility business, which people got excited about. The stock doubled in a short time.
"
879,ISRG,"We made a meaningful reduction in exposure in that euphoria. It had become close to 3% of the portfolio. So we cut our position roughly in half. It is roughly 1.5% today.
"
880,ISRG,"Their 20% fall? The stock had gone up the day they reported earnings. Then management talked about the need to spend more on investing in people and their product. A lot of highly valued, high-growth companies have seen similar price corrections.
"
881,ISRG,"I'm comfortable owning the stock. At the right price, we're getting back in.
"
882,ISRG,"IBD: Michael Kors (KORS) is relatively new for you. Are you concerned that earnings-per-share growth has sharply decelerated in recent quarters?
"
883,ISRG,"Caruso: We're always concerned about decelerating growth rates. But Kors' decline is to a less-than-extraordinary level. That's still better than a lot of companies. The stock is reasonably valued for the kind of growth we envision. They have opportunities in Europe and elsewhere overseas. Kors is seen as differentiated here and overseas.
"
884,ISRG,"IBD: Any surprise to Starbucks' (SBUX) accelerating EPS growth?
"
885,ISRG,"Caruso: No. They're just an unbelievable company. They're one of the few that has been able to consistently reinvent themselves. They've done a brilliant job of expanding their product offerings in small footprint stores, in being first to market in using new technologies to connect to their customers and their rewards programs are best in their class.
"
886,ISRG,"IBD: Precision Castparts (PCP) is up this year, but you've done some trimming. What are your concerns?
"
887,ISRG,"Caruso: They are persistent in acquiring businesses that let them leverage their own infrastructure. And they're an important supplier to Boeing (BA) on the 787. They generate about $10 million of content on every 787 that Boeing ships. Part of our reduction is that we own both companies. If we sell, it probably will be out of Boeing. Precision has lagged Boeing, so Precision has more upside.
"
888,ISRG,"IBD: Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) is way down this year. Yet you've added to your position in some recent quarters. Are you still optimistic?
"
889,ISRG,"Caruso: This has been the most disappointing stock in the portfolio in 2013. The interest we had was centered on the uniqueness of their business. There are no competitors at their scale. Robotic surgery is here to stay and will continue to grow.
"
890,ISRG,"Procedure growth continues to expand at a midteen clip year over year. The issue with execution relates to installation sales, which has slowed, especially in the U.S.
"
891,ISRG,"We expect a couple more tough quarters. Procedure growth will continue in the 16% area. There's no competition. Unbelievably high margins, big share buyback, no debt. Hopefully, it will be a contrary growth stock that recovers.
"
892,ISRG,"IBD: Are you concerned that LinkedIn's (LNKD) EPS growth has slowed for two quarters?
"
893,ISRG,"Caruso: They've brought a new (advertising product for mobile devices) to market. It will help their growth rate re-accelerate into next year. Like we did with Facebook, we made decent sales in the summer on the market euphoria around this stock. We're more interested in finding a price to re-engage LinkedIn than Facebook.
"
894,ISRG,"We think of it as a core holding, a business that's tough to replicate due to their network effect and LinkedIn managers who think of this as a business and want it to be profitable. It's a good business that is richly valued. It will grow into that. So getting the entry and trim points right is important.
"
895,ISRG,"IBD: Noble Energy's (NBL) EPS growth has soared the past two quarters. But tumbling crude oil prices have doused energy producer stocks' spark lately. This stock has pulled back about 10% since Oct. 30. Why stick with it?
"
896,ISRG,"Caruso: Noble is one of the best-positioned energy companies by way of its fracking inventory. Overseas — in Israel and Africa — they have unbelievable reserves. And they are really good operators, really focused on creating value.
"
897,ISRG,"Energy firms are more volatile than what we typically engage, but this company's assets are special.
"
898,ISRG,"We've seen a reduction in underlying commodity prices, so we would welcome an opportunity to buy some of this back, make it larger in the portfolio. It's not quite at a point where we would start buying it back.
"
899,ISRG,"IBD: What's the biggest change you've made since taking this fund's helm in February 2012?
"
900,ISRG,"Caruso: Basically, our perception of growth is linked to a company's ability to create long-term value. So our focus is further forward than many other investors' focus is. It's more on the economics of business and profitability than on the hunt for earnings growth, which is sometimes very episodic. We're still looking for opportunities in large-cap growth. But we're focused on the longer term.
"
901,ISRG,"IBD: What was the fund's prior time horizon?
"
902,ISRG,"Caruso: I can't say, but it was probably more consistent with most growth managers'. Annual turnover in growth portfolios is often 100% to 150%. We're trying to do closer to 50%. We want great franchises that have the ability to win over a very long time. I tell my analysts I want them to understand how companies are competitively differentiated. I don't want them spending their time trying to anticipate when a bad business is a good stock.There are two keys to Frank Caruso's investment strategy.First, the lead manager of $2 billion AllianceBernstein Large Cap Growth directs his team to seek what he calls dynamic gaps.Those gaps are big differences between how fast Caruso's team expects a stock's earnings to grow and Wall Street's consensus expectation.The second key is where Caruso has his team look for that gap: four to five years out.Caruso is adamant about avoiding a focus on the near term.This approach had the fund up 32.46% this year through Nov. 30. That topped 78% of its large-cap growth peers, which averaged 29.96%. The S&P 500 was up 29.12%.Over the past three years the fund's average annual gain is 18.14% vs. 15.70% for its peer group and 17.73% for the big-cap bogey.Caruso, age 57, discussed his investment process with IBD from his office in Manhattan.IBD: How does your search for leading stocks differ from other growth investors'?Caruso: We think of equities generally (in terms of) a combination of growth and capital returns in the form of dividends and share buybacks, which support the valuations of equities over a long period.And we take a long-duration approach to investment opportunities. But most growth investors are dangerously focused on the moment, growth in the short term. We try to exploit this phenomenon where not a lot of analytical work is being done four to five years out.IBD: Give me some examples that show how your tack works, please.Caruso: In the spring of 2012, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) missed a couple of months of sales estimates and the stock was crushed. It went from about 440 to 230 a share. But our research let us be marginal buyers in that lurch. We were confident in the caliber of management. We bought a distressed stock in a great long-term franchise (between May and July 2012 between 380 and 400). Later, they began to execute and sales improved. (We added to our position) through the beginning of October 2012 at prices between 284 and 330.IBD: Is Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) another example? You added a big chunk to your stake a few quarters ago.Caruso: They have a great core competency in technologies that are increasingly desired by clients: in the cloud and in mobility. It's been growing in the high teens and low 20s for years. It has no debt, and it has excess cash.After putting up a strong quarter, they got caught up in the immigration debate. They rely on a lot of foreign visas to conduct their business. The stock went down about 25% in a heartbeat.That was an opportunity for us to reload. In the spring of 2012 we started initiating. The stock broke down into the high 50s (from 78). We met with Cognizant managers for three or four hours, and we left convinced they still had a great business and plan. The stock moved higher.

The company witnessed solid bookings growth, both on a sequential and year-over-year basis.

We are encouraged by Veeva Systems’ consistent efforts in product innovation and launches through R&D. Growing global demand for cloud-based vault applications also boost opportunities.On the flip side, high expenses on the operational side are causing a drag on the company’s margins, partially dampening its revenues. Furthermore, intense competition and a saturating life sciences market are key concerns.

933,ISRG,"Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG  -  Free Report) is one of the top-performing stocks in the MedTech space. Growing adoption of the company’s robot-based da Vinci surgical system and increasing procedure volumes are key catalysts.The stock has rallied 52.9% in a year’s time, against the industry’s decline of 1.5% and the S&P 500 index’s return of 13.5%. The stock has a market cap of $51.51 billion.Let’s find out whether the company can maintain the positive trend.Robot-based da Vinci Unit Driving GrowthThe growing prevalence of minimally-invasive robot-assisted surgeries, self-automated home-based care, use of IT for quick and improved patient care and shift of the payment system to a value-based model indicate higher adoption of Artificial Intelligence in the MedTech space.Intuitive Surgical’s flagship da Vinci surgical system is powered by robotic technology. The platform has bolstered the company’s foothold in the markets of Cardiac Surgery, Colorectal Surgery, General Surgery, Gynecologic Surgery, Head & Neck Surgery, Thoracic Surgery and Urologic Surgery. The da Vinci System has provided minimally invasive surgery to more than 3 million patients worldwide.The company launched an upgrade to its flagship Vinci Xi technology. Notably, the Xi suite is designed to seamlessly integrate future innovations such as advanced instrumentation, surgical skills simulation, software upgrades and other advancements into one dynamic platform. The company can now ship Xi Single-Site, Xi 30-millimeter stapler and Firefly to several countries. Minimally invasive surgery is becoming increasingly popular as it helps patients recover faster, thereby reducing hospitalization costs. Notably, the minimally invasive surgical instruments market is projected to reach a worth of $18.14 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 10.2% (per Markets & Markets).Although high price of the da Vinci system may hinder widespread adoption, we believe that the overwhelming benefits of minimally invasive surgery will compel surgeons and patients to use the system. This will drive the company’s system sales and improve top-line growth in the long run.In the first quarter of 2018, da Vinci procedures grew approximately 15% year over year. Intuitive Surgical replaced 185 da Vinci surgical systems, up from a 133 in the first quarter of 2017. The company’s installed base grew 13% from the year-ago quarter.For 2018, the company has strong opportunities in the U.S. general surgery market, particularly driven by procedures for hernia repair and colorectal surgery.

937,ISRG,"ResMed, Inc.

Further, the transaction is expected to be immaterial to ResMed’s consolidated financial results.Buyout Integration & SynergiesPer ResMed, HEALTHCAREfirst’s solutions, comprising electronic health record (EHR) software, billing and coding services, and advanced analytics, complement Brightree’s (ResMed’s wholly-owned subsidiary) line of software solutions. Integration of HEALTHCAREfirst’s solutions with ResMed’s software-as-a-service (SaaS) portfolio will enhance the latter’s efficacy in managing the growing population and providing benefits to patients, their families, agencies and payers.A Glimpse of the SaaS BusinessResMed witnessed a 14% year-over-year growth in revenues from the Brightree SaaS business in the last reported quarter. Notably, the company has been actively working on chronic disease management algorithms, including population health models, health care analytics, care co-ordination and SaaS models for home health, home nursing and hospice.

Notably, OASIS stands for Outcome and Assessment Information Set.ResMed is also expanding its range of out-of-hospital software offerings through the acquisition of software-as-a-service businesses for home health, home nursing and other alternative care settings. We believe this buyout will help ResMed solidify its SaaS portfolio.Market Potential Per ResMed, a rapidly aging population, growing incidence of chronic conditions along with changes in the trend with higher inclination toward homecare and other lower-cost care settings will continue to provide impetus to the home health and hospice segments.Going by a Stratistics MRC report published by Reuters, the global home healthcare market is expected to reach a worth of around $494.78 billion in 2023, at a CAGR of 10.1% from 2016 to 2023.

938,ISRG,"President Donald Trump’s calling off of the summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last Thursday was quite a shocker.The abandonement of summit plans dealt a blow to the underpenetrated and emerging markets of Asia, which are a solid source of revenues for more than 80% of U.S.-based multinational companies. The effects of the political mayhem caused the MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan, South Korea’s KOSPI and Japan’s Nikkei to plummet.Major Wall Street indices, S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, lost ground as well.Considering this trend of downward movements, the White House decided to conduct the meeting. The United States announced its plans to send a “pre-advance team” to Singapore to prepare for Trump-Kim summit on Jun 12.MedTech appears to be one of the very few sectors that might shelter investors from the political tension. Shrugging off the current volatility, the Medical-Products industry has returned 0.2% since the call-off against the S&P 500’s fall of 0.4%. In fact, analysts believe that the MedTech sector will be able to strengthen its foothold at a faster rate if the meeting goes on as planned.This is because there are a number of U.S.-based MedTech companies operating in Asia. Post the success of the summit, these companies will be able to spread their network in North Korea and augment overall production. Per research by Statista, the MedTech market in the Asia-Pacific region is estimated to reach a worth of around $78 billion in 2018.Buoyed by the encouraging projections, it would rather be interesting to see how the Medical-Product companies are placed amid the political turmoil.4 MedTech Stocks to GainMeanwhile, the Medical-Product companies have already been gaining from organic growth, R&D innovation, higher consolidation, tax abolition as well as focus on emerging markets including Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam, India, Philippines and more.In fact, stakeholders in the medical universe have been eyeing these markets over the last couple of years. These companies are bullish about growing medical awareness, economic prosperity, an aging population, increasing wealth, government’s focus on healthcare infrastructure and expansion of medical insurance coverage in the APAC space.Below, we take a look at four leading MedTech players that are gaining from the prospects in the APAC market:Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report), popularly known as BD, particularly focuses on broader emerging markets like India, China, Brazil and Turkey, whose economic and healthcare sectors are growing rapidly. In particular, safety-engineered products continue to drive growth in the emerging markets. We believe that exposure in these markets will boost the top line, which in turn will accelerate EPS growth.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have returned 16.2% in a year, significantly higher than the S&P 500 index’s gain of 11.4%.Baxter International’s (BAX  -  Free Report) solid presence in Asia, precisely India, is worth a mention. The company has research hubs in Japan and China. Recently, Baxter completed the acquisition of India-based Claris Injectables, a global generic injectables pharmaceutical company, for almost $625 million.This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has outperformed the S&P 500 index in a year’s time. The stock has returned 21%. Intuitive Surgical Inc’s (ISRG  -  Free Report) growing interest in the emerging markets, specifically in the APAC region, bodes well. In the past two years, the company’s procedure performance in Asia projected consistent strength. The company registered solid growth in China, Japan and Korea.The Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company’s shares have returned 49.1% in a year. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Boston Scientific Corporation’s (BSX  -  Free Report) growth strategy comprises the pursuit of development opportunities outside the United Station through strengthening of global presence, inclusive of emerging markets. Against the backdrop of flattening or declining sales growth in developed markets like the United States and Europe, Boston Scientific is fortifying its foothold in the emerging markets of Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRIC).In first-quarter 2018, business from the emerging markets registered 17% growth. Business in China was once again remarkable (up 23% year over year). The company is currently projecting an improvement in performance in China banking on the recent approval of SYNERGY.This Zacks Rank #2 stock has returned 11.7% in a year. Things to Remember“Things are not so easy as they appear to be!”Americans should never forget that former president George W. Bush referred North Korea as an ‘Axis of evil,’ as it sponsored terrorism and had solid access to nuclear weapons.Further, North Korea's multiple trials of nuclear warheads have dampened the inter-country relationship. Analysts believe that an unforeseen summit may not solve these age-old problems. Further, no one can guarantee that Kim Jong Un’s ‘tremendous anger and open hostility’ will not offend Trump anymore as it did last week.However, Trump’s team is expecting to reach an agreement to settle the North Korean nuclear and other issues in the meeting.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

The company’s growing prospects in the fast-expanding market for prostate cancer tests are also encouraging.Per a report by BCC Research, the prostate cancer global market is estimated to reach a value of worth $65.1 billion by 2021, up from $47.2 billion in 2016 at a CAGR of 6.6%.

While the same in Europe, Asia and other markets rose 16% year over year at CER. Growth was particularly strong in France and Japan across Europe and Asia on the back of the connected health solutions adoption including AirSense 10, AirCurve 10, AirView and myAir.

This should further accelerate the uptake of ResMed’s dental devices by 35%, which help treat sleep apnea.ResMed Inc. Price ResMed Inc. Price | ResMed Inc.

944,ISRG,"On May 28, we issued an updated research report on IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report). The company’s robust worldwide commercial capabilities and best-in-class products including the next-generation chemistry analyzer, Catalyst One, are key growth drivers over the near term. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).This leading molecular diagnostic company has outperformed its industry. The stock has increased 11.6% against the industry’s 13% decrease.Notably, IDEXX exited the first quarter of 2018 on a strong note with better-than-expected earnings and revenue improvement. Solid year-over year growth in organic revenues and a raised EPS guidance for 2018 were also encouraging. This stellar performance was driven by robust sales at the Companion Animal Group (CAG) business, fueled by a firm global Catalyst uptake.  International revenues in the first quarter were up 11% organically, driven by 13% organic gains in international CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. This reflected continued consumable revenue gains, supported by Catalyst instrument base, increased average testing utilization and sturdy growth in European lab revenues.The companion animal market fundamentals remain safe and sound with tremendous global runway for growth. Additionally, we are upbeat about the company’s expanding premium instrument base in the United States as well as the international markets including growth in competitive instrument placements, increasing utilization and a consistent customer retention.IDEXX’s innovation-based, multi-modality global strategy enabled by enhanced commercial capability accelerated recurring CAG Diagnostics revenue growth in the reported quarter. Moreover, the company’s healthy top-line growth was driven by considerable contributions from its rest of the business segments.Additionally, the company boasts a strong cash balance, which allows it to carry out share repurchases.Meanwhile, majority of IDEXX’s consolidated revenues is being derived from sale of products in the international markets. Thus, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar’s exchange rate, relative to other currencies, had a negative impact on revenues derived in currencies other than the U.S. money as well as on profits drawn from products manufactured in the United States and sold internationally. For 2018, adverse currency translations affected adjusted earnings per share to the tune of 4 cents. Also, the company’s heavy dependence on third-party distributors is a drag.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), Illumina, Inc (ILMN  -  Free Report) and Amedisys, Inc.

945,ISRG,"Home to more than half of the world’s population, Asia Pacific or APAC, has significant unmet healthcare needs and holds attractive growth potential for the MedTech bigwigs. Adding further optimism to this corner of healthcare is Trump’s clear focus on this market.Per an article published on Economic Times, the Asian healthcare market is expected to grow from $1835 billion in 2016 to more than $2660 billion by 2020. The upside can be attributed to improved access to healthcare facilities amid increased government and private investments.US-China Trade WarMeanwhile, investors are concerned about the ongoing trade dispute which can severely hurt U.S. MedTech companies’ profits in the emerging market.Accusing China of unfair trade practices, President Donald Trump has imposed tariffs on another $200 billion of imports from China just days after slapping punitive duties on $34 billion of Chinese goods. This was followed by an immediate retaliation by China, which imposed tariffs on U.S. exports of $3 billion. The blow followed Trump’s proposal of implementing tariffs on more than $500 billion worth of Chinese goods.Per an article by Christian B. Jones in Mondaq, MedTech firms in the United States currently sell $4.7 billion worth of medical devices annually to China and import a total of $5 billion.Going by a JP Morgan report, the trade war can bring collateral damage to countries closely tied to China’s supply chain, including South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia Singapore and Thailand.India & Korea Relations Raise HopeAmid the trade-war uproar, Trump’s latest stance toward the rest of APAC has been a breather for investors. In his last landmark Asia trip, Trump revealed stronger reliance on India as a strategic partner. In fact, he sees India at the heart of his Asia policy.In keeping with this, Trump’s new policy on lowering drug prices can have a positive impact on the U.S.-India bilateral trade relations. This can further help fix prices of certain exorbitant pharmaceuticals and medical devices.An Emergo article shows that the Indian medical device market was valued at $3.5 billion in 2015 and can expand to $4.8 billion by 2019. Moreover, a Business Standard article suggests that India’s import of medical devices from the United States grew from INR61.5 billion in 2014-15 to INR74.2 billion in 2017-18.Meanwhile, U.S. ties with North Korea seem to be improving. In the recent historic summit with President Kim Jong-un, Trump put the age-old war tactics on hold with Korea.In the summit, Trump swore to provide security guarantees to the DPRK (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) and complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.The successful nuclear talks are likely to pave the way for a mutually beneficial trading relationship beginning at some point in the future.Per data published on the Korea Country Commercial Guide, in 2017, total imports of medical devices by Korea grossed $3 billion, with the United States contributing more than $1.4 billion. Furthermore, the U.S. market share represents approximately 47% of the Korean import market.Choosing the Right StocksWhile the economy is gradually focusing on the lucrative Asia-Pacific market, it is the right time for investors to cash in on the opportunities in this market. We have shortlisted a few medical device stocks which have carved out a niche in the Asian market. Such stocks are likely to log massive gains, given their solid stand in the APAC region at present.Our first pick is Baxter International (BAX  -  Free Report) which has a solid presence in Asia, with research hubs in Japan and China. The company’s renal care team recently launched KAGUYA peritoneal dialysis technology in Japan. In 2017, Baxter completed the acquisition of India-based Claris Injectables, a global generic injectables pharmaceutical company, for almost $625 million. The buyout bolstered Baxter’s foothold in the generic pharmaceuticals space. In the same year, Baxter signed an agreement with India-based Dorizoe Lifesciences for the expansion of its generic injectables pipeline.The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has outperformed the industry in a year’s time.

Moreover, for Align Technology, China stands second to the largest market — United States. The company also introduced a clear Aligner solution for teen Class II correction — the Invisalign Technology Teen with mandibular advancement — in certain markets of APAC. The FDA approval for the same is expected in the second half of 2018.Over the past year, shares of Align Technology have skyrocketed 138.4%, compared with the industry’s rise of 6.5%.Investors can also consider Intuitive Surgical Inc.

946,ISRG,"With a market capitalization of approximately $56.58 billion, Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG  -  Free Report) continues to benefit from growing adoption of the company’s da Vinci system, increasing procedure volumes, consistent innovation and solid recurring revenue base.However, unfavorable foreign exchange, procedure adoption risk, lower capital spending by hospitals and increasing regulatory headwinds are major concerns.For fiscal 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $3.61 billion, reflecting an increase of 15.2%. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings is pegged at $10.26, showing a rise of 14.1%. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Here we take a quick look at the primary factors that have been plaguing Intuitive Surgical and discuss the prospects that ensure near-term recovery.Intuitive Surgical, Inc. Price and Consensus  Intuitive Surgical, Inc. Price and Consensus | Intuitive Surgical, Inc. QuoteCompetition Mar ProspectsIntuitive Surgical has been enjoying a monopoly in the market for robots used in abdominal surgery since the launch of its flagship device called da Vinci back in 2000.Post the regulatory approval of Transenterix's surgical robot for abdominal surgery in 2017, competition for Intuitive Surgical has intensified. Reports suggest that the news had a negative impact onthe company’s price movement, even though the device is not expected to compete directly with da Vinci.MedTech giant Medtronic is another major threat. Per sources,the company has been working on its surgical robot and plans to launch it in 2018.Why Should you Hold?The da Vinci surgical system enables minimally-invasive surgery that helps avoid the trauma associated with open surgery. The da Vinci System is powered by robotic technology that allows surgeon’s hand gestures to be translated into smaller, precise movements of tiny instruments inside the patient’s body. da Vinci has bolstered the company’s foothold in the  markets of Cardiac Surgery, Colorectal Surgery, General Surgery, Gynecologic Surgery, Head & Neck Surgery, Thoracic Surgery and Urologic Surgery. The system has facilitatedminimally invasive surgery to more than 3 million patients worldwide.Recently, the da Vinci Surgical System has been observed to cure patients diagnosed with inguinal hernia.The company launched an upgrade to its flagship Vinci Xi technology — da Vinci X — recently. Notably, the Xi suite is designed to seamlessly integrate future innovations, such as advanced instrumentation, surgical skills simulation, software upgrades and other advancements into one dynamic platform. The company can now ship Xi Single-Site, Xi 30-millimeter stapler and Firefly to several countries.Minimally invasive surgery is becoming increasingly popular as it helps patients recover faster and reduces hospital costs. Notably, the minimally invasive surgical instruments market is projected to reach a worth of $18.14 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 10.2% (Markets & Markets). Although high price of the system may hinder widespread adoption, we believe that the benefits of minimally invasive surgery will propelsurgeons and patients to use the system. This will drive the company’s system sales and improve top-line growth in the long run.Favorable Share Price MovementIntuitive Surgical has outperformed the industry in a year’s time. The company’s shares have surged almost 50.8%, against the industry’s decline of 2.4%. The current level is also higher than the S&P 500 index’s rise of 12.9%.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Genomic Health (GHDX  -  Free Report), Abiomed (ABMD  -  Free Report) and Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report).Genomic Health has an expected earnings growth rate of 187.5% for the current quarter.

The stock has been outperforming its industry over the past six months. Per the latest stock movement, it has gained 12.2% against 8.1% decline of the broader industry.QIAGEN ended the first quarter on a solid note. We are impressed with the year-over-year growth in majority of the segments. The company has been proceeding with its test menu expansion strategy. In this regard, in April, the company announced the receipt of pre-market approval by the FDA for PartoSure. In the same month, the company launched QIAstat-Dx in Europe following the closure of the recently-announced Stat-Dx acquisition and completion of defined development activities by Stat-Dx. We are also upbeat about QIAGEN’s Molecular Diagnostics sales that have been growing significantly. During the first quarter, the company witnessed double-digit CER growth in revenues from the QuantiFERON latent TB test along with strength in Personalized Healthcare following rising sales of infectious disease testing products.We also look forward to the implementation of the recently-drawn strategies to boost top-line contributions from the NGS portfolio.Meanwhile, QIAGEN faces stiff competition from firms that provide competitive pre-analytical solutions and other products. The markets for some of the company’s products are very competitive and price sensitive, which add to the concerns.Also, strong reliance on collaborations and declining HPV sales in the United States are other negatives.A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), Illumina, Inc (ILMN  -  Free Report) and The Cooper Companies, Inc.

953,ISRG,"Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) recently announced the initiation of a clinical study — The Bifurcation Cohort — to evaluate the efficiency and safety standards of drug-eluting stents (DES) for treating bifurcation lesions.Study in DetailsThe Bifurcation Cohort, part of the RESOLUTE ONYX Post-Approval Study, will cover 250 patients with bifurcation lesions from 30 sites in the United States and Europe. It will be enrolling patients suffering with coronary artery disease (CAD) and receiving Resolute Onyx DES in diameter sizes varying from 2.0-5.0 mm. Notably, the Resolute Onyx DES is not approved for treating bifurcation lesions in the United States. Further, the primary endpoint for the study will be target vessel failure at 12 months.Per Medtronic, data from the study will be submitted to the FDA for expanded indication approval including bifurcation lesions for the Resolute Onyx DES. Further, the company stated that bifurcation lesions are responsible for 20% of all percutaneous coronary interventions. Thus, we believe the positive data will provide impetus to the company’s efforts to achieve expanded FDA approval for the Resolute Onyx DES and accelerate business growth.CSH PerformanceMedtronic is consistently trying to enhance its Coronary & Structural Heart (CSH) segment, which is part of the Cardiac & Vascular Group (CVG) segment.CSH revenues in third-quarter fiscal 2018 were up 14% at CER (18% as reported) on low-30s constant currency growth in transcatheter aortic valves as a result of strong customer uptake of the CoreValve Evolut PRO platform and expanded FDA approval to include patients at intermediate risk.Moreover, continued uptake of the Resolute Onyx drug-eluting stent in the United States and Japan revived the business.We encouragingly note that Medtronic recently received FDA nod for the U.S. launch of the Resolute Onyx 2.0 mm drug-eluting stent. The stent is the smallest in size in the market presently. The Resolute Onyx DES is available for use in all sizes in the United States, Europe and in countries that recognize the CE Mark.Market PotentialMedtronic’s strategy to gain traction in the CSH segment seems to be aligned with data provided by Transparency Market Research. Per the report, the global coronary stent market is expected to see a CAGR of 6.6% from 2013 to 2019.More specifically, the DES market within the Coronary stents market is expanding fast. It is estimated to witness a CAGR of 9.54% in the 2013-2019 period. The market is likely to expand 9% in the United States, 10% in the Asia Pacific, and 3.1% in Europe as well as the Rest of the World.Stock Performance Over the past three months, Medtronic has outperformed the industry, gaining 2.7% as compared with the industry’s 1.8%.  Zacks Rank & Key PicksMedtronic currently carries a Zacks Rank # 3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), Illumina, Inc (ILMN  -  Free Report) and The Cooper Companies, Inc.

Earnings also improved 42.7% on year-over-year basis.Revenues totaled $848 million, up 24.7% from the prior-year quarter.

Per management, revenues also gained from around a 2.5% drop in dollar.Segment DetailsInstruments & AccessoriesRevenues came in at $460.3 million, which reflects a year-over-year increase of 20.9%.

The first quarter of 2018 placements include 45 in Europe and 9 in Japan.MarginsGross margin was 71.6%, down 40 basis points (bps) year over year.In the first quarter of 2018, operating income increased 30.1% on a year-over year basis to $346 million.Financial ConditionThe company ended the first quarter with $4.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments, reflecting an increase of $222 million in the quarter, primarily driven by cash generated from operations.The company has not repurchased any share in the quarter and has approximately $718 million remaining under its board’s buyback authorization.OutlookThe company has not issued any guidance.However, management feels that U.S. revenues might experience a low single-digit decline because of lackluster performance in the gynecology and benign hysterectomy market.Management also feels that margins will fluctuate due to a mix of newer products of systems and accessory revenues.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been eight revisions higher for the current quarter.Intuitive Surgical, Inc. Price and Consensus  Intuitive Surgical, Inc. Price and Consensus | Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

956,ISRG,"The United States has hit rough waters of late. Few analysts label the troubles as self-invited while others foresee a revolution. Rising trade war tensions between the United States and China are showing no signs of abatement. The issue has escalated to a point where imposition of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs may go up to $450 billion on both the sides.Moreover, President Trump’s mulling over a restriction for Chinese companies when it comes to investing in U.S. tech firms to avert technology export is likely to worsen the scenario. If this wasn’t enough, the United States is urging countries to stop importing oil from Iran by November, raising supply-related concernsFurthermore, Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imported from China, the European Union, Mexico and Canada along with threats of higher tariffs for imported cars and auto parts have raised concerns.MedTech on Stable GroundIn the wake of such a rocky scenario, investors are consistently on the lookout for safer sectors. With tailwinds like favorable consumer behavior, growing demand for liquid biopsy tests along with deferred implementation of an industry-wide Medical Device tax backing the sector, the medical device space seems to be in safer territories. Per Emergo, the U.S. Medical Device industry is likely to be worth $173 billion by 2019.Minimally-Invasive Surgical Device Market Hogs LimelightFor investors trying to pick a sub-industry with booming prospects, the minimally-invasive surgical device market is the final stop.Reduced stay at hospital, lower healthcare costs and pain, scaring and tissue-damage  are certain benefits of opting for minimally-invasive surgery over the traditional process.Persistence Market Research estimates the global minimally-invasive surgical device market to value around $18,900 million in 2022, at a CAGR of 6.8% between 2017 and 2022. Per a report by Mordor intelligence, the U.S. minimally invasive surgery device market is projected to see a CAGR of 8.65% between 2018 and 2023.Factors Driving the MarketThe minimally-invasive surgical device market is largely dependent on the aging population. Per the U.S. Census Bureau report, in 2050, people aged 65 or more are likely to total 83.7 million, almost double its estimated population of 43.1 million in 2012. Data also shows that the median age is increasing in most areas of the country and the global scenario is pretty similar.Strengthening emerging markets have been contributing largely to the rise in demand for minimally-invasive surgical devices. Geographically, the market is divided into North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia-Pacific, and Middle East & Africa. Per Wise Guy Reports, the demand for minimally-invasive surgical devices will be solid in the Asia-Pacific region, the expected CAGR being 12.2% between 2016 and 2021.The growing dominance of AI applications in healthcare and technological revolution, new avenues and opportunities in the minimally-invasive surgical devices space with robot-assisted surgeries being in vogue. In this context, the first generation of surgical robots is being installed in a number of operating rooms globally.Stocks to Watch Out ForWe have picked three companies, which we believe can help tap the booming prospects of the minimally-invasive surgical devices market.Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

957,ISRG,"Of late, Medtronic plc's (MDT  -  Free Report) spine business has been registering soft performance due to a challenging market scenario. Let us see if there is any possibility of a rebound this time around. The company is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and fiscal 2018 results before the opening bell on May 24.Click here to know how the company’s overall Q4 performance is likely to be.Spine at a GlanceIn the last reported quarter, Medtronic’s spine division was flat year over year. Despite a mid-single-digit growth in BMP (Bone Morphogenetic Protein) at CER, a low-single digit decline in Core Spine hampered overall sales.However, the company noted that though growth was sluggish, it was in line with the global spine market. Per management, the combination of advanced technologies in imaging, navigation, powered instruments and nerve monitoring has spurred growth in this division. The company has also started to demonstrate positive outcome related to its distribution relationship with Mazor Robotics.Medtronic PLC Price and EPS Surprise Medtronic PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Medtronic PLC QuoteNevertheless, since the beginning of fiscal 2018, Medtronic is suffering from significant pricing pressure in this business, which offset the strong procedural growth. The company believes that this price reduction basically stems from consolidations within hospitals. The company stated that hospitals are getting more sophisticated with their buying patterns and are consolidating their vendor base resulting in price declines.Medtronic expects this competitive pricing pressure to reduce over the next couple of quarters leading to net procedural growth for the company. However, looking at the company’s outlook, we are uncertain of a near-term recovery. The company earlier noted that spine’s broader Restorative Therapies Group (RTG) segment growth may be marred by the impact of a slower spine market in the soon-to-be reported quarter.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderMedtronic currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), Illumina, Inc (ILMN  -  Free Report) and Amedisys, Inc. (AMED  -  Free Report). While Intuitive Surgical and Illumina sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Amedisys carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Notably, the product is the company’s first titanium spinal implant to be built using the 3D printing technology.Zyston Strut Open Titanium System in DetailsThe Zyston Strut Open Titanium System is a family of lumbar cages which are available in various sizes to meet patient’s requirements. Further, this system has been developed to increase the strength, capacity of the graft and visualization of the interbody spacer in spinal fusion cases. It also encompasses surgical instruments which enable insertion, manipulation and elimination of the implants.What is 3D Printing Technology?Also known as additive manufacturing, 3D printing is the process of turning a digital model into a solid three-dimensional physical object by adding material layer by layer (per an article on 3D Hubs). Further, 3D printing has also received a warm response from the MedTech space within healthcare. Notably, research firm Future Market Insights expects the global 3D printed medical devices market to see a CAGR of 18.1% between 2017 and 2027.Zimmer Biomet’s latest offering Zyston Strut Open Titanium System, which is built using the 3D printing process, will allow physicians to develop a unique cage architecture that will maximize graft volume before implantation.In 2016, Zimmer Biomet had announced the receipt of 510(k) clearance for the Unite3D Bridge Fixation System, under its Foot & Ankle business.

959,ISRG,"On May 14, we issued an updated research report on BioScrip, Inc. (BIOS  -  Free Report). Although the company struggles with reimbursement challenges, its core business continues to grow. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).BioScrip exited the first quarter of 2018 on a dismal note with lower-than-expected earnings performance. Although, revenues were above the consensus mark, the huge year-over-year decline was a disappointment. This downside was due to a shift in the company’s strategy to focus on growing core revenue mix including contract changes with United Healthcare in September 2017.Also, external challenges like reimbursement cuts pertaining to the 21st century Cures Act hampered growth in 2017 and the trend is expected to persist in 2018 as well. In the past three months, shares of BioScrip have underperformed the industry. The stock has lost 15.4% against the 1% gain of the broader industry.On a positive note, this Denver, CO-based leading Infusion Service provider has continued to progress with its multi-faceted CORE plan to improve the finances.

This leads to increased price competition for the company as more participants are entering the market. On a positive note, GNC Holdings’ international business has been a key driver of growth in recent years. Management expects to continue capitalizing on international revenue growth opportunities through the addition of franchise stores in existing markets, expansion into new high-growth markets and the growth of product distribution in both existing and new markets.In this regard, GNC Holdings recently announced the receipt of Hayao shareholders’ vote for the strategic partnership and China joint venture agreement with Harbin Pharmaceutical Group Holding (Hayao).

964,ISRG,"On Jun 5, we issued an updated research report on STERIS plc (STE  -  Free Report). The company has been actively trying to expand into the adjacent markets and strengthen its core business through acquisitions and dilutions. However, the company operates in a tough competitive landscape, which is a concern. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Shares of this developer, manufacturer and marketer of infection prevention, decontamination, microbial reduction plus surgical and gastrointestinal support products and services have outperformed the industry over the past three months. The stock has rallied 13.4% against its industry’s 13.1% decline.We are encouraged by STERIS witnessing favorable underlying market trends along with new product and service offerings. The company's strong organic growth across specialty services, life sciences and applied sterilization segments also buoys optimism. Further, growth in free cash flow reserve is indicative of the company’s strong cash balance. The company has also made certain divestments and organizational changes, expected to better align with its operations.  Over the recent past, STERIS has been pursuing growth of its footprint into adjacent markets via acquisitions and dilutions. Following the Synergy Health buyout, the company sold the Synergy Health Healthcare Consumable Solutions (HCS) business to Vernacare in November 2017. The HCS business used to generate roughly $40.0 million of annual revenues.This apart, the company made six consolidations in fiscal 2018. Through these transactions, the company aims at strengthening the Healthcare Products, Healthcare Specialty Services and the Applied Sterilization Technologies businesses. We believe that STERIS can chase back-to-back acquisitions in the long run in order to widen its business and customer base, courtesy of its solid financial position.Meanwhile, STERIS competes for pharmaceutical, research and industrial customers against several large companies with extensive product portfolios and a global reach as well as small entities with limited product offerings and operations in one or a few countries.The company worries over facing fierce competition as new infection prevention, sterile processing, contamination control, gastrointestinal and surgical support products and services enter the market. This might hamper STERIS’ growth considerably.Moreover, multiple STERIS’ clients are undergoing consolidation, partly due to healthcare cost-reduction measures, initiated by competitive pressures as well as legislators, regulators and third-party payors. We think that if the company fails to check its customer consolidation rate now, it will adversely impact its business as well as the financial condition.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), Illumina, Inc (ILMN  -  Free Report) and Varian Medical Systems, Inc.

Far-reaching innovation like gene therapy, newer drug combinations, patient monitoring with the help of big data this year will shape up the medical fraternity of the United States.Tax Suspension to Fuel R&DThe Medical Device market has further gained momentum owing to the recent two-year suspension of the controversial 2.3% Medical Device tax. The 2.3% excise tax was implemented in 2013 as part of Obamacare on MedTech manufacturers, significantly restricting R&D activities.According to an article published in Xtalks, the Medical Device tax was responsible for a $34-million reduction in R&D spending along with a $188-million decline in overall sales.However, it is to be seen whether the tax will be fully eliminated or resumed after the two-year period. For now, the deferral will encourage R&D activity in this space, which bodes well for MedTech companies.Notably, in the past month, the medical instruments industry has rallied 3.8% against the S&P 500 index’s return of 1.5%.R&D Leads to Revolution in MedTechThe MedTech space currently offers unprecedented opportunities for growth and market share expansion. Solid investment in R&D has helped manufacturers use the benefits from big data, artificial intelligence (AI) and medical mechatronics.The industry is also catching up with the digital-data age. Enormous size of data can be captured through technology for arriving at business insights. This helps the healthcare sector provide better care and reduce wastage. The latest trend of adopting electronic health record (EHR) services in the U.S. MedTech space has also been gaining popularity.Some of the major HCIT (Healthcare I.T.) bigwigs, which have carved out a niche in the big-data domain, are Cerner Corporation and athenahealth, Inc. These companies are making significant investments in R&D to boost up their EHR platforms.Meanwhile, medical Mechatronics is a much-awaited digital evolution in the global healthcare industry, providing innovation to the healthcare industry through reduction in the size of the age-old medical devices and development of low-cost disposable devices.Engineering concern eInfochips believes that mechatronics is the future of medical devices. The benefits of Mechatronics have been seen in the form of 3D printing, cancer study and development of better medication for deadly diseases.Notably, Intuitive Surgical’s (ISRG  -  Free Report) minimally-invasive da Vinci surgical system and Stryker Corporation’s (SYK  -  Free Report) robotic-arm assisted surgery platform, Mako, deserve a mention here.Choosing the Winning StocksGiven the favorable scenario, investment in Medical Device stocks with strong potential seems to be a wise choice.

967,ISRG,"On Jun 19, we issued an updated research report on Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report). We are currently looking forward to the company’s modified Rite Aid contract, expected to benefit the company in the long run. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).We are encouraged by the company’s consistent sales increase in the Retail Pharmacy International business. Moreover, Walgreens Boots has been gaining traction from a slew of strategic tie-ups, which brought more patients to its U.S. pharmacies.We are also upbeat about the company’s alliance with Express Scripts, via which, both companies aim to expand respective existing group purchasing efforts. This latest pact is expected to improve Express Scripts’ supply chain and make medicines including biosimilars affordable and accessible to patients.Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price | Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Quote The above positives apart, Walgreens Boots’ decision to buy a 40% stake in China’s Sinopharm Holding Guoda Drugstores looks promising as that should provide a strong impetus to the company’s worldwide retail pharmacy business. The limited number of Rite Aid stores’ acquisitions also impresses us for which, the company has recently secured a regulatory approval.However, Walgreens Boots faces headwinds in the form of fierce competition and tough industry conditions. Even though the company continues to reap benefits from its growth initiatives, major business tycoons are already advancing in pharmacy businesses with a fair market share.Notably, a slowdown in generic introduction over the last few years has been affecting Walgreens Boots’ margins. Also, an escalated reimbursement pressure and a generic drug cost inflation have been hampering Walgreens Boots’ margins significantly.Over the past three months, shares of Walgreens Boots have underperformed the industry. The stock has lost 3.2% against the industry’s 5.6% increase.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Illumina, Inc (ILMN  -  Free Report), Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report) and Chemed Corporation (CHE  -  Free Report).

968,ISRG,"Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) has made another encouraging move with respect to its Aortic & Peripheral Vascular (APV) business. The company recently announced the receipt of FDA approval for 200mm and 250mm lengths of the IN.PACT Admiral Drug-Coated Balloon (DCB) for treating long superficial femoral artery (SFA) lesions in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD).Per the company, in April, Medtronic received approval to treat SFA lesions of up to 360mm in length, on the back of supporting clinical data from the complex lesion imaging cohorts of the IN.PACT Global Study, also covering long lesion, in-stent restenosis and chronic total occlusion groups with lesion lengths >180mm.We note that the IN.PACT Admiral DCB received FDA approval in December 2014, to treat superficial femoral and popliteal arteries. Moreover, it is commercially available in Europe since its receipt of the CE mark approval in 2009. So far, more than 200,000 PAD patients in Europe have been treated with the device.A Glimpse of APV BusinessInterestingly, Medtronic’s revenues from the APV division improved 8.8% year over year (up 4.8% at constant exchange rate) in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018. Moreover, the Peripheral Vascular business grew on a low-single digit. The latest development should boost the company’s performance in this segment.Market ProspectsMedtronic’s strategy, to gain traction in the peripheral vascular sub-segment, seems to be aligned with data provided by MarketsAndMarkets. Per the report, the interventional cardiology & peripheral vascular devices market is expected to see a CAGR of 7.1% to reach a value of $31.47 billion from 2016 to 2021.We believe, the high incidence of peripheral artery disease due to unhealthy lifestyle and aging population, penetration by the companies in the untapped markets, rising need for minimally-invasive angioplasty procedures, technological advancements and increasing awareness among people will continue driving global acceptance for this technology. In view of these encouraging factors, we believe that the company’s development regarding IN.PACT Admiral DCB is strategic and it is expected to broaden its customer base.Share Price PerformanceHowever, over the past month, Medtronic has been underperforming the broader industry. The stock has gained 1.7% in comparison with the industry’s 2.1% increase. Nevertheless, we believe, the latest FDA approval will boost investor confidence in the stock. Zacks Rank & Key PicksMedtronic currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), Illumina, Inc (ILMN  -  Free Report) and Amedisys, Inc.

973,ISRG,"Mechatronics, a high-end technology incorporating electronics, machine learning and mechanical engineering, has been in vogue, of late. With growing prominence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and robotic companies, organizations with significant exposure to Mechatronics have been raking in huge profits. A research by the Business Wire deciphers that the global Mechatronics and Robotics market is projected to witness a CAGR of 15.02% during the 2017-2021 period.Considering the strong exposure of Mechatronics in almost all spheres like technology, automobile, telecom and more, the evolution of Medical Mechatronics has been the most fascinating.The growing prevalence of minimally-invasive robot-assisted surgeries, self-automated home-based care, use of Information Technology (IT) for quick and improved patient care as well as a shift of the payment system to a value-based model indicate the predominance of Mechatronics in the MedTech space.So, let’s delve into details on how Medical Mechatronics has been creating new opportunities in MedTech and raising investors’ confidence to put money in the healthcare space for long-term gains.How is Mechatronics Shaping Up the Healthcare Paradigm?Medical Mechatronics is a much-awaited digital evolution in the global healthcare industry.Medical Mechatronics has provided innovation to the healthcare industry through reduction in the size of the age-old medical devices, development of low cost disposable devices, portability of devices and error free results.Per Hindawi, a renowned Healthcare Engineering journal, the Medical Mechatronics revolution has been one of the most important drivers of the global knowledge-based economies like the United States.Here we take a look at the two major aspects of Medical Mechatronics that have been doing rounds in the global headlines.3D printing & Medical MechatronicsThe best example of Mechatronics in the healthcare industry is 3D printing, which has changed the face of the medical devices industry.Also known as additive manufacturing, 3D printing is the process of turning a digital model into a solid three-dimensional physical object by adding material layer by layer (per an article on 3D Hubs). 3D printing has also received a warm response from the MedTech space within healthcare. Notably, research firm Future Market Insights expects the global 3D printed medical devices market to see a CAGR of 18.1% between 2017 and 2027.Of the major companies, Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report) has been one of the early adopters of the 3D printing technology. The company’s FDA-approved Tritanium TL Curved Posterior Lumbar Cage is a 3D-printed interbody fusion cage intended for use as an aid in lumbar fixation.Robotics Boosting Medical Mechatronics The rise of Mechatronics, powerful computing, improved sensing, microfabrication and molecular imaging has enabled new robotic solutions to mitigate age-old problems for the MedTech companies. These solutions are pain less, error free and inexpensive. So MedTech companies that are using Mechatronic-based robots to cure diseases have a competitive edge with a strong customer base, solid revenues and handsome profits.Of the major companies, MedTech giant Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report) is a notable mention.Intuitive Surgical designs, manufactures and markets the da Vinci surgical system — an advanced robot-assisted surgical platform. This Mechatronic-based platform enables minimally-invasive surgery that helps avoid the trauma associated with open surgery.The company plans to expand the usage of da Vinci in general and thoracic surgery, colorectal surgery and hernia repair in the days to come.Let us take a look at three other MedTech stocks that have been hogging the limelight based on the growing prevalence of Mechatronics and artificial intelligence in the healthcare sector.3 Best MedTech Stocks Riding High on MechatronicsIn this backdrop, three MedTech stocks are well positioned on strong fundamentals and solid exposure to Mechatronics.We have used the Zacks Stock Screener to pick them.

974,ISRG,"On Jun 18, we issued an updated research report on QIAGEN N.V. (QGEN  -  Free Report). The company’s business is expected to get a boost from its flourishing molecular diagnostic market, international expansion, extended test menu and growth-driving strategic collaborations. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).This Netherlands-based molecular diagnostics provider offers innovative technologies and products for pre-analytical sample preparation and molecular diagnostics solutions. Shares of the company have outperformed the broader industry over the past six months. The stock has rallied 14.6% versus the 8% decline of the industry. QIAGEN ended the first quarter of 2018 on a solid note. We are impressed with the year-over-year growth across most segments. The company also delivered a strong performance with respect to the operating margin. Meanwhile, its commitment to return more to shareholders through increased repurchases reflects its sturdy cash position. Expectations of a favorable currency movement in the ongoing year also buoy optimism among investors.We are also upbeat about QIAGEN’s progress with the test menu expansion strategy. In April, the company announced the receipt of FDA’s pre-market approval for PartoSure. In the same month, it launched QIAstat-Dx in Europe following the closure of the recently-announced Stat-Dx acquisition and the completion of defined development activities by Stat-Dx. The company is planning to launch the test in the United States as well as across other geographies in 2019. QIAGEN also launched two novel liquid biopsy panels, namely AdnaTest ProstateCancerPanel AR-V7 Kit and AdnaTest LungCancer Kit.During the first quarter, QIAGEN announced receiving an approval from Japan’s Ministry of Health Labor and Welfare for QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus) as an in vitro diagnostic to detect tuberculosis (TB) infection. Further, the recently-changed guidelines issued by the World Health Organization, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and International Panel Physicians Association will add new impetus to the rising popularity of proactive latent TB screening and treatment.We also look forward to the implementation of the recently-drawn strategies to boost top-line contributions from the NGS (Next Generation Sequencing) portfolio.Meanwhile, QIAGEN is exposed to stiff competition. The company is facing severe rivalry from firms providing competitive pre-analytical solutions and other products used by QIAGEN’s customers. The fact that markets for some of the company’s products are highly aggressive and price sensitive, further aggravates the company’s woes. Also, a heavy reliance on collaborations and declining HPV (Human papillomavirus) sales in the United States are other negatives for this industry player.Zacks Rank & Key PicksQIAGEN currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), Illumina, Inc (ILMN  -  Free Report) and Amedisys, Inc. (AMED  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Intuitive Surgical has an expected long-term earnings growth rate of 12.1%.Illumina expects long-term earnings growth of 19.3%.Amedisys has an expected long-term earnings growth rate of 18.6%.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

975,ISRG,"On May 21, we issued an updated research report on Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. (CSII  -  Free Report). Notably, a number of factors continue to drive optimism for the stock. For instance, the company’s firm position in the coronary arterial disease (CAD) and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) market spaces, positive study results highlighting its effective technologies, an impressive portfolio expansion as well as a strong gross margin scenario. The player carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).This medical device manufacturer, developer and marketer of innovative solutions, which  treat patients with peripheral and coronary arterial diseases including those with arterial calcium, saw a solid third quarter of fiscal 2018. The company witnessed a year-over-year rise in revenues at both CAD and PAD businesses. Also, the gross margin expansion was impressive. Over the past three months, shares of Cardiovascular Systems have outperformed its industry. The stock has surged 32.2% compared with  the 5.1% increase of the industry.The company is putting efforts to innovate products through R&D investments. The market is also looking forward to its recently-launched coronary device in Japan, reflecting the company’s focus on widening international footprint.Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. Price Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. Price | Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. Quote Cardiovascular Systems has been broadening its product portfolio to enhance the market reach. It is currently pursuing product improvement and evaluating new technologies to strengthen and develop its portfolio of powerful micro invasive tools.We are also upbeat about Cardiovascular Systems’ new partnership, which has helped extending its portfolio. The company is now the U.S. distributor of OrbusNeich balloon products. OrbusNeich PCI balloons include the Sapphire II Pro, which has recently received an FDA approval for the 1.0 mm coronary balloon. Moreover, the company has signed an original equipment manufacturer agreement with Integer Holdings Corporation for CSI-branded ZILIENT guidewires.Additionally, we are optimistic about the favorable trends in the PAD and CAD spaces. Per American Heart Association, as many as 8-12 million Americans suffer the PAD syndrome. Moreover, an aging population coupled with rising incidence of diabetes and obesity is likely to aggravate the frequency of PAD complaints. Thus, the company’s growth in these areas offers a huge scope for the unique PAD Orbital Atherectomy System (OAS) of Cardiovascular Systems to address the hitherto unmet needs in the market.On the flip side, the company faces cutthroat competition in the niche space. Its OAS products contend with a variety of other products or devices for the treatment of vascular disease including stents, balloon angioplasty catheters and atherectomy catheters as well as products used in vascular surgery. Larger players contesting in the stent and balloon angioplasty market segments include bigwigs like Abbott Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report). Moreover, on the profitability front, Cardiovascular Systems struggles with a long history of net loss since its inception in 1989 with no immediate recovery in sight. Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report) and Amedisys, Inc. (AMED  -  Free Report). While Intuitive Surgical sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Amedisys carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Intuitive Surgical has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 12.1%.Amedisys has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 17.5%.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

976,ISRG,"Medtronic plc’s (MDT  -  Free Report) Diabetes Group has been on a solid growth trajectory of late, on encouraging contributions from majority of the sub-segments.We expect this strength to reflect in fourth quarter and fiscal 2018 results, which are scheduled to release before the opening bell on May 24.Click here to know how the company’s overall Q4 performance is likely to be.Diabetes in FocusMedtronic’s Diabetes Group presently comprises the Intensive Insulin Management (IIM), Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapies (NDT), and Diabetes Services & Solutions (DSS) divisions. The Diabetes segment develops, manufactures, and markets advanced, integrated diabetes management solutions that includes insulin pump therapy, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems, and therapy management software.We note that management expects double-digit revenue growth in the Diabetes Group in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Per management, consistently strong adoption of MiniMed 670G system in the United States along with enhanced sensor supply capacity will drive the upside.Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Diabetes Group revenues of $621 million indicates a rise of 21.3% from the year-ago quarter. Also, our estimates for Diabetes Group revenues in the United States of $362 million reflect a rise of 19.5% from a year ago.Medtronic PLC Price and EPS Surprise  Medtronic PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Medtronic PLC Quote In the last reported quarter, the segment recorded improvement in sales and benefited from increased uptake of the new sensor-augmented insulin pump systems in the United States as well as in the international markets along with enhanced production capacity for the same. Notably, the MiniMed 670G system has served over 20,000 patients in the United States.This apart, management is optimistic about the uptick in consumable revenues from Animas Corporation’s (one of the Johnson & Johnson Diabetes Care Companies) users in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Moreover, they have stated that the company is progressing well with the smooth transition of Animas users. We expect the trend to continue in the yet-to-be reported quarter as well.During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, Medtronic proceeded with initiatives to boost the performance of its MiniMed portfolio. In February, the company expanded its product portfolio with the addition of MiniMed Mio Advance infusion set. The latest offering in the Diabetes business was planned to be made commercially available in Canada, Hong Kong and certain countries in Europe in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018.In the same month, the company announced that the FDA has approved a new arm indication for the Guardian Sensor 3 continuous glucose monitor (CGM) used with the MiniMed 670G insulin pump. Notably, the Guardian Sensor 3 is the company’s latest and most accurate CGM. Per Medtronic, this is the only sensor to have received an FDA nod for controlling automated insulin delivery via a hybrid closed loop system, the MiniMed 670G.This new arm indication for the Guardian Sensor 3 offers more convenience and flexibility to patients. It is available in the United States for use with the MiniMed 670G system. We believe these developments will be beneficial to the company’s Diabetes Group portfolio, which should get reflected in the yet-to-be-reported quarter results.Let's see how things are shaping up in these sub-segments before the fourth-quarter release.IIM revenues rose in the high-teens at CER in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. However, the company witnessed 15% growth in new patient count in the United States. This growth was led by solid uptake of MiniMed 670G system in the United States with the Guardian sensor 3 CGM. In addition, the division delivered low-20s digit constant currency growth in international markets on account of continued strength in the MiniMed 640G system.Given the developments with regard to the MiniMed 670G system, we expect top-line contributions from the continued uptake of this product to rise and get reflected in the soon-to-be reported quarter results.DSS grew mid-single digits at CER as consumables benefitted from rise in installed base and enhanced patient utilization. The improvement in this business is expected to continue.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderMedtronic currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), Illumina, Inc (ILMN  -  Free Report) and Amedisys, Inc. (AMED  -  Free Report). While Intuitive Surgical and Illumina sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Amedisys carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

977,ISRG,"ResMed Inc. (RMD  -  Free Report) recently demonstrated a favorable outcome from two clinical analyses in the field of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). These studies were conducted for the United Kingdom and the United States, highlighting the cost effectiveness of combining home oxygen therapy with home non-invasive ventilation (NIV) therapy for persistent hypercapnia patients, who suffer exacerbation of COPD.The combo regimen of Home Oxygen Therapy-Home Mechanical Ventilation (a home NIV), together known as HOT-HMV, has been presented at the American Thoracic Society 2018 International Conference. These are company-sponsored health economic studies.Going by the U.K. study, HOT-HMV treatment reduced exacerbation frequency and 28-day hospital readmission. Data from the analysis was used to develop an economic model from the U.K. National Health Service perspective. While the U.S. study demonstrated a 58.3% reduction in 30-day readmissions for HOT-HMV patients compared with those on home oxygen alone. Evidently, this indicated the treatment to be hugely cost effective. Per ResMed, the U.S. analysis was based on the U.K. study. The study finds were utilized to build an economic model from the U.S. payer perspective.  We are optimistic about this entire development by ResMed, taking into consideration the widely growing market for COPD treatment. Per data provided by GBI Research, the global COPD market is currently worth $11.3 billion and is projected to reach a value of $15.6 billion by 2019. According to the research report, this gaping demand will be met through numerous new, efficient and convenient products making inroads into the market.  Undoubtedly, ResMed’s HOT-HMV studies and the related favorable outcomes are a step forward for the company to intensify its footprint in the niche market.Notably, ResMed achieved strong global revenue growth over the past few quarters, led by sales of sleep devices, respiratory care devices, mask systems as well as software solutions. We believe, ResMed’s product launches and strategies will gain traction in the SDB market and are expected to drive growth for the company in the near term.Among recent developments, the company informed about its first self-branded portable oxygen concentrator Mobi, subject to a fiscal third-quarter launch. It has also introduced AirMini, the world's smallest PAP (positive airway pressure) device.In the past three months, ResMed has outperformed its industry. The stock has gained 9% compared with the 5.1% rise of the industry.Zacks Rank & Key PicksResMed currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), Illumina, Inc (ILMN  -  Free Report) and The Cooper Companies, Inc. (COO  -  Free Report).

978,ISRG,"Illumina, Inc. (ILMN  -  Free Report) has been gaining investor confidence on consistently positive results. Over the past year, the company’s share price has outperformed its industry. The stock has gained 54.2% against the industry’s 8.5% fall. Also, the company has outperformed the S&P 500’s 13.2% gain.This renowned sequencing and array-based genetic analysis solution provider has a market cap of $39.64 billion. The company has an earnings growth rate of 20% for the next three to five years.With solid prospects, this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock is an attractive pick for investors at the moment. The company’s estimate revision trend for the current year has been positive. In the past 60 days, 10 analysts revised their estimates upward with no movement in the opposite direction. Resultantly, earnings estimates rose around 5.4% to $4.84. Let’s find out whether the recent positive trend is a sustainable one.Solid Quarterly PerformanceIllumina exited the first quarter of 2018 on a solid note with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. We are also encouraged by the significant year-over-year growth on both the counts. The substantial upside can be attributed to strong consumables growth across Illumina’s sequencing portfolio.New Products Bode WellWe are upbeat about Illumina’s product launches which continue to contribute to the top line. Management is hopeful about the recently-launched NovaSeq S1 flow cell reagent kit. The company also received product approval certificate for the NextSeq 550Dx instrument from the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS) in South Korea.Last November, Illumina introduced NextSeq 550Dx instrument as well. This is the company’s second FDA-regulated and CE-IVD marked next-generation sequencing (NGS) system.Efforts to Grow in Oncology Spacellumina’s collaborations with Bristol-Myers Squibb and Loxo Oncology in the field of clinical oncology applications are expected to garner positive results. The alliance with Bristol-Myers Squibb will utilize Illumina’s NGS technology to develop and globally commercialize in-vitro diagnostic (IVD) assays in support of Bristol-Myers Squibb’s oncology portfolio.We also look forward to GRAIL, Illumina’s recently-developed company focused on the cancer screening market. We believe GRAIL is expected to significantly expand Illumina’s share in the multi-billion dollar oncology market.Geographic ExpansionApart from North America, Illumina markets and distributes products directly to customers in Europe, Latin America, and the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region either through its direct selling force or through distributors that specialize in life science products.In the first quarter, Illumina witnessed 21% growth in the APAC region propelled by 38% shipment growth in Greater China. Obviously, among the emerging markets, China is currently the most favorable space for Illumina’s business.In recent times, management has noticed a considerable increase in demand as customers attempt to set up NIPT operations in China. We believe this recent progress in China will open up avenues for Illumina, thereby enhancing business growth.Other Key PicksOther top-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), Chemed Corporation (CHE  -  Free Report) and Amedisys, Inc.

979,ISRG,"Medtronic plc’s (MDT  -  Free Report) Restorative TherapiesGroup (“RTG”) has been on a strong growth trajectory of late, on encouraging contributions from the majority of sub-segments.We expect this strength to reflect in the fourth quarter and fiscal 2018 results, which are scheduled to release before the opening bell on May 24.Click here to know how the company’s overall Q4 performance is expected to be.RTG in FocusMedtronic’s RTG presently comprises of Spine, Brain Therapies, Specialty Therapies and Pain Therapies divisions. We note that management expects 3-4% revenue growth in RTG business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Per management, this guidance balances the ongoing strength in Pain and Brain Therapies segments with any adverse impact from the weakening spine market.Consequently, RTG’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $2.09 billion indicates rise of 60.8% from the year-ago quarter.Medtronic PLC Price and EPS Surprise  Medtronic PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Medtronic PLC QuoteIn the last reported quarter, the segment recorded improvement in sales, driven by low-double-digit growth in Brain Therapies, mid-single-digit growth in Specialty Therapies and high-single-digit growth in Pain Therapies at CER. However, revenues from the Spine business remained flat at CER on a year-over-year basis.Let's see how things are shaping up in these sub-segments before fourth-quarter results.Brain Therapies: In Brain Therapies, which now includes Neurovascular and Neurosurgery businesses, the company has been witnessing major developments. In the Neurovascular business, which received solid contributions from stroke portfolio in the last reported quarter, Medtronic announced the receipt of FDA approval for the Riptide Aspiration System in January 2018. This adds a valuable tool to the company’s Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) product portfolio benefit of which should get reflected from the yet-to-be-reported quarter itself.Further, in April, Medtronic announced the CE Mark receipt and launch of the Visualase MRI-Guided Laser Ablation System in Europe. Notably, the Visualase system can be used in neurosurgery procedures and provides advanced MRI-guided laser ablation technology. These developments should help the company continue to witness strength in the Brain Therapies business.Pain Therapies: The Pain Therapies division, which now includes Pain (Spinal Cord Stimulation and Drug Pumps) and Interventional Spine businesses, contributed encouragingly to the company’s top line in third-quarter fiscal 2018. Pain Therapies witnessed growth on the solid uptake of Intellis platform for spinal-cord stimulation as well as strength in drug pumps.In January, the company announced the receipt of FDA approval for a new clinician programmer for use with the SynchroMed II Intrathecal Drug Delivery system. Again, in April, Medtronic announced its U.S. launch of OptiSphere embolization spheres, a resorbable embolic platform, developed for embolization of hypervascular tumors.In view of the company’s efforts to develop its Pain Therapies division,we believe that solid trend will continue to reflect in the to-be-reported quarter results as well.Spine: Medtronic’s Spine division includes the Core Spine, BMP and Kanghui businesses. In the last reported quarter, a low-single-digit decline in Core Spine was more than offset by mid-single-digit growth in BMP at CER.Per management, the combination of enabling technologies like imaging, navigation, powered instruments, nerve monitoring and Mazor Robotics with spine implants has spurred growth in this division.We expect encouraging top-line contributions from the business in the to-be-reported quarter.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderMedtronic currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), Illumina, Inc (ILMN  -  Free Report) and Amedisys, Inc.

982,ISRG,"DENTSPLY SIRONA (XRAY  -  Free Report) has underperformed the industryin the last six months. The company’s shares have lost 27.9% comparing unfavorably with the industry’s gain of 5.1%. The current level is also significantly lower than the S&P 500 index’s return of 5.3%.A rapidly changing healthcare environment in the United States, a sluggish first quarter, declining margins and foreign exchange headwinds are significant obstacles for the company.Battered by the above challenges, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter adjusted earnings is currently pegged at 60 cents, down 20% in the last two months. This also marks a 7.7% fall year over year. The stock has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).  Below we take a sneak peek at the major issues plaguing DENTSPLY SIRONA.The company expects gross margins and operating margins to remain flat or slightly down on a year-over-year basis in the coming quarters. This is because underlying margin rate improvement is expected to be offset by foreign exchange effects and headwind from the target inventory equipment reductions.Further, as the company is committed to delivering $100 million in operating cost savings by fiscal 2019, it expects more than half of the amount in 2018. Although the savings should result in increased margin over time, the same in2018 are likely to be affected.By the end of the first quarter of 2018, DENTSPLY SIRONA confirmed that it expects 2018 full-year operating margins to be down between 100 basis points (bps) and 150 bps on a year-over-year basis.In this regard, DENTSPLY SIRONA reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 45 cents in the first quarter of 2018, down 8.2% year over year. The metric beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7.1%.  Net sales fell 1.1% year over year to $956.1 million on a constant-currency (cc) basis. However, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $944.7 million. Management expects adjusted earnings per share for 2018 in the range of $2.55-$2.65, down from the previous range of $2.70-$2.80. Revenues are projected to rise 2% at cc.DENTSPLY SIRONA has solid international presence. Therefore, a strong U.S. dollar, especially against the euro as well as emerging market currencies had a negative impact on results. We believe that currency volatility will remain a headwind for 2018.The company faces significant pricing pressure due to intense competition. DENTSPLY SIRONA conducts its operations, domestic and foreign, under highly-competitive market conditions. The size and number of the company’s competitors vary by product line and regionally.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are ABIOMED, Inc.

984,ISRG,"With the suspension of the controversial 2.3% medical device tax for another two years, the medical device industry is currently riding high on optimism. AdvaMed, the medical device industry’s lobbying group, which strongly advocated for this relief, noted that the tax repeal will provide a huge impetus to the companies to channelize their turnovers into strategic consolidations, research and developments and also help in creating new job opportunities.According to an article published in Daily News, the tax before going into effect from January 2020 will save the device companies as much as $3.7 billion during the two-year suspension.The U.S. medical device market is undergoing substantial transformation. An aging population, longer expectancy for life, growing healthcare awareness in emerging economies combined with powerful long-term tailwinds, including mergers & acquisitions (M&As) and product innovation, have been contributing to growth of the sector.M&A Boom Continues It is yet to be seen how far the benefits of the tax repeal have been redirected to M&As till now. Meanwhile, according to Mark Bonifacio, President of Bonifacio Consulting Services, private equity and strategic OEM (Original equipment manufacturer) buyers are competing for assets in all sectors of medical contract manufacturing and broadening their portfolios or investing in new technologies.He strongly stated that although the start of 2018 was sluggish with respect to M&As, it was due to uncertainties over changes in the global healthcare market and the fate of Obamacare’s medical device tax. Now that the doubts are gradually getting cleared, the industry is once again heading toward another year of significant M&A activity.This year’s biggest M&A deal seems to be in the cards with the Wall Street Journal’s latest rumored news related to two mammoths of MedTech space, Boston Scientific BSX and Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report). The report says that both the rivals may consider a bid for consolidation.The analysts seem to be optimistic about the rumored deal and believe that after the colossal mergers of Medtronic (MDT  -  Free Report)-Covidien and Abbott (ABT)-St. Jude Medical in the last couple of years, Boston Scientific also needs to make a mammoth move to maintain its foothold in the highly competitive medical-technology space.Following the company’s $25 billion consolidation with St. Jude Medical in January, Abbott ABT recently closed the $5.3-billion acquisition of Alere. With the successful wrap up of this transaction, the combined company is anticipated to emerge as a leading player in the $7 billion point-of-care diagnostic space.Another mega consolidation in the recent times was that of medical device major, Becton, Dickinson and Co. and medical, surgical, diagnostic, and patient care devices provider C. R. Bard, for $24 billion. After the completion of the deal in January, Becton, Dickinson is on its way to expand to new areas like vascular access segments – PICCs (peripherally inserted central catheters), midlines and drug delivery ports.Baxter International BAX purchased RECOTHROM Thrombin topical and PREVELEAK Surgical Sealant from specialty pharmaceutical company Mallinckrodt plc (MNK  -  Free Report).Varian Medical (VAR  -  Free Report) also inked a major M&A deal. The company recently signed an agreement to acquire Australia-based global life sciences company, Sirtex Medical Limited for a total deal value of $1.28 billion. The investment will strengthen the company’s position in interventional oncology therapies. This apart, in its effort to gain foothold in the emerging economy, the company recently acquired Cooperative CL Enterprises, a leading distributor of radiotherapy equipment in Taiwan.Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) subsidiary DePuy Synthes inked a deal to acquire Medical Enterprises Distribution in May.This apart, in 2018, Boston Scientific announced several strategic acquisitions including NxThera and nVision in Urology and Pelvic Health, EmCision in Endoscopy, Securus in EP and Millipede in Structural Heart. This inorganic expansion plan bodes well for the stocks’ operational growth.Divestments Medical device majors continue to offload their non-core business lines and assets that are similar to the ones acquired through mergers to focus on the main segments. These divestures have been mandated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and other international anti-trust regulators. This restricts chances of monopoly in the market.Earlier this month, Johnson & Johnson got a $2.7 billion offer from Fortive Corporation to sell its subsidiary, Ethicon, Inc.’s Advanced Sterilization Products business units to Fortive. If JNJ accepts the proposal, it will be a step toward streamlining of its business per its strategic roadmap for better resource utilization and higher shareholders’ return.This apart, according to a MASSDEVICE report, Medtronic recently divested its stake in LifeTech Scientific to China Everbright Ltd. and another unnamed investor. BD also divested its soft tissue core needle biopsy line and Aspira product line to Merit Medical for $100 million. The divestment is related to its acquisition of C.R. Bard.In April, Henry Schein HSIC announced its decision to spin off the company’s major segment global Animal Health business. We believe this initiative remains part of Henry Schein's 2018-2020 Strategic Plans to focus more on dental and medical businesses. According to the company, this transaction will enable it to make the most of the opportunities in the dental space in order to deliver quality clinical care and advanced wellness and prevention.Apprehending that China’s drug distribution reform may slow down the company’s growth in the region (according to a Reuters report), Cardinal Health sold off its China business to Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Holding for $1.2 billion.Following the announcement of its two major buyouts, Abbott divested its eye care business Abbott Medical Optics (AMO) to Johnson & Johnson for about $4.33 billion to streamline its newly added business lines.A marketer of aesthetic treatment systems, Cynosure, sold itself to Hologic. Notably, Hologic acquired all outstanding Cynosure shares for approximately $1.65 billion.Emerging Market Healthcare Scenario Bright A survey report by Gallup Analytics last July revealed that U.S. adults cited healthcare as the second major problem faced by the country under the new presidential administration. Following the new healthcare reform announcement in December 2017, a Gallup poll revealed that the past decade marked the biggest increase in the uninsured rate.Meanwhile, with exploding population, rising middle class and increasing governmental awareness of health issues, emerging geographies are facing huge demand for modern but cheaper healthcare options. Going by a report in The Guardian, International Finance Corp’s (IFJ) data shows that developing countries account for 80% of global deaths from chronic diseases indicating enormous market opportunity.Per a recent BCG report, the share of emerging markets, which is currently less than a quarter of global MedTech revenues, is likely to increase to nearly one-third of revenues by 2022. The MedTech market in China, currently the second largest in the world, is projected to grow about 13% annually from 2015 through 2022. India, the fifth largest MedTech market in the world, currently records 17% annual growth. At this pace, India may emerge as a strong competitor to Japan and Germany by 2022.Given the huge potential in these regions, long back, Johnson & Johnson had set up manufacturing and R&D centers in Brazil, China and India. The company’s emerging markets medical device segment continues to grow three to four times faster than the developed markets.Abbott continues to lead the emerging market investment trend with about 50% of sales from this region. In the recent quarters, sales in key emerging markets were up in double digits, driven by strength in BRIC as well as strong growth in several countries throughout Latin America, including Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Argentina.At Medtronic (MDT  -  Free Report), in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, businesses in Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, Eastern Europe and China showed sustained strength, growing in double digits. Overall, Medtronic’s long-term outlook on emerging markets is encouraging.Boston Scientific’s emerging markets’ business registered 17% growth in first-quarter 2018, reflecting a significant increase from 8% growth in 2013. Business in China was once again remarkable (up 23% year over year).Key Picks from the SpaceIn the medical instrument space, we are positive on ABIOMED, Inc. ABMD and Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

986,ISRG,"The Medical Instrument industry within the broader Medical universe has been gaining on R&D innovation, higher consolidation, focus on emerging market and tax abolition. The industry increased 3.6% in a month’s time, higher than the S&P 500 index’s rise of 2%.Fundamentally, the industry has benefited by a massive change in consumer behavior as well. This is evident from the rise in minimally-invasive surgeries, higher demand for liquid biopsy tests as well as use of IT for quick and improved patient care along with the shift of the payment system to a value-based model.It will be interesting to analyze the best Medical Instrument stocks that are likely to yield solid returns in the days to come. But first, let us glance at the latest headlines from the space. Latest Medical Instrument Headlines at a Glance Stryker’s Takeover Plans of Boston ScientificThe Medical Instrument fraternity has been riding on the current merger and acquisition (M&A) trends.Per a recent report by the Reuters, Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report) is likely to take over Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report), creating a market value of more than $110 billion. However, the possibility of the deal is uncertain. Thre are no confirmatory statements or press releases from the company representatives.In fact, investors should never forget about Stryker’s highly-rumored acquisition plans of Smith & Nephew in 2015, which never materialized. On the brighter side, this is not the first time Stryker has been tied up with Boston Scientific. The company acquired Boston Scientific's neurovascular unit in 2010 for $1.5 billion, which indicates probability of a second collaboration (read more: Stryker Likely to Acquire Boston Scientific).Stryker has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).If the deal materializes, the combined entity will have one of the MedTech’s broadest spectrums of product offerings that include cardiology, orthopaedics, surgical supplies and neuroscience. This will reduce pricing pressure and competition. Further, the companies with a strong acquisition policy will gain from rapidly-expanding customer base, moderate leverage and enhanced cash flow.Glancing at major acquisitions in the recent past, Becton, Dickinson and Company’s takeover of C. R. Bard for $24 billion and JOHNSON & JOHNSON’s buyout of Covidien for about $43 billion deserve a mention.Abiomed Reserves Slot in the S&P 500 Leading Medical Instrument player Abiomed Inc (ABMD  -  Free Report) replaced Wyndham Worldwide Corp and entered the S&P 500 Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) Health Care Supplies Sub-Industry index.Per a research report by The Globe and Mail, Abiomed is following the trend of medical device and technology companies reserving the top slot in the S&P 500 index. To remind investors, Align Technology Inc (ALGN  -  Free Report) topped the index in 2017.Abiomed currently has a market capitalization of $18.6 billion. Further, the company’s financial viability, adequate liquidity, reasonable price and sector representation has lent it a competitive edge in the U.S. Medical Instrument industry (read more: Abiomed to Replace Wyndham in the S&P 500 Benchmark).Tax Abolition Boosting R&DA bipartisan two-year suspension of a ‘Medical Device’ tax, which imposed a 2.3% excise tax on MedTech manufacturers, has been a temporary relief. This tax took a toll on the entire medical device industry since its enactment. Per the Advanced Medical Technology Association lobbying group, this tax had a negative impact on medical innovation resulting in loss or deferred creation of jobs.For now, the deferral will encourage R&D activities in this space. The repeal of the tax paradigm is expected to boost hiring and investment among the 9,000 America-based medical device manufacturers, instilling investor’s optimism. The ratification of the Tax-repeal amendment has invoked massive investment in the sector.3 Top Medical Instrument StocksConsidering the existence of the number of players in the Medical Instruments industry, choosing the right stocks with the potential to yield returns might be a daunting task.Our proprietary Zacks methodology makes it fairly simple for you.We have taken the help of the Zacks Stock Screener to select favorable stocks.

990,ISRG,"On Jun 8, we issued an updated research report on CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report). While increasing demand for PBM (Pharmacy Benefit Management) and specialty pharmacy was a major growth driver for the stock, its dull retail performance over the last few quarters seems to have disappointed investors. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Shares of the company have outperformed the industry in the past three months. The stock has lost 4.3% compared with the 6.3% decrease of the broader industry.CVS Health ended the first quarter of 2018 on a mixed note. While earnings were ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues lagged the same. However, the  top line’s year-over-year growth was driven by a strong Pharmacy Services segment, benefiting from the upside in the specialty services. A strong 2019 PBM selling season was another favorable factor.  Notably, the company is already more than halfway through its 2019 renewals. The retention rate is currently in line with the rates it has witnessed over the last few years.Despite a tough pricing competition, CVS Health currently gains momentum through high levels of service and execution, competitive pricing and a unique integrated model, which allows the company to provide differentiated products and services generating savings, better health outcomes as well as convenience.Moreover, solid year-over-year Retail/LTC comparisons were encouraging. The company is presently moving toward achieving the completion of the Aetna deal. Per CVS Health, this landmark acquisition of the U.S. health insurance giant might introduce a vast change on the Healthcare landscape in the United States. Investors are hopeful about CVS Health’s earning of $750 million drawn from the near-term synergies via the Aetna transaction post its closure.Meanwhile, the company’s commencement of this momentous $69-billion healthcare consolidation is keeping all analysts upbeat. On its successful culmination, CVS Health expects to reap $750 million with low to mid-single digit accretion in the second year post the close of the buyout.On the flip side, the company’s highly competitive retail pharmacy business is a big concern as it faces some stiff rivalry in the pharmacy segment. This is because availability of low-cost pharmacy options and other retail businesses continue to add pharmacy departments in the portfolio. Particularly, discount retailers have made substantial inroads in gaining a major market share. This apart, CVS Health delivered some sluggish numbers within the retail Long Term Care business in the recent past. Per the company, this decision to restrict itself from participating in the TRICARE network and many fully-insured prime networks was due to the negative impact on Pharmacy sales and script comps.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), Illumina, Inc (ILMN  -  Free Report) and Amedisys, Inc.

991,ISRG,"Shares of Orthofix International N.V. (OFIX  -  Free Report) have lost 13% over the past two weeks since the company’s first-quarter 2018 earnings release on Apr 30, 2018.Despite better-than-expected bottom line numbers, shares dropped due to lowered earnings outlook for the company in 2018. Over this period, the company has also significantly underperformed the industry it belongs to. The stock has lost 12.5% against the industry’s 3.7% gain.Let us delve deeper into the earnings details of Orthofix:The company reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 39 cents from continuing operations. The figure was ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.3%. The bottom line surged 44.4% year over year primarily on strong sales growth at the company’s BioStim, Extremity Fixation and Spine Fixation strategic business units (SBU). Excluding one-time items, net income from continuing operations in the first quarter came in at 27 cents per share versus the net loss from continuing operations of 13 cents, thereby showing a remarkable year-over-year improvement.Sales DetailsOrthofix’s first-quarter sales improved 5.8% (up 3.3% at constant exchange rate or CER) to $108.7 million, almost in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $109 million. As a result of the company’s adoption of the revenue recognition accounting change at the beginning of 2018, Orthofix noted that if it converts the consolidated revenues of first-quarter 2017 into the new standard, growth would have been 2.4% at CER in the reported quarter. Sales were primarily driven by a strong performance by the company’s three SBUs, namely BioStim, Extremity Fixation and Spine Fixation, partly offset by a year-over-year decline in Biologics business.SBU DetailsFor the first quarter, the company posted BioStim sales of $46.2 million, reflecting 3.6% (same at CER) growth from the prior-year period. Extremity Fixation sales were $27.5 million in the quarter under review with 14.9% improvement (up 4.3% at CER) from first-quarter 2017. The company realized a continued uptake of new products and a commendable performance in most of the company’s global markets including the United States.Orthofix International N.V. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Orthofix International N.V. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Orthofix International N.V. QuoteOrthofix reported Spine Fixation SBU sales of $20.7 million, reflecting 7.5% (up 7.2% at CER) growth over the year-earlier quarter. This uptick can be attributed to product launches and the adopted strategic initiatives.Biologics SBU sales totaled $14.3 million, down 4.4% (same at CER) from the year-ago quarter. This decline resulted from the contractual reduction in the marketing service fee percentage that Orthofix receives from MTF Biologics.MarginsIn the first quarter, gross margin contracted 23 basis points (bps) to 77.8%. Unfavorable sales mix impacted the quarterly gross margin.Sales and marketing expenses rose 3.6% year over year to $50.2 million. General and Administrative expenses were up 6.6% to $19.5 million. The company witnessed a 6.6% decrease in research and development expenses to $6.9 million. Overall, adjusted operating margin expanded 148 bps to 7.2% owing to increased operating expenses.Cash PositionOrthofix exited the first quarter of 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of $77.1 million compared with $81.2 million at the end of 2017. For the first quarter, net cash used in operating activities was $3.6 million compared with $10.8 million a year ago.2018 GuidanceOrthofix has lowered its 2018 earnings view as it expects Biologic sales to be flat or less by low single digits for the full year due to contractual decrease in the marketing service fee the company is going to receive from MTF Biologics. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations are expected in the range of $1.58-$1.78, falling below the earlier-projected band of $1.76-$1.84. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year adjusted EPS stands at $1.67, within the company’s projected range.Full-year net sales projection has been increased to the band of $458-$464 million (earlier prediction was $450-$455 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year revenues is pegged at $462.7 million, lying within but near the upper end of the guided range.Our TakeOrthofix exited the first quarter of 2018 on a mixed note. While earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate, sales almost matched the consensus mark. Investors are upset about poor Biologics prospects, which will continue to be a drag on the overall performance throughout the remainder of the year. Accordingly, the company has to reduce its full-year earnings expectation.This apart, currency fluctuations, a competitive landscape and macroeconomic headwinds continue to pose challenges to the company. Moreover, higher costs and operating expenses are a matter of grave concern for Orthofix. Also, heavy dependence on a third party for final distribution of products exposes the company to heightened risks. On a positive note, the top line was substantially driven by strength in Extremity Fixation as well as Spine Fixation businesses, which are expected to continue in the near term on the back of sales force enhancements, expanded distributorship network and introduction of products.Zacks Rank & Key PicksOrthofix carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space, having posted solid results this earnings season are, Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), Chemed Corp. (CHE  -  Free Report) and Baxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report). While Intuitive Surgical sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Chemed and Baxter carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

This was fueled by higher dialysis treatments and an increase in U.S. revenues per treatment.The Dialysis Care business grew 5% at cc on a year-over-year basis in the region.

994,ISRG,"In the Global Week Ahead, keep your eye on the trade war ball(s).According to Scotiabank’s watchful FX team, markets will be gradually informed by developments in U.S.-China trade tensions over the coming weeks.China-U.S. trade war tensions likely begin to escalate this week.On Tuesday, the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) will hold a public hearing addressing its proposed list of tariffs on $50 billion of imports from China. The comment period ends on May 22nd.Sometime over the first half of June, the USTR may revise its list of tariffs and send recommendations to President Trump who may then decide to enact the tariffs. Mixed into the fray will be the USTR’s next list of tariffs on another $100 billion of Chinese imports and more hearings in a similar process.Also, Friday will bring the Treasury’s deadline for proposals on restricting Chinese investment specifically related to intellectual property, which seems liberally interpreted. China’s potential retaliations against any U.S. moves would further inflame tensions.In addition, Reuters in London shared these five world market themes, operating across the Global Week Ahead.These themes are what traders and investors there are watching most closely there.(1) Fresh U.S. Retail Sales Numbers Come OutEconomists polled by Reuters see April U.S. retail sales — due this Tuesday, May 15th — growing just 0.4 percent, moderating from March’s 0.6 percent rise.But excluding the automobile sector, sales are expected to increase 0.5 percent, after 0.2 percent in March.The recent U.S. tax changes are estimated to have reduced annual personal taxes by $115.5 billion. That means more money in the pockets of consumers, who drive two-thirds of the economy. Now that the personal income tax season has come and gone, and the bulk of taxpayer refunds has found their way into people’s pockets, did consumers spend more?Economists reckon the data will help shape the debate over how many times the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this year. Bond markets currently are betting on at least two more increases. The combination of extra spending and tax cuts frontloaded the positives, and now we wait to see if it translates into robust economic performance. Traders see the Fed on track to raise interest rates in June after U.S. consumer prices rebounded modestly in April.(2) Oil PricesOil prices are at the highest since 2014 and the surge shows no sign of waning. In fact, $80 a barrel is within sight for Brent crude.The U.S. decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal and re-impose sanctions has pushed the Brent 3% higher this week, its biggest of five consecutive weekly rises. It is now up 60% over the past year.Iranian oil exports should start falling as the new sanctions take hold. Even if other OPEC countries manage to fill that gap, the global oil market is still pretty finely balanced. Brent could reach $90 per barrel in the second quarter next year, Bank of America Merrill Lynch predicts, adding that $100-oil cannot be ruled out.The question is now how this will impact inflation and central bank policy. Inflationary pressures in the developed world remain muted, but economic textbooks suggest not for long.(3) European M&AM&A action has been heating up in Europe, with April recording the highest value of monthly deals in 10 years, according to Thomson Reuters data.This week, we’ve had a private equity firm agreeing to buy Zoopla-owner ZPG, sending its shares to a record high and lifting other online consumer-focused firms such as Auto Trader and RightMove.Japan’s Takeda is buying Shire for $62 billion, and U.S. cable giant Comcast is seeking approval for its bid to buy British pay-TV group Sky.The UK, in particular, is drawing attention from foreign buyers due to the still-depressed levels of the pound and the fact that stocks trade at a discount to their long-run average on a 12-month forward PE basis.Credit Suisse Wealth Management added UK equities to their most preferred markets, while Bank of America Merrill Lynch say they are rotating from Europe to the UK.The Euro Stoxx index is close to fully regaining all the ground lost during the February volatility shock, while the UK’s FTSE 100 is flat on the year, after being down as much as 10 percent some weeks back. Deal-making activity could provide the lift into positive territory for both benchmarks.(4) Italy Has a New GovernmentAfter weeks of wrangling, Italy may soon get a new government made up of the far-right League and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement.But for markets, which have so far taken Italian political risks in their stride, a League/5-Star tie-up is the worst-case scenario; both groups are hostile to EU budget restrictions and have made electoral pledges that would cost billions of euros to implement.No wonder the cost of insuring Italian debt against default have crept up, bond yields have hit 7-week highs and shares are set for their biggest weekly fall in seven weeks.The Italian/German bond yield gap, a key indicator of relative risks, has also widened. But it remains below levels seen before the March 4 election; clearly some investors are still willing to look beyond the politics.After all, a week is a long time in politics and the two parties are yet to agree on who will be prime minister. And a 5-Star member has even hinted the premier may be an independent figure not affiliated to either group.(5) Watch What Happens in Malaysia – After a Big Election WinMalaysian markets re-open next week after investors had two days to chew on a shock election result that saw incumbent prime minister Najib Razak lose to 92-year old Mahathir Mohamad, the end of an uninterrupted six-decade run for the ruling coalition.Offshore markets are uneasy: the ringgit lost 4 percent on the non-deliverable forwards market and an overseas Malaysian equity fund showed a 6 percent drop. The cost of insuring against default on Malaysian debt rose to more than 90 basis points from 78 before the election.The fear is that Mahathir, who was in power for 22 years until 2003, including during the late-1990s financial crisis, will fulfill pledges to remove the goods and services tax, scrap toll fees, reinstate fuel subsidies and renegotiate Chinese investment deals.That would hit budget revenues. Mahathir has also vowed anti-corruption reform, but whether better governance can be achieved remains to be seen. For now, uncertainty takes center stage.Top Zacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY) Stocks—BP PLC (BP  -  Free Report): This $151B market cap oil stock has a Zacks long-term VGM score of A.

995,ISRG,"Chemed Corporation (CHE  -  Free Report) has been gaining investor confidence on consistently strong performance and upbeat results. Over the past three months, the company’s share price has outperformed its industry. The stock has gained 30.1% compared with the industry’s 1.8%. Also, the company has outperformed the S&P 500’s 1% gain.Chemed has a market cap of $5.26 billion. Moreover, it has delivered an average earnings beat of 9.6% in the trailing four quarters.With solid prospects, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock is an attractive pick for investors at the moment.The company’s estimate revision trend for the current year has been positive. In the past 60 days, one analyst revised estimate upward, with no movement in the opposite direction. The magnitude of estimate revision for earnings per share increased around 3.4% to $11.08.Per the Zacks Style Score system, Chemed sports a Growth Score of A, which hints at solid prospects. Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 offer the best upside potential.In this regard, Chemed has a favorable net margin (net income/ sales) of 6.7%, better than the industry’s 2.9%. The projected annual earnings growth rate of 30% compares favorably with the industry’s 23.9%. Moreover, the debt to capital ratio of 20.7% bodes well when compared with the industry’s 42.6%.Let’s find out whether the recent positive trend is a sustainable one.Chemed kick-started 2018 on a solid note, with earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The stellar performance was driven by steady year-over-year revenue growth in both of the company’s subsidiaries.Within Chemed’s VITAS business, management noted that the recent admission trends have been positive and the momentum is expected to continue. During first-quarter 2018, VITAS performed well financially and operationally on an increase in the geographically weighted average Medicare reimbursement rate and average daily census. A decline in Medicare Cap also lent support to revenues.Moreover, we are encouraged by VITAS' median length of stay in the recently reported quarter, which in turn is a key indicator of the company’s penetration into the high acuity sector of the market.The Roto-Rooter business also saw consistent growth on strong performance by the core plumbing and drain cleaning service segments as well as solid growth in water restoration. Further, the company saw year-over-year rise in commercial and residential revenues.Additionally, Chemed’s strong cash balance allows it to carry out share repurchase programs, providing solid returns to investors. Moreover, the expansion in gross and operating margin buoys optimism.On the flip side, reimbursement-related issues, seasonality in business, a competitive landscape and dependence on government mandate pose challenges. Moreover, more than 95% of VITAS’ revenues are payments from the Medicare and Medicaid programs which raises concerns.Other Key PicksOther top-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), Align Technology, Inc.

The figure however outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $187.9 million and was above the company’s guidance of $186-$188 million. The year-over-year decline was however caused by price reductions in long-term contracts related to Hereditary cancer testing.Further, the company believes unfavorable weather conditions across the United States had an adverse impact of around 1-2% on third-quarter test volumes.However, the decline was partially offset by growing new product volumes, better-than-expected hereditary cancer volumes and the success of the company’s Elevate 2020 program. Moreover, this was the fifth consecutive quarter in which the company witnessed year-over-year Hereditary cancer volume growth led by encouraging response to the newly-launched riskScore test under its myRisk Hereditary Cancer testing portfolio.Myriad Genetics, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Myriad Genetics, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Myriad Genetics, Inc. QuoteQuarter in DetailsSegment-wise, Molecular diagnostic tests (92.9% of total revenue) recorded total revenues of $179.7 million, down 3% year over year on account of a 12.4% decline in Hereditary cancer testing revenues to $123.3 million. Also, Hereditary Cancer testing revenues declined due to price reductions in long-term contracts. However, volume growth exceeded the company’s 3% growth target on a year-over-year basis.EndoPredict testing revenues remained flat year over year at $2.3 million in the reported quarter. Vectra DA testing revenues came in at $15 million, up 33.9% year over year, while other testing revenues declined 38.9% to $2.2 million. Further, GeneSight testing revenues rose 27.2% year over year to $30.4 million in the reported quarter. Prolaris tests raked in revenues of $6.5 million in the quarter, up 91.2% year over year.Pharmaceutical and clinical service revenues (accounting for the rest) in the quarter totaled $13.8 million, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 17.9%.Margin TrendsGross margin in the quarter under review contracted 30 basis points (bps) to 77.2%. According to management, the gross margin performance was affected by Hereditary Cancer test pricing issue, partially offset by improved efficiencies in production process a result of the Elevate 2020 program and rising new product reimbursements for Vectra DA and Prolaris tests.Operating expenses contracted 4.4% to $133.6 million as a 5.1% rise in research and development (R&D) expenses (to $18.5 million) was offset by a 5.7% fall in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses (to $115.1 million) in the reported quarter.Financial PositionMyriad Genetics exited the fiscal third quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $157.3 million, compared with $143.5 million at the end of the preceding quarter. Year to date, cash flow from operations totaled $68 million, compared with $69.6 million a year ago. Year to date, the company registered free cash flow of $61.4 million, compared with $64.2 million in the year-ago period.GuidanceMyriad Genetics has raised the guidance for fiscal 2018 revenues to $771-$773 million from $760-$770 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $774.4 million lies above the guided range.On the bottom-line front, the company lifted the adjusted EPS range to $1.19-$1.21 from $1.11-$1.16. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.16 is below the company’s guided range.Management has provided the guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. The company estimates adjusted EPS of 31-33 cents on total revenues of $193-$195 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted EPS is 31 cents and revenues is $197.8 million. While the consensus estimate for earnings coincides with the low end of the company’s guided range, our revenue estimate lies above the projected range.Our ViewMyriad Genetics performed better than expected in third-quarter fiscal 2018. However, the year-over-year decline in revenues is disappointing. On a positive note, the company observed strong growth in both GeneSight, Vectra DA and Prolaris testing revenues. The recent FDA approvals and encouraging test results buoy optimism.On the flip side, unfavorable foreign currency translation continues to pose a threat. With a considerable portion of its revenues coming from outside the United States, the company faces the risk of exchange rate fluctuations.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksMyriad Genetics has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space which have reported solid results this season are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), Chemed Corporation (CHE  -  Free Report) and Baxter International Inc.

Adjusted EPS remained 3.3% ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

QuoteIn the first quarter, the company recorded sales of $2.07 billion in the North American market, up 6.7% year over year. Sales totaled $1.15 billion in the international market, up 17% year over year.Segment Analysis    Henry Schein derives revenues from four operating segments: Dental, Medical, Animal Health and Technology and Value-added services.In the first quarter, the company derived $1.55 billion in revenues from global Dental sales, up 10.2% year over year. This includes 5.2% growth in local currencies and 5% contribution from foreign currency exchange.

This included 4% growth in local currencies and a 2.1% rise related to foreign currency exchange. Acquisitions contributed 1.1% in the quarter under review.Margin Trend         Gross profit increased 8.8% to $895.6 million in the reported quarter. However, gross margin contracted 34 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 27.8% due to a 10.7% rise in cost of sales.  Despite a 9% rise in selling, general & administrative expenses of $685.7 million, adjusted operating income improved 8.2% year over year to $209.9 million. However, adjusted operating margin declined 12 bps year over year to 6.5% in the reported quarter.Financial PositionHenry Schein exited the first quarter 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of $99.2 million, compared with $174.7 million at the end of 2017. For the first three months of 2018, net operating cash outflow was $70.9 million, compared with $52.6 million of cash outflow in the year-ago period.As a result of a blackout period related to the spin-off and merger of the company's Animal Health business, during the quarter under review, the company did not repurchase any shares of common stock. At the close of the first quarter, the company had $200 million authorized for repurchase of common stock.2018 GuidanceExcluding costs related to restructuring and the spin-off and merger of Henry Schein’s global Animal Health business, the company has reiterated its 2018 EPS guidance. The company still expects EPS in the range of $4.03-$4.14, reflecting 12-15% growth from the 2017 adjusted EPS figure of $3.60. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 adjusted EPS is $4.09 remains within the guided range.Our TakeHenry Schein exited the first quarter of 2018 on a strong note with earnings and revenues steering past the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. All four of the company's operating segments recorded strong year-over-year growth. Henry Schein's strong share gains in the North American and overseas markets along with solid revenues raise optimism.Despite the better-than-expected revenue performance, we are disappointed with the year-over-year deterioration in Henry Schein's gross and operating margin due to higher cost of sales and expenses.We currently await the completion of the company’s global Animal Health business' planned spin-off. This business contributes nearly 30% to the company’s topline. The spin off, accordingly, is expected to bring in major changes to Henry Schein’s overall operating results.According to the company, following the spinoff, the Animal Health business will merge with privately-held Vets First Choice to form a new public company called Vets First Corp. We believe, this initiative remains a part of Henry Schein's 2018-2020 Strategic Plan to focus more on dental and medical businesses.Zacks Rank & Key PicksHenry Schein has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space which have reported solid results this season are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), Chemed Corp.

1001,ISRG,"On Jun 4, we issued an updated research report on Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report). While we are encouraged by the global acceptance of the company’s advanced therapies, its escalating costs and expenses raise concerns. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past three months, shares of Medtronic have outperformed the industry.  The stock has grown 10.1% against the industry’s 2.1% decline.Notably, Medtronic exited the fiscal 2018 on a solid note with better-than-expected fourth-quarter performances. All major business groups contributed to its solid top-line growth at CER, highlighting sustainability across groups and regions, in addition to displaying a successful integration and achievement of synergy targets. Also, a gradually stabilizing Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure(CRHF) market buoys optimism.Medtronic PLC Price Medtronic PLC Price | Medtronic PLC Quote The receipt of FDA approval for the DBS (Deep Brain Stimulation) therapy as an adjunctive treatment to reduce partial-onset seizures raises hope for the company in the target medical market. Medtronic is also focusing on geographical diversification of its businesses. The company is highly positive about its foray into the $1-billion standalone CGM (continuous glucose monitoring) market with its Guardian Connect.We are currently upbeat about Medtronic’s recently-launched restructuring initiative called Enterprise Excellence plan, aimed at $3-billion annual growth run rate savings by the end of fiscal 2022. Per the company, this new program has been designed to increase its effectiveness and growth-related reinvestment ability along with providing a consistent boost to its margin expansion and driving the EPS leverage.On the flip side, the company has been exposed to steep costs and expenses, weighing heavily on its margins. Also, its 2019 guidance remains conservative on the apprehension of lackluster Cardiac and Vascular Group (CVG) and Minimally Invasive Therapies Group (MITG) performances. This in turn dampens investors’ confidence in the stock.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), Illumina, Inc (ILMN  -  Free Report) and Amedisys, Inc (AMED  -  Free Report).

The company also expects core revenues at Home Solutions and continued core growth to prove accretive to its portfolio. Moreover, we are upbeat about BioScrip’s completion of the UnitedHealthcare contract transition and projections of growth in core revenues.

The company saw strong sales growth across all geographies. Emerging markets also performed well, with strong growth in South Africa and Saudi Arabia. Asia Pacific grew in double-digits with strong results from Japan's reintroduction of XLIF. Further, NuVasive’s healthy cash balance should support its plans to pursue acquisitions and develop products.Meanwhile, the presence of a large number of players has made the medical devices market intensely competitive. The orthopedic industry, in particular, is extremely competitive with the presence of bellwethers like Zimmer Biomet Holdings (ZBH  -  Free Report) and Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report), among others.Also, margin drag, pricing pressure and reimbursement issues continue to be other major headwinds.Key PickA better-ranked stock in the broader medical sector is Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1006,ISRG,"On May 31, 2018, we issued an updated research report on Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report). The company is gaining traction in the emerging markets, particularly in the BRIC zone. However, product recall issue continues to impede growth. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past three months, shares of Boston Scientific have outperformed the industry on several issues. The stock has gained 11.6% versus the industry's 2.1% decline.Notably, Boston Scientific posted an impressive first-quarter 2018 on the back of growth across all business lines and geographies. The 2018 view also paints a bright picture for the near term. Boston Scientific is leaving no stone unturned to strengthen its core businesses as well as invest in new technologies. The company achieved clinical milestones for Ranger Drug Coated Balloon and WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure device.Also, post the suspension of Lotus valve in Europe, ACURATE TAVR valve platform continues to build momentum for the company’s growth. During the first quarter, Boston Scientific announced several strategic acquisitions including NxThera and nVision in Urology and Pelvic Health, EmCision in Endoscopy, Securus in Electrophysiology and Millipede in Structural Heart. This inorganic expansion plan bodes well for the stocks’ operational efficiency. Also, a gradually improving foreign exchange scenario has started to contribute to the company’s overall top-line performance.Boston Scientific is pulling out all the stops to pump its resources into new technologies and global markets, accounting for higher sales across all its geographical regions in the third quarter. Additionally, we are encouraged by the company’s number of approval gains for its products both in the domestic as well as overseas markets.However, we are concerned about the company’s recall of one of its prime products, Lotus range of heart devices. The fate of Lotus valve issue thrown in the throes of uncertainty for some more time for Boston Scientific. Recently, the company announced a delay in its earlier-reported timelines for the commercial return of the LOTUS Edge Aortic Valve System in Europe as well as the United States, following the product’s voluntary recall in February 2017.Per the latest update, the company expects to launch LOTUS Edge in the United States and the European markets not before 2019.

A Kaloroma Information article validates the country’s dominance in the field, thanks to its more than $180 billion in revenues generated from all over the world.Medical Device Tax SuspensionThe medical device industry is booming with possibilities, courtesy of the two-year suspension of the infamous 2.3% Medical Device tax. The lifting of the tax makes scope for solid research and development (R&D), which is likely to benefit companies in the long run.The 2.3% excise tax was implemented in 2013 under Obamacare, significantly affecting R&D.

1015,ISRG,"On Jun 7, we initiated a research report on Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (BIO  -  Free Report). We are upbeat about the company delivering a robust performance overseas, while a tough competitive landscape is a concern. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).This California-based manufacturer and global supplier of clinical diagnostics and life science research products has been outperforming its industry over the past year. The stock has gained 30.7% versus the industry’s 15.3% rise. Bio-Rad kick-started 2018 on a solid note, with earnings and revenues rising year over year in the first quarter. The company has been strongly progressing with its efforts to strengthen its hold in other geographies. In first-quarter 2018, Bio-Rad derived around 62% of its net sales globally. The company delivered robust performance, primarily in North America, China and the Asia-Pacific region.Further, constant currency sales at the Life Science segment were particularly strong in North America, China and Europe, while currency-neutral sales at the company’s Clinical Diagnostics segment saw strength in China, Asia Pacific and North America.We are encouraged by the company’s active portfolio expansion for the blood typing market. In January 2018, Bio-Rad announced the receipt of 510(k) clearance from the FDA for the IH-Incubator L and IH-Centrifuge L instruments to be used with the complete range of Bio-Rad’s IH-System Gel Reagents for manual blood typing methods.Meanwhile, Bio-Rad operates in a highly competitive environment dominated by firms varying from large multinational corporations to start-ups.

Our research shows that stocks with an impressive Growth Style Score of A or B combined with a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 offer the best upside potential.Accordingly, IDEXX Laboratories has an encouraging net margin (net income/sales) of 13.9% as well against the industry’s negative 14.9%. Also, the company’s sale to assets ratio of 1.26 compared with the industry’s 0.63 makes it a sturdy growth pick.Let’s find out is the recent positive momentum is sustainable or not.The company is a leading manufacturer of products and services, primarily for the companion animal veterinary, livestock and poultry. It exited the first quarter of 2018 on a commendable note with better-than-expected earnings and revenue performances.The stock’s stellar performance was driven by robust sales at the CAG (Companion Animal Group) business. In the first quarter, CAG revenues rose 13% organically year over year, supported by CAG Diagnostics’ recurring organic revenue growth.Moreover, IDEXX VetLab consumables organic revenue growth was firm on the back of an expanding premium instrument base in the United States and the international markets, including growth in competitive instrument placements, increasing utilization and a consistent customer retention.Notably, in January 2018, the company made Catalyst SDMA Test available in North America. With this, IDEXX’s point-of-care customers will now be able to add SDMA as an essential element to the routine chemistry panel.

1019,ISRG,"ResMed Inc. (RMD  -  Free Report) recently announced positive results from a company-sponsored research, supporting the efficiency of bilevel devices. The results were presented at SLEEP, an annual joint meeting of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the Sleep Research Society.Bilevel Rescue Study in DetailResMed compared 1,496 non-compliant patients (per U.S. Medicare guidelines), who switched to bilevel therapy. Results demonstrated that therapy compliance was achieved by around 56.8% patients when they were shifted from positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy in the first 90 days of the treatment.Per the company, a bilevel device releases two distinct pressures, one for inhalation and the other for exhalation. Patients, who are pressure intolerant or have persistent evidence of apnea at higher pressures, are often prescribed with the advanced bilevel devices.We believe that positive results from this study are expected to boost the uptake of the company’s bilevel devices.A Glimpse at the CompanyResMed achieved strong global revenue growth over the past few quarters, led by sales of sleep devices, respiratory care devices, mask systems as well as software solutions. We believe, ResMed’s product launches and strategies are anticipated to gain traction in the sleep apnea market and are expected to drive growth for the company in the near term.Among recent developments, the company informed about its first self-branded portable oxygen concentrator, Mobi, subject to launch in the fiscal third quarter. It has also introduced AirMini, the smallest PAP (positive airway pressure) device in the world.ResMed recently received reimbursement approval for mandibular repositioning devices in France. Further, it announced that South Korea will start reimbursing diagnosis and therapeutic treatment for sleep apnea in the near term.Moreover, the company recently announced a definitive agreement to buy HEALTHCAREfirst — a privately-held provider of software solutions and services to home health, and hospice agencies — to boost its software-as-a-service business.Market PotentialPer a report by MarketsandMarkets, the sleep apnea devices market is expected to worth roughly $6.49 billion by 2023, at a CAGR of 7.8% between 2018 and 2023.

Also, the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents by 13.6%. The year-over-year upside was driven by higher gross profit margin. Further, a tax cut owing to the recent U.S. tax reform provided an impetus.For the full year, EPS was $1.82, reflecting an increase of 55.6% from the year-ago $1.17.

We note that the variation in average order value was mainly because of a shift in sales to higher priced items.Per the company, the seasonality in its business is mainly because of the proportion of flea, tick and heartworm medications in the product mix. Spring and summer are considered peak seasons, while fall and winter represent off-seasons.During the quarter under review, PetMed acquired 113,000 new customers, up from 126,000 a year ago.

The company also declared a quarterly dividend of 25 cents per share, payable to shareholders on record as of May 25, 2018.Our TakePetMed exited the fiscal fourth quarter on a mixed note. However, we are encouraged by the growth in reorder sales in the quarter. Further, an expanding gross margin due to a shift to higher margin products like next generation medications buoys optimism.The company is also striving to implement strategies to revitalize its top line. These include increased focus on advertising efficiency to boost new order sales as well as shifting sales to higher margin items while also expanding its product line.Zacks Rank & Key PicksPetMed has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space which have reported solid results this season are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), Chemed Corporation (CHE  -  Free Report) and Baxter International Inc.

1021,ISRG,"Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) recently announced the launch of the latest generation of the Afinion test system — Afinion 2 analyzer — in the United States. This system delivers accurate hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) results in 3 minutes and albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) results in 5 minutes. Therefore, the product will enable healthcare providers to adhere to American Diabetes Association (ADA) testing guidelines efficiently and promptly.What Is Afinion 2 Analyzer Rapid Test System?The Afinion 2 analyzer is a rapid and compact multi-assay platform which is capable of streamlining and simplifying the delivery of actionable and accurate measurements of HbA1c and ACR results at the point of care. The Afinion 2 platform also provides all-in-one connectivity to laboratory and hospital information systems (LIS/HIS), which enables healthcare providers to use it in various out-patient settings.Per the ADA, regular measuring of HbA1c and ACR levels are effective for long-term management of patients diagnosed with diabetes. Given the host of benefits it offers, we are upbeat about the launch of the Afinion 2 analyzer system which is expected to boost the top-line contributions from the Diagnostics division.A Glimpse at the Diagnostics BusinessAbbott’s Diagnostics division manufacturesand markets diagnostic systems as well as tests in four business lines — Core Laboratory, Molecular, Point of Care and Rapid Diagnostics (reflects sales from Alere, which was acquired on Oct. 3, 2017). The division accounted for 24.9% of total sales in first-quarter 2018.In the last reported quarter, the Diagnostics revenues grew 58.7% year over year (up 5.5% on a comparable operational basis) driven by better-than-expected performance of the company’s Rapid Diagnostics business and strength in flu season across the United States.Notably, Rapid Diagnostics recorded sales of $559 million, driven by solid contributions from infectious disease testing that include flu and strep testing. Further, management projects the uptrend in this division to continue on the back of new product launches, benefits from Alere acquisition and strength in Alinity test platform.Market PotentialTheprevailing demographics are in favor of high incidence of diabetes among individuals. Per a report from Mordor Intelligence, the global market for diabetes care devices is expected to attain a value of $30.25 billion by 2021. Further, per Abbott, more than 30 million people (or 9.4% of the total population) in the United States are suffering from diabetes. Thus, under such circumstances, we conclude that the developmental steps undertaken by the company seem to be progressive and are strategically aligned.Price PerformanceAbbott has been gaining investors’ optimism on consistently positive results.

1022,ISRG,"On May 30, we issued an updated research report on Illumina, Inc. (ILMN  -  Free Report), a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. The company’s market opportunities continue to expand owing to accelerated demand from clinical and translational customers. Its recent strategic collaborations are also expected to widen its product portfolio.Shares of the company have outperformed the industry over the last three months. The stock has rallied 21.3% against the industry’s 6.6% decline.Notably, Illumina exited the first quarter of 2018 on a solid note with better-than-estimated earnings as well as revenues. Moreover, we are encouraged by the significant year-over-year growth on both counts. This huge upside can be attributed to a strong rise in consumables across Illumina’s sequencing portfolio.Illumina, Inc. Price Illumina, Inc. Price | Illumina, Inc. Quote Additionally, management is hopeful about the recently launched NovaSeq S1 flow cell reagent kit. The company also received a product approval certificate for the NextSeq 550Dx instrument from the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety in South Korea. In the field of oncology, Illumina’s collaborations with Bristol-Myers Squibb and Loxo Oncology are likely to garner positive results down the line. Meanwhile, the company’s raised 2018 guidance indicates that it will deliver an impressive performance in the quarters to come.San Diego, CA-based Illumina is a tools and integrated systems provider for the analysis of genetic variation and function.

The upside was driven by major gains in Water, Food & Beverage and Life Sciences unit.Europe, North America and Latin America led the Global Industrial regional growth.However, acquisition-adjusted fixed currency operating income in the segment decreased 5% on a year-over-year basis due to higher delivered product costs and massive investments in the business.Ecolab Inc.

The segment witnessed solid growth in North America and Asia Pacific.Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income rose 4% year over year.Global Energy Sales rose 9% to $847.1 million owing to strong growth in the well stimulation business and modest gains in the downstream business.Acquisition-adjusted fixed currency operating income remained flat year over year.Other Sales declined 11% year over year to $197.4 million. However, sales in this segment witnessed robust growth in North America.Notably, the Other segment now has Ecolab’s Colloidal Technologies unit. The unit was previously part of the Global Industrial Reportable segment.Acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales rose 8% year over year, as the Pest Elimination unit within the segment registered solid growth in North America and Europe.Margin AnalysisThe company’s margins in the quarter under review remained under pressure owing to higher delivered-product costs.As a percentage of revenues, Ecolab registered adjusted gross margin of 40% in the first quarter, down 150 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis.Adjusted operating margin in the first quarter contracted 60 bps to 10.9% of net revenues.However, Ecolab remains hopeful of the latest pricing initiatives that it has undertaken.

Further, Europe, North America and Latin America led Global Industrial regional growth in the quarter.

Notably, royalty and license fee revenues totaled $8.4 million, up from the year-ago quarter’s $1.1 million.

Surmodics issued a solid guidance for fiscal 2018. The company's solid initiatives to strengthen research and development programs bode well.On the flip side, the company witnessed significantly high operating losses. Product sales declined due to shipment issues, particularly in the Medical Device segment. Further, foreign-exchange woes related to the Creagh Medical buyout have been a major dampener.

Robust performance by the company’s flagship dental implants, CAD/CAM systems, imaging systems, treatment centers and orthodontic product platforms hold considerable promise over the long haul. Emerging markets like Asia-Pacific & the Middle East offer healthy growth opportunities on a long-term basis, as they remain vastly untapped with low dental products penetration. The company’s agreements with MedTech bigwig Patterson Companies in Canada are likely to drive sales. DENTSPLY recently witnessed a rebound in sales in Asia, particularly Japan, and strong growth in Russia.On the flip side, a lowered guidance is indicative of looming concerns. The company's higher capital expenditure on product development and tough competition are expected to exert pressure on margins.

Order growth was primarily driven by TomoTherapy array of products and Radixact system orders.Accuray Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Accuray Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Accuray Incorporated QuoteOther HighlightsRadixact Platform Drives Sales: Radixact is one of the company’s latest devices, which contributed handsomely to revenues. The Radixact system accounted for 80% of all TomoTherpay orders in the quarter under review.Further, the system is being accepted as a true workhorse product in the market, courtesy of its significantly improved product performance, functional efficacies and broad case mix versatility.           Suite of Software Upgradation: A series of software upgradation has been another growth driver for Accuray. These upgrades were primarily focused on improvised imaging, faster planning capabilities as well as system connectivity. Further, software enhancements involved improvisation of CyberKnife treatment planning efficiency.In this regard, Accuray had introduced CTrue iterative reconstruction, an enhanced CT imaging capability for Radixact in the annual ESTRO meeting, which was held in Barcelona in 2018.Geographical Gains Improve: Per management, revenue growth in the third quarter can attributed to the European, American and APAC regions.

Further, the company lowered the EBITDA expectations largely due to strategic investments and lower-than-expected gross margins. However, Accuray continues to rides on the market’s solid response to the Radixact platform and the company’s revamped software.On the flip side, long sales and implementation cycles of the CyberKnife and TomoTherapy systems can majorly affect the company’s top line.

Total gross margin was 47.7% of net revenues, down 130 basis points (bps) year over year.

Strong sales in the United States and Europe raise optimism. A raised guidance for 2018 also paints a bright picture. On the flip side, declining margins owing to surging R&D expenses raise concern.

Notably, the Zacks Consensus estimate is currently pegged at $3.52 per share, significantly below the company’s estimate.   The company expects revenues of $2.8 billion in 2018, up from the previously issued range of $2.72-$2.74 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $2.74 billion, lower than the company’s estimate.    Despite an unfavorable foreign-exchange environment, which put solid pressure in the quarter under review, the company expects strong adjusted operating margin improvement over the remaining three quarters. Management expects a 70- 90 bps margin expansion in 2018.In ConclusionPerkinElmer exited the first quarter of 2018 on a solid note with strong performance in the DAS segment. Growth in DAS was bolstered by strength in the lifesciences end markets, informatics profile and OneSource offering. The company experienced healthy growth across all major geographies in Asia, Americas, Europe and the BRIC nations. Solid prospects in the elemental-analysis product line hold promise. Furthermore, a positive guidance and a solid long-term outlook for 2020 boosts investors’ confidence in the stock.On the flipside, despite having a diversified portfolio, unfavorable foreign exchange is a primary concern. Softness in the industrial end markets due to unfavorable timing of instrument orders has been a major dampener for PerkinElmer. Further, the company continues to acquire a large number of companies which increases integration risks. Also, high debt levels may hinder the company’s expansion plans.Q1 Earnings of MedTech Majors at a GlanceA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space, which reported solid earnings this season are, Baxter International Inc.

We encouragingly note that the PartoSure test has already been successfully launched in over 35 countries across Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Latin America.On the flip side, a competitive landscape and strong reliance on collaborations remain major overhangs.Zacks Rank & Key PicksQIAGEN has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space which have reported solid results this season are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), Chemed Corp.

Product revenues were $204.4 million for the quarter, up 12% year over year.Product revenues also witnessed impressive growth in overseas markets.

A solid guidance for 2018 raises investors’ optimism on the stock. The company has been gaining on strong segmental revenues and improving product revenue margins. An expanding product portfolio and wider adoption of its non-invasive patient monitoring technology are major catalysts. Masimo’s SET pulse oximetry business represents considerable growth opportunities in international markets. Moreover, Masimo received some noteworthy CE and FDA clearances during the quarter, including a clearance for domestic use of the new Rad-97 telehealth monitor with two-way audio and video capabilities.On the flip side, lackluster performance in royalties and other revenue unit is a concern.

We believe that applications like athenaClinicals, athenaClinicals-Streamlined, athenaInsight, athenaCommunicator, athenaOne, athenaCollector for Hospital and Health Systems and the brand promise of ‘Unbreak Healthcare’ are fortifying its market position in terms of exclusiveness of services provided. A strong client base has been a key catalyst. Business and Services revenues witnessed year-over-year growth while the same in the Implementation and other segment declined.Among major concerns, athenahealth’s EHR solution faces significant competition from the likes of Allscripts Healthcare Solutions and others.

Our consensus estimate for earnings is above the company’s guided range.Our TakeHill-Rom exited the fiscal second quarter on a strong note. The company saw a solid year-over-year increase in revenues on strong international growth. The upside in international growth was driven by double-digit growth in Canada and the Middle East, along with strength in Europe and Latin America.

The latest version is capable of quickly and efficiently screening adult patients with pupil sizes as small as 3 mm to diagnose any vision-related issue.However, a decline in revenues at the Patient Support Systems segment is quite disappointing.

QuoteOperational DetailsDexCom generated gross margin (as a percentage of revenues) of 64.5%, which contracted 160 basis points (bps) year over year.

Solid contribution from Sensor revenues, Transmitter revenues and Receiver revenues are key catalysts at the moment. The glucose monitoring market represents significant commercial opportunity for DexCom. DexCom's opportunities in alternative markets such as the non-intensive diabetes management space, the hospital, gestational, pre-diabetes and obesity are likely to provide the company a competitive edge in the MedTech space. Further, the company’s next-generation fully-disposable CGM systems is also in progressOn the flip side, cutthroat competition in the market for blood & glucose monitoring devices is a headwind for DexCom at the moment. We believe the company’s margins will continue to be under pressure in the coming quarters, owing to high product development costs and rising expenditures on research & development. Lower expected margins on transmitter sales are also a cause of concern.Q1 Earnings of MedTech Majors at a GlanceA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space, which reported solid earnings this season, are Baxter International Inc.

1049,ISRG,"On Dec 20, we issued an updated research report on Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG  -  Free Report). Growing adoption of the company’s da Vinci system, increasing procedure volumes, strategic acquisitions, continuous innovation and solid recurring revenue base are key catalysts. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Intuitive Surgical is the manufacturer of the da Vinci surgical system (an advanced robot-assisted surgical system) and related instruments and accessories. The system enables minimally-invasive surgery that helps avoid trauma associated with open surgery. In the last quarter, Intuitive Surgical launched two additional instruments and accessories for da Vinci X and Xi platforms in seven countries.Notably, the company initiated a limited launch of a refined vessel sealer in Europe in the quarter. Management announced plans to file the first 510(k) for FDA approval of da Vinci SP program by 2017,and submissions for additional indications thereafter. For 2018, Intuitive Surgical has strong opportunities in the U.S. general surgery market, particularly driven by procedures for hernia repair and colorectal surgery. Internationally, the company has significant opportunities in Japan, South Korea and China.On the flip side, foreign exchange movements are affecting the company’s results. Though Intuitive Surgical generates a major portion of revenues from the domestic market, continued investments in international businesses are widening the company’s exposure to international markets. Hence, unfavorable foreign exchange is a major concern for 2018.Further, the Medical Product space, has been a precarious game for the Republicans since day one, courtesy of President Trump’s repeated failure to repeal and replace Obamacare. However, major MedTech players like Intuitive Surgical have been pinning their hopes on Trump’s promise to abolish the infamous 2.3% medical device sales tax, though its elimination is far from being achieved.In this regard, let us not forget the massive chaos in the MedTech space triggered by the failure of the first Republican healthcare bill which was proposed this summer. The so-called American Health Care Act (AHCA) failed to garner support in the House owing to solid opposition from conservative and moderate lawmakers. The persistent uncertainty has given rise to concerns regarding the sustainability of MedTech companies, including Intuitive Surgical.Investors’ optimism has been growing, thanks to President Trump’s promise of ‘enactment of new tax reforms’. However, the market has not benefited due to the lack of favorable developments in the regulatory front. Notably, this tax had been suspended for two years and is likely to be put into effect again on Jan 1, 2018.Shares Shine BrightIntuitive Surgical’s price movement has been robust over the last three months. The company represented a solid return of almost 6.8%, comparing favorably with the r industry’s rally of just 2.9%. The current level is a bit lower than the S&P 500 index’s gain of 8%.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express (PETS  -  Free Report), Luminex Corporation (LMNX  -  Free Report) and IDEXX Laboratories (IDXX  -  Free Report).PetMed Express flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1050,ISRG,"“Some people call this artificial intelligence, but the reality is this technology will enhance us.” — Ginni Rometty, Chairman, President, and CEO of IBM.Easing threats of a robotic apocalypse, the global Artificial Intelligence (AI) market is evolving at a lightning pace. Since its germination in early 1950’s, AI has been enhancing our lives like never before.In fact, stocks from the AI space have been providing handsome returns, significantly higher than the broader market. Research firm Tractica expects AI market revenues to reach $59.8 billion by 2025. If such an optimistic forecast is to be relied on, it would be a quantum leap over the 2016 level of only $1.4 billion.Global AI TrendsBe it virtual assistants or self-driven cars, AI has gained prominence across consumer, enterprise, and government sectors around the world. Per ROBO Global, the collective robotics market is anticipated to increase tenfold between 2015 and 2020.About a month ago, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia granted citizenship to the humanoid Sophia, developed by Hong Kong-based Hanson Robotics. If this was not fascinating enough, New Zealand-based entrepreneur, Nick Gerritsen recently developed the world’s first AI politician, Sam, who can address local issues related to education, housing and immigration.We notice that demand for robotic products in the United States has been shooting up at workplaces as well as households. A report by Technavio suggests that the industrial robotics market in the country is expected to see an impressive CAGR of more than 12%.So, it may not be too wrong to foresee a future where robots live cheek by jowl with humans!AI Impact on 3 Major SectorsFrom Apple Inc.’s SIRI to Microsoft’s Cortana and Amazon’s ALEXA to humanoid Sophia, the impact of AI has been incredible. While all the major sectors are trying to utilize their resources to come up with the best in the burgeoning AI trend, here we have zeroed in on three major sectors that are making the most of it.Tech Sector: Convergence of AI & Big DataIt is actually the amalgamation of AI with big data analytics that drove Tech growth. In easier words, big data is a huge amount of unstructured data. When big data is integrated, analyzed and simplified, AI models originate.Various reports suggest that growth in AI is directly proportional to growth in big data space. To substantiate, a report from Bank of America Merrill Lynch suggests that the big data market is set to reach a worth of $210 billion by 2020, thereby boosting AI and driving tech expenditure in days to come.MedTech Sector: Robot Assisted SurgeriesAI has been enhancing the healthcare space with clinical applications, diagnostic support, operational efficiency, Electronic Health Record systems, practice workflows and supply chain management.The growing prevalence of minimally-invasive robot-assisted surgeries, self-automated home-based care, use of IT for quick and improved patient care and shift of the payment system to a value-based model indicate the high prevalence of AI in the MedTech space.MedTech major Intuitive Surgical Inc (ISRG  -  Free Report) designs, manufactures and markets the da Vinci surgical system — an advanced robot-assisted surgical platform. This AI platform enables minimally-invasive surgery that helps avoid the trauma associated with open surgery. The company plans to expand the usage of da Vinci in general and thoracic surgery, colorectal surgery and hernia repair in the days to come.Auto Sector: AI Drives Driverless CarsAlthough AI-powered cars have not hit the showrooms yet, in February, Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report) made huge investments in Argo AI, to develop a virtual driver system by 2021. In fact, a research report by ignite suggests that by 2020, nearly 250 million cars will be connected to the Internet globally.With smart sensors, embedded connectivity applications and big data-enhanced geo-analytical capabilities, bigwigs like Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report) and Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report) are expending millions of dollars on AI infusion in automobile.3 Stocks to Bet OnWe have selected three pure-play AI companies, which, we believe tap into the promising long-term prospects.Fanuc Corp. (FANUY  -  Free Report) offers state-of-the-art factory automation products globally.

The FIELD system is a platform to boost factory production and efficiency with advanced AI and high-end computing technology.Per reports, Fanuc leverages on proven technology instead of creating new technology. This creates a level of consumer reliability that outpaces its competitor products in the market at large.Fanuc Corp. Price and Consensus  Fanuc Corp. Price and Consensus | Fanuc Corp.

1052,ISRG,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (ISRG  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 9.8% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Intuitive Surgical Beats on Q3 Earnings & RevenuesIntuitive Surgical posted adjusted earnings of $2.77 per share in the third quarter of 2017, crushing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.97 on stellar revenue growth. Also, the figure improved 34.5% on a year-over-year basis.

U.S. procedures grew approximately 12% and outside of the United States (OUS) procedures grew approximately 23% year over year. Procedure performance in Asia showed continued strength on solid growth in China, Japan and Korea. Added to this, solid growth in prostatectomy procedure volumes lent Intuitive Surgical a competitive edge in the broader prostate surgery market in the third quarter.Launches Bode Well: In the third quarter, Intuitive Surgical expanded the launch of two additional instruments and accessories for da Vinci X and Xi platforms in seven countries. In fact, the company initiated a limited launch of a refined vessel sealer in Europe in the reported quarter.

However, as the OUS markets are in early stages of adoption, sales might be lower than estimated in the region.Revenue SegmentsInstruments and Accessories: Revenues at the segment grew 15% to $401 million in the quarter, driven by strong procedure growth and increased sales of stapling and vessel sealing products. Revenues realized per procedure were approximately $1,880 compared with $1,870 in the year-ago quarter.System: Sales increased 15% to $237 million buoyed by higher system placements, partially offset by lower average selling prices.

The decrease in margins was due to a $7-million medical device tax refund, which was received in 2016.Notably, management at Intuitive Surgical expects margins to fluctuate based on the company’s mix of new products, mix of systems in instrument and accessory revenue, reduction of product costs and the reinstatement of the medical device tax in 2018.Financial UpdateIntuitive Surgical ended the third quarter of 2017 with $3.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and investments, up by $379 billion on a year-over-year basis.

Also, APAC accounts for two-thirds of the global disease burden.Further, a research report by Statista shows that the MedTech market in the Asia-Pacific region is estimated to reach nearly $78 billion in 2018.Trump’s Focus on AsiaWith the above data pointing toward the huge and unmet healthcare needs within the APAC market, investors may find President Trump’s recent 12-day long Asia trip (with stops in Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines) to be a positive sign.Furthermore, his recent tweet – “Our great country is respected again in Asia. You will see the fruits of our long but successful trip for many years to come!”–is indicative of a favorable Republican stance on APAC, especially with respect to business and trade.Here we take a sneak peek at two major postulates of Trump’s recent Asia visit:Bilateral Trade AgreementTrump’s promise to augment bilateral trade agreements with Indo-Pacific nations instills our confidence in his APAC policies. However, Trump specifically mentioned that these agreements are bound to follow the ""principles of fair and reciprocal trade."" He also voiced for “free and open Indo-Pacific trade,” emphasizing on increased focus in the nations of Japan, Australia, and India.Prospects in China“Pacific is big enough to accommodate both China and the United States,” said China’s President Xi Jinping during Trump’s visit.China undoubtedly poses serious competitive threat to the United States, not just in the healthcare space, but also in electronic, semiconductors, retail, and other areas. Jinping’s statements clearly hint at the possibility of the countries coexisting peacefully despite the political tensions. This might also be indicative of strategic mergers between companies in the two nations in order to enhance trade practices.MedTech Companies Eye APACConsidering Trump’s growing focus on APAC, the region seems to be poised to yield accretive returns in the long term. In fact, stakeholders in the medical universe have been eyeing the emerging market over the last couple of years. These companies are bullish on the growing medical awareness, economic prosperity, an aging population, increasing wealth, government focus on healthcare infrastructure, and the expansion of medical insurance coverage in the APAC space.Meanwhile, despite the health-policy debacle in the United States and deteriorating economic conditions in Europe, we can conclude that growth in the emerging markets of China, India, Japan, and others will bolster the global foothold for MedTech companies. Below, we take a look at four leading MedTech players that are tapping into and also gaining from the bountiful opportunities in the APAC market:Baxter International (BAX  -  Free Report)Baxter’s solid presence in Asia, precisely in India, is worth a mention; the company has research hubs in Japan and China. In the just-reported third quarter, Baxter completed the acquisition of India-based Claris Injectables, a global generic injectables pharmaceutical company, for almost $625 million. In December 2016, Baxter had initiated the agreement. Per management, the acquisition will bolster Baxter’s foothold in the generic pharmaceuticals space. In the second quarter of 2017, Baxter signed an agreement with India-based Dorizoe Lifesciences for the expansion of its generic injectables pipeline. Further, Baxter’s strong presence in peritoneal dialysis, nutrition, IV fluids, and anesthesia gases fortifies its footprint in China.This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has had an impressive run on the bourses in the last two years. The stock has returned 70.6%, significantly higher than the broader industry’s gain of 16.2%.  BostonScientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report)An important part of Boston Scientific’s growth strategy is to continue pursuing development opportunities outside the United States.In the just-reported third-quarter 2017, business from the emerging markets registered an 18% organic growth rate. It remained above the company’s target of reaching 15% of sales by 2017 (from 8% in 2013). Business in China was also remarkable (up 23% year-over-year). The company is currently looking forward to an improved performance in China, banking on the recent approval of SYNERGY.Boston Scientific is also optimistic about its core cardiology segment, which is gradually stabilizing with growth in the BRIC nations. The cardiology capacity in China is expected to double by 2017-end. In India, business is projected to grow more than 15% annually.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has yielded a stellar return of 59.3% in the last two years, way ahead of the broader industry’s 16.2% over the same time frame. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.  Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG  -  Free Report)Intuitive Surgical’s growing interest in the emerging markets, specifically in the APAC region, bodes well. Over the last couple of years, the company’s procedure performance in Asia showed continued strength, with solid growth in China, Japan, and Korea. In the just-reported third quarter, Intuitive Surgical’s system placements included 14 in Japan, five in India, four in New Mexico, and one in China.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has returned 135.4% over the last two years, much higher than the broader industry’s 25% during the same period.  Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report)Becton, Dickinson and Company, or BD, is focused on geographical expansion in overseas markets, and in particular, emerging nations. We note that the company is especially focused on broader emerging markets like India and China, which are seeing rapid growth in economic and healthcare sectors. We believe that significant emerging market exposure will boost the company’s top line, which in turn should lead to accelerated EPS growth.BD revenues grew 6.9% in the just-reported fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Emerging market revenues grew a strong 12.7% year-over-year in the quarter at constant currency, driven by strong performance in greater Asia and China, where revenues saw double digit growth.This leading player in the MedTech space is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The stock has returned 45.1% in the last two years, much higher than the broader industry’s growth of 10%.  The ParadoxHowever, Trump’s ‘Americafirst!’ pitch at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, or APEC, which was held in Vietnam (November 6-11), has been a serious threat to U.S. multilateral trade. It has been clearly portrayed that Trump’s primary focus was, is, and will be the betterment of the United States.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

1055,ISRG,"GNC Holdings, Inc. (GNC  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share (EPS)of 24 cents, reflecting a 36.8% year-over-year decline. Adjusted EPS surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 20 cents by 20%.RevenuesRevenues (which now exclude Lucky Vitamin in all periods) in the reported quarter dropped 7.2% year over year to $607.5 million.The drop was primarily because of the sale of Lucky Vitamin in September 2017 and the termination of the Gold Card program.Same-store sales increased 0.5% in domestic company-owned stores (including GNC.com sales) in the quarter under review. Notably, this is the third straight quarter of growth. In domestic franchise locations, same-store sales dropped 1.9%.GNC Holdings, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  GNC Holdings, Inc.

In domestic franchise locations, revenues declined $7.8 million due to a decrease in retail same store sales along with a reduction in the number of franchise stores.Revenues at the International segment increased 0.8% to $40.1 million driven by higher cross-border e-commerce sales in China.Revenues at the Manufacturing/Wholesale segment (excluding intersegment revenues) declined 1.4% to $55.1 million. Within this segment, third-party contract manufacturing sales fell by $0.9 million. However, Intersegment sales increased $3.4 million on the company's increased focus on proprietary products. MarginGross profit declined 5.9% in the reported quarter to $206.9 million.

The company intends to shutter approximately 200 stores in 2018 as part of the ongoing optimization of the company's store portfolio.  The company has also announced plans to open a limited number of new stores in 2018.Our Take        GNC Holdings exited the first quarter of 2018 on a mixed note. The year-over-year fall in adjusted earnings and revenues is dampening.The company has been firing on all cylinders to strengthen its international presence. In this regard, GNC Holdings recently announced that its proposal to enter into a strategic partnership and China joint venture agreement with Harbin Pharmaceutical Group Holding Co., Ltd (""Hayao"") has received Hayao shareholders’ vote. Further, the company has recently entered into a master franchise agreement with Rapid Nutrition to foray in Australia.

1058,ISRG,"Investors in Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (ISRG  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Nov 17, 2017 $200.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Intuitive Surgical shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Intuitive Surgical is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Medical - Instruments industry that ranks in the Bottom 40% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, seven analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while two have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $2.21 per share to $2.25 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Intuitive Surgical right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

Surging operating expenses also add to the woes.International growth is likely to boost with the company’s prospects in Australia, Canada, Middle East, U.K., Ireland and Germany. Cerner witnessed strong cash flow and record bookings.

Further, foreign currency headwinds and intense competition have been dampening the company’s performance since long.Baxter’s cyclophosphamide performance over the last five years lacked luster. Lower cyclophosphamide sales pose threats to the Integrated Pharmacy Solutions franchise business.Q1 Earnings of MedTech Majors at a GlanceA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space, which reported solid earnings this season are, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report), Chemed Corporation (CHE  -  Free Report) and Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Bruker exited the third quarter on a solid note with better-than-expected earnings and revenue performance. Scientific Instruments segment performed well with strong results driving growth in NANO and CALID groups.Last three quarters, the NANO Surfaces group business realized profitability owing to prior restructuring and cost actions. In the reported quarter, high-single-digit growth was driven by contributions from Hysitron nanoindenting product’s acquisition in late January and improved results at the AXS business.Bruker Corporation Price Bruker Corporation Price | Bruker Corporation QuoteMoving on, the company’s strategic acquisition activity has also been encouraging. For instance, the company recently announced the completion of Germany-based MERLIN’s buyout. Products of this company can complement Bruker’s MALDI Biotyper platform.More good news is that Bruker’s MALDI Biotyper franchise has grown into an impressive system worth approximately $90 million per annum. We are happy to note that demand for the MALDI Biotyper is increasing in applied markets, specifically for food, feed and beverage categories/segments. Based on recent developments witnessed in its product portfolio, management believes that Bruker is poised to double its microbiology business over the next four to five years.Shares of the company have been trading above the broader industry over the last three months.

The upside was supported by growth in North America and international regions on an expanded customer base and increased utilization along with a solid worldwide teen case growth. Moreover, increased revenues from iTero scanner contributed majorly.Segments in DetailRevenues at the Clear Aligner segment (88.2% of total revenues) soared 36.5% year over year to $385.5 million in the reported quarter, primarily driven by continued strong Invisalign case volume growth across all customer channels and geographical regions.In the first quarter, Invisalign case shipments amounted to 272,235, up 30.8% year over year, aided by growth across all regions as well as expansion of customer base.

We are upbeat about the continued strength in Invisalign volumes. In North America, the company continued to witness an expanding GP Dentist customer base along with sustained strength in Invisalign utilization by orthodontists. We are also encouraged by the solid performance in the EMEA and Asia Pacific markets.Within Scanners and Service, the company witnessed rapid uptake of iTero scanners across all geographies. Moreover, the company continues to see increased adoption of iTero scanners for Invisalign case submissions instead of PVS impressions, thereby driving Invisalign utilization. Further, Align Technology recently announced the receipt of China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) approval for the commercial launch of the iTero Element intraoral scanner.We are also upbeat about the company expanding the iTero Element portfolio with the lauch of iTero Element 2 and iTero Element Flex scanners in the United States and majority of European countries, covering France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom.Align Technology has a strong cash balance that enables it to carry out share repurchases and in turn provide solid returns to investors.On the flip side, the company is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations, seasonal demand fluctuations, higher operating expenses pertaining to increased head count along with higher investments targeted toward expansion of geographical presence and portfolio.Zacks Rank & Key PicksAlign Technology currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space, which reported solid earnings this season, are Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report), Chemed Corporation (CHE  -  Free Report) and Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

1074,ISRG,"On Nov 15, we issued an updated research report on Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG  -  Free Report) — manufacturer of the da Vinci surgical system (an advanced robot-assisted surgical system) and related instruments and accessories.  Among major positives, the Sunnyvale-based company has had an impressive run on the bourses, of late. A glimpse at the recent price performance reveals a favorable return of 81.7% in the past year compared  with the industry’s rally of 20.1%. The company has a solid track record characterized by earnings beats in all of the trailing four quarters.  Recently, Intuitive Surgical reported stellar performance on the back of higher adoption of the da Vinci system among physicians and overall growth in global procedures. The system enables minimally-invasive surgery that helps avoid the trauma associated with open surgery. The company’s performance was also driven by growing volumes, courtesy of general surgery, oncology, urology and gynecology procedures.Intuitive Surgical consistently introduces technologies for surgical systems. The company plans to launch an upgrade — da Vinci X — to its flagship Vinci Xi technology. Management confirmed the submission of documents for CE Mark approval of Vinci X. Further, the company expects availability of this device in Europe by the end of 2017. In the long haul, extensive expenditure on product pipeline and expansion in international markets like Europe should drive growth for the company.On the flipside, the company expects procedure growth rate to slow down outside the United States in the upcoming quarters. The lengthy sale and purchase order cycle of the da Vinci system has added to the company’s woes.

The revised dividend of 38 cents will be paid on Dec 4, 2017 to shareholders of record as of Nov 20, 2017.Further, we believe that AmerisourceBergen will benefit from generics growth in the long run.

1077,ISRG,"On Nov 8, we issued an updated research report on Baxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report). Baxter recently exited the third quarter of 2017 on a favorable note, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both the counts. The impressive performance by the hospital products and renal segments holds promise. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Headquartered in Deerfield, IL, Baxter is a global medical technology company which operates in the life-sustaining and critical care products category that is cushioned against economic downturns. The company’s products are not commodity-like in nature and provide a strong recurring revenue base.Baxter has been experiencing burgeoning demand for dialyzers across the globe as more people are afflicted with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) due to growing incidence of diabetes, blood pressure and other kidney-related diseases.  Coming to the recently-reported third quarter, Baxter’s strong product portfolio, plethora of regulatory approvals and the completion of Claris acquisition drove the top line. Buoyed by solid performance, management at Baxter lifted its full-year guidance. For 2017, Baxter estimates sales growth of approximately 4% at cc. Adjusted earnings for the year are expected in the band of $2.40 to $2.43 per share, up from the previous band of $2.34 to $2.40.The year 2017 has been a favorable one for Baxter on the regulatory front so far. In the third quarter, management at Baxter confirmed two new FDA approvals for temporary importation of certain drugs from facilities in Canada and Mexico. Further, the FDA approval of a new premixed injectables is a key catalyst.Coming to product portfolio, Baxter’s convenient kidney dialysis solutions, regenerative tissue products, 3-in-1 oXIRIS set for continuous renal replacement therapy and the next-generation SIGMA Spectrum infusion pump are the latest additions to the extensive product portfolio.Notably, Baxter’s home solution system is the first technology designed to reduce storage and weight handling requirements for traditional PD therapy. Management claims to have the first patient on therapy with the new system as part of a clinical trial in 2018. Regulatory submission is expected in 2019.Despite the ongoing political conundrum pertaining to the repealing of Obamacare in the U.S. MedTech space and devastation caused by Hurricane Maria, we believe a solid foothold in the global markets will drive results for this MedTech major. With a large proportion of sales coming from overseas markets, Baxter should benefit from developing countries' incremental investments in health care systems.Share Price MovementOver the past year, Baxter has outperformed the broader industry in terms of price performance. The company represented a solid return of 39.5%, higher than the industry’s gain of roughly 15.4%. The current level is also higher than the S&P 500’s return of only 19.8%.Q3 Earnings of MedTech Majors at a GlanceWith most of the S&P members having reported their numbers, the third-quarter earnings season is drawing to a close.

Reported earnings were, however, lower than the year-ago figure of 26 cents.Revenues were $20.1 million, up from $18.2 million in the prior-year quarter. Reported revenues also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17 million.Quarter in DetailSurmodics reports revenues in two segments – In Vitro Diagnostics (IVD) and Medical Device.Medical DeviceIn the reported quarter, sales increased 7.5% to $14.7 million. The growth can be attributed to higher product sales, royalties, research, development and other revenues.In Vitro Diagnostics (IVD)Sales rose 19.8% to $5.3 million on higher sales in several product categories. Surmodics, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Surmodics, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Surmodics, Inc.

On the flipside, the company expects IVD business to grow in the mid-single digits, compared with double-digit gains realized in fiscal 2016 owing to anticipated top-line headwinds in the near term.

We are still in the early stages so far (only a week has passed since Delta Air Lines beat estimates on both top and bottom lines), but overall results have been notably better than expected.While after-the-bell earnings reports yesterday were better than expected across the board, some companies performed more impressively than others. While Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report) posted a robust earnings beat, IBM (IBM  -  Free Report) eked out a positive surprise on new corporate tax benefits alone. (IBM’s Watson enterprise has thus far failed to inspire fresh investment in Big Blue.) As a result, IBM has shed more than 5% in today’s pre-market, while ISRG shares are up 5% this morning.New Q1 earnings reports are following suit, starting with Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), which left estimates in the dust this morning. This investment banking major posted $1.45 per share on $11.1 billion in quarterly revenues, outpacing the $1.28 and $10.5 billion in the Zacks consensus estimates, respectively. Net income grew 38% in Q1, whereas Sales & Trading rose 26%. For more on MS’s earnings, click here.Fellow financial institution U.S. Bank (USB  -  Free Report) beat earnings estimates by a penny to 95 cents per share, but missed on revenue expectations, bringing in $5.47 billion as opposed to the $5.53 billion our analysts were looking for. This still represents good year-over-year growth from $5.29 billion in Q1 2017, but pre-market trading shows USB shares slipping half a percentage point at this hour. For more on USB’s earnings, click here.Based on Chicago’s North Shore, Abbott Labs (ABT  -  Free Report) also topped earnings consensus by a penny to 59 cents per share. Revenues also slightly surpassed expectations in Q1, reporting $7.39 billion in sales. Guidance for full-year 2018 has been posted at between $2.80 and $2.90 per share, and the Zacks consensus is roughly at the midpoint. Shares are off 1.3% ahead of today’s opening bell. For more on ABT’s earnings, click here.Defense components major Textron (TXT  -  Free Report), however, performed much better this morning — 76 cents per share blew away expectations of 46 cents, and more than double the 37 cents per share a year ago. Sales of $3,296 million also impressed, both above the estimated $3,114 million and the year-ago figure of $3,093 million. Industrial sales perked up 14%, and the company saw gains from its Arctic Cat acquisition. Shares are up 6.7% in today’s pre-market. For more on TXT’s earnings, click here.

Earnings also improved 42.7% on year-over-year basis.Revenues totaled $848 million, up 24.7% from the prior-year quarter. Revenues also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10.6%.The solid performance was backed by higher worldwide da Vinci procedures led by growth in U.S. general surgery procedures and global urologic procedures. Per management, revenues also gained from around a 2.5% drop in dollar.Meanwhile, in the last three months, the stock has gained 0.5% against the industry’s decline of 7.2%.Segment DetailsInstruments & AccessoriesRevenues came in at $460.3 million, which reflects a year-over-year increase of 20.9%. Per management, 15% growth in da Vinci procedure volume primarily drove the upside.In Japan, 12 da Vinci procedures within the specialties of general surgery, gynecology, and cardiothoracic surgery were granted a national reimbursement status.Intuitive Surgical, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Intuitive Surgical, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Intuitive Surgical, Inc. QuoteSystemsIn the reported quarter, system revenues increased 45.8% year over year to $234.5 million. Notably, 185 da Vinci Surgical systems were shipped by the company, up 39.1% year over year.In the quarter under review, shipments included 43 systems under operating lease arrangements, compared with 21 in the year-ago quarter.ServicesServices revenues came in at $152.7, up 10.7% from a year ago.International Sales UpOutside the United States, revenues totaled $275 million, up 49% on a year-over-year basis and 11% sequentially.

The first quarter of 2018 placements include 45 in Europe and 9 in Japan.MarginsGross margin was 71.6%, down 40 basis points (bps) year over year.In the first quarter of 2018, operating income increased 30.1% on a year-over year basis to $346 million.Financial ConditionThe company ended the first quarter with $4.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments, reflecting an increase of $222 million in the quarter, primarily driven by cash generated from operations.The company has not repurchased any share in the quarter and has approximately $718 million remaining under its board’s buyback authorization.OutlookThe company has not issued any guidance.However, management feels that U.S. revenues might experience a low single-digit decline because of lackluster performance in the gynecology and benign hysterectomy market.Management also feels that margins will fluctuate due to a mix of newer products of systems and accessory revenues.Our TakeIntuitive Surgical ended the first quarter of 2018 on a solid note. The company’s flagship da Vinci procedures recorded solid growth and holds promise for the quarters ahead as well. The company also saw expansion outside the United States, which is encouraging.However, the company expects U.S. sales to decline in the quarters ahead, which raises concern.Zacks Ranks & Key PicksIntuitive Surgical carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report), Myriad Genetics Inc.

The decline in Americas’ organic growth was due to one less billing day in the third quarter. Organic revenue growth further reduced as a result of the adverse weather conditions in Puerto Rico, Texas and Florida.EMEA-APAC revenues in the quarter grossed $477.6 million, up 11.5% year over year and up 7.4% on an organic basis.

Geographically, the company recorded growth in the Americas and EMEA-APAC during the same period.On a brighter note, management looks forward to benefits from the proposed merger with Avantor, already in process. The combined entity’s suite of products, services and solutions will help the company generate a higher degree of relevance with Biopharma and Industrial customers. Also, the buyout is expected to generate significant synergies over the next three years. In addition, the transaction is likely to create a robust product and service portfolio for production-scale biopharma.

As a result, IBM has shed more than 5% in today’s pre-market, while ISRG shares are up 5% this morning.New Q1 earnings reports are following suit, starting with Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), which left estimates in the dust this morning. This investment banking major posted $1.45 per share on $11.1 billion in quarterly revenues, outpacing the $1.28 and $10.5 billion in the Zacks consensus estimates, respectively.

1088,ISRG,"After the closing bell Tuesday, a fresh wave of Q1 earnings reports have come out, across a wide swath of sectors. Among the big names posting actuals this afternoon, all came out with exclusively better-than-expected results.IBM Corp. (IBM  -  Free Report), at first glance, appeared to accomplish what analyst had set out for it: a 5-cent earnings beat to $2.45 per share on $19.1 billion in sales, which surpassed the $18.7 analysts were looking for. These figures represent year-over-year revenue growth for the first time in 5 years, but after-market trading is selling off IBM shares roughly 5%, virtually wiping out the company's gains for all of 2018 so far.This sell-off may also provide a drag to the Dow index tomorrow morning, which had just finally dug itself out of its hole over the past month. IBM's guidance for full-year 2018 was reaffirmed at $13.80 per share; apparently investors were looking for something a little stronger on this line.United Continental (UAL  -  Free Report) topped the Zacks consensus earnings estimate by a penny to 50 cents a share, with revenues for the quarter also edging out expectations to $9.03 billion. This marks a 23% upswing in earnings from the year-ago quarter on PRASM metrics up 2.7% in Q1. Full-year guidance have tightened to between $7-8 per share, and the company has beaten estimates on the bottom line for 5 straight quarters.Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) also outperformed estimates, though not by as impressive of margins as some of these companies this afternoon. Headline numbers of $4.79 per share on $2.89 billion in sales also mark the fifth-straight earnings beat, and revenue growth year over year was roughly 33%. Yet late trading is selling the news following a strong regular session, down 2.6% since results were posted. For more on LRCX's earnings, click here.CSX Corp. (CSX  -  Free Report) easily bettered expectations on the bottom line in its Q1 -- 78 cents per share vs. 66 cents expected, on $2.88 billion in revenues, better than the $2.83 billion expected. This company has also outperformed in the past 5 straight quarters, with a trailing 4-quarter average of over 10%. Late trading is pushing up CSX shares 3.78%.Finally, Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report) posted arguably the most impressive Q1 report of the bunch, with $2.44 per share far outpacing the $1.99 expected, and revenues of $848 million solidly passing the $767 million in the Zacks consensus. Shares in late trading are up 5.6%, putting the MedTech company up near record-high trading territory.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

1092,ISRG,"The collaboration of machines with artificial intelligence (AI) is taking robotics to new highs that humans could have hardly imagined till a few years back. Jeff Bezos’ recent walk with a robot dog is an example of that.Earlier this week, the current richest man in the world strolled at the annual MARS robotics conference held in Palm Springs, CA with a robotic dog called SpotMini built by Boston Dynamics, a prominent robotics design company. Notably, last month, SpotMini was seen opening unlocked doors with an extended arm attached to its structure.AI Driving Robotics DevelopmentThe advancements in robotics and the subsequent promotion of the same are probably bringing us closer to the day when robots will assist humans in household chores as seen in sci-fi movies.We believe AI has a huge role to play in turning these movie sequences into reality, with the aim of incorporating cognitive thinking process into machines. We have seen the virtual versions of intelligent machines in the form of voice assistants like Apple’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) Siri, Ok Google, Microsoft’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) Cortana and Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Echo among others.It seems that now is the time to look at lifelike and realistic forms of these machines, which would have a wider range of applications. Events like granting of citizenship to the world’s first humanoid robot, Sophia by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia as well as development of the first artificially intelligent politician, Sam in New Zealand indicate that the gap between the human world and robotics is being bridged.Projections BullishIn a recent report, IDC projected that worldwide spending on robotics will be around $94 billion in 2018.The year will also see around 90% of the spending allocated for 2017 to 2021 timeframe. Industrial robotics, comprising “discrete and process manufacturing,"" “resource and healthcare” and “retail and wholesale” industries, will witness the highest spending. The industrial segment will be followed by service and consumer robots.We believe that such huge growth prospect bodes well for the robotics industry participants.Let’s take a look at some stocks, which are likely to bring man and machine closer.Rockwell Automation Inc. (ROK  -  Free Report) is an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of industrial automation equipment, application specific integrated software and consulting design services, based in Milwaukee, WI. The company is well positioned to benefit from attractive opportunities in the industrial automation and information market.Notably, Rockwell beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 7.07%.Its long-term earnings growth rate is currently pegged at 11.4%.Rockwell carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The company plans to expand the usage of da Vinci in general and thoracic surgery, colorectal surgery and hernia repair, going forward.Notably, Intuitive Surgical beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 15.01%.Long-term earnings growth rate for this Zacks Rank #2 stock is currently pegged at 10.7%.Intuitive Surgical, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Intuitive Surgical, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Intuitive Surgical, Inc. QuoteWhile these companies are solely focused on manufacturing, International Business Machines Corp (IBM  -  Free Report) is responsible for providing AI that runs these machines.The company’s advancement in the AI domain with its dedicated platform, Watson is a huge positive in our view. The company has been showcasing Watson powered robots since 2015. We believe Watson has a lot to offer going forward.Notably, IBM beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 2.83%.Its long-term earnings growth rate is currently pegged at 4.9%.IBM carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).International Business Machines Corporation Revenue (TTM) International Business Machines Corporation Revenue (TTM) | International Business Machines Corporation QuoteConclusionThough some experts fear that machines may overpower human intelligence in the future, for now, adequately-abled machines could be of great assistance, increasing productivity and efficiency of the entire population.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.   Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1093,ISRG,"In the era of big data, unless one's portfolio is in tune with the evolving digital trend, making prudent investment choices can prove to be a daunting task. Millennials have started to recognize the increasing need of the emerging automation trend and subsequently robotics, IoT, 3D printing are becoming part of our daily life with the latest buzzword being Artificial Intelligence (AI).While Siri and Ok Google have made life easier, the latest version of Global Positioning System helps track almost anything and everything along with its intelligent route map. Also, not being a pro on social network sites like Facebook, Twitter or snapchat can be seen as primitive.According to investment giant Jim Cramer, AI along with big data will soon let companies to bat a thousand. Interestingly, the benefits of the same will not remain restricted to any particular industry but will be felt across all business segments and investment arenas.AI to Help MedTech Gain TractionNon-healthcare bigwigs like Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Google, Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), IBM and Microsoft with their digital affluence are already eyeing the healthcare and device market of late, courtesy of its solid prospects. Two things to be noted here:Health treatment costs have skyrocketed over the past few years. Surprisingly, medical devices and pharmaceuticals account for only a small portion of healthcare expenses. Per Josh Makower, MD, general partner venture capital firm New Enterprise Associates, the greater part of healthcare costs goes in paying the salaries of healthcare employees. AI can help to curtail this high labor cost.Going by 2018 Deloitte data, global health care spending is projected to increase at an annual rate of 4.1% in 2017-2021, a significant escalation from just 1.3% in 2012-2016. Per the report, rising labor cost is acting as a major spending growth driver.Also, with growth in the aged population, the necessity for AI has increased by leaps and bounds. Per the U.S. Census Bureau report, between 2012 and 2050, there will be a significant rise in the aged population in the United States. In 2050, the population aged 65 or older is projected to be 83.7 million, almost double its estimated population of 43.1 million in 2012. Data also shows that the median age is increasing in most areas of the country and this is the global scenario as well.Notably, the industry is bearing the brunt of an exploding population at present. The World Health Organization's (""WHO"") latest available data show that more than 45% of WHO Member States worldwide report to have less than 1 physician per 1000 population. The density of physicians to patients in the United States is 2.3:1000.The strategic application of AI in every sphere of healthcare can provide an impetus to  productivity. Evidently, companies that adopted AI technologies have already witnessed a 50% reduction in healthcare costs and have also experienced improved patient outcome by more than 50%.MedTech Stocks Going the AI WayMedtronic (MDT  -  Free Report) is undoubtedly among the first MedTech manufacturers forging ahead with initiatives to bring in AI techniques in manufacturing processes. Back in 2016, the company partnered with IBM Watson to utilize the latter’s machine learning algorithms to incorporate AI in its diabetes app MiniMed.  In 2017, they jointly launched the first artificial pancreas systems. Metronic has utilized sugar IQ with the cognitive computing capability of IBM Watson to detect important patterns and trends for diabetes.EHR technologies developer Cerner (CERN  -  Free Report) is also adopting AI techniques rapidly. Lately, the company has been in the headlines, courtesy of its efforts to digitize electronic health record systems. In this regard, the company recently entered into two collaborations, one with Salesforce, a renowned player in the field of customer relationship management, and the other with Centrus Health, a clinically integrated, physician-led network. With the latest development, the company is planning to advance its flagship big-data platform HealtheIntent.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report) designs, manufactures and markets the da Vinci surgical system — an advanced robot-assisted surgical platform. This AI platform enables minimally-invasive surgery that helps negate trauma associated with open surgery. The company plans to expand the usage of da Vinci in general and thoracic surgery, colorectal surgery and hernia repair.Of late, Boston Scientific (BSX  -  Free Report) has also been putting an all-out effort to incorporate AI techniques in neuromodulation, cardiac rhythm management, cardiology, electrophysiology, peripheral interventions, oncology, endoscopy, urology and pelvic health.ConclusionA long debate can be structured on how an intelligent machine intensive technology can make human capabilities outmoded gradually — but that’s a different story. Despite several adversities, AI undoubtedly has emanated to change the behavioral pattern of consumers in medical device space like all other sectors. Once again going by Jim Cramer’s say, “I love behavior-change investing. It can be incredibly lucrative, and when you have a behavior-change theme you can use selloffs to pick stocks based on those changes.” Thus, it goes without saying that the market holds ample promise and the proper execution of AI will definitely prove to be a trump card for the space.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

The company has three major revenue segments —Instruments and Accessories (52.3% of total revenues), Systems (29.1% of total revenues) and Services (18.6% of total revenues).Business HighlightsSolid Procedure TrendsIntuitive Surgical posted solid numbers in the quarter, courtesy of rising customer adoption of procedures and growth in system placements. The company outperformed in the Mature and Growth procedures, especially in general and thoracic surgery.Precisely, fourth-quarter procedures increased approximately 17% on a year-over-year basis. Procedure performance in Asia reflected persistent strength backed by solid growth in China, Japan and Korea. Added to this, growth in prostatectomy procedure volumes lent the company a competitive edge in the broader prostate surgery market in the fourth quarter.Favorable Study ResultsIn November 2017, a team of investigators from the University of Southern California, the University of Michigan Ann Arbor, Penn State Health and Intuitive Surgical published a large-scale study titled ‘Robotic-Assisted, Video-Assisted Thoracic and Open Lobectomy: Propensity Matched Analysis of Recent Premiere Data in the Annals of Thoracic Surgery’.The results from this study demonstrated the increase in the number of robotic-assisted lobectomies. Lobectomy can be defined as surgical excision of a lobe or an organ.In the quarter under review, Intuitive Surgical submitted the 510(k) applications to the U.S. FDA for its 60-millimeter stapler for da Vinci X and Xi platforms.International SalesThe company has been gaining solid prominence globally. In fact, outside the United States, the company’s procedures improved approximately 21% on a year-over-year basis. Intuitive Surgical’s system placements included 47 in the Europe and 22 in Japan. Notably, 25 of the 47 systems placed in Europe, were da Vinci X systems. However, as the OUS markets are in early stages of adoption, sales might lag estimates in the region.Revenue SegmentsInstruments & AccessoriesRevenues in the segment rose 18% to $457 million in the quarter, on the back of strong procedure growth and increased sales of stapling and vessel sealing products. Revenues realized per procedure were approximately $1,910, flat year over year.Systems Sales in the segment increased 20% to $283 million, buoyed by higher system placements and partially offset by lower average selling prices. Coming to the company’s flagship da Vinci surgical platform, Intuitive Surgical shipped 216 systems compared with 163 in the prior-year quarter.ServicesThe company registered revenues of $153 million, up 13% on a year-over-year basis and backed by growth in the installed base of da Vinci systems.Gross MarginIntuitive Surgical’s adjusted gross margin in the reported quarter expanded 130 basis points (bps) to almost 71% of net revenues. The increase in margins indicates the company’s consistent efforts to lower manufacturing cost.Notably, management expects margins to fluctuate based on the company’s mix of new products, reduction of product costs and the reinstatement of the medical device tax in 2018.Financial UpdateIntuitive Surgical ended the fourth quarter of 2017 with $3.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and investments, in line with the third-quarter figure. Per management, this was offset by a final payment of $274 million associated with the accelerated share repurchase agreement initiated by the company in first-quarter 2017.GuidanceFor 2018, Intuitive Surgical anticipates full year procedure growth within a range of 11% to 15%. Procedure growth is expected to be driven by U.S. general surgery and procedures outside the United States.Management expects operating expenses to rise in the range of 16-18% in 2018, as the company continues to invest in emerging markets and new technology including computer-assisted surgery.Gross margin is expected within the range of 70-71.5% of net revenues in 2018.Incorporating projected impacts of the newly enacted U.S. tax law, Intuitive Surgical expects 2018 income tax rate between 2% and 20% of net pre-tax income. How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Fresh estimates followed an upward path over the past two months.Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

1095,ISRG,"The fourth-quarter earnings season has commenced on a positive note for most sectors, with a decent picture from the 133 S&P 500 participants that have reported till Jan 26. Total earnings for these companies are up 12.3% year over year on 8.8% higher revenues, with 81.2% beating earnings estimates and 78.9% surpassing top-line expectations.Notably, about 121 S&P 500 companies are reporting their earnings this week.Per the latest Earnings Preview, overall earnings for the fourth quarter are expected to increase 11.6% on 7.5% growth in revenues. This indicates an improved growth projection from the previous quarter driven by a corporate-tax overhaul and relatively healthy job data. These factors have boosted corporate earnings and stoked investments.Based on this pattern, the fourth quarter is expected to register modest double-digit percentage earnings growth on a year-over-year basis.MedTech Earnings So FarMedical, one among the 16 Zacks sectors, is expected to stand out this quarter. The sector benefits from favorable consumer behavior, growing prevalence of minimally-invasive surgeries, demand for liquid biopsy tests, use of IT for ensuring quick and improved patient care along with the shift of the payment system to a value-based model.This is evident from the results of MedTech heavyweights Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report). The companies exited the fourth quarter on a solid note, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts. An upbeat FY18 guidance also instills confidence.For the fourth quarter, the earnings growth rate for the medical sector is pegged at 4.2% on 4.9% revenue growth.Upcoming ReleasesLet’s take a look at three major other MedTech stocks slated to release their quarterly reports on Jan 30, 2018:Stryker Corporation’s (SYK  -  Free Report) results are scheduled for release after the market closes. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $3.46 billion, up 9.5% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is $1.95, up 9.6% on a year-over-year basis.Stryker recently announced better-than-expected preliminary net sales results for fourth-quarter 2017. For full-year 2017, net sales are estimated at $12.4 billion, up 9.8% from the year-ago quarter on a constant-currency basis. The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.38 billion.Buoyed by these prospects, our quantitative model indicates an earnings beat for Stryker this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. Stryker’s Earnings ESP is +0.01%.

1096,ISRG,"On Jan 26, we issued an updated research report on Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (ISRG  -  Free Report). The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Intuitive Surgical’s share price movement has been compelling over the last three months. The company represented a solid return of almost 17.1%, surpassing the broader industry’s gain of 13.8%. The current level is slightly lower than the S&P 500's return of 11.9%. Intuitive Surgical exited the fourth quarter on a solid note, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both the counts. The company outperformed in the Mature and Growth procedures, especially in general and thoracic surgery. Procedure performance in Asia showed continued strength with solid growth in China, Japan and Korea. Also, expansion in gross margin buoys optimism. A positive outlook for the coming quarters raises our confidence.  Intuitive Surgical has gained significantly on the CE Mark approval for da Vinci X in Europe. The stock has got a further boost from the recent FDA approval of the same. In the fourth quarter of 2017, Intuitive Surgical submitted the 510(k) application to the FDA for its 60-millimeter stapler for da Vinci X and Xi platforms.However, a surge in operating expenses and the reinstatement of the medical device tax are likely to hurt the bottom line. Further, the da Vinci Surgical System’s long sale and purchase order cycle is a drag. Cut-throat competition in the niche space is also a major concern.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Amedisys (AMED  -  Free Report), Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report) and ResMed (RMD  -  Free Report).Bio-Rad Laboratories has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

This was partially offset by declining business-to-business average selling prices. Rental gross margin was 24.3% versus 30.7% in the year-ago quarter. The downside resulted from reimbursement rate reductions. This was partially offset by reduced cost of rental revenues primarily associated with lower depreciation.Inogen, Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Inogen, Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Inogen, Inc QuoteGeneral and administrative expenses were $10.4 million, up from $8.7 million in the comparative quarter of 2016. This was primarily due to $0.6 million of patent litigation settlement expenses, increased personnel-related expenses and higher patent defense legal costs.GuidanceConsidering the solid performance in the third quarter, Inogen raised its guidance for 2017 revenues to the range of $244-$248 million, compared with the previous $239-$243 million. This represents year-over-year growth of 20.3% to 22.3%.Our TakeInogen reported stellar third-quarter 2017 results, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both the counts. The company witnessed solid growth in revenues and adjusted earnings on a year-over-year basis. In our view, solid domestic and international business-to-business sales have led to the impressive quarterly performance. In the upcoming quarters, the company expects direct-to-consumer sales to be its fastest growing channel followed by domestic business-to-business sales. In this context, the company recently signed a lease for its expansion site in Ohio to accelerate growth in domestic direct-to-consumer sales channel.On the flip side, declining rental might mar the company's prospects. Since the company generates a significant portion of its revenues from the international market, volatile foreign exchange rate will always pose a concern.Zacks Rank & Key PicksInogen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express, Inc.

Adjusted EPS also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.

While nutritional specialty products grew 17%, sales from vaccines increased 25%, principally on volume growth of products for poultry and swine industries.However, sales at Medicated feed additives (MFAs) and Other fell 5% primarily due to volume decline.Domestic net sales at MFAs and Other declined by $10.5 million due to reduced volumes of medically important antimicrobials and unfavorable timing of certain customer orders. International net sales increased by $6.7 million, driven by growth across most regions, including the benefit of improved economic conditions in Brazil.Net sales at the Mineral Nutrition segment increased 1% to $52.1 million on higher average selling prices resulting from an increase in underlying raw material commodity price. However, the rise in average selling prices was partially offset by lower volumes of trace mineral products.Net sales at the Performance Products segment increased 5% to $12.5 million on higher average selling prices and volumes of copper-based products.Operational UpdatePhibro’s fiscal first-quarter gross profit increased 3.4% year over year to $63.4 million.

Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $864 million. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).FY17 at a GlanceIntuitive Surgical reported revenues of $3.12 billion in full-year 2017. The company has three major revenue segments — Instruments and Accessories (52.3% of total revenues), Systems (29.1% of total revenues) and Services (18.6% of total revenues).Intuitive Surgical, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Intuitive Surgical, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Intuitive Surgical, Inc. Quote Business HighlightsSolid Procedure TrendsIntuitive Surgical posted solid numbers in the quarter, courtesy of rising customer adoption of procedures and growth in system placements. The company outperformed in the Mature and Growth procedures, especially in general and thoracic surgery.Precisely, fourth-quarter procedures increased approximately 17% on a year-over-year basis. Procedure performance in Asia reflected persistent strength backed by solid growth in China, Japan and Korea. Added to this, growth in prostatectomy procedure volumes lent the company a competitive edge in the broader prostate surgery market in the fourth quarter.Favorable Study ResultsIn November 2017, a team of investigators from the University of Southern California, the University of Michigan Ann Arbor, Penn State Health and Intuitive Surgical published a large-scale study titled ‘Robotic-Assisted, Video-Assisted Thoracic and Open Lobectomy: Propensity Matched Analysis of Recent Premiere Data in the Annals of Thoracic Surgery’.The results from this study demonstrated the increase in the number of robotic-assisted lobectomies. Lobectomy can be defined as surgical excision of a lobe or an organ.In the quarter under review, Intuitive Surgical submitted the 510(k) applications to the U.S. FDA for its 60-millimeter stapler for da Vinci X and Xi platforms.International SalesThe company has been gaining solid prominence globally. In fact, outside the United States, the company’s procedures improved approximately 21% on a year-over-year basis.Intuitive Surgical’s system placements included 47 in the Europe and 22 in Japan. Notably, 25 of the 47 systems placed in Europe, were da Vinci X systems. However, as the OUS markets are in early stages of adoption, sales might lag estimates in the region.Revenue SegmentsInstruments & AccessoriesRevenues in the segment rose 18% to $457 million in the quarter, on the back of strong procedure growth and increased sales of stapling and vessel sealing products. Revenues realized per procedure were approximately $1,910, flat year over year.Systems Sales in the segment increased 20% to $283 million, buoyed by higher system placements and partially offset by lower average selling prices. Coming to the company’s flagship da Vinci surgical platform, Intuitive Surgical shipped 216 systems compared with 163 in the prior-year quarter.ServicesThe company registered revenues of $153 million, up 13% on a year-over-year basis and backed by growth in the installed base of da Vinci systems.Gross MarginIntuitive Surgical’s adjusted gross margin in the reported quarter expanded 130 basis points (bps) to almost 71% of net revenues. The increase in margins indicates the company’s consistent efforts to lower manufacturing cost.Notably, management expects margins to fluctuate based on the company’s mix of new products, reduction of product costs and the reinstatement of the medical device tax in 2018.Financial UpdateIntuitive Surgical ended the fourth quarter of 2017 with $3.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and investments, in line with the third-quarter figure. Per management, this was offset by a final payment of $274 million associated with the accelerated share repurchase agreement initiated by the company in first-quarter 2017.GuidanceFor 2018, Intuitive Surgical anticipates full year procedure growth within a range of 11% to 15%. Procedure growth is expected to be driven by U.S. general surgery and procedures outside the United States.Management expects operating expenses to rise in the range of 16-18% in 2018, as the company continues to invest in emerging markets and new technology including computer-assisted surgery.Gross margin is expected within the range of 70-71.5% of net revenues in 2018.Incorporating projected impacts of the newly enacted U.S. tax law, Intuitive Surgical expects 2018 income tax rate between 2% and 20% of net pre-tax income.Bottom LineIntuitive Surgical exited the fourth quarter on a solid note, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both the counts. Also, the company witnessed impressive procedure performance in Asia. A positive outlook for the upcoming quarters also raises optimism in the stock. Further, incremental spending on product development and higher investments in international markets are likely to boost long-term growth.However, a surge in operating expenses and the reinstatement of the medical device tax are likely to dampen the company’s bottom line in the upcoming days. Further, the da Vinci Surgical System has a long sale and purchase order cycle which might act as a deterrent. Added to this, cutthroat competition in the niche space is a concern.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Amedisys (AMED  -  Free Report), Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report) and ABIOMED (ABMD  -  Free Report).Amedisys has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 18.5%.

More than 25 Radixact units have been recognized since the product launch.Further, the system is being accepted as a true workhorse product in the market, because of its significantly improved product performance, functional efficacies and broad case mix versatility.Suite of Software Upgradation: A series of software upgradation has been another growth driver for Accuray. These upgrades include integrated data management system (IDMS) and Accuray Precision Treatment Planning Software. Within the system, the PRECISEART module, captures and identifies anatomical changes taking place within the patient during the course of treatment.It has led to notable improvement in the company’s treatment planning capabilities and oncology department workflow.Geographical Gains Improve: Per management, revenue growth in second quarter can attributed to European and APAC regions.

Also, the company reiterated its guidance for fiscal 2018. Accuray rides on the market’s solid response to the Radixact platform and the company’s revamped software.On the flip side, long sales and implementation cycles of the CyberKnife and TomoTherapy systems can majorly affect the company’s top line.

1102,ISRG,"On Jan 23, we issued an updated research report on AngioDynamics Inc. (ANGO  -  Free Report). The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).AngioDynamics recently reported a dismal second quarter of fiscal 2018, with adjusted earnings and revenues missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The slashed guidance for fiscal 2018 sales is also discouraging.AngioDynamics’ Peripheral Vascular segment has been weak of late. The company also had a high debt level at the end of the last quarter. AngioDynamics’ rising debts impose certain operating and financial restrictions, which limit the company’s execution of core business strategies. The company also recently recalled the Acculis Microwave Tissue Ablation System.  Coming to the stock’s price performance, AngioDynamics saw a negative return of almost 0.6% over the last year, significantly underperforming the S&P 500’s 24.7% gain. Furthermore, the current level compares unfavorably with the broader industry’s gain of 33.6%.On the flip side, AngioDynamics continues to expand its business on the back of acquisitions and strategic alliances. Major buyouts like Microsulis, Navilyst, Vortex Medical, NanoKnife and RITA Medical have significantly expanded its product pipeline. AngioDynamics has been making disciplined investments across all three of its business segments to drive long-term revenue growth. AngioDynamics has been offering a broad spectrum of products which has helped widen its commercial opportunities. The company is also a leading player in the thrombolytic catheters space. It has a broad range of unique catheters like Uni-Fuse, SpeedLyser and Pulse Spray under the thrombus portfolio.AngioDynamics is expected to benefit from the ongoing market transition toward less-invasive interventional procedures. We expect this trend to continue, as less-invasive interventional procedures help reduce patient recovery time, thereby saving hospitalization costs. Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Amedisys (AMED  -  Free Report), Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report) and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report).Bio-Rad Laboratories flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1103,ISRG,"On Jan 22, we issued an updated research report on Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).This leading pharmacy-led, health and wellbeing company has been trading above the broader industry over the past three months. The stock has gained 14.5% in comparison to the broader industry’s 9.1%.Walgreens Boots reported an impressive first quarter of fiscal 2018. We are encouraged by the strength in the Retail Pharmacy USA division and the continued prescription growth on account of Medicare Part D growth and volume growth from previously announced strategic pharmacy collaborations.We are particularly upbeat about the revised Rite Aid store deal for which the company received regulatory approval last September. Per Walgreens Boots, the modified buyout contract will help it boost the top line and also gain operational benefits. It will also help the company expand and optimize retail pharmacy network in key U.S. markets, including the Northeast. Notably, the stores to be purchased are located primarily in the Northeast and Southern United States, while the three distribution centers to be bought are located in Dayville, CT; Philadelphia, PA; and Spartanburg, SC. Post the transaction’s initial closing, synergies of $300 million are expected to be realized within four years.  Moreover, increase in Retail Pharmacy International sales buoys optimism. Also, we are upbeat about the company’s decision to acquire a 40% stake in Sinopharm Holding Guoda Drugstores in China. This should provide a strong impetus to Walgreens Boots’ worldwide retail pharmacy business. Moreover, the company’s acceptance of the proposal to sell part of its investment in Chinese wholesale partner Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals Corporation for a huge amount of cash is a major positive.However, Walgreens Boots faces headwinds in the form of increased competition and tough industry conditions. Even though the company continues to gain traction, major mass merchants are expanding their pharmacy businesses and enjoying a fair market share.Moreover, over the last few years, slowdown in generic introduction has been affecting Walgreens Boots’ margins. In addition, increased reimbursement pressure and generic drug cost inflation have been hampering Walgreens Boots’ margins significantly.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Amedisys (AMED  -  Free Report), Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report) and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report).Bio-Rad Laboratories flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Strong revenue growth in the Pharmacy Services segment was partially offset by a decline in Retail/LTC revenues in the quarter.Quarter in DetailsPharmacy Services revenues increased 8.1% to $32.89 billion in the reported quarter, driven by growth in specialty pharmacy volumes, higher pharmacy network claim volumes as well as brand inflation. This was, however, partially offset by increased generic dispensing and price compression.Pharmacy network claims processed during the quarter climbed 8.3% to 374.2 million on a 30-day equivalent basis, backed by net new business growth. Also, the Mail Choice processed claim count was 66.9 million, up 6.1% on a 30-day equivalent basis on continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings and a rise in specialty pharmacy claims.Revenues from CVS Health’s Retail/LTC dropped 2.7% year over year to $19.59 billion, primarily due to a 3.2% decrease in same-store sales, continued reimbursement pressure and an increase in the generic dispensing rate.Front-end same-store sales were down 2.8% year over year. Front-store sales were affected by soft customer traffic and efforts to rationalize promotional strategies, which were partially offset by an increase in basket size.Pharmacy same-store sales also declined 3.4% in the reported quarter. Sales were affected approximately 435 basis points (bps) due to recent generic drug introductions. Also, Pharmacy same-store prescription volumes inched up 0.3% on a 30-day equivalent basis.

1112,ISRG,"After a solid third quarter of 2017, Inogen Inc. (INGN  -  Free Report) was recently recognized as one of the fastest growing companies in North America by Deloitte’s Technology Fast 500.The acknowledgment is primarily based on Inogen’s solid fundamental growth story, with revenues improving almost 169% from $75.4 million in 2013 to $202.8 million in 2016. Notably, this is the fourth consecutive year of the same recognition for Inogen. The company has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Deloitte’s Technology Fast 500 recognizes growing technology, media, telecommunications, life sciences and energy tech companies in North America. The award winners have been selected on the basis of revenue growth recorded from 2013 to 2016.  Factors Driving InogenWe believe Inogen’s direct-to-customer business model has lent it a leading position in the oxygen therapy market. The direct-to-consumer model gives companies an opportunity to build a unique brand-relationship with customers. Earlier this year, the company signed a lease for its expansion site in Ohio to accelerate growth in domestic direct-to-consumer sales channel. The growing direct-to-customer sales and marketing efforts help drive awareness among patients. Growth in physician referrals is also expected to boost the top line over the long term.Inogen raised its guidance for 2017 revenues to $244-$248 million from the previous $239-$243 million. This represents year-over-year growth of 20.3% to 22.3%.Inogen’s expanding product portfolio is a key catalyst. The company provides oxygen concentrator solutions for portable and stationary use. Inogen’s flagship product, One G4 is a single-solution portable oxygen concentrator (POC). Furthermore, Inogen One G3 portable oxygen concentrator lends mobility and independence to oxygen therapy users. This platform is the lightest continuous flow oxygen concentrator in the market and consumes much less power than other devices, fortifying the company’s footprint in the Long-term Oxygen Therapy (LTOT) market.Favorable Market TrendsA research report by Transparency Market Research suggests that the North America oxygen therapy devices market is expected to see a CAGR of 5.5% from 2015 to 2023, to reach a worth of $1.58 billion in 2023. Favorable market trends are indicative that Inogen will grow manifolds in the years to come.Internationally, Inogen should benefit from developing countries' incremental investments in health care systems. Further, an underpenetrated oxygen therapy market and favorable reimbursement scenario in countries like Germany, France and the U.K. present significant growth opportunities for Inogen. Germany is estimated to be the second largest market in Europe for medical oxygen systems.Share Price MovementInogen's share price movement over the past six months has been favorable. The company represented a return of almost 41.8%, better than the broader industry's gain of just 6.7%. The current level is also higher than the S&P 500’s return of 8.3%.Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express (PETS  -  Free Report), Luminex Corporation (LMNX  -  Free Report) and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report).Notably, PetMed Express sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1113,ISRG,"On Nov 9, we issued an updated research report on QIAGEN N.V. (QGEN  -  Free Report). The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).This Netherlands-based molecular diagnostics provideroffers innovative technologies and products for pre-analytical sample preparation and molecular diagnostics solutions. The stock has been trading below the broader industry over the last six months. As per the latest share price, it has lost 1.4% as against the 1.1% gain of the broader industry. The company ended the third quarter on a mixed note with earnings beating and revenues missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate.We note that the company has been facing considerable negative impact from the timing of national tender that is leading to a decline in HPV test sales in the rest of the world.QIAGEN’s Personalized Healthcare business relies on formation of projects with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to co-develop companion diagnostics paired with drugs that such companies either market currently or are developing for future use. Thus, QIAGEN is exposed to the risk of not being able to maintain these relationships with collaborative partners pursuing or developing competitive products or technologies, either on their own or in collaboration with others.  Moreover, QIAGEN has been facing intensifying competition from firms that provide pre-analytical solutions and other products. Also, the price sensitivity of the market poses a threat.We are however impressed with balanced growth across all of the company’s business segments. On the profitability front, QIAGEN performed well in terms of operating margin. We are also upbeat about the company’s partnership and co-marketing agreement with CENTOGENE AG to boost its bioinformatics portfolio. Moreover, the company’s focus to drive growth through Sample-to-Insight offerings buoys optimism.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express, Inc.

1114,ISRG,"On Nov 9, we issued an updated research report on Phibro Animal Health Corporation (PAHC  -  Free Report). The company has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).This is a New Jersey-based leading globally diversified animal health and mineral nutrition company. Over the last three months, it has been trading above the broader industry. The stock has declined 8.7% compared with a 3.1% gain of the broader industry.Notably, Phibro ended the second quarter of fiscal 2017 on a mixed note with the bottom line exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues declining marginally on a year-over-year basis. Segment-wise, Medicated feed additives (MFA) business was weak in the United States. $4.2 million of that business decline was due to reduced sales of medically important antimicrobials, primarily on the change in consumer preferences and the less use of certain antimicrobials in the market. This apart, an unfavorable timing of certain customer orders hampered the business.Phibro Animal Health Corporation Price Phibro Animal Health Corporation Price | Phibro Animal Health Corporation QuoteAlso, a persistent decline in Mineral Nutrition segment sales is likely to be a drag on business. Customer consolidation can also affect Phibro’s revenues. Plus, an unfavorable currency movement and a tough competitive scenario continue to pose as other headwinds.On a positive note, Animal Health has continued to remain a key contributor, delivering growth over the last few quarters. Per Phibro, its animal health products are excellent in preventing, controlling and treating diseases in animals as well as increasing nutrition to improve health. We believe, a diverse product portfolio will allow the company to address the distinct growing conditions of livestock in different regions of the world.Phibro has extended its reach beyond the United States to enter Brazil and other countries in South America, China, India and Asia Pacific, Russia and Africa. This we feel will help the company counter competition.The company continues to invest in the Far East Asia where the poultry and dairy industries are expected to grow exponentially. The company currently expands its dairy business in the markets of Australia, Brazil and Mexico. We believe that despite the economic turmoil in Russia, Greece, Brazil and China, Phibro has performed quite well and has the potential to maintain the momentum.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express, Inc.

An encouraging fiscal 2018 guidance instills our confidence in the stock. Meanwhile, the company is banking on strategic buyouts, joint ventures and supply agreements to drive growth.

Price and EPS Surprise  ABAXIS, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | ABAXIS, Inc. Quote What Does the Latest Tax Reform Mean?The latest U.S. tax legislation, which slashes the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, is anticipated to benefit the company with an effective tax rate of 27%, excluding a one-time non-cash charge. This one-time non-cash charge of approximately $2.5−$3.5 million is a result of a decrease in deferred tax assets due to a reduction of the federal tax rate. The company anticipates a decline of 200 to 300 basis points (bps) in effective tax rates in fiscal 2018 and a drop of 1,000-1,200 bps in fiscal 2019 from fiscal 2017.Share Price MovementOver the past three months, Abaxis has been trading above the broader industry. The stock surged 33.9% as compared to the industry’s gain of 5.9%. The company has been performing well in Veterinary consumables with contributions from hematology reagents, i-STAT cartridges, coagulation cartridges and rapid assays. We are also upbeat about the increase in sales of hematology instruments worldwide. Moreover, solid global sales of Piccolo instruments are encouraging.We are also encouraged by Abaxis’ expansion of its portfolio of rapid test menu in the recent past. The company signed a partnership with the American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA) to develop a wellness testing initiative to improve veterinary blood work compliance and implementing preventive care. We believe successful expansion of the product portfolio will boost the top line and help the company foray into new regions.Zacks Rank & Key PicksAbaxis carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Integer Holdings Corporation (ITGR  -  Free Report), Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.

This gain is majorly due to the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities, partially offset by the repatriation tax. However, the company does not expect this gain to influence adjusted non-GAAP financial results.Moreover, the company anticipates a decline of 500 basis points (bps) in effective tax rate of around 29% in fiscal 2018.Share Price MovementOver the past three months, Hill-Rom has been trading above the broader industry.

1124,ISRG,"Now that Q4 earnings season is knocking at the door, there is no mystery in investors’ hunt for stocks with estimate beating potential. This is because investors always try to place themselves ahead of time and look to play stocks that are rich in quality.Why Is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important?Historically, stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings (on a nominal basis) tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations. After all, a 20% earnings rise (though apparently looks good) doesn’t tell you if it has been decelerating.Also, seasonal fluctuations can come into play. If a company’s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 is strong, it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline. In such cases, growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company.On the other hand, after a whole lot of research and analysis on a company’s financials and initiatives, Wall Street analysts project its earnings. They also take a company’s guidance into consideration when deriving an earnings estimate.Thus, outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company’s own expectation as well as the market perception. And if the margin of earnings surprise is big, it typically drives the stock higher right after the release. Thus, more than anything else, an earnings surprise can push a stock higher.How to Locate Potential Outperformers? Now, finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line is a dream that investors chase but might not always come true. One way of fulfilling it is by looking at the earnings surprise history of a company.An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a driver in sending a stock higher. It indicates the company’s ability to exceed estimates. And investors generally believe that the company will have the same trick up its sleeve to deliver yet another earning beat in its upcoming release.The Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise, we chose the following as our primary screening parameters.Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10%: Stocks delivering a positive surprise in a quarter tend to surprise again.Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20%: We lifted the bar for outperformance slight higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20%.Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20%: This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger.In addition, we place a few other criteria to push up chances of a positive surprise.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Only companies with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) can get through.Earnings ESP greater than zero: A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for an earnings beat to happen, as per our proven model.In order to zero in on those that have long-term growth potential and high trading liquidity, we have added the following parameters too:Next 3–5 Years Estimated EPS Growth (Per Year) greater than 10%: Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock’s long-term growth prospects.Average 20-day Volume greater than 100,000: High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.A handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to 10.Here are five out of 10 stocks:Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report): This is a manufacturer and seller of construction and mining equipment. The Zacks Industry Rank of the stock is in the top 8%, at the time of writing.

However, adjusted EPS beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents.Excluding one-time items, Bruker reported net income of $37 million or 23 cents per share in the third quarter, compared with $46.5 million or 29 cents, respectively, in the year-ago quarter.Revenues in DetailBruker reported revenues of $435.6 million in the third quarter, up 10.6% year over year. The top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $414 million. Excluding a 4.8% positive effect from acquisitions and a 2.4% favorable impact from changes in foreign currency rates, Bruker reported year-over-year organic revenue growth of 3.4% in the quarter under reveiw. Geographically and currency adjusted, European revenues increased in mid-teens year over year in the third quarter. North America revenues increased low- to mid-single digits. In Asia Pacific, organic revenues declined marginally. While China revenues again rose double digits in the third quarter, it was offset by a steep decline in Japan and soft performance in other Asia-Pacific regions.Bruker Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Bruker Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Bruker Corporation Quote Management expects continued organic revenue growth in 2018 on the back of the multi-year margin expansion initiative.Per management, the company registered organic revenue growth based on NANO and CALID Group.Bruker’s BioSpin Group reported low single-digit revenue growth on year-to-date basis. Revenues were however flat year over year. Per management, the upside was led by strong contribution from aftermarket and service sales, which were up low double digits in both the quarter and the year-to-date periods.The Bruker NANO reported high single-digit revenue growth on a year-over-date basis on the back of strong organic growth and contributions from the January 2017 Hysitron acquisition of nanoindenting products. Also, year-to-date growth at AXS was driven by higher industrial growth and recovery in the European markets. On an organic basis, NANO group revenues rose low double digits.CALID revenues increased mid single digits year to date on an organic basis in the third quarter. CALID gained from the InVivo consumables acquisition made in January 2017. Year to date, Daltonics mass-spec revenues within the CALID Group increased and Optics products garnered solid revenue growth on strong execution and improved applied and industrial market demand.BEST revenues rose 11% organically on a year-to-date basis backed by higher MRI OEM consumer demand and the Bruker-OST acquisition made in November 2016.Margin TrendGross margin in the reported quarter contracted 156 basis points (bps) to 45.5%. According to the company, adjusted gross margin declined 130 bps to 47.6% owing to a predicted gross margin headwind from acquisitions, negative currency effects as well as product, geographic and business mix.Selling, general & administrative expenses increased 6.3% to $102.9 million and research and development expenses rose 7.9% to $40.9 million from the year-ago period. The other charges contracted 6.5% year over year to $4.3 million. Overall, operating margin contracted 20 bps to 11.5%.Financial PositionBruker exited third-quarter 2017 with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $429.2 million, down from $440.3 million at the end of the second quarter. Year-to-date net cash provided by operating activities was $50.7 million, compared with $40 million in the year-ago period.2017 GuidanceBruker provided an update to its guidance for 2017.Total revenue growth rate expectation for the year has been raised to a band of 8-8.5% from the earlier 4.5-6.0%. Moreover, organic revenue growth guidance has been lifted to 2.5-3% from 1.5-2% on continued acquisition growth expectations of 4.5% (previously 3.5-4%) and a foreign currency tailwind of around 1%. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 revenues is pegged at $1.71 billion.The company expects 2017 adjusted operating margin increase of approximately 70-100 bps year over year, up from the previous guidance of 40-70 bps. This includes an approximate 40-bps headwind in fiscal 2017 from the recent acquisitions.  Bruker raised adjusted EPS projections to a range of $1.17-$1.20 from $1.08-$1.12. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 EPS is pegged at $1.12.Our TakeBruker exited the third quarter on a solid note. The company also raised 2017 guidance, which is indicative of brighter prospects. The company’s strategic acquisition activity has been encouraging. We are also upbeat about the company’s current focus on product development through increased R&D. On the flip side, competitive landscape and macroeconomic headwinds continue to pose challenges for the company. Also, the contraction in both gross and operating margin is disappointing.Zacks Rank & Key PicksBruker currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express, Inc.

A solid guidance for 2017 and an encouraging long-term outlook are the key highlights of the quarter. Also, expansion in margin is encouraging. We look forward to the takeover of the hospital and health system business of McKesson Corporation.

1128,ISRG,"Pacific Biosciences of California Inc. (PACB  -  Free Report) reported a loss of 19 cents per share in the third quarter of 2017, a penny narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The loss is in line with the year-ago quarter. Strength in China and Asia boosted the company’s bottom line in the quarter. The company has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Revenues of $24 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $28 million and declined 4.2% on a year-over-year basis. Notably, the DNA sequencing market is highly competitive owing to the presence of several established players. Cutthroat competition in the niche space is the primary reason for the year-over-year decline in revenues.Segment DetailsProduct revenues rose 12.7% to almost $20.3 million. Service revenues declined 7.8% from the year-ago quarter to almost $3.2 million. Year to date, Pacific Biosciences generated $68.5 million in product and service revenues, up 26% from $54.2 million generated in the first three quarters of 2016.Consumable revenues in the reported quarter were $10.6 million, up 62% on a year-over-year basis. Consumable revenue growth was driven by higher installed base of instruments and growth in sequel instrument utilization.Instrument revenues in the third quarter were $9.7 million, down from $11.5 million on a year-over-year basis. At the end of the quarter under review, Pacific Biosciences installed base of sequel instruments totaled around 200 instruments.The company didn’t record any contractual revenues in the quarter.Pacific Biosciences of California, Inc.

For the fourth quarter, Pacific Biosciences expects gross margin in the range of 37% to 40% of net revenues.Our ViewpointSolid contribution from the Instrument and Consumable revenue platforms acted as a significant positive for Pacific Biosciences in the third quarter. The improvement in margin sales of the Sequel System is another encouraging factor. The company also witnessed significant strength in China. Notably, it placed numerous system orders in the region with both new and existing customers. Of the major concerns, the DNA sequencing market is highly competitive owing to the presence of several established players. Cutthroat competition in the niche space is a headwind. However, problems related to the limited availability of SMRT cells (Single Molecule, Real-Time) for the Sequel system and higher non-cash operating expenses are expected to mar prospects.Companies Reporting Solid Earnings ResultsIntuitive Surgical Inc.

This includes negative impact from foreign currency exchange of approximately 1%.Negative Estimate Revision TrendThe estimate revision trend for Wright Medical has been dismal.

As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year earnings fell 20% to 4 cents.The stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), signifying probabilities of underperformance in the near term.Foreign Currency HeadwindsWright Medical derives a significant part of its total revenues from international operations, which are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.Back Order IssuesProducts of Wright Medical are usually marketed internationally through a combination of subsidiaries and distributors. In Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America, the company primarily relies on distributors for sales. However, distribution of products in some of these markets has been troublesome due to the presence of different distributor levels. These problems are eventually resulting in a significant amount of back orders, which is a major headwind.Pricing PressureWright Medical continues to face flat pricing due to price discounting in larger accounts, limited product offerings and international price cuts. The advent of group purchasing organizations is also keeping prices under pressure.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Amedisys, Inc.

1131,ISRG,"The market is not content with NuVasive, Inc.’s (NUVA  -  Free Report) unimpressive preliminary results for the fourth quarter and 2017. After the results were announced on Jan 8, the stock lost 10.8% to close the session at $53.26 on the next day.  Prelim Results at a GlanceWe believe the dull revenue expectation for the fourth quarter 2017 has dampened investors' spirits. NuVasive announced preliminary revenues of approximately $272 million for the quarter, flat year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $272.74 million.Revenues for 2017 are expected at $1.03 billion, reflecting 7% year-over-year growth. The estimates happen to be in line with the company’s guidance. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 revenues stands at $1.03 billion.In view of the continued impact of hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico in the fourth quarter as well as an anticipated decline in U.S. procedural volumes, NuVasive had issued an updated 2017 guidance during the third-quarter 2017 earnings call.The company had expected to report revenue growth of 7.2%, at CER for 2017. The projected revenue figure was approximately $1.030 billion. NuVasive also projects its 2017 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to be pegged at $1.91. Additionally, adjusted operating margin for the year is currently expected at 16.6%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 EPS stands at $1.91.However, the company continues to witness sequential growth in international revenues. Notably, on the back of continued innovation, NuVasive has witnessed more than 20% increase in international sales in the fourth quarter for the fifth sequential quarter.NuVasive, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  NuVasive, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | NuVasive, Inc. Quote Preliminary Outlook for 2018NuVasive has also provided the initial guidance for full-year 2018 as well. The company expects mid-single digit revenue growth in 2018 over the 2017 figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 revenues is pegged at $1.09 billion. Moreover, the company expects non-GAAP operating margin expansion of approximately 100 basis points. Also, adjusted EBITDA is expected in the $290-$300 million range.The latest U.S. tax legislation, which slashes corporate tax rates from 35% to 21%, is expected to result in significant tax savings for NuVasive. Without the tax rate cut, the company would have to face a corporate tax rate of 33% on a non-GAAP basis in 2018.The company will also take synergies from the December 2017 acquisition of privately-held intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) service provider SafePassage into account while issuing the guidance for 2018. The buyout is on track and is expected to close in January 2018 on fulfillment of certain customary closing conditions. Per NuVasive, the acquisition will strengthen the company's intraoperative neuromonitoring business line. The consolidated giant is expected to deliver services to more than 1,000 customers and 3,000 surgeons. Moreover, following the acquisition of SafePassage, NCS is likely to aid more than 100,000 IONM cases every year in the United States.Post closure of the deal, the transaction is expected to prove accretive to the company's EPS in 2018 and beyond. It is also expected to support NuVasive’s long-term targets for revenue growth and expansion of adjusted operating and EBITDA margins.Zacks Rank & Key PicksNuVasive carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Integer Holdings Corporation (ITGR  -  Free Report), Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.

The full-year figure is well above the Zacks Consensus estimate of $710.63 million.   Meanwhile, the estimate revision trend has been favorable as one estimate moved south over the past two months, with two movements in the opposite direction.

Price and Consensus | DexCom, Inc. Quote 2018 OutlookFor 2018, DexCom estimates total revenues in the range of $830-$850 million, courtesy of strong sensor volumes, international revenues and the expansion of DexCom’s worldwide patient base. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 revenues is pegged at $856 million at the moment.Dexcom’s launch of G6 sensor platform and expansionary moves in the Medicare and international markets are likely to boost revenues in 2018. However, cutthroat competition in the niche space is likely to mar the top line.Shares FallHowever, the market is not really happy with DexCom’s preliminary results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2017. Following the announcement, the stock tumbled 1.5% in the last trading session to close at $54.60. The company is likely to report full financial results on Feb 27, 2018, after the market closes.DexCom’s price movement in the past year has been unimpressive. The company reported a negative return of 20.9%, comparing unfavorably with the industry’s rally of 26%. The current level is also lower than the S&P 500’s gain of 23.7% over the same time frame. DexCom’s glucose monitoring devices are more invasive and better than other self-monitored glucose testing systems. Moreover, reports suggest that patients are unwilling to realize the benefits of continuous glucose monitoring at the moment. Reluctance on the part of physicians and patients to adopt DexCom’s products may make it challenging for the company to expand market share.  Key Picks A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Integer Holdings Corporation (ITGR  -  Free Report), Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.

1133,ISRG,"On January 5th, we issued an updated research report on Bruker Corporation (BRKR  -  Free Report). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Bruker has been trading above the broader industry over the past three months. The stock has returned 18.7%, higher than the 6% gain of the broader industry during the period.In the last three quarters, Bruker’s NANO Surfaces group business realized profitability owing to prior restructuring and cost actions. In the last-reported third quarter 2017, high-single-digit growth was driven by contributions from Hysitron nanoindenting product’s acquisition in January 2017 and improved results at the AXS business.Moving on, the company’s strategic acquisition activity has also been encouraging. For instance, the company recently announced the completion of its Germany-based MERLIN’s buyout. Products of the acquired company can complement Bruker’s MALDI Biotyper platform.More good news is that Bruker’s MALDI Biotyper franchise has grown into an impressive system worth approximately $90 million per annum. We are happy to note that demand for the MALDI Biotyper is increasing in the applied markets, specifically for food, feed and beverage categories/segments.Based on recent developments witnessed in its product portfolio, management believes that Bruker is poised to double its microbiology business over the next four-five years. The company’s raised 2017 guidance is also indicative of brighter prospects.On the flip side, Bruker conducts 80% of its business in the international markets. As a result, adverse currency fluctuations continue to incur losses for the company.

1134,ISRG,"On Nov 7, we issued an updated research report on Batesville, IN-based Hill-Rom Holdings, Inc. (HRC  -  Free Report). The company currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).This leading global medical device companyexited fiscal 2017 on a strong note with fourth-quarter earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company saw a solid year-over-year increase in revenues on strong international growth. Hill-Rom is currently focused on gaining traction in the untapped international market on successful execution of the company’s strategy, courtesy of its efficient international team and organizational realignment. The company is focusing on product innovation through research and development. A slew of product launches in the fourth quarter is encouraging. Moreover, an improvement in adjusted gross and operating margin buoys optimism.In November 2017, Hill-Rom outlined impressive long-term growth strategies along with key initiatives. The company also stated its financial goals through fiscal 2020.  Hill-Rom’s merger and acquisition (M&A) pipeline continues to be robust. The company aggressively pursues acquisitions to accelerate growth in five key clinical focus areas viz. advancing patient mobility, wound care and prevention, surgical, safety and efficiency, clinical workflow solutions and respiratory help. Apart from Welch Allyn and Trumpf, several recent noteworthy acquisitions include Virtus and Aspen Surgical. However, a decline in revenues at the Patient Support Systems segment is quite disappointing.

1135,ISRG,"DaVita Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 adjusted operating earnings of 81 cents per share that missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 94 cents. Further, earnings declined from 14.7% on a year-over-year basis.Total revenues increased 5.1% year over year to $3.92 billion and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.89 billion. The year-over-year improvement was mainly attributable to a 3.8% rise in patient service revenues to $2.62 billion and 16.5% increase in capitated revenues to $1.02 billion from the year-ago quarter.DaVita carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. Price and Consensus  DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. Price and Consensus | DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. Quote Segment UpdateDavita Medical Group (“DMG”)DMG, the nation's largest operator of medical groups and physician networks, provides integrated care management as an operating division of DaVita, focusing on delivering healthcare through a broad range of services.For the third quarter of 2017, DMG incurred adjusted operating loss of $5 million, which excludes $601 million non-cash goodwill impairment and other adjusted items. In the third quarter, DaVita announced the restructuring of the DMG segment that eliminated 350 non-clinical positions. Thus, management at DaVita expects annualized savings of around $40 million per year starting 2018.DaVita Kidney CareAs an operating division of DaVita, DaVita Kidney Care focuses on setting worldwide standards for clinical, social and operational practices in kidney care. DaVita saw solid results from the Kidney Care business.Adjusted operating income in the third quarter at the segment was $404 million, up 1% year over year, primarily driven by an extra treatment day in the quarter. Notably, the company saw a negative financial impact of Hurricane Harvey and Irma, which is estimated to be approximately $7 million for higher costs and approximately $7 million of lost contribution from missed treatment and uncollected revenues owing to disruption of the company’s billing process during the natural disasters.U.S.Dialysis and Related Lab ServicesRevenue per treatment for U.S. dialysis and lab business was essentially flat with the last quarter. In fact, management at DaVita expects revenue per treatment to essentially remain flat in the fourth quarter as well. The company’s patient care costs were up approximately $1.76 per treatment compared with the last quarter.Financial UpdateFor the twelve months ended Sep 30, 2017, DaVita had an operating cash flow of $2.08 billion and free cash flow of $1.49 billion. Operating cash flow was $553 million in the third quarter and $1.56 billion year to date.Share Repurchase UpdateDaVita bought back almost 2 million shares of the company’s common stock for approximately $117 million at an average price of $59.09 per share. In October, DaVita’s board of directors approved an additional share repurchase authorization worth approximately $1.253 billion.As of Nov 7, 2017, DaVita repurchased a total of 11.4 million shares of the company’s common stock for a total of $702 million at an average price of $61.30 a share.GuidanceDaVita expects adjusted consolidated operating income for 2017 in the range of $1.620 billion to $1.685 billion, lower than the previously issued range of $1.675 billion to $1.775 billion.The company estimates adjusted operating income at the Kidney Care segment in the band of $1.570 billion to $1.600 billion. Notably, the previously issued range was $1.565 billion to $1.625 billion.For the full year, DaVita expects adjusted consolidated operating income in the range of $50 million to $85 million, significantly lower than the previous guidance of $110 million to $150 million.Our TakeDaVita ended third-quarter fiscal 2017 on a mixed note. Strong growth in patient services is likely to boost the company’s growth trajectory in the coming quarters. DaVita’s continuous improvement in Kidney care is commendable as well. The company’s efforts to control expenses hold promise. A compelling inorganic growth story supported by its strong financial position is another positive. However, DaVita is challenged by adverse effects of healthcare reforms, rise in Medicare costs, and an increase in Medicare Advantage (MA) beneficiaries. Also, MA rate cuts are likely to hurt the bottom line in the near future. Lackluster performance by the company’s DMG segment and a slashed guidance for the full year indicate looming concerns ahead for the stock. Sluggishness in the dialysis and lab businesses adds to our concerns.Q3 Earnings of MedTech Majors at a GlanceThe Q3 earnings season is drawing to a close, with most of the S&P members having reported their numbers.

The figure also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $182.3 million and the company’s guidance range of $181-$183 million. The year-over-year rise in the top line was primarily on account of strong demand for Hereditary Cancer and GeneSight tests. Myriad Genetics, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Myriad Genetics, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Myriad Genetics, Inc. Quote Quarter in DetailsSegment-wise, Molecular diagnostic tests (94% of total revenue) recorded total revenues of $178.8 million, up 8.3% year over year, mainly on account of a 300% rise in GeneSight testing revenues to $28.8 million. EndoPredict testing revenues grew 11.8% year over year to $1.9 million in the reported quarter. Moreover, Vectra DA testing revenues came in at $16 million, up 37.9% year over year, while other testing revenues rose 4.2% to $2.5 million.In the Prolaris testing space, volumes continued to grow double digits in the fiscal first quarter. However, Prolaris tests registered revenues of $2.9 million in the quarter, flat year over year. Also, Hereditary Cancer testing revenues dropped 9% year over year to $126.7 million, while volumes grew year over year for the third consecutive quarter with pricing at par with expectations.Pharmaceutical and clinical service revenues (accounting for the rest) in the quarter totaled $11.4 million, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 8.1%.Margin TrendsGross margin in the quarter under review contracted 10 basis points (bps) to 77.4%. According to management, the gross margin performance was adversely affected by Hereditary Cancer test pricing issue but partially offset byimproved efficiencies in Hereditary Cancer production process, rising margin from GeneSight business and increasing new product reimbursement.Operating expenses rose 1.3% to $133 million owing to a 2.9% rise in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses to $115.2 million. Research and development (R&D) expenses, however, declined 8.2% to $17.8 million in the reported quarter. Overall, operating margin increased 400 bps to 7.5%.Financial PositionMyriad Genetics exited the fiscal first quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $148.3 million, compared with $150.7 million at the end of fiscal 2017.

The company continues to expect revenues in the range of $750-$770 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $764.2 million lies within the guided range.On the bottom-line front, the company expects to generate adjusted EPS in the range of $1.00-$1.05. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.04 is within but near to the higher end of the company’s guidance range.Management has provided the guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The company estimates adjusted earnings per share of 22-24 cents on total revenues of $187-$189 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted EPS of 25 cents and revenues of $190 million exceeds the company’s guided range. Our ViewMyriad Genetics kick started fiscal 2018 on a solid note with its first-quarter numbers exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company observed strong growth in both GeneSight and EndoPredict testing revenues along with continued year-over-year growth in Hereditary Cancer volumes with pricing at par with expectations.On the flip side, unfavorable foreign currency translation continues to pose a threat. With a considerable portion of its revenues coming from outside the United States, the company faces the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. Additionally, macroeconomic uncertainty and higher expenses owing to extensive pipeline of some tests may impact the company’s margins.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksMyriad Genetics has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express, Inc.

1138,ISRG,"On Nov 6, we issued an updated research report on Wright Medical Group N.V. (WMGI  -  Free Report). The company recently reported third-quarter results, wherein adjusted earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Exclusive platforms and technologies like PERFORM Reversed glenoid, ORTHOLOC 3Di and the SIMPLICITI shoulder system acted as key catalysts in the third quarter. Wright Medical currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Wright Medical is focusing on product innovation through research and development. The company recently launched INVISION Total Ankle Revision System — the first system developed for total ankle revision arthroplasty. Of the other major platforms, the launch of PERFORM Reversed is expected to boost revenues.Wright Medical’s solid guidance boosts investor confidence. The company expects net sales for 2017 in the band of $740 million to $745 million. This includes negative impact from foreign currency exchange of approximately 1%. The company forecasts full-year 2017 adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of $84 million to $88 million.However, lackluster international performance of the Lower extremities segment is a matter of concern.

The reported figure is on par with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.At constant exchange rate or CER, the company reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 32 cents, which met the low end of the company’s guidance of 32-33 cents at CER.QIAGEN’s reported EPS in the quarter was 21 cents, up 40% year over year.Revenues in DetailNet sales at actual rates in the third quarter grew 7% on a year-over-year basis to $364 million (same at CER). However, the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $365.1 million.Meanwhile, considering the acquisition of OmicSoft in January, revenues increased 1%. Currency translation did not have any material impact on net sales. Also, organic expansion contributed 6% of total CER growth.Region-wise, sales from the Americas (47% of revenues) grew 3% at CER, while revenues from Europe-Middle East-Africa (32%) and Asia-Pacific/Japan (20%) increased 15% and 7%, respectively, at CER.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Qiagen N.V. Quote Segments in DetailQIAGEN primarily generates revenues from Molecular Diagnostics, Applied Testing, Pharma and Academia, which represented 49%, 10%, 19% and 22% of net sales, respectively, during the reported quarter.Molecular diagnostics sales were up 9% at CER, driven by substantial growth in QuantiFERON latent TB tests, QIAsymphony automation system consumables portfolio and solid performance of companion diagnostic pharma collaborations. Sales derived from Applied Testing rose 15% at CER, on increased uptake of new products in human ID and forensics.Pharma sales rose 5% at CER in the third quarter and Academia sales improved 2% at CER backed by growing demand.Operational UpdateAdjusted operating income in the third quarter increased 9% year over year to $96.1 million. Also, the adjusted operating margin expanded 40 basis points to 26.4%. Financial UpdateQIAGEN exited the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $671.8 million, up from $542.8 million in the preceding quarter. Year-to-date net cash from operating activities was $210.7 million, down from $241.6 million a year ago. Moreover, the company reported year-to-date free cash flow of $146.1 million compared with $186.7 million in the year-ago period.In January 2017, QIAGEN completed a synthetic share repurchase that combined a direct capital repayment with a reverse stock split as part of a commitment to return $300 million to shareholders. The transaction was announced in August 2016 and involved an approach used by various large, multinational Dutch companies to boost shareholders’ returns in a faster and more efficient manner than traditional open-market purchases. QIAGEN intended to repay the balance of the commitment through open-market share repurchases in 2017. However, QIAGEN has completed $300 million of its share repurchase goal ahead of the end of 2017 through the open-market repurchase of 1.91 million shares on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.2017 GuidanceQIAGEN has maintained its 2017 guidance for adjusted net sales growth at 7% (CER). Moreover, the adjusted EPS guidance has been reiterated at the band of $1.25-$1.27 at CER.This is based on operating and financial leverage which includes benefits from the completion of the $300-million share repurchase plan and efficiency actions taken in 2016. This, however, excludes the expected 7 cents per share of restructuring costs planned for 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings of $1.26 is within the guided range. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 revenues is pegged at $1.42 billion.The company also provided its financial guidance for the fourth quarter of 2017. Net sales are expected to grow 5-6% at CER. Adjusted EPS is expected at around 41-42 cents at CER on an underlying basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $407.65 million, while the consensus estimate for earnings stands at 42 cents.Our TakeQIAGEN ended the third quarter on a mixed note. We are impressed with balanced growth across all of the company segments. Furthermore, on the profitability front, QIAGEN delivered strong performance with respect to operating margin. We are also upbeat about the company’s strategic focus to drive growth through Sample-to-Insight offerings. Meanwhile, its commitment to return more to shareholders through increased share repurchases reflects its solid cash position.On the flip side, declining HPV sales in the United States continues to be a drag.

Hill-Rom is currently aiming to gain traction in the untapped international market on successful execution, courtesy its efficient international team and organizational realignment. The company is putting efforts in product innovation through research and development.

1142,ISRG,"On Nov 2, we issued an updated research report on Mountain View, CA-based Omnicell Inc. (OMCL  -  Free Report). The company develops and markets end-to-end automation solutions for the medication use process.Omnicell exited third-quarter 2017 on a mixed note with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues missing the same. Also, weak gross margin scenario is a matter of concern. We believe the company’s strategies including portfolio expansion, acquisitions and penetration into the medication adherence market continue to drive expenses. Meanwhile, expenses related to the recently launched XT series have been exerting pressure on the bottom line.Omnicell’s lowering of the high end of the full-year 2017 adjusted revenue guidance is reflective of the fact that the overall weakness will continue. A tough competitive landscape also acts as a dampener.  Over the last three months, Omnicell’s shares have been trading below the broader industry. As per the latest share price movement, the stock has lost 1%, significantly underperforming the broader industry’s addition of 2.9%.On a positive note, the year-over-year increase in earnings and revenues was impressive. The company witnessed balanced growth across all business lines in the quarter. We are encouraged to note that the company is working on product innovation through R&D. Over the recent past, Omnicell has been observed to gain consistently from series of product launches (the latest being XT Series Automated Supply Dispensing system) and strategic partnerships.Zacks Rank & Key PicksOmnicell has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express, Inc.

1143,ISRG,"On Oct 31, we issued an updated research report on Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation (IART  -  Free Report). The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Integra LifeSciences exited the third quarter of 2017 on a disappointing note, with both earnings and revenues missing the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, contraction in adjusted operating margin and adjusted gross margin adds to the woes.On a positive note, over the last six months, shares of Integra Lifesciences have been trading slightly above the broader industry. The stock has gained 0.8% against the 0.8% loss of the broader industry over the same time frame. A consistently strong performance of its Orthopedics and Tissue Technologies’ segment buoys optimism.Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation Price Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation Price | Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation QuoteWe believe the company’s recent product diversification bolstered investors’ confidence, thereby boosting the stock price further. Of late, within Orthopedics and Tissue Technologies segment, the company launched several new regenerative products for the surgical reconstruction market. In the third quarter of 2017, the company registered mid-single digit growth in Regenerative Technologies franchise, primarily banking on the addition of Derma Sciences and strong growth in patient skin portfolio.Within tissue ablation, the global launch of CUSA Clarity is getting good response in the United States and abroad. Integra LifeSciences expects all these products to drive growth in 2017 and beyond.We are also optimistic about the fact that Integra LifeSciences has successfully witnessed certain key overseas developments, despite facing foreign exchange fluctuations across its international business. Also, the company has adopted several near-term objectives under its three-pillar strategy. Management also expects to gain market traction through strategic partnerships and acquisitions.On the flip side, foreign exchange and stiff competition pose as potent headwinds. Also, many of Integra LifeSciences’ manufacturing, development or research facilities are vulnerable to natural disasters or unprecedented events, which depending on their severities, might force the company to cease development and manufacturing of some or all of its products.It is important to note that last quarter, the impact of back-to-back hurricanes has grossly affected wound care and orthopedic procedures, particularly in Florida. In addition, the company was unable to fulfill certain private label orders because of the disruption to operations in Puerto Rico, leading to a double-digit decrease in private label sales in the third quarter.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express, Inc.

Notably, the results from the ‘Spasticity In Stroke-Randomised Study’ (SISTERS) trial were published in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry (JNNP).The results demonstrate that ITB Therapy with Lioresal Intrathecal (baclofen injection) delivered via the SynchroMed II Infusion System is superior to oral antispastic medications in decreasing muscle tone in the affected lower and upper extremities.Going by the American Association of Neurological Surgeons’ data, more than 12 million people suffer from spasticity worldwide. According to the company, severe spasticity patients have tight, stiff muscles that make everyday activities tiring and difficult.

Hence in an initiative to provide effective treatment to severe PSS patients, the company demonstrated the efficacy of ITB therapy over oral medication.  SISTERS is the first randomized, controlled, open-label, multicentre study to examine the effectiveness and safety of ITB Therapy compared to CMM with oral medications for treatment of PSS after six months of active treatment.Developments in Pain TherapiesMedtronic is consistently trying to boost its Pain Therapies division, which is part of the Restorative Therapies Group.

Other revenues dropped 5.3% to $75 million.MarginsA dismal topline performance along with a 4.5% rise in cost of products sold (to $500.9 million) resulted in gross margin contraction in the third quarter.

Research and development expenses also declined 4.6% to $91.2 million.

The company currently expects to register revenue in the range of $7.76 billion–$7.80 billion representing growth at CER in the range of 0.9–1.4% (earlier prediction was growth of 1.8–2.7%).

While earnings remained below the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues were marginally in line with the same. We are disappointed by the company’s declining sales performance within most of its core segments. According to the company, the challenging top-line result was due to the pace of supply recovery of certain key brands, softened domestic market conditions and slower than anticipated sales recapture, particularly in the United States. The lowered 2017 guidance also added to our concerns indicating little chances of recovery ahead.However, we look forward to the ongoing synergy from the LDR Holding acquisition, which should broaden and complement the company’s musculoskeletal offering. We are also impressed by the strong strategic and financial goals which the combined entity expects to reach.Zacks Rank & Key PicksZimmer Biomet has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express, Inc.

1156,ISRG,"Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) has been hogging the limelight for developments in the flagship, sensor-based continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system — FreeStyle Libre System.The company has been witnessing solid growth in the global Diabetes Care business, primarily on the back of solid contributions from FreeStyle Libre. Accordingly, it is leaving no stone unturned to cash in on the growing popularity of this CGM system that eliminates the need for daily finger sticks.Developments in FreeStyle LibreFollowing the FDA approval in September 2017 for the FreeStyle Libre Flash glucose monitoring system, Abbott recently achieved another major milestone after U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) granted FreeStyle Libre approval for Medicare coverage. Post approval, FreeStyle Libre has become the only no- user calibration CGM device, under the Medicare coverage, available for around 30 million people with diabetes in the United States.Meanwhile, Abbott has been steadily progressing with the development of its Diabetes Care segment.

Notably, the FreeStyle Libre system is partially or fully covered in 21 countries, including France, Germany and Japan.Moreover, the company announced receipt of Health Canada License for FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring System in June 2017. This drove the Diabetes Care segment, which saw revenue growth of 37.6% in third-quarter 2017 on continued acceptance of FreeStyle Libre internationally.We believe the latest CMS reimbursement grant will boost the company’s performance in the domestic arena as well.We expect Freestyle Libre to contribute to Abbott’s top line as along with the U.K., Japanese and Canadian developments, the French Health Ministry approved national reimbursement for the device last May.Market PotentialAn ageing population, unhealthy lifestyle and rising awareness and expenditure in healthcare are likely to drive growth further in the diabetes market.

We are upbeat about the continued strong Invisalign volumes. An extremely strong summer teen season drove the company’s Invisalign growth within the global teen market.Within Scanners and Service, the company witnessed a nice uptake of iTero scanners by GP dentists.

The year-over-year decline was led by a shift in the company’s strategy to focus on growing its core revenue mix.Apart from that, the impact of the Cures Act, contract modifications with UnitedHealthcare and the impact of hurricanes Harvey and Irma were major deterrents.

This guidance incorporates the estimated adverse effect of the Cures Act legislation and the company's estimates regarding its contract with UnitedHealthcare. The company has reduced its revenue outlook for 2017 to a range of $805-$810 million from the previous $815-$835 million, including the impact of the revised UnitedHealthcare contract on its 2017 revenues and the damages incurred due to hurricanes.

Meanwhile, the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $630 million. The year-over-year decline was a result of sales loss owing to divested businesses. Organic revenue growth at constant currency was 4% year over year, primarily driven by balanced growth in two of the four segments.The company operates through four segments: Healthcare Products, Healthcare Specialty Services, Applied Sterilization Technologies and Life Sciences.Revenues from the Healthcare Products segment declined 2% year over year to $302.1 million in the reported quarter. This was largely due to an 8% decline in capital equipment revenues and a 1% decrease in consumable revenues as a result of divestitures, which in turn were partially offset by an 8% increase in service revenues. STERIS PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  STERIS PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | STERIS PLC Quote Revenues from the Healthcare Specialty Services segment declined 15.7% to $116.1 million on a reported basis due to linen divestitures.

On an organic basis, revenues increased 9% year over year. MarginsAdjusted gross margin improved 360 basis points (bps) year over year to 42.2% in the reported quarter on account of synergies from divested low-margin businesses, improvement in operational efficiencies, a favorable product mix and pricing.STERIS witnessed a 6.3% year-over-year decline in selling, general and administrative expenses to $153.4 million. Research and development expenses fell 4.8% to $13.9 million. Accordingly, adjusted operating margin expanded 490 bps on a year-over-year basis to 15.7% in the reported quarter.Financial DetailsSTERIS exited second-quarter fiscal 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of $295.6 million compared with $294.8 million at the end of first-quarter fiscal 2018.

Adjusted EPS is projected in the range of $3.96-$4.09.Our TakeSTERIS exited second-quarter fiscal 2018 on a mixed note. The year-over-year decline in revenues is a disappointment.

Within this segment, total sales at comparable drugstores rose 4.7%, while prescriptions filled in comparable stores grew 8.9% on account of Medicare Part D growth and volume growth from previously announced strategic pharmacy collaborations.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 earnings is pegged at $5.54, within the company’s guided range.However, per management, the adjusted EPS outlook for fiscal 2018 does not include any impact from the latest U.S. tax legislation, which slashes corporate tax rates from 35% to 21%. Moreover, the guidance assumes current exchange rates for the rest of the fiscal.Our TakeWalgreens Boots reported an impressive first quarter of fiscal 2018. We are also encouraged by the increase in sales at the Retail Pharmacy International segment. Moreover, Walgreens Boots has been gaining on account of the company’s strategic tie-ups, which brought more patients to its U.S. pharmacies.We are also upbeat about the Rite Aid acquisition deal for which the company got regulatory approval in September 2017. Per Walgreens Boots, this modified merger contract is in line with its growth strategy and offers additional operational benefits. It will also help the company expand and optimize retail pharmacy network in key U.S. markets, including the Northeast.Also, we are upbeat about the company expanding global footprint with its decision to acquire a 40% stake in Sinopharm Holding Guoda Drugstores Co., Ltd. (GuoDa), a subsidiary of China National Accord Medicines Corporation Ltd. On completion, this investment should provide a strong impetus to Walgreens Boots’ worldwide retail pharmacy business. Notably, Shanghai-based GuoDa is a large national pharmacy chain in China. It is the retail pharmacy platform of China National Pharmaceutical Group Corporation (CNPGC).Moreover, the company’s acceptance of the proposal to sell part of its investment in its Chinese wholesale partner Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals Corporation for huge cash returns buoys optimism.Zacks Rank & Key PicksWalgreens Boots carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1168,ISRG,"On Jan 2, we issued an updated research report on Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report). The company’s solid international foothold is expected to boost growth by expanding existing product offerings in all business segments. However, the company announced the voluntary product recall of the Oral Care line-up in 2017.Stryker is focusing on international growth. A significant turnaround in the company’s European business backed by effective restructuring measures indicates a potential upside. In particular, the company’s Medsurg product line has witnessed strong demand in the European and Australian markets. Further, favorable response for the Medsurg product line in China has enhanced the company’s international prospects.Stryker’s international organic sales growth in the third quarter of 2017 was 5.2% on a year-over-year basis. Strong international performance came on the back of solid performances in Europe, Asia and Latin America. In the quarter, internationally, MedSurg delivered organic sales growth of 7.1%, which indicates strong growth in Medical businesses, primarily in Europe.Neurotechnology and Spine also witnessed robust organic growth. The performance was bolstered by high demand for Neurotech products in Europe and Asia. Countries like UK, Germany, Italy have been witnessing solid performances from Stryker since long. In fact, the company’s Physio unit launched Automated External Defibrillators (AED) in Europe, recently.On the flip side, Stryker announced the voluntary product recall of the Oral Care lineup, which was offered by the company’s Sage-Products unit. Added to the voluntary recall, Stryker has placed a temporary hold on certain cloth-based products.Stryker continues to witness lower demand for health care products. The company has been facing challenging global economic conditions, particularly in the United States and Western Europe. Additionally, lower reimbursements for medical products and services may impose a downward pressure on the prices for the company’s products, longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies, which will dent the top line.Stryker now expects full year organic sales growth at the lower end of the previous range of 6.5%-7% and adjusted net earnings in the band of $6.45-$6.50.Stryker's price movement over the past year has been favorable. The company yielded a return of almost 29.7%, better than the industry's 24% rally. The current level is also higher than the S&P 500 index’s return of 19% over the same time frame.

The increase in net revenues was due to growth from acquisitions of 6.9%, organic growth (net revenue growth less revenue from acquisitions for the first twelve months after the close of each acquisition) of 2.3%, and the benefit from foreign currency translation of approximately 30 basis points. However, this was partially offset by a 0.7% adverse impact of multiple hurricanes during the quarter.Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Quote Quarter under ReviewCurrently, LabCorp reports under two operating segments: LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development.In the reported quarter, LabCorp Diagnostics reported net revenue of $1.84 billion, up 9.9% year over year, fueled by price, mix, tuck-in acquisitions, organic volume (measured by requisitions excluding requisitions from acquisitions for the first 12 months after the close of each acquisition) and the benefit from foreign currency translation of approximately 20 basis points. The company reported 7.3% increase in total volume (measured by requisition) and a 2.4% increase in revenue per requisition in the quarter.After several quarters of drag in sales, Covance Drug Development reported an 8.6% rise in net revenue to $761.1 million in the third quarter.

During the quarter, the company returned $42.1 million to shareholders through share repurchases and currently has $444.7 million of authorization, remaining under its existing share repurchase plan.OutlookBased on a strong third-quarter show and considering a gradually improving foreign exchange scenario, the company increased its earlier provided 2017 outlook.Net revenue growth is now expected to remain in the band of 8-8.5% year over year, ahead of the earlier range of 5-6.5%. This includes a 10 bps impact from an unfavorable foreign exchange headwind. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $10.13 billion.Adjusted EPS guidance for 2017 has been narrowed to the range of $9.40−$9.60 (previous range: $9.30−$9.65). The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.51 falls within the guided range.Free cash flow expectation has been raised to a new band of $970−$1010 million (previous range: $925−$975 million) up 8–13% from the prior year.Our TakeLabCorp’s third-quarter earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Strong year-over-year increase in both earnings and revenues were encouraging too. LabCorp Diagnostics business was strong on improving price, mix, acquisition and favorable foreign exchange scenario.Also after several quarters of dull performance, Covance Drug Development reported strong growth. This was primarily on the back of the acquisition of Chiltern, strong organic growth and favorable foreign currency translation. An increased guidance for 2017 boosts investors’ confidence indicating chances of this bullish trend to be maintained in the fourth quarter too.We believe that with the integration of newer acquisitions, LabCorp is perfectly positioned to drive long-term profitable growth through a combination of world-class diagnostics, drug development expertise and knowledge services.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksCurrently, LabCorp has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express, Inc.

The resultant free cash flow was $5.9 billion in fiscal 2017.GuidanceWalgreens Boots has issued the fiscal 2018 guidance. The company expects adjusted EPS in the $5.40-$5.70 range for the fiscal. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 earnings is pegged at $5.48, within but near to the lower end of the company’s guided range.Our TakeWalgreens Boots reported an impressive fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 with both earnings and sales surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, declining sales at the Retail Pharmacy International was a disappointment. Nevertheless, Walgreens Boots has been gaining on account of the company’s strategic tie-ups which brought more patients to its U.S. pharmacies.In September, Walgreens Boots announced the receipt of U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) approval for the purchase of 1,932 stores, three distribution centers and related inventory from Rite Aid for a total of $4.375 billion. Synergies of $300 million are expected to be realized within four years of initial closing of the transaction, achieved majorly from procurement, cost savings and other operational areas. Per Walgreens Boots, this modified merger contract is in line with its growth strategy and offers additional operational benefits. It will also help the company expand and optimize retail pharmacy network in key U.S. markets, including the Northeast.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCurrently, Walgreens Boots has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express, Inc.

1178,ISRG,"NuVasive, Inc. (NUVA  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 52 cents, reflecting a 30% rise from the year-ago quarter. The figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 48 cents.Solid revenue growth primarily led to this year-over-year bottom-line improvement.Including one-time items, the company reported third-quarter 2017 net income per share of 64 cents, a significant improvement from the year-ago figure of 7 cents per share.Revenues in the reported quarter increased 3.2% year over year to $247.4 million (up 3.4% at constant exchange rate or CER). The figure however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $255 million.The above upside in revenues was driven by a robust performance in the international market on strong growth across all geographical regions. In the United States, procedural volumes were sluggish, unable to meet the company’s expectations.NuVasive, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise NuVasive, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | NuVasive, Inc. Quote However, putting together the impact of hurricanes Harvey and Irma on NuVasive’s U.S. results and Maria on the company’s international results along with one less selling day, the revenue growth would have been approximately 6% year over year.In the reported quarter, the company’s U.S. Spinal Hardware business registered more than 2% growth backed by introduction of new products. Adjusting the impact of the hurricanes and offsetting the effect of one less selling day, the U.S. Spinal Hardware business approximately grew 5% year-over-year.The U.S. Surgical Support business declined 12.7% in the third quarter, primarily on continued softness in biologics business. With new competitive products entering the market, the company faces challenges in the field. Also, procedural issues are affecting revenue volumes.However, the international business recorded 46% growth at CER on continued strong demand of the company’s spine technology outside the United States, particularly in the key markets of Italy, Germany and Japan.In the quarter under review, there was a 10.8% increase in cost of goods sold. Despite that, gross profits inched up 0.8% to $181.8 million. Yet the company reported a 180-basis point (bps) year-over-year contraction in gross margin to 73.5% in the third quarter that includes a 90-bps year-over-year impact from low-margin businesses.Sales, marketing and administrative expenses went down 4.6% to $125.8 million, while research and development expenses increased 1.6% to $12.7 million.NuVasive posted adjusted operating income of $43.3 million in the reported quarter, reflecting a 20.1% rise from the year-ago number. Adjusted operating margin expanded 247 bps to 17.5% in the quarter under review.The company exited third-quarter 2017 with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $62.2 million, down from $130.9 million at the end of the previously reported quarter.OutlookIn view of the continued impact of Maria in Puerto Rico in the fourth quarter as well as the anticipated lower U.S. procedural volumes, NuVasive has updated its full-year 2017 guidance.Currently, the company expects to report revenue growth of 7.2%, lower than the earlier expected rate of 11.1% at CER to approximately $1.030 billion (earlier it was $1.065 billion) in 2017. The figure also remains lower than the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.06 billion.NuVasive also lowered its guidance for full-year 2017 adjusted earnings per share to $1.91 as compared to the previous expectation of $2 per share. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.99 remains significantly above the company’s guidance. Additionally, adjusted operating margin for the year is currently expected at 16.6% compared with the former projection of 17.1%.Our TakeNuVasive exited the third quarter with better-than-expected earnings and revenue numbers. This quarter, the company’s performance was significantly dependent on stellar international growth. The company noted that the reported quarter marked the fourth consecutive one, registering more than 20% growth in international business. However, overall sales in the quarter were grossly impacted by procedural volumes related challenges in the United States and the adverse impact of Harvey and Irma on NuVasive’s U.S. results and Maria on the international front.With chances of the fourth-quarter revenues being affected by Maria in Puerto Rico and due to the anticipated lower U.S. procedural volumes continuing into the same period, NuVasive is pressed to reduce its full-year guidance, which is disappointing.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCurrently, NuVasive has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express, Inc. (PETS  -  Free Report), Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) and Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (ISRG  -  Free Report).

1179,ISRG,"Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 84 cents, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 86 cents by 2.3%. However, adjusted earnings improved 23.5% year over year, primarily driven by strong sales growth at the company’s transcatheter heart valves business.Excluding one-time items, net income in the third quarter came in at $170.1 million or 79 cents per share, up 20.3% or 21.5% year over year, respectively.Sales DetailsEdwards Lifesciences’ third-quarter sales improved 11.1% to $821.5 million. However, the figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $834 million by 1.5%. Underlying sales increased 12.9% (including the impact of Germany stocking sales as customers in the nation chose to purchase additional inventory of the SAPIEN 3 valve in anticipation of a potential supply interruption resulting from recent intellectual property litigation).Revenues were primarily driven by considerable growth in transcatheter heart valve sales as well as strong performance by Surgical Heart Valve Therapy and Critical Care product lines too across all regions. Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Quote                                                                                                                       Segments DetailsFor the third quarter, the company reported Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy (THVT) sales of $481.2 million, reflecting 17.3% growth over the prior-year quarter. In the United States, THVT sales in the quarter totaled $311.6 million, up 20.1% year over year. Growth was driven by excellent clinical performance by SAPIEN 3 as well continued strong therapy implementation across all regions.Surgical Heart Valve Therapy sales in the quarter were $195.6 million, up 2.4% from the prior-year quarter. This was led by strong demand for the EDWARDS INTUITY Elite valve system and strong uptake of core products outside the United States, partially offset by the continuing shift from surgical aortic valves to the SAPIEN 3 valves in the United States and Europe.Critical Care sales were $144.7 million in the reported quarter, representing an increase of 4.5% from third-quarter 2016.  Solid growth across all product categories was driven by strong growth in the company's core products and the Enhanced Surgical Recovery Program, mainly in the United States and Asia Pacific.MarginsIn the third quarter, gross margin expanded 120 basis points (bps) to 74% owing to a more profitable product mix, led by growing sales of transcatheter valves as well as a favorable comparison of supply chain expenditures. This was however partially offset by expenses incurred due to flooding from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico and the shutdown of the company's manufacturing plant in Switzerland.SG&A expenses rose 6.5% year over year to $244.6 million on account of sales and personnel-related expenses, primarily in the Transcatheter Valve (THV) segment.R&D expenditures increased 26.5% year over year to $142.9 million owing to continued investments in the company’s transcatheter aortic valve and mitral valve program. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter expanded 50 bps to 26.9% as the rise in revenues outweighed the increase in operating expenses.Cash PositionEdwards Lifesciences exited the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.4 billion, compared with $1.13 billion at the end of the second quarter. Long-term debt in the quarter totaled $1.03 billion, compared with $1.02 billion reported in the previous quarter.Cash flow from operating activities was $310.8 million in the third quarter, compared with $197.7 million in the previous quarter. Excluding capital spending of $42.3 million, free cash flow was $268.5 million. During the quarter, average diluted shares outstanding were 216.2 million. 2017 Guidance StaysEdwards Lifesciences has reaffirmed its full-year 2017 sales expectations at the high end of the previously projected range of $3.2-$3.4 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year revenue is $3.40 billion, coinciding with the high end of the guided range. Adjusted EPS expectations have also been reinstated at $3.65–$3.85. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year adjusted EPS stands at $3.78, within the company’s guided range.For the fourth quarter of 2017, the company projects sales (after adjusting for the effect of Germany stocking sales) between $855 million and $895 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is $874.2 million, within the company’s projected range. The company estimates adjusted EPS between 84 cents and 94 cents. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted EPS is 92 cents, which is also within the company‘s forecasted range.Our TakeEdwards Lifesciences exited the third quarter on a disappointing note with both earnings and revenues lagging the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company’s business was affected by the recent natural disasters in the Caribbean and the United States. Edwards Lifesciences has principal manufacturing locations for its Critical Care products in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. In Puerto Rico, the company had to discontinue production due to floods which affected the top line to some extent. The company also had to postpone a number of procedures in Houston and Florida. Per management, natural disasters negatively impacted third-quarter sales to the tune of $2 million.Nevertheless, strong transcatheter valve sales in the domestic market as well as overseas is a major positive. The company also performed well on its gross margin front, which raises optimism.Management expects to gain traction in the ever-expanding TAVR market, based on increasing preference in favor of transcatheter aortic valve replacement as well as compelling clinical evidence, leading to strong adoption of THV therapy. However, tough competition in the cardiac devices market and reimbursement issues continue to pose challenges.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCurrently, Edwards Lifesciences has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express, Inc.

The updated outlook represents EPS growth of 32-34% on a reported basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 EPS is pegged at $3.17, below the guided range.Our TakeIDEXX exited the third quarter on a mixed note, with earnings beating and revenues missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, solid year-over year growth in organic revenues buoys optimism. The company’s raised EPS guidance for 2017 is also encouraging.The stellar quarterly performance was driven by strong sales within the company’s companion animal business. The companion animal market fundamentals remain solid with tremendous global runway for growth. Management’s innovation-based, multi-modality global strategy, enabled by enhanced commercial capability, accelerated recurring CAG Diagnostics revenue growth.

However, adjusted earnings deteriorated 4.3% on a year-over-year basis.Revenues totaled $132.6 million, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $131 million. Revenues also increased 4.7% on a year-over-year basis.Quality Systems carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Segment DetailsTotal software, hardware and related revenues increased 1.5% to $39.3 million, primarily driven by a 16.3% rise in software-related subscription services. However, growth at this segment was partially offset by lower software license and hardware sales, which declined almost 17% in the quarter. The company expects software license and hardware revenues to remain under pressure for the remainder of the fiscal.Support and maintenance revenues in the quarter totaled $41.7 million, up 7% on a year-over-year basis. Revenues at this segment were driven annual price increases.Professional services revenues increased 9.9% to almost $7.7 million. The year-over-year increase was led by transfusion services.

In the second quarter, recurring revenues reached a record level of 83% of total revenues. Quality Systems, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Quality Systems, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Quality Systems, Inc. Quote Quarter HighlightsEagleDream & Entrada Hold Promise: In August, Quality Systems completed the acquisition of EagleDream Health Inc. for roughly $26 million in cash. EagleDream Health is a cloud-based analytics company that optimizes understanding across clinical, financial and administrative data to enhance practice performance.Following the acquisition, NextGen Healthcare, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Quality Systems, gained facilities to provide enriching care experience and accelerate patient engagement for ambulatory clinics and health systems. Management further expects to achieve per capita cost efficiency as well as enhanced work-life balance for clinicians and staff in the quarter to come (read more: Quality Systems Completes EagleDream Health Buyout).Entrada’s pipeline has been offering new deals to Quality Systems for quite some time now. Earlier this year, NextGen Healthcare had acquired Entrada for $34 million. Per the second-quarter fiscal 2018 results, Subscription revenues were significantly up on strength in Entrada. We believe the acquisition will prove accretive over the long haul.Bookings Decline: Quality Systems registered bookings worth $26 million, down 24% on a year-over-year basis. Per management, subscription bookings continued to be a steady contributor to second-quarter bookings. However, headwinds in the perpetual license bookings marred bookings growth in the quarter.Margin DetailsQuality Systems’ gross margin remained flat on a year-over-year basis at 56% of net revenues in the reported quarter.Coming to operating expenses, the company recorded selling general & administrative (SG&A) expenses of $41 million, down from $42.8 million a year ago.

R&D expenses rose in the second quarter on the back of incremental personnel costs, offset by increased software capitalization.GuidanceFor fiscal 2018, the company projects revenues in the band of $522-$530 million, up from the previously issued range of $512-$530 million.Adjusted earnings per share are projected in the range of 64 cents to 68 cents, compared with the previous 62 cents to 70 cents.Our TakeQuality Systems posted a stellar second quarter of fiscal 2018, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both the counts. We are particularly upbeat about the company’s solid performance with regard to total software, hardware and related revenues. Quality Systems’ solid recurring revenue base is a key catalyst for the quarters to come. Furthermore, the company’s new Entrada and Eagle Dream solutions are likely to drive growth. On the flipside, ongoing sluggishness in the RCM customer base, intensifying competition and a strict regulatory environment are likely to mar the top line. Furthermore, management slashed the high end of the fiscal 2018 earnings guidance, signaling at looming concerns. The company expects software license and hardware revenues to remain under pressure for the remainder of the fiscal.Companies With Solid Earnings ResultsIntuitive Surgical Inc.

The figure was also higher than 20 cents in the year-ago quarter.In the reported quarter, revenues increased roughly 29% year over year to $132.8 million approximately, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $131.0 million. The year-over-year upside was supported by robust performance of the Impella heart pump product line.Quarter HighlightsGlobal revenues of the manufacturer, developer and marketer of medical products surged 30% to $127.4 million in the quarter.U.S. Impella revenues improved 27% to $113.6 million (driven by a 33% increase in patient utilization). Outside the United States, revenues surged 61% to $13.8 million. Germany accounted for the majority of the international revenues, which grew 64% on a year-over-year basis.During the reported quarter, the installed base for Impella 2.5 heart pumps in the United States grew by 17 hospitals, taking the installed customer base total to 1,171 sites.

QuoteFinancial ConditionAbiomed’s cash and cash equivalents were $44.5 million as of Sep 30, compared with $39.0 million as of Mar 31. Notably, management announced that the company currently has no debt.GuidanceAbiomed forecasts fiscal 2018 revenues in the range of $565 million to $575 million. This marks an increase of 27-29% from the fiscal 2016 level. Operating margin is projected in the band of 23% to 25%.Our TakeFurther, we believe that robust demand for the Impella product line will continue to drive Abiomed’s top line over the long term. The company’s expanding product portfolio will improve its penetration into both the prophylactic high-risk PCI and cardiogenic shock patient market. This is evident from the fact that both Impella 2.5 and CP continue to add centers in the United States. New publications regarding the devices in leading medical journals help in promoting their utilization and effectiveness.Although Abiomed’s significant international presence helps broaden customer base among other positives, fluctuations in currency exchange rates can adversely impact the company’s international sales.

Excluding revenues from acquisitions, discontinued products and the effect of currency exchange rates, organic revenues rose 1.5% year over year.The solid revenue growth in the third quarter was primarily driven by strong contribution from the Orthopedics and Tissue Technologies segments.Coming to product categories, revenues from the company's Specialty Surgical Solutions segment increased 3.4% to $164.8 million.Orthopedics and Tissue Technologies revenues came in at $114.1 million in the third quarter, up 25.5% year over year.Margin TrendGross margin contracted 81 basis points (bps) to 63.5% in the reported quarter. Per the company, adjusted gross margin contracted 60 bps to 68.7%.Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 29.9% to $145.9 million in the reported quarter, while research and development expenses contracted 0.6% to $15 million.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 adjusted earnings is pegged at $1.91, above the company’s guided range.Our TakeIntegra LifeSciences exited the third quarter of 2017 on a disappointing note. Also, contraction in adjusted operating margin and adjusted gross margin adds to the woes. Moreover, the drop in year-over-year investments in research and development is discouraging. In spite of the raised full-year revenue guidance, the slashed full-year adjusted earnings range adds to the woes.However, the strong year-over-year increase in revenues on the back of its Orthopedics and Tissue Technologies segment buoys optimism. We are also encouraged to note that the company’s segments saw year-over-year revenue growth in the quarter. Nonetheless, we believe the company is trying to execute its growth plan through an efficient management team.Zacks Rank & Key PicksIntegra LifeSciences has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express, Inc.

Revenues were driven by a 1.3% increase in the average net Medicare reimbursement rate and a 2.8% rise in average daily census.

Meanwhile, in the trailing four quarters, the company posted earnings beats, with an average of 1.86%. Currently, Stryker carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The upside in earnings was primarily driven by a rise in revenues to $3.01 billion, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.97 billion. At constant currency (cc), net sales improved 5.8% from the year-ago quarter.Segment DetailsOrthopaedics net sales of $1.1 billion increased 5.1% year over year in the reported quarter. Excluding the 0.3% impact of acquisitions, net sales in the quarter increased 4.5% in cc, including 6.5% from increased unit volume.

For full year, the company expects adjusted earnings in the band of $6.45 to $6.50. Stryker expects organic sales growth of 6.5% to 7.0% for full-year 2017.Our TakeWe believe Stryker’s innovative product pipeline will be a key catalyst in the near term. Furthermore, growing adoption of MAKO will drive sales in the orthopedic and reconstructive surgery market.On the flip side, China might prove to be a challenging market for the company. Coming to supply-related headwinds, the company has been grappling with issues in the spine business for long. We believe that this may prove to be a major drawback in the quarters ahead.

1189,ISRG,"Cerner Corp (CERN  -  Free Report) reported adjusted third-quarter 2017 earnings of 61 cents per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. The lackluster third-quarter performance can be primarily attributed to the year-over-year decline in bookings, which had scaled an all-time high in the last quarter. However, earnings rose 3.4% on a year-over-year basis.The company reported net revenues of $1.28 billion, falling short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.29 billion. However, revenues rose 7.7% on a year-over-year basis. Cerner holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Bookings DisappointIn the third quarter, Cerner registered bookings worth $1.111 billion, down 22.5% on a year-over-year basis. In fact, bookings were below the company’s previously issued guidance owing to the postponement of several big contracts from this quarter to tentatively the fourth quarter of 2017.Notably, bookings in the last quarter totaled $1.64 billion, up 16% on a year-over-year basis.Nonetheless, Cerner is well positioned for a strong full-year performance based on solid bookings guidance for the fourth quarter. Next-quarter bookings are expected in the band of $1.75 billion to $2 billion, with the midpoint reflecting 30% growth on a year-over-year basis. The midpoint of the fourth-quarter booking guidance would increase full year 2017 bookings guidance by 8% on a year-over-year basis.Segment DetailsSystems sales increased 8% to $324 million. Sales were buoyed by licensed software and subscriptions, partially offset by a decline in technology resale.Total support, maintenance and services, including professional and managed services, rose 7.8% from the year-ago quarter to $927.8 million. This reflects solid execution by the company’s service organizations. Revenue Cycle has also been a strong contributor, courtesy of strong sales and contribution from RevWorks services (revenue management services).

Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $752 million.It is important to note that the company’s stockholders approved a three-for-one split of the issued and outstanding common stock, which began trading on a split-adjusted basis on Oct 6. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Intuitive Surgical, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Intuitive Surgical, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Intuitive Surgical, Inc. QuoteBusiness HighlightsSolid Procedure Trends: Intuitive Surgical posted solid numbers in the quarter, courtesy of rising customer adoption of procedures and growth in system placements. The company outperformed in the Mature and Growth procedures, especially in general and thoracic surgery.Precisely, third-quarter procedures increased approximately 15% on a year-over-year basis. U.S. procedures grew approximately 12% and outside of the United States (OUS) procedures grew approximately 23% year over year. Procedure performance in Asia showed continued strength on solid growth in China, Japan and Korea. Added to this, solid growth in prostatectomy procedure volumes lent Intuitive Surgical a competitive edge in the broader prostate surgery market in the third quarter.Launches Bode Well: In the third quarter, Intuitive Surgical expanded the launch of two additional instruments and accessories for da Vinci X and Xi platforms in seven countries. In fact, the company initiated a limited launch of a refined vessel sealer in Europe in the reported quarter. Management announced plans to file the first 510(k) for FDA approval of da Vinci SP program by year-end, and submissions for additional indications thereafter.International Sales: Globally, Intuitive Surgical’s system placements included 25 in Europe, 14 in Japan, five in India, four in New Mexico and one in China. However, as the OUS markets are in early stages of adoption, sales might be lower than estimated in the region.Revenue SegmentsInstruments and Accessories: Revenues at the segment grew 15% to $401 million in the quarter, driven by strong procedure growth and increased sales of stapling and vessel sealing products. Revenues realized per procedure were approximately $1,880 compared with $1,870 in the year-ago quarter.System:Sales increased 15% to $237 million buoyed by higher system placements, partially offset by lower average selling prices. Notably, Intuitive Surgical generated approximately $7 million in revenues associated with operating leases in the reported quarter compared with $4 million in the third quarter of 2016. Coming to the company’s flagship da Vinci surgical platform, the company shipped 169 surgical systems, up from 134 in the third quarter of 2016.Service:The company registered revenues of $147 million, up 13% on a year-over-year basis on growth in the installed base of da Vinci systems.MarginIntuitive Surgical’s adjusted gross margin in the reported quarter contracted 130 basis points (bps) to 71.8% of net revenues. The decrease in margins was due to a $7-million medical device tax refund, which was received in 2016.Notably, management at Intuitive Surgical expects margins to fluctuate based on the company’s mix of new products, mix of systems in instrument and accessory revenue, reduction of product costs and the reinstatement of the medical device tax in 2018.Financial UpdateIntuitive Surgical ended the third quarter of 2017 with $3.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and investments, up by $379 billion on a year-over-year basis. This was primarily driven by cash generated from operations and employee stock-option exercises.Bottom LineIntuitive Surgical exited the third quarter on a solid note, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both the counts. Procedure performance in Asia showed continued strength with solid growth in China, Japan and Korea. The company gained significantly on the CE Mark approval for da Vinci X in Europe. The stock has got a further boost on the recent FDA approval of the same in the recent past. A positive outlook for the coming quarters also raises our confidence in the stock. Further, incremental spending on product development and higher investments in international markets are likely to drive long-term growth. However, the da Vinci Surgical System has a long sale and purchase order cycle which might act against the company. In fact, the stock looks a tad expensive, adding to our concerns. Intuitive Surgical expects sales to be lower outside the United States.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are SONOVA HOLDING (SONVY  -  Free Report), EnteroMedics Inc.  and Luminex Corporation (LMNX  -  Free Report). All the stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.SONOVA represented a solid return of 8.1% over the last three months. The company has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 7%.EnteroMedics has an average earnings beat of 55.8% for the trailing four quarters. The company has a solid return of 7.1% for the past month.Luminex came up with a positive earnings surprise of 188.9% last quarter.

1192,ISRG,"Intuitive Surgical’s (ISRG  -  Free Report) third-quarter results, scheduled for release on Oct 19, are expected to show steady growth in instruments and accessories revenues — one of the major revenue components. While this could majorly drive its third-quarter earnings, an expected improvement in revenues at all other segments should help the company generate solid results this season.It is important to note that Intuitive Surgical delivered positive earnings surprises in the past four quarters, the average being 7.8%. Similar to the prior quarter, strong procedure growth and increased sales of stapling and vessel sealing products are expected to be the main factors driving the surge in instrument and accessories revenues.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for instrument and accessories revenues stands at $394 million for the third quarter. This reflects an increase of 13.2% from the year-ago quarter. Continued development in European markets, solid access to the company’s products in Asia and new platforms in imaging and advanced instruments are likely to drive revenues at the segment.Intuitive Surgical, Inc. Price and Consensus  Intuitive Surgical, Inc. Price and Consensus | Intuitive Surgical, Inc. QuoteOther Factors at PlayWe believe that the growing adoption of Intuitive Surgical’s da Vinci system among physicians for general surgery, oncology, urology and gynecology procedures is a catalyst for the third quarter. Overall, Q3 revenues are expected at around $752.3 million, up 10.2% from the prior-year quarter. Below are the other factors that might influence Intuitive Surgical’s quarterly results this earnings season.Solid Procedure Trends: Expectations of outperformance in the Mature and Growth procedures, especially in general and thoracic surgery, is likely to boost the company’s top line. Added to this, solid growth in prostatectomy procedure volumes is likely to lend Intuitive Surgical a competitive edge in the broader prostate surgery market in the third quarter.Geographically, procedure growth in the third quarter is expected to be led by China, Germany and Japan. In Germany, procedure growth is likely to be supported by solid installed base expansion.Furthermore, procedure trends are expected to be solid globally, with growth led by general surgery and global urology segments.Systems & Service Unit Hold Promise: Solid growth in the company’s product and systems segment is expected to drive the company’s third-quarter earnings. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues at this segment stands at $216 million, up 5.4% on a year-over-year basis. The increase reflects higher system placements and operating lease revenues.  However, this might be partially offset by lower average selling prices and lease buyout revenues at the segment.Coming to revenues at the services segment, the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $145 million, up 11.5% on a year-over-year basis.Growth in System’s Installed Base: Buoyed by higher system placements and operating lease revenues, we expect the company’s total systems installed base to be 4231 units, up 82 units from the last quarter. It is important to note that Intuitive Surgical generated approximately $6 million in revenues from operating leases last quarter, compared with 4 million in the second quarter of 2016.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Intuitive Surgical does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Intuitive Surgical is -0.49%, as the Most Accurate estimate is $1.96 and the Zacks Consensus Estimates is pegged at $1.97. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Intuitive Surgical carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings reflects a decline of 4.2% on a year-over-year basis.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.17% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Adjusted EPS also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Per management, the hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria have dented the adjusted EPS figure to the tune of 2 cents.The year-over-year decline can be attributed to a dull revenue performance in the reported quarter, primarily because of underperformance by the U.S. & Canada and manufacturing/wholesale segments.Including one-time items, the company reported earnings of 31 cents per share, down 34% year over year.RevenuesRevenues during the reported quarter dropped 2.9% year over year to $609.5 million. The figure also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $616 million.The lower sales at the U.S. & Canada and manufacturing/wholesale segments can be cited as the major reason for the disappointing numbers.Same-store sales increased 1.3% in domestic company-owned stores (including GNC.com sales) in the third quarter of 2017.

In domestic franchise locations as well, revenues declined nearly $7.5 million, partially offset by a 1.3% increase in retail same-store sales. However, GNC.com sales were up 41.9% in the third quarter.Revenues at the international segment increased 19.3% to $49.1 million. Revenues from international franchisees rose $2.8 million.

Sales to wholesale partners decreased 10.5% year over year from $24.7 million to $22.1 million in the quarter. However, Intersegment sales increased to $58 million in the quarterfrom the year-ago $53 million on the company's increased focus on proprietary products.  MarginGross profit deteriorated 8.6% in the reported quarter to $196.8 million. Consequently, gross margin contracted 200 basis points (bps) to 32.3%.Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 1.7% to $150.9 million.

At the end of the third quarter, the company had a total long-term debt of $5.68 billion, a marginal decline from $5.84 billion at the end of the second quarter.GuidanceBoston Scientific has provided an update to its full-year 2017 guidance.Banking on a solid third-quarter show and a gradually improving foreign exchange scenario, the company raised its 2017 revenue guidance to the range of $8.985-$9.015 billion (annualized growth of 7-8% on reported basis and growth of 7% on operational basis including contribution of approximately 120 bps from EndoChoice and Symetis) from the earlier band of $8.89-$8.99 billion (annualized growth of 6-7% on reported basis and growth of 6-8% on operational basis).

Adjusted earnings are expected in the band of 32-35 cents per share on revenues of $2.345-$2.375 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPS stands at 34 cents while for revenues, it is $2.32 billion.Our TakeDespite back-to-back natural disasters, Boston Scientific managed to register solid third-quarter performance with earnings in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues, ahead of the mark. A gradually improving foreign exchange scenario has also started to contribute to the company’s overall topline performance.The raised guidance is all the more impressive and indicative of this overall bullish trend to continue through the rest of 2017.Boston Scientific is leaving no stone unturned to strengthen its core businesses and invest in new technologies and global markets, which accounted for higher sales across all its geographies in the third quarter. We are also encouraged with the company gaining a number of approvals for its products, both in the domestic and overseas markets.Among the recent developments, worth mentioning is the company's recent acquisition of Apama Medical, the developer of the single-shot Apama Radiofrequency (RF) Balloon Catheter System for the treatment of atrial fibrillation.This apart, the company received an FDA approval forMRI labeling and announced the U.S. launch of the Resonate family of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) systems.

Adjusted earnings also surpassed the year-ago number by 14.4%.Including one-time items, the company reported EPS of $1.11, compared with 87 cents a year ago.RevenuesIn the reported quarter, Illumina's revenues grew 17.6% year over year to $714 million. Moreover, the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.9%. Illumina, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Illumina, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Illumina, Inc. Quote Per management, top-line growth in the third quarter can be attributed to strong uptake of sequencing consumables and instruments as well as microarray portfolios. Moreover, the NovaSeq platform continued to drive growth with close to 200 NovaSeq systems currently at customers’ hands since the launch in January 2017. Management is also hopeful that recent launches like S4 flow cell, Xp workflow and Nextera DNA Flex library preparation kit will drive NovaSeq demand.Product revenues (83.5% of total revenue) increased 15.9% year over year to $596 million. Service and Other (15.5%) revenues were up 26.9% year over year to $118 million.Operational UpdateIllumina's adjusted gross margin came in at 67.5%, reflecting a contraction of 267 basis points (bps) year over year owing to NovaSeq introduction, higher array services revenues and product mix within sequencing consumables. Excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets and including stock-based compensation expenses, adjusted gross margin was 68.8%, highlighting a contraction of 320 bps from a year ago.Research and development expenses were up 20.1% year over year to $134 million and selling, general & administrative expenses rose 6.3% to $167 million. Consequently, the adjusted operating margin of 25.4% reflected a decline of 117 bps from the year-ago period.Financial UpdateIllumina exited the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $2.04 billion, up from $1.89 billion in the third quarter. Year-to-date net cash provided by operating activities was $581 million, compared with $517 million in the year-ago period.2017 GuidanceBanking on the solid third-quarter performance, Illumina has raised its full-year 2017 revenue growth expectations to 13% from the earlier provided range of 12%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year 2017 revenues is pegged at $2.69 billion.The company raised its adjusted EPS to the band of $3.73-$3.78 from the earlier $3.60–$3.70. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Illumina’s 2017 bottom line stands at $3.64, far below the low end of the guided range. Our TakeIllumina exited the third quarter on a solid note. We are also encouraged by the year-over-year increase in both the fronts. The company has also raised its full-year 2017 revenue guidance and the adjusted EPS range. We are looking forward to the performance of NovaSeq S4 flow cell, reagent kit and NovaSeq Xp workflow for its NovaSeq 6000 System.On the flip side, weak margins owing to the lower instrument margin associated with NovaSeq launch and higher array services mix will continue to act as deterrents. Also, a tough competitive landscape is a concern.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCurrently, Illumina has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express, Inc. (PETS  -  Free Report), Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) and Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (ISRG  -  Free Report).

1200,ISRG,"In the Global Week Ahead, pay attention to three U.S. catalysts.Will summer traders regard these three events as the Three Musketeers, charging up the hill, adding confidence? Or will they amount to the Three Stooges -- and give up a stumble or two -- and thus create a more ragged tone?When you are writing on stock markets just a couple miles from the old Columbia Pictures studio lot, where Larry, Moe & Curley got their first and biggest boost, you become a partisan. Only time will tell the tale well.First off, this will be the biggest earnings week of the Q2 season. There’s plenty of room for a lousy report. But there are so many, it may get washed out quickly.Second, on Wednesday, the latest FOMC statement hits the tape. Watch out for market-moving comments about recent weak inflation data.Third and finally, traders close out the week with a Friday 1st estimate of U.S. Q2 GDP growth. If Q2 doesn’t beat up on Q1, that would be considered a stumble.Here is your U.S. roadmap—Over the coming week, earnings will play the most significant role in both U.S. and global equity markets. 184 S&P500 firms release Q2 earnings. This will be the single heaviest reporting week of the season.Key names: Alphabet (formerly Google), Newmont Mining, McDonald’s, 3M, Eli Lilly, Caterpillar, GM, AT&T, Coca-Cola, Ford, State Street, Boeing, Facebook, Procter & Gamble, UPS, Mastercard, Intel, Amazon, Starbucks, Mattel, Merck, Xerox and American Airlines.  On Wednesday, consensus expects the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) not to change its Fed Funds target range. It rests at 1.25%.July is a statement-only event. But will the press release show FOMC members have big concerns over recent soft inflation figures? Or will the majority reinforce a belief that it is transitory?Out on Friday, the week saves the best (or worst…) for last. The first estimate of U.S. GDP growth in Q2 arrives at 8:30am ET.The U.S. recorded just +1.4% y/y growth in Q1. Bloomberg’s consensus expects +2.6% in Q2.We can consult the Fed ‘nowcast’ forecasting business, though it is getting a bit crowded these days. The St. Louis Fed has +2.5%, which matches the Atlanta Fed’s latest estimate at +2.5%. Both estimates are a notch above the NY Fed’s at +1.9%.Outside the U.S., pay attention to Brazil--Out on Wednesday, consensus is firm. Banco Central do Brasil will cut its SELIC policy rate by 100 basis points (bps) agajn. It would follow on a 100 bps cut on May 31st.If that Brazilian cut happens, it would bring cumulative easing since last October to five full percentage points, from a cycle peak of 14.25% to 9.25%.Top Zacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY) Stocks—Facebook (FB  -  Free Report): This is now an incredible $476 billion in market cap stock.

The Zacks long-term VGM score is a mediocre C.

1202,ISRG,"Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results after the closing bell on Jul 20. Last quarter, the company’s earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 17.63%. Also, the company delivered an average beat of 14.44% in the trailing four quarters.Let’s see how things are shaping up for Intuitive Surgical prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayWe believe that the growing adoption of Intuitive Surgical’s da Vinci system among physicians for general surgery, oncology, urology and gynecology procedures is a key catalyst. Earlier, da Vinci procedures increased approximately 18% year over year in the first quarter of 2017. For the second quarter, the company expects procedure growth rate to slow down a bit outside the U.S. The company anticipates full-year 2017 procedure growth within 12% to 14%. Full-year 2017 gross profit margin is expected in the upper end of the range of 69% to 71% of net revenue.Moreover, rising procedural volumes outside the U.S., particularly in Europe, fortifies the company’s market position. In fact, the integrated Table Motion product line has gained significant traction within a short span of time and is likely to boost the company’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter. Meanwhile, increased spending on product development and higher investments in expanding the company’s footprint in international markets are prudent moves to drive long-term growth in our view.We note that Intuitive Surgical outperformed the Zacks Medical Instruments sub-industry in the last one year. While the stock has returned 41.11%, the sub-industry has gained only 10.08%.Intuitive Surgical, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Intuitive Surgical’s Earnings ESP is 0.00% since both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at $4.86. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Intuitive Surgical has a Zacks Rank #3. Though a favorable Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Also, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few companies you may want to consider as our proven model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:  Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

1203,ISRG,"On Aug 29, we issued an updated research report on Sunnyvale-based Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG  -  Free Report) – manufacturer of the da Vinci surgical system (an advanced robot-assisted surgical system) and related instruments and accessories. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Among major positives, Intuitive Surgical has had an impressive run in the bourse of late. A glimpse at the recent price performance reveals a favorable return of 43.9% over the past year, comparing favorably with the industry’s increase of 4.1%. The company has a solid track characterized by consecutive earnings beat in the trailing four quarters.In recent times, Intuitive Surgical reported stellar performance mainly due to the growing adoption of the da Vinci system among physicians and overall growth in global procedures. The da Vinci surgical system enables minimally invasive surgery that helps avoid the trauma associated with open surgery. Performance was also aided by growing volumes, courtesy to general surgery, oncology, urology and gynecology procedures.Intuitive Surgical continuously introduces technologies for surgical systems. The company also plans to launch an upgrade – da Vinci X – to its flagship Vinci Xi technology. In this regard, management confirmed the submission of documents for CE Mark approval of Vinci X. Furthermore, the company expects availability of this device in Europe by the end of 2017. In the long haul, extensive expenditure on product pipeline and expansion in international markets like Europe should drive growth for the company.On the flipside, the company expects procedure growth rate to slow down a bit outside the United States in the coming quarters. The long sale and purchase order cycle of the da Vinci system has added to the woes. Also, expenses on research and development (R&D) increased significantly in the first half of 2017, reflecting high spending on advanced imaging, advanced instrumentation and next-generation robotics.Key PicksA few better-ranked medical stocks are IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report), Lantheus Holdings, Inc. (LNTH  -  Free Report) and Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report).
