2,DG,"For the first time since Wall Street began to focus on the GOP's border-tax plan, retailers joined the rest of the stock market in a broad rally on Thursday, lifting the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite to record highs.After a strong day for retail on Wednesday, Dow component Wal-Mart (WMT) shares rose another 1.9% to 69.08 on Thursday, the highest close in more than a month. Dollar Tree (DLTR) surged 3.6%, Gap (GPS) added 2.8%, and Costco (COST) rose 2.6% to an all-time closing high. Dollar General (DG) raced ahead 3.5% to its highest close since Nov. 30 as its former CEO, Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., made waves with his forceful opposition to the border-tax plan. (Wal-Mart retreated 1.5% on Friday as retailers were mixed overall).Meanwhile, fell Dow component Nike (NKE) shares sprinted 2.7% Thursday, retaking its 200-day moving average for the first time since August. Nike added 1.7% on the stock market today to a fresh four-month high. As ex-CEO at Nike rival Reebok, Perdue also must be looking at the border-tax debate from the view of the footwear industry that does most of its manufacturing overseas.Yet even as hopes dimmed for the GOP House plan that would cut the corporate tax rate to 20%, funded by a 20% tax on imports, the broad market charged higher on the back of President Trump's comments to airline executives that he'll be announcing a ""phenomenal"" tax plan in the next two or three weeks.Goldman Sachs (GS) helped the Dow claim new heights, rising 1.6% Thursday and 0.5% Friday. Tesla (TSLA) cruised ahead 2.7% Thursday, as it breaks out of a long base, holding its gains Friday.Steel stocks were especially strong Thursday, with U.S. Steel (X) up 8.3%, Steel Dynamics (STLD) 5.7% and Nucor (NUE) 4.6%. All three stocks rose fractionally Friday.Yet assuming Perdue stands firm, the GOP can only afford to lose one more senator to keep the border tax alive. And Perdue didn't appear to leave much wiggle room to reverse his opinion: ""The clear effect of the proposed border adjust tax is an increase in consumer prices,"" he wrote in a letter to colleagues. ""This would hammer consumer confidence and lower overall demand, thus putting downward pressure on jobs.""IBD'S TAKE: Supporters of the border tax plan say that the dollar would rise by 20% vs. other currencies, meaning that it wouldn't harm either corporate profits or consumers. But it does pose a risk to U.S. investors holding shares of companies like Alibaba or international ETFs.The retail stock revival and record high for the major averages raise this question: If the border tax isn't going anywhere, what does Trump have up his sleeve? If the border tax dies, Wall Street analysts have largely concluded that corporate tax cuts would have to be scaled back in a big way to make it through reconciliation, a legislative maneuver that means the GOP can pass tax cuts with only a majority vote if the package is revenue neutral in year 11 and beyond.Without a border tax, some think the effort to cut corporate taxes could collapse. At best, the corporate tax rate might be cut to 25%, but even that might be out of reach.Yet a closer look suggests that investors didn't really get carried away with Trump's mystery tax plan. Even though advancing stocks led declines by roughly 2-to-1 on the New York Stock Exchange, Raymond James strategist Jeffrey Saut noted that the percentage of volume going into advance stocks ""was among the lowest in history"" on days when the S&P 500 has hit a 52-week high and closed positive on the day.RELATED:If Border Tax Dies, Trump Corporate Tax Cut May CollapseWhy Tax Reform Could End In Tears For Trump And GOP

3,DG,"The stock market closed higher Thursday, with the three major indexes hitting new highs.The Nasdaq and S&P 500 each climbed 0.6%. The Dow Jones industrial average also rose 0.6% as it added a bit of air above the 20,000 milestone. Small caps, which had been languishing, outperformed: The Russell 2000 added 1.4% and moved back above its 50-day moving average.Volume was lower, according to unconfirmed data. Winners led losers by almost 2-to-1 on the NYSE and by about 8-to-5 on the Nasdaq.Consumer and technology stocks led the market. Apparel makers rose nearly 4% as Nike (NKE), a Dow component, surged back above the 200-day moving average for the first time since August. Shares rose 2.6%.Medical and enterprise software were part of the tech groups in the top 10. Others were technology services and hardware manufacturers.But some defensive groups also led, including dairy products, meat products and discount stores. Stocks in the discount retail group are rebounding, and Big Lots (BIG) climbed above its 50-day moving average. Earlier this week, Dollar General (DG) announced it will open 1,000 stores and two distribution centers.Steel was the day's top-performing industry group. President Trump's remarks that a tax plan will be announced soon seemed to ignite buying in steel shares. Steel makers are among the industries most likely to benefit from trade, tax and fiscal plans by the White House.After the close, Ubiquity Networks (UBNT) fell sharply after the company announced quarterly results. Adjusted earnings of 72 cents a share missed the consensus estimate of 77 cents.In a day that saw plenty of breakouts, the strongest were Roper Technologies (ROP) and Louisiana Pacific (LPX).Roper, an industrial equipment maker, beat expectations as it reported adjusted earnings of $1.86 a share.  Sales of $1.01 billion were basically in line with estimates. The stock closed in buy range from a 196.03 buy point in a long, undefined pattern.Louisiana Pacific roared 10% and is extended from a 21.26 buy point in a cup without handle. The building products company said it earned adjusted profit of 23 cents a share, above expectations. Sales climbed 19% to $550 million. The stock had the highest relative volume in today's trading.But GrubHub (GRUB) continued to sink, falling 4% more and closing below its 50-day line. The meal-delivery company slid 3.5% Wednesday after its fourth-quarter earnings missed expectations.RELATED:U.S. Steel Leads Sector Advance As Trump Vows 'Phenomenal' Tax News Airlines Rise After Trump Vows Regulatory Cuts; Tax Plan To Come
"
4,DG,"The fight over the border tax has been focused entirely on the impact a 20% tax would have on big importers. Supporters insist that retailers like Wal-Mart (WMT) and Best Buy (BBY) wouldn't really be hurt, because currencies would adjust to neutralize the tax.Yet, while the predicted 25% rise in the dollar isn't certain — it could rise by somewhat less or even more — it's curious that there's been almost no attention paid to the potential impact on the one industry that's likely to bear the brunt of a currency adjustment: U.S. tourism.Tourism Economics estimates that each 10% rise in the dollar causes a 2% decrease in international visitors. On top of that, visitors may shorten their average stay and otherwise limit their spending.International travelers could find that visiting a Disney (DIS) theme park, gambling at an MGM Resorts (MGM) casino, staying at a Marriott (MAR) hotel or shopping at Tiffany (TIF) would be much more expensive.Staying at a Trump International Hotel would be more expensive too, which might influence President Trump's view that the dollar is already ""too strong"" and is ""killing us."" Just how much more expensive would depend on the extent to which reduced travel leads tourism-related industries to lower prices.Another hit would come from increased overseas travel by Americans, who would find that their dollars go much further in London, Paris, Rome and other destination spots around the world and opt against a U.S. vacation.International carriers like United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) may not suffer as much, since more outbound American travelers could ease the pain of fewer U.S.-bound tourists. Similarly, global hotel chains like Marriott may also see additional bookings by Americans abroad. But more domestic-focused businesses won't have such offsets.A major, unilateral increase in the U.S. currency could come at a pretty significant price. International travel added $247 billion to the U.S. economy last year and generated an $88 billion surplus, relative to what Americans spent abroad, according to the U.S. Travel Association's analysis of Commerce Department data. That's down from a $98 billion travel surplus in 2015. It's not clear how much of the narrower surplus was related to a stronger dollar, but there is generally a lag before shifts in currencies affect travel, given advance bookings.The figures include educational tourism — foreign students attending U.S. colleges and universities and generally paying much more than local residents to do so. With a 25% rise in the dollar, the U.S. might not look like quite as an attractive place to study. In 2015, education-related tourism totaled $35.8 billion.""Regular exporters would, under border adjustment, receive a subsidy that would offset the exchange rate impact; but hotel owners presumably wouldn't,"" wrote American Enterprise Institute resident scholar Stan Veuger. ""Or would U.S. taxpayers start subsidizing the vacations of Chinese tourists?""That seems as unlikely as federal government subsidies to let foreign students attend the University of California at Berkeley, he adds.While the impact on tourism has been almost entirely absent from the debate, it could play a bigger role as GOP senators decide whether they can back the House plan. Georgia Sen. David Perdue, former CEO of Dollar General (DG), has already signaled his fierce opposition, meaning just two more GOP defections could kill it.Expect Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who both represent top-five states for foreign travel, to come under heavy lobbying pressure from the tourism industry. Border states Texas and Arizona also are big tourism destinations, with Mexican travelers spending $19.7 billion in the U.S. in 2015.IBD'S TAKE: If the dollar appreciates 20% to 25% against foreign currencies, U.S. investors holding ADRs of foreign equities like Alibaba or international ETFs would take a hit.The projected rise in the dollar would come from already lofty levels. The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of advanced-economy currencies, surged 26% from July 2014 to March 2015, hitting the highest level since 2003.On earnings calls in the fall of 2015, Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide noted ""lower volumes of inbound international travelers due to the strong dollar,"" while Tiffany said it ""continued to experience a negative effect on foreign tourists spending in the U.S.""While the dollar eased off of those levels for most of 2016, it has strengthened again on expectations for a stronger U.S. economy under Trump.AEI's Veuger also points out that real estate is another ""quasi-exporting"" industry that might feel an impact from the border tax, since foreigners purchase some $100 billion worth of residential properties in a year, about half paid for in cash.RELATED:If Border Tax Dies, Trump Corporate Tax Cut May CollapseTreasury Might Write Checks To Boeing Under GOP Tax Reform

6,DG,"The stock market took off thanks to President-elect Donald Trump's agenda of corporate tax cuts, infrastructure spending and deregulation, but the latest headlines signal a likelihood of turbulence ahead as investors examine what JPMorgan analysts call ""radical changes.""CNN on late Wednesday reported that top players in the incoming administration have been kicking around the idea of imposing an across-the-board 5% tariff on imports. Alternatively, team Trump has been weighing support for a House Republican corporate tax change that would indirectly apply a 20% tax on imports, even though it might not pass muster with the World Trade Organization.Trump aides Thursday responded to the CNN report, stressing that no decisions have been made.""The CNN story got a little bit too far out over its skis,"" Trump transition spokesman Jason Miller told reporters. ""The incoming administration is obviously discussing numerous trade deals and tax reform packages with members of our own team as well as members of Congress. But it's too early to go into specific speculation on issues of tariffs or border adjustability.""The report followed the announcement that economist Peter Navarro, who has defended Trump's campaign threat to slap a 45% punitive tariff on Chinese imports, will head a soon-to-be-established White House National Trade Council.On Thursday, shares of major retailers were taking it on the chin. Wal-Mart (WMT) was off 2.3% on the stock market today. Macy's (M) slid 3.6%, Target (TGT) 4.4%, Gap (GPS) 5.4% and Dollar Tree (DLTR) 5.65%. E-commerce giant Amazon.com (AMZN) fell 0.55%. (Retailers also fell on reports of weak holiday sales and traffic).One of the big questions since the election is how Trump will merge his populist campaign themes with a traditional Republican agenda of tax cuts and deregulation. A boost to infrastructure spending and use of the bully pulpit to keep companies like Ford (F) and Carrier, a unit of United Technologies (UTX), from shutting down U.S. production are two clear ways that Trump aims to stay faithful to his working-class supporters who put him over the top in the Rust Belt. Demanding that Mexico and Canada open up North American Free Trade Agreement for renegotiation is another likely tack. Yet the latest reports offer the clearest indication that Trump may go further than investors have been expecting.It's easy to see why investors are excited about the prospect of a big corporate tax cut. Trump's campaign plan to cut the corporate rate to 15% from the 35% statutory rate could boost S&P 500 earnings by $180 billion, or 16%, figures Jonathan Glionna, head of U.S. equity strategy research at Barclays.IBD'S TAKE: Stocks that stand to benefit from both corporate tax cuts and an infrastructure boost have been among the big winners of the Trump rally. Two of those stocks, Freeport McMoRan and Martin Marietta Materials, are near a buy point. Check out Leaderboard, where IBD's market writers help you find buying opportunities in these and other stocks as they emerge, as well as sell signals to lock in profits.But some companies and sectors could stand to benefit much more than others. Domestic-focused industries like retail and homebuilders, many of which derive 100% of income from the U.S., could see an earnings boost of 30% or more, Glionna wrote, and could get a further boost from a consumer tax cut. Dollar General (DG), for example, could see its 37% effective tax rate (including state taxes) fall to 17% under the Trump plan.Among industry groups, only telecom would get a bigger lift than retail, with AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ) seeing a 29% boost in earnings.Yet, retailers could, all of a sudden, become big losers if Trump adopts the House Republican plan. While cutting the statutory corporate tax rate to 20% from 35%, the House plan would no longer allow businesses to deduct the cost of imports from taxes. That means retailers such as Dollar General, Wal-Mart, Amazon, Costco (COST) and Starbucks (SBUX) would have to pay a tax equal to 20% of the cost of the clothing, televisions, toys and coffee they import.Because retail profit margins are generally in the low single digits, one concern is that retailers that sell a lot of imported goods might have to pass much of those taxes on to customers to maintain their profitability.""Clearly a 20% tax on the wide range of consumer goods that are imported into the United States would put increased economic pressure on families who can least afford it,"" the National Retail Federation said after the House unveiled its ""Better Way"" tax plan in June.Actually, the economic impact of the House plan is far from clear. While imports could be 20% more expensive and exports 12% cheaper, the dollar could appreciate by 15% or more, largely offsetting the tax changes, Deutsche Bank wrote in an analysis this week.Trump and the GOP could be in for a big battle if they build corporate tax reform around this border-adjustment plan. Yet, reform may not be much easier if they choose another path. The conservative Tax Foundation estimates that this border adjustment of corporate taxes would raise $1.1 trillion over 10 years, a huge sum that helps offset the cost of lowering the corporate tax rate to 20% in the House plan. Unless the GOP can get eight Senate Democrats on board, which is doubtful, a tax package passed via reconciliation will have to be deficit-neutral beyond 10 years, so offsets are needed to make the U.S. tax code more competitive.On top of that, there are real worries that other countries will punish American companies if the Trump administration applies tariffs or Congress adopts what looks like a border tax.It's probably safe to say that the stock market rally has downplayed some of these nagging problems in implementing the Trump agenda and that the ride may get bumpy because the range of possible outcomes is wide.As JPMorgan analysts wrote this week, ""While a lot of the early corporate tax reform enthusiasm was predicated on a cursory examination of the headline rate cuts, markets are now examining the radical changes being proposed to the intricacies of the code. (Last) Thursday and Friday saw notable weakness in apparel/retail-linked stocks and a big factor behind the selling was concern around the border adjustment concept that sits at the heart of the GOP corporate tax reform plan.""RELATED:Here's How Much Trump Tax Cuts Could Boost The Stock Market Tax Reform May Pit GOP Vs.

10,DG,"A federal judge's order on Tuesday blocking the Obama administration's overtime time rule from taking effect next week was the second big surprise most companies hadn't been counting on — the first being the election of Donald Trump.Some companies, including Wal-Mart (WMT), have already given managers a raise to comply with the law. Others, like Carrols Restaurant Group (TAST), the biggest franchisee of the Restaurant Brands International (QSR) Burger King chain, had said they were shifting managers into hourly workers to avoid any increase in pay.Even on Tuesday, about an hour before the injunction was announced, Dollar Tree (DLTR) told analysts it would see extra labor costs of 3-4 cents per share in the fourth quarter due to the overtime rule taking effect on Dec. 1.The Obama administration rule was set to lift the minimum salary exempting employers from paying time and a half for overtime to $47,476 from $23,660.""We have been preparing for and testing changes to our compensation structure in regard to the new (Fair Labor Standards Act) regulations,"" Bob Sasser, CEO of Dollar Tree, told analysts, according to a SeekingAlpha transcript. ""We have communicated these changes to our teams to ensure our company's compliance when the new rule will become effective on December 1.""The good news for employees is that pay hikes that already have been granted and accounted for are more likely than not going to stick to avoid a hit to morale. Managers who were effectively demoted to clock puncher, though, may remain on salary.Because Trump's election put the eventual fate of the overtime rule in doubt, companies that were struggling with the change likely delayed taking actions that were either negative for the bottom line or employee retention. Some companies may have planned to give managers a raise but not yet told them.While it's unclear whether the injunction could survive an appeal, the cloud over the controversial overtime rule will make it that much easier for the incoming Trump administration to walk away from the rule, or to dilute it.IBD'S TAKE: The likely weakening or retraction of the Obama administration's overtime rule is just one of the reasons why Donald Trump's victory was absolutely huge for McDonald's.Wal-Mart boosted minimum salaries for assistant store managers to $48,500 from $45,000, effective in September, to avoid being liable for overtime pay.President Obama initially touted the rule change as a way to keep employers from mistreating salaried workers by giving them what amounts to a paltry wage, sometimes equivalent to the minimum or less when all the extra hours worked were factored in. Yet the likeliest beneficiaries of the change are those who were already making above $40,000, so boosting their pay wouldn't hit bottom lines too hard.Here's what some other companies have said:Panera Bread (PNRA), on its Oct. 26 earnings call, said it was holding off giving earnings per share guidance for 2017, in part because of the ""final timing of FLSA"" changes, implying that election outcomes or an effort to delay the change in Congress could alter the Dec. 1 date.Planet Fitness (PLNT): ""With some of the law changes on the FLSA that kick in ... our manager salaries will go up a bit starting in Q4.""Dollar General (DG): ""We anticipate the incremental expense will be about $0.03 to $0.04 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of this year.""

The relative strength line measures price performance vs. the S&P 500. And if the line is trending higher, that's bullish.As the IBD Stock Of The Day looks to clear the buy point, the RS line at a new high would be a positive indicator.The discounter's fundamentals are improving. Dollar General earnings per share soared 32% in the first quarter, the best in years. That's after fiscal Q4 EPS fell 1%. Analysts expect bottom-line growth to accelerate to 35% in fiscal Q2.Meanwhile, revenue growth picked up from 2% in Q4 to 9% in Q1.

In addition, its EPS Rating of 97 is excellent, putting it in the top 3% of stocks tracked by this metric. The stock is ranked second in the Retail-Discount & Variety industry group, after Ollie's.But it would be wise to remember a common pitfall for new and experienced investors alike: buying a stock just ahead of its earnings report because it's ""acting right.""

The IBD 50 stock went on a massive run from a low of 1.34 in February 2016 to a high of 27.35 in October 2017. After a sharp decline following that move, Kemet has rebounded and now sports an A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 2.0 up/down volume ratio.

Salesforce.com (CRM) and other software stocks have been winners. Payment stocks are a pocket of strength. Many retail names, from Lululemon (LULU) to TJX (TJX) have been strong. Energy stocks from Chevron (CVX) to Marathon Oil (MRO) are doing well, but are subject to the ups and downs of crude oil prices. Biotechs are trying to make a recovery, with Biogen (BIIB) skyrocketing Friday on positive Alzheimer's drug news.Meanwhile, chips are still well off their highs, a bad sign for any stock market rally. Financials are near 2018 lows, with JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) kicking off earnings season Friday.Dow futures rose 0.5% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.5%.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng advanced 1.3%. and Japan's Nikkei 1.2%. European markets showed modest gains intraday.During last week's holiday-shortened week, the stock market averages were volatile but ultimately rallied. The Nasdaq composite rallied 2.4%, the S&P 500 1.5% and the Dow Jones 0.8%. Friday's post-jobs, post-China tariffs rally was particularly significant. If you haven't already, you should read the latest Big Picture column.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe stock market came under pressure amid Trump trade war tariffs and threats over the past several weeks. President Donald Trump on Friday imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods, quickly matched by Beijing. Trump also threatened tariffs on virtually all Chinese imports. But for now, Wall Street has decided the Trump trade impact has been priced into stocks.If you look at the Nasdaq composite over the last several months, the tech-heavy index looks like it broke out on June 1, rallied for a few weeks, then erased those gains before rebounding again last week from its 50-day moving average.The S&P 500 index and Dow Jones have been consolidating since late January, with the S&P 500 in somewhat better shape.Stocks, even top stocks, tend to track the broader stock market. But sector rotations into and out of China internets, software stocks and energy names have left many individual stock charts looking more volatile.Amazon stock and especially Netflix stock have been two of the biggest stock market winners in 2018. Facebook stock, after a scandalous spring, is at record highs, slightly extended from a buy point. Apple stock is in buy range from 179.04 double-bottom entry. The Dow Jones component has pulled back to its 50-day line and could be working on a new consolidation. Alphabet (GOOGL) is below a buy point after a low-volume breakout last month and hitting resistance at its old high.Software accounts for four of the top 10 groups in the 197 industries that IBD tracks. Two more are in the top 20.Buying and holding individual software stocks has been a challenge. Salesforce, the top stock in the No. 3-ranked enterprise software group, staged a low-volume breakout in early May, then promptly undercut the buy point. It didn't trigger a 7%-8% loss that would trigger an automatic sell. By the end of May, following quarterly earnings, Salesforce stock was back in buy range and is now modestly extended.Meanwhile, some stocks did trigger the 7%-8% loss sell rule, like Workday (WDAY) and Red Hat (RHT), while others round-tripped double-digit gains, such as Qualys (QLYS).Software Stocks To Watch: Okta (OKTA), an April 2017 cybersecurity IPO, is finding support at its 50-day moving average for the first time since a late April breakout. A solid gain in heavy volume could offer a buying opportunity. Alternatively, Okta could continue to consolidate for a few weeks, forming a new base and buy point.Collaboration software maker Atlassian (TEAM) broke out last October. Anyone holding Atlassian stock since then would be sitting pretty. Since then the stock has staged a few failed breakouts but still moved up, generally following its 50-day. Atlassian stock is once again finding 50-day support but needs at least another week to form a proper base.Lululemon Athletica and Canada Goose (GOOS) are among the trendy apparel retail stock that have boomed in 2018. Specialty discounters such as TJX are faring well too, with TJX rival Ross Stores (ROST) stock in buy range currently. Five Below (FIVE) and Dollar General (DG) are setting up near buy points.An improving jobs market and Trump tax cuts have fueled consumers' wallets and confidence. Most retailers also aren't that exposed to Trump trade wars with Europe, China and others.Energy stocks are tricky to play because they tend to rise and fall with crude prices. (Refiners tend to benefit from a wider ""crack spread"" between crude and gasoline prices.)EOG Resources (EOG), a recent IBD Stock of the Day, broke out in early May and ran up for a couple of weeks as crude futures rallied. But the EOG stock pulled back below the buy point and found support at the 50-day line in June as crude also backed off multiyear highs. EOG Resources, known as the ""Apple of Oil,"" is setting up in a new base with crude hitting its best levels since 2014.Marathon Oil, another IBD Stock of the Day, also broke out in early May and ran up. Marathon Oil stock also pulled back to its 50-day line, but never undercut the buy point. Shares are now in a flat base within a base-on-base formation.Biogen shot up nearly 20% to 357.48 on Friday, racing toward a 370.67 cup-base entry. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) also is closing in on a buy point. But both Biogen and Vertex Pharma have relative strength lines, while improving, that were in downtrends for several months. The relative strength line tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 indexNotable biotech ETFs, including iShares Nasdaq Biotech (IBB) and the triple-levered Direxion Daily S&P Biotech Bull (LABU) also are approaching possible buy points, but with RS lines that have made much headway over the past year.Payment stocks have been a pocket of strength. Mastercard (MA) and Dow Jones component Visa (V) have been consolidating near record highs for a few weeks, finding support around their 50-day or 10-week lines. Square (SQ) has also been acting well.

29,DG,"Whole Foods Market (WFM) shares have been in a downturn for nearly three years amid growing competition. But the pioneer in natural and organics groceries shot up 5% on the stock market today.First, Wal-Mart (WMT), which is the largest U.S. groceries seller, said Thursday morning that it would curb new-store growth as it invests in e-commerce. That's good news for a slew of retailers, from specialty discounters such as Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Dollar General (DG), as well as grocery chains such as Whole Foods and Kroger (KR).Grocery sellers have been struggling with falling food prices, in part due to renewed Wal-Mart price cuts. That's especially painful for Whole Foods, which has struggled to shake its ""whole paycheck"" reputation. Whole Foods recently opened up a lower-priced chain of stores called 365.Then speculation grew that Kroger, the largest pure-play grocer, was making or mulling a bid for Whole Foods Market.Chatter $40 cash/stock bid for $wfm from $kr.— Mike Bergen (@BergenCapital) October 6, 2016Kroger has stepped up its offerings of organic foods, grabbing market share in recent years. So it's unclear if Kroger would want to make such an acquisition.Kroger and Whole Foods didn't comment on the rumors.In any case, several grocery sellers — including dollar stores, fared well Thursday.Whole Foods Market rose 4.9% to 29.33, its best gain in four months, but found resistance at the 50-day line and still near the lowest levels since early 2011.Kroger stock rose 1.8%, but rebounded from its lowest close in nearly two years.Dollar Tree rose 4% while Dollar General climbed 3.1% -- also rebounding from recent lows. Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM), another natural foods grocer, rose 3.5%.As for Wal-Mart, its shares fell 3.2% to 69.36 as the retail giant gave earnings guidance that's below most analyst forecasts. The stock is at its lowest level in more than four months but did close above the 200-day support line.RELATED:Wal-Mart Earnings Forecast Trails Views On Investment SpendingGrocery Chains Reeling From Low Food Prices, Stiff CompetitionKroger Is Latest To Warn On Food Deflation, Doesn't Fear Wal-Mart

30,DG,"A future with slow-growing productivity — and by extension, slow-growing incomes — seems close to becoming conventional wisdom. But the strides that Wal-Mart (WMT) is making with technology that streamlines everything from tracking inventory to simplifying check-out suggest a brighter outlook.The retail giant was considered a prime force behind the last productivity boom (think bar codes, scanners and retailer-supplier data links) and the subsequent productivity bust (heavier reliance on temps and part-time workers come to mind).But facing competitive threats from Amazon (AMZN), Dollar Tree (DLTR), Dollar General (DG), Target (TGT) and Costco (COST), and the simultaneous challenge of substantially raising its own wage scale, Wal-Mart is re-engineering virtually every aspect of its business. New technologies and strategies have been tested, sending drones flying through warehouses, equipping shoppers with their own scanners and putting apps in the hands of efficiency-seeking store managers. Now sales are on the upswing, though profits have yet to follow, as the pace of change at Wal-Mart is accelerating.The payoff for investors won't be immediate. On Oct. 6, Wal-Mart cut its profit outlook again as it invests heavily to improve operations in stores and online. The stock has a lousy 19 Composite Rating out of 99, which means the stock only outperforms 19% of all other stocks based on earnings, share price performance and other key criteria. The Retail-Major Discount Chains group is No. 190 out of 197 industries that IBD tracks.IBD'S TAKE: Wal-Mart, like many retailers and companies in other modest-wage industries, have seen profit margins pressured amid intense competition and rising wage pressures. But some have thrived. On Thursday, Ulta Beauty predicted earnings growth above 20% through 2019. Read this Investor's Corner primer on profit margins.The good news for consumers is that the retail giant is sharing some of its efficiency gains via lower prices, which means you can expect its efficiency measures to spread to other companies. Amazon may be the most disruptive force in retail, but Wal-Mart's sheer scale still gives it an outsized influence on the economy. Kroger (KR), Target and the dollar stores are feeling heat from Wal-Mart price cuts, the companies have hinted at and analysts have signaled in recent weeks. Even fast-casual restaurants and quick-service chains like McDonald's (MCD) appear to be feeling pressure due to Wal-Mart's grocery price cuts along with its upward pressure on wages, with the cost of eating out rising at a record pace vs. eating in. When Wal-Mart makes up its mind to cut prices and do what it must to accomplish that, suppliers and competitors have little choice but to change the way they do business too.Here's a look at some technology programs underway at Wal-Mart and how they could change the productivity paradigm for retailers and the broader economy.IBD'S TAKE: Wal-Mart is the best stock in its sector, but its Retail-Major Discount Chains group is ranked 190 out of 197 by IBD based on stock performance and Wal-Mart shares aren't near a buy point. For a primer on how to find stocks to buy at the right time, visit IBD University.Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon said on the Aug. 16 earnings call that the company will roll out its new self-scan-and-pay technology at all Sam's Clubs this fall, letting members of the discount warehouses ""skip the checkout line.""Customers can use the ""Scan & Go"" app to ring up items as they put them in their shopping cart and see a running receipt total on their phones. The app also handles payment, so customers just show their receipts to greeters on the way out.The technology has been a long time in development. In 2014, the company pulled the plug on a year-old Scan & Go pilot program at 200 Wal-Marts using an app that was only compatible with Apple (AAPL) iPhones.But the company isn't reserving its latest innovations for Sam's Club customers. In June, Wal-Mart rolled out mobile payment technology at all of its 4,600 U.S. locations. It is testing out customer handheld scanning devices provided by the store in a number of Wal-Mart locations, but management has noted the logic of offering the same self-scan capability via smartphone that it's doing at Sam's Club.Scanning items as you put them in your cart relieves one of the frustrations of people who prefer the self-checkout lane. But like shoppers who check out with the help of a cashier, they still face another frustration: Finding bar codes slows everything down.Wal-Mart is experimenting with a technology called digital watermarking that, in the words of McMillon via Instagram in June 2015, ""could transform the way our customers check out.""Digimarc (DMRC), which subsequently confirmed that its bar code technology was the subject of McMillon's post, invisibly embeds bar code information repeatedly over retail packaging so there's no need to locate it or reorient the merchandise before scanning.Adoption of this next-generation bar code, if broad adoption is to occur, must proceed in steps. Bar code scanners must be designed to read the digital watermarking, and Zebra Technologies (ZBRA) and Datalogic are now equipping their scanners to do so.Regional grocer Wegmans has begun using digital watermarking on its private-label packaging in a logical first step before broader adoption by consumer packaging companies. Wegmans, which has 89 stores, expects $2 million in annual savings for every extra item scanned per minute vs. the usual 21, noted Cowen & Co. analyst Robert Stone in a recent research report.The next big breakthrough would be for major producers like Procter & Gamble (PG) to update their packaging. A push from Wal-Mart could certainly provide an impetus, but there's another important catalyst: By mid-2018, food labels of large manufacturers must meet new standards, making nutrition information easier to read, Stone notes.Eventually, Digimarc has said, shopping carts equipped with scanners could read its bar codes when customers put items in the cart.Wal-Mart said in June that it will start using drones to take inventory in its warehouses by late 2016 or early 2017, identifying when stocks are misplaced or running low. The drones will make a one-day job out of work that now takes employees a month to complete, while reducing the risk of accidents, Wal-Mart says.The drones are part of a larger push to manage inventories more efficiently. Wal-Mart, like other retailers including Home Depot (HD), Target and Kohl's (KSS), has been making a big push to keep inventories to a minimum and improve efficiency by rationalizing product selection (such as three sizes of salad dressing instead of six) and having more frequent supplier deliveries. Wal-Mart also is keeping more inventory in distribution centers to facilitate e-commerce shipping. One goal is simply limiting the number of times merchandise has to be moved by an employee from the time Wal-Mart receives a supplier shipment to final purchase.The latest U.S. economic data show that inventories at general merchandise stores fell 0.6% from a year earlier in July. In the short term, better inventory management may hold down economywide output and make productivity look awful, even if it's actually a partial result of retailers making efficiency gains. In the second quarter, leaner inventories subtracted 1.16 percentage points from GDP.Over time, though, inventory efficiencies reduce costs and permit lower prices and, possibly, better product selection. Wal-Mart's own inventories declined 2.9% from a year earlier in the second quarter, including a 6.5% drop in comparable-store inventories, management reported on its August earnings call. Meanwhile, in-stock levels continued to rise, meaning fewer frustrated customers.Now every member of Wal-Mart's in-store management team has a My Productivity smartphone app to request restocking of certain items and check sales trends while they roam the aisles and assist customers.""Prior to My Productivity, management associates were spending thousands of hours in the backrooms of our stores annually,"" wrote Mark Ibbotson, Wal-Mart executive vice president, in a June blog post introducing the new technology. ""That simply cannot be in today's world.""Wal-Mart's latest move to improve productivity, like many of its efficiency gains, involved using old technology in a new way. In early September, the company said it was cutting 7,000 cash accounting and invoicing jobs in its U.S. stores. Instead, the company will use cash recycler machines to count money and will handle invoicing at a central office.Wal-Mart also has been dreaming up new ideas for fixing the age-old problem of unused shopping carts left in the parking lot or cluttering the shopping aisles. This year, Wal-Mart filed a patent for a robot that collects unused shopping carts. A related idea would let customers hail a shopping cart via smartphone.While there's no telling how long it may take that burst of creativity to materialize in stores, the key point is that Wal-Mart is leaving no stone unturned or idea unconsidered to drive productivity and improve the customer experience. On Oct. 6, the company hosted a few dozen companies out of 250 original applicants in a ""Technology Innovation Open Call."" The winners got to pitch their technology solutions for retail, logistics, big data, security and social media.Wal-Mart's efficiency moves have swept through the economy before. An influential McKinsey & Co. study on productivity in the second half of the 1990s found that the retail sector accounted for nearly one-fourth of the U.S. rise, adding that ""more than half of the productivity acceleration in the retailing of general merchandise can be explained by only two syllables: Wal-Mart.""Big information technology breakthroughs, such as bar codes, wireless scanning guns and electronic data interchange with suppliers, came long before productivity took off. Wal-Mart's efficiency gains in that era were as much due to managerial efforts, McKinsey found. The key was that its tech and management changes were both geared toward achieving ""everyday low prices."" Wal-Mart reached a scale that compelled its business partners and rivals to follow suit or risk being left behind.U.S. output per work hour at general merchandise stores, excluding department stores, soared by nearly 150% from 1995 to 2007.But over the past eight years through the end of 2015, productivity in this sector has risen just 3%.What went wrong? A sluggish economic recovery, modest wage gains, and an overabundance of stores as Amazon gained market share. Wal-Mart, which opted to close 154 U.S. stores at the start of 2016, went through a six-quarter string of same-store sales declines through mid-2014 as its customer-satisfaction rankings tumbled.Retailers and other modest-wage employers such as fast-food chains took what might be viewed as profit shortcuts. Wal-Mart reportedly boosted its temp workforce and had understaffed stores. Other employers boosted their ranks of part-timers clocking fewer than 30 hours per week to dodge paying for health insurance or facing a fine under the ObamaCare employer mandate.Wal-Mart's penny pinching hurt sales and productivity, ultimately spurring lower profits and a change in strategy.As the economy nears full employment and employers recognize that cutting corners hasn't paid off, wage gains are picking up as companies try to raise their game. Wal-Mart has been at the forefront, raising its own base wage to $10 an hour, pushing other modest-wage employers to follow suit or suffer low morale and high turnover.Yet whatever productivity gains Wal-Mart is seeing from initiatives launched in the past year or two have yet to catch up to its extra spending on wages and on technology to improve customer satisfaction and narrow the gap with Amazon. While sales rose 3.1% from a year ago at Wal-Mart's U.S. stores in the second quarter, expenses rose 8.3% and operating income fell 6.2%.The company warned last week that it won't turn the corner on earnings growth until 2018, forecasting roughly flat per-share profits next year, prompting some analysts to reel in their price target for Wal-Mart shares. Wal-Mart also said it would scale back plans to grow its U.S. store base, adding just 55 stores in the next fiscal year, compared with 135 this year, while building more distribution centers for online orders.Ultimately, consumers will decide with their feet and their wallets how productive Wal-Mart investments turn out to be. On that score, Wal-Mart's 1.2% same-store increase in customer traffic last quarter looked like a good sign, even as fewer people were shopping at rivals Target and Dollar General.Wal-Mart CEO: Sam's Club Shoppers Can Skip Cashier Off The Charts: Fast Food Inflation Vs.

31,DG,"United Natural Foods (UNFI), a longtime grocery distributor to Whole Foods Market (WFM), easily topped fiscal fourth-quarter profit forecasts and gave bullish full-year sales guidance after the close Monday.Estimates: Earnings per share of 63 cents, down 12.5%, on revenue of $2.218 billion, up 7.6%.Results: EPS of 69 cents or 70 cents ex items on sales of $2.21 billion.Prior Quarter: Fiscal Q3 EPS fell 8%, the third straight quarterly decline. Sales rose 1%, the sixth straight quarter of decelerating growth.Outlook: Fiscal 2017 GAAP EPS of $2.53-$2.63 on sales of $9.43 billion-$9.6 billion. Analysts see EPS of $2.69 on sales of $9.39 billion.Stock: Shares were up 0.2% in late trading, down from an earlier 9% surge, after closing up 0.5% at 41.82 in the stock market today. The stock broke out of a cup-with-handle base in June following the organic grocery distributor's last quarterly report, but shares have trended downward since the middle of last month, below their 50-day line.Why It Matters:  United Natural Foods' results will come as the grocery sector deals with an oversupply in some types of food -- particularly meat, poultry and dairy -- that have dragged prices lower and forced grocery stores into more aggressive promotions that some have compared to the industrywide price wars that took place in 2009.SuperValu (SVU), a grocery-store operator and distributor, last week warned about lower food prices and said Wal-Mart (WMT), which is undertaking a big price-cutting campaign, has ""always been a tough competitor."" Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM), a natural-foods rival to Whole Foods, also slashed its full-year guidance.Cowen on Monday upgraded Wal-Mart's stock to outperform from market perform and raised its price target to 83 from 76.Some analysts also believe Wal-Mart's discounting has hurt dollar stores. In reporting their quarterly results last month, Dollar General (DG) last month cited retail ""food deflation"" as a problem, while Dollar Tree (DLTR) management spoke of a ""challenging retail sales environment.""And grocery-store operator Kroger (KR) last week attempted to downplay Wal-Mart's effect on sales, but it cut its full-year earnings-per-share forecast due to ""continued deflation."" Telsey Advisory Group on Monday cut its price target on Kroger to 40 to 46. Kroger shares fell more than 2% to 30.82, a fresh 52-week low.IBD'S TAKE: Cheaper groceries have also hurt the restaurant business, with more people opting to save money and eat in. However, Papa John's in recent days has flirted with a buy point. See why stocks like Papa John's and Domino's Pizza are rising above rival restaurants.Sprouts Farmers Market fell 1.2% and Whole Foods shed 0.7%, while Wal-Mart rose 2.3%.

32,DG,"Grocery retailer and distributor SuperValu (SVU) on Thursday became the latest industry player to warn about stiffer competition and lower food prices, slashing its full-year outlook amid what some analysts call signs of another grocery-store price war.The announcement comes a day after natural foods store Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) cut its full-year outlook for similar reasons. Dollar General (DG) also cited retail ""food deflation"" as a difficulty. Investors will be watching to see if grocery-store operator Kroger (KR) reports the same when it reports second-quarter earnings on Friday.""The current landscape is now beginning to look a lot like 2009, when meaningful deflation resulted in an industry price war and multiple quarters of declining earnings,"" Credit Suisse analyst Edward Kelly said in a research note dated Wednesday.He added that the fall in food prices could last a few quarters and make it even harder for Whole Foods Market (WFM) to spin itself as a more value-oriented grocery store.The slide in prices has occurred largely in beef, poultry and dairy, Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said.Beef prices, he said, have largely fallen due for cyclical reasons -- the general balancing of supply and demand. Last year's bird flu outbreak constrained supply of poultry, drove up egg prices and prompted more people to buy egg substitutes, he added. But when some kept using those substitutes after the bird flu passed rather than switching back to eggs, egg production got too high and prices fell. As the U.S. dollar strengthened against other currencies, demand for milk in Asia and Europe waned, leading to an oversupply, Yarbrough also said.Amid those trends, grocery stores have tried to cut prices to move items off shelves more quickly. Recent price cuts at Wal-Mart (WMT) have begotten price cuts at its rivals.""The deflation in certain proteins has been sustained in a way that I have not previously seen,"" CEO Mark Gross said at an investor conference.""It's interesting,"" he continued, ""the ability of U.S. producers to spring back from, let's say, supply constraints of last year, particularly, say, the Avian bird flu that affected chicken flocks -- the ability of producers to come back so fast and so strong that we would be experiencing substantial deflation in normal Grade A eggs is significant.""At the conference, SuperValu management shied away from calling the climate a price war but did say that Wal-Mart, whose price cuts have reportedly also hurt the dollar stores, has ""always been a tough competitor."" SuperValu also cited changes and cuts in food stamp benefit as affecting sales, as have others.In a statement, SuperValu said it expected full-year adjusted EBITDA — or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization — to be around 5% lower than last year. Earlier, the company had forecast for a 1.5% slip, according to the Wall Street Journal.Shares sank 9.5% in the stock market today following the news, puncturing their 50-day and 200-day lines after finding support at the latter level for a few weeks. The stock fell 3.9% on Wednesday, joining the Sprouts-led sell-off.SuperValu serves and operates conventional grocery stores and operates Save-A-Lot, a discount chain. The company said its retail division in its fiscal second quarter ""has been impacted to a greater than anticipated degree by competitive openings and a challenging sales and operating environment for its stores.""The Save-A-Lot segment in the second quarter had been hit by ""deeper levels of deflation as well as lower levels of SNAP (supplemental nutrition assistance program) benefits compared to the first quarter,"" SuperValu said, referring to a federal program that helps people in low-income brackets buy food.IBD'S TAKE: Cheaper groceries have also hurt the restaurant business, with more people opting to save money and eat in. However, Papa John's is nearing a buy point. See why stocks like Papa John's and Domino's Pizza are rising above rival restaurants. Sprouts Farmers Market stock fell 1.3% after crashing nearly 14% on Wednesday. Kroger (KR) closed down 1 cent at 31.31, but that followed a 4% loss on Wednesday. and Whole Foods Market rose 0.6%, but after tumbling 5% on Wednesday.Wal-Mart fell 0.3%, still stuck below its 50-day line.Natural foods distributor United Natural Foods (UNFI) sank 3.7% after losing 4.3% on Wednesday.Cheaper prices at grocery stores can't be good news for restaurants either. Fast food prices have risen much faster than the cost of eating at home. Eateries may need to rein in menu prices to sustain customer traffic, but that could squeeze profit margins with labor costs rising from tighter job markets and higher minimum wages.Kelly, in the research note, said it was ""too early to call the bottom"" of the current price drop. And predictions across the industry vary.""I don't think any of these grocery stores or any of these guys have any better idea than we do,"" Yarbrough said. ""I think they're just speculating, and I think of it may be wishful thinking.""RELATED:Tractor Supply Crashes, But Sell Signals Were Already ClearFast Food Prices Have Never Risen So Fast Vs.

33,DG,"Dow futures rose modestly Tuesday morning, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. The Dow Jones led another solid stock market advance Monday, with the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite also strong following Friday's big rally. But quality breakouts were scarce. Monday's big winners tended to be recent laggards, including Dow Jones components Caterpillar (CAT), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) as well as recent China livestreaming IPOs Huya (HUYA) and iQiyi (IQ).The lack of breakouts is somewhat surprising. Friday's post-jobs-report, post-China-tariffs surge triggered a shift in IBD's market direction back to confirmed uptrend. Given that stocks, even leading stocks, tend to follow the major averages, you'd expect to see some new breakouts.

43,DG,"Italy's political chaos and President Donald Trump's tariffs weighed on the Dow Jones, but the Nasdaq moved to multi-month highs, as stocks rallied Friday on a strong but Fed-friendly jobs report.

44,DG,"Kroger (KR) on Friday said the slide in food prices that has hurt rivals could last into early next year, but the largest pure-play grocery store operator downplayed the impact of discounts from competitors like Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) and emphasized that they've weathered such price slumps in the past.Wal-Mart has embarked on a price-slashing campaign that, combined with a general oversupply in some items on grocery-store shelves, has created what some analysts said could become the next big grocery-store price war.But Kroger appeared to characterize those challenges as difficult but not unique.""To say that there's something drastically different, I wouldn't define it as that,"" CEO Rodney McMullen said on the company's second-quarter earnings call.Still, Kroger cut its full-year earnings-per-share outlook to $2.03-$2.13, or $2.10-$2.20 excluding new pension obligations, citing ""continued deflation."" The forecast was below Wall Street's expectations for $2.21.And management said they've seen a ""gradual tightening of budgets"" among consumers and that customers have told the company they expect the economy to get worse over the next three months.Those remarks came as some observers see similarities to the drop in food prices in 2009, when the U.S. was still shedding jobs and feeling the aftereffects of a housing bust. Kroger noted that the economy then was more difficult than the one the nation has today, and the company stuck with its long-term EPS growth rate of 8%-11%.""We've been through periods like this before,"" CFO Mike Schlotman said on the company's earnings call.In the aftermath of the recession, however, Kroger's stock was a laggard, essentially moving sideways from February 2009 to September 2012 while the overall market shot up during that period.This time around, the oversupply and resulting drop in beef, poultry and dairy prices has been driven by several factors. Among them: the natural supply cycle in beef; a massive rebound in poultry and egg production following last year's Avian flu that has overshot demand; the stronger dollar and general weaker demand for dairy in Asia. Grocery stores have cut prices to rid themselves of items more quickly, spurring cuts from rivals.Kroger, which operates chains like Ralphs and Food 4 Less, earned 47 cents a share for its fiscal second quarter, up 7%, topping estimates for 45 cents. Revenue rose 4% to $26.6 billion, just below Wall Street forecasts for $26.7 billion. Same-store sales excluding fuel rose 1.7%.The company also cut its expected capital investments, excluding mergers and other costs, to $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion for the year, down from an earlier outlook for $4.1 billion to $4.4 billion. That cut would likely ""be viewed positively,"" BMO Capital Markets said in a research note.Shares closed up 0.6% at 31.51 in the stock market today, amid the worst market sell-off since the Brexit vote. The stock has trended lower and was close to slicing through the floor of a consolidation pattern begun in March.Shares had already fallen to a 52-week low as of Thursday on bad news from SuperValu (SVU) and Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM). Sprouts, SuperValu and Whole Foods Market (WFM) extended weekly losses Friday morning.On Thursday, SuperValu slashed its full-year outlook, citing stiffer competition and lower food prices. On Wednesday, Sprouts Farmers Market cut its guidance for similar reasons. Dollar General (DG) has made similar comments about food prices.IBD'S TAKE: Cheaper groceries have also hurt the restaurant business, with more people opting to save money and eat in. However, Papa John's is nearing a buy point. See why stocks like Papa John's and Domino's Pizza are rising above rival restaurants. Kroger sees same-store sales growth for the rest of the year at 0.5%-1.5%, or 1.4%-1.8% for the full year. The company sees tough same-store-sales comparisons for the third quarter, but added that it was too early to get a better read on the trends.""While expectations were increasingly lower into the quarter in recent weeks as other food retailers have more drastically cut guidance on the heels of accelerating deflation, we think these results may not be as bad as feared,"" BMO analyst Kelly Bania wrote in the firm's research note.""However,"" she added, ""given our expectation for deflation to accelerate in the Fall and linger into the 1H17, we believe the question going forward will be, 'Is it conservative enough given low visibility?'

45,DG,"Big Lots (BIG) easily beat second-quarter profit estimates Friday morning, but shares quickly reversed lower amid ongoing concerns about retailers and discounters in particular.The report followed a steep sell-off in Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR). The dollar stores missed Wall Street earnings targets, and Dollar General cut its full-year sales forecast amid intense competition, as Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) was preparing to slash prices, and as Amazon.com (AMZN) continued to expand its online retail footprint.Big Lots, which operates more than 1,400 closeout stores in 47 states, said Q2 earnings per share minus one-time items climbed 30% to 52 cents, easily topping estimates of 40 cents. It was the third quarter in a row of better-than-expected earnings.Revenue dipped slightly to $1.2 billion from $1.21 billion a year earlier, just missing projections for $1.216 billion. Comparable store sales edged up 0.3%.For Q3, Big Lots sees diluted EPS between a 4 cent loss and a 1 cent gain. Consensus is for a 1-cent loss. The company expects sales at stores open more than a year to be flat to up 2% vs. the same quarter a year earlier. For Q4, Big Lots sees adjusted EPS of $2.18-$2.23, with same-store sales flat to up 2%. Analysts had expected Q4 EPS of $2.21.Big Lots has seen weak revenue for more than two years, reporting growth in a range of minus 1% to plus 1% every quarter in that period. Its earnings growth, however, has mostly in double digits due to cost control measures.Big Lots opened higher on the stock market today, but it soon reversed and traded down 4.5% to 50.57 in very heavy volume, below the 50-day moving average. The stock fell 4.3% on Thursday, dropping below its 50-day line intraday but closing above that support area. Thursday's move did push Big Lots slightly below a 53.45 entry point cleared in late July.The high-volume selling below the 10-week line is a clear sell signal.IBD'S TAKE: Retail earnings and stocks have been uneven in recent weeks, with discounters no exception. But one specialty discounter has performed well since its July 2015 IPO and is setting up in a bullish consolidation. Check out this IBD Stock Analysis of Ollie's Bargain Outlet, which reports earnings next week.Dollar General fell 0.15% after closing down 17.6% Thursday.

46,DG,"Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) on Thursday said increased competition, lower grocery prices and other difficulties weighed on their second-quarter results, which for both companies missed Wall Street's expectations.The results come as Wal-Mart (WMT) starts to cut its own prices, potentially luring away customers who might otherwise head to smaller dollar stores strategically placed within the orbit of big-box Wal-Mart locations. Meanwhile, Amazon (AMZN) has been ravaging clothing retailers and is making more inroads in groceries.""Retail food deflation ... coupled with unseasonably mild spring weather, proved to be stronger than expected headwinds to our business,"" Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos said in a statement. ""The competitive environment also intensified in select regions of the country.""Dollar Tree CEO Bob Sasser, meanwhile, cited a continued ""challenging retail sales environment"" in the company's second-quarter earnings release. Variations on that phrase -- ""challenging environment"" -- have become a common refrain this earnings season amid heightened concerns about economic security and personal safety.Shares of Dollar General dived 17.6% to 75.61 in the stock market today, dropping below their 200-day average and falling out of buy range. Dollar Tree sank 9.9% to 85.50. Technically, that's back in buy range from a prior breakout, but the high-volume gap down through the 50-day line is a clear sell signal. Wal-Mart dipped 1.4% to its lowest close since June 20 -- just two days after hitting a 14-month intraday high. Amazon ticked up 0.3%.Dollar Tree cut its full-year net sales forecast to $20.69 billion-$20.87 billion from an earlier outlook of $20.79 billion-$21.08 billion. Analysts expected $21.02 billion. However, Dollar Tree raised its full-year earnings-per-share guidance to $3.67-$3.82 from $3.58-$3.80. Analysts forecast $3.79.IBD's TAKE: Cheaper groceries also pose a competitive threat to the restaurant business, potentially forcing restaurants to cut costs. See this story on Middleby, which makes equipment for restaurant kitchens, for more on how restaurants try to contain expenses. Dollar General stuck to its full-year EPS forecast, but said it expected capital expenditures during the year to rise after purchasing 42 Walmart Express stores — Wal-Mart's small-store model that the dollar stores effectively killed.The dollar stores benefit from a smaller-store model, which can be easier to navigate for shoppers seeking to buy only a few items and helps keep labor costs down. But Wal-Mart has stepped up its e-commerce efforts, and its price cuts could force the dollar stores into a downward spiral of discounts to compete more aggressively with each other.""As we spoke to store managers about price competition in March of this year, almost none cited any issues or changes in activity from competitors,"" Jefferies analyst Daniel Binder said in a research note earlier this month.""However, as we went through spring and summer, the responses around increased pricing activity spiked up enough to get our attention. Walmart was often mentioned as the culprit, but we also heard store managers call out direct competition in the dollar store channel.""RELATED:Wal-Mart Re-Thinks Small Format Strategy As Dollar Stores SwarmWal-Mart Pays $3.3 Billion For Jet.com And E-commerce 'Lore'

56,DG,"Deep discount retailer Dollar Tree (DLTR) fell short of fourth-quarter forecasts across the board and gave weak guidance, sinking shares Wednesday. The dollar store is the latest discount chain to sell off after reporting earnings. Costco (COST), meanwhile, pulled ahead of revenue expectations in the afternoon.X Estimates: Profit to grow 37% to $1.90 per share in Q4 as revenue rises 14% to $6.4 billion.

Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Estimates: Earnings to rise 24% to $1.45 per share on 10% sales growth to $32.71 billion. Core same-store sales, minus gas and the impact of foreign exchange, are expected to rise 5.5%, per Consensus Metrix.

62,DG,"Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen said the case for a rate hike is stronger now, but investors weren't sure what to make of that. Pfizer (PFE) paid $14 billion for a one-drug biotech, but shares of drugs and pharma supply chain companies sold off as Mylan's (MYL) EpiPen price hikes drew outrage. Best Buy (BBY) earnings surprised investors, while dollar stores came under pressure.For the week, the Nasdaq fell 0.4%, the S&P 500 0.7% and the Dow 0.8%. The major averages are still in sideways action. Drug stocks were big movers on Pfizer's Medivation (MDVN) deal and Mylan's EpiPen furor. Dollar stores suffered heavy losses as competition from Wal-Mart (WMT) was heating up.Fed Chair Janet Yellen said at Friday's long-awaited speech that the case for an interest rate hike has ""strengthened in recent months."" That followed other modestly hawkish statements from fellow Fed policymakers. However, Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said Yellen's comments were consistent with a September rate increase. He saw the possibility of two rate hikes this year. Markets had already priced a Fed move, perhaps in December, but they don't expect any quick follow-upNew-home sales soared to a 654,000 annual rate in July, by far the highest since October 2007, the Commerce Department reported. The 12% rise from June surprised economists looking for a slight dip to 580,000. Luxury homebuilder Toll Bros. (TOL) confirmed that the high end of the market is prospering, reporting a 69% jump in third-quarter earnings per share, a 23.5% rise in revenue and a strong backlog of orders. Existing-home sales fell more than expected in July, though that was from June's cycle high. But applications for loans to buy a home fell to a six-month low. Toll shares soared to a seven-month high, moving above their 200-day moving average.The generic drugmaker Mylan sold off 11.55% for the week as members of the Senate and other politicians started inquiring into its price increases on its emergency allergy drug/device EpiPen. That fueled selling in drug and biotech stocks. Mylan CEO Heather Bresch, daughter of Sen. Joe Machin, D-W.V., said only a fraction of the $608 list price makes it back to Mylan, due to all the middlemen, leading shares of Express Scripts (ESRX), CVS Health (CVS) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC) to fall as well.Big pharma Pfizer agreed to buy Medivation for $14 billion in cash, snatching the cancer-drug specialist from Sanofi (SNY), which had been trying for months to acquire Medivation. Biotechs rallied Monday on the news, with BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) jumping on rumors that it was Sanofi's second choice of target. On Wednesday, Pfizer agreed to buy the antibiotics business of AstraZeneca (AZN) for $725 million plus possible future milestone and sales payments and royalties that could amount to $850 million.Oil prices may be settling into a trading range in the mid to high $40 range. OPEC members gave conflicting signals over whether they might support a production freeze, while Goldman Sachs said such a move would not ""be sufficient to support prices much further."" Meanwhile, the Energy Information Administration said U.S. crude inventories rose by 2.5 million barrels vs. expectations for a small drop. Domestic production fell slightly.The road to self-driving cars got a little more crowded as Mobileye (MBLY) announced it will partner with General Motors (GM) supplier Delphi Automotive (DLPH) to jointly develop off-the-shelf autonomous driving technology for automakers. The two companies will co-develop ""the market's first turnkey Level 4/5 automated driving solution."" Mobileye already has deal with BMW (BMWYY) and Intel (INTC) to bring an autonomous vehicle to market by 2021.Mobileye shares spiked Tuesday on the Delphi news, briefly topping a buy point. Shares rose 2.3% for the week.Tesla Motors (TSLA), which is ending its business relationship with Mobileye, introduced new versions of its Model S and X that boosts speeds and driving range, powered by an updated battery technology. Tesla said its upgraded Model S is now the fastest-accelerating car in commercial production. Tesla shares fell 2.2%, closing below the 50-day line and just above the 200-day line.Tesla partner Nvidia (NVDA) unveiled a new processor for autonomous driving, saying it's 50%-100% more powerful than other mobile processors.The beauty products retailer reported better-than-expected earnings and sales, with yet another quarter of double-digit same-stores growth. Ulta Beauty (ULTA) also raised full-year EPS guidance. But its Q3 profit range was a little cautious. Ulta shares have been on a strong run-up, so it may have been priced for perfection. Ulta shares tumbled 6% on Friday, undercutting its 50-day moving average.Workday (WDAY) reported a wider-than-expected Q2 adjusted loss. But it topped on some key metrics, including revenue, which rose 34% to $377.7 million. But shares of the cloud-based human resources software maker rose 2.5%, hitting a 2016 high on Thursday.July IPO Talend (TLND) lost an adjusted $1.84 a share, according to its late Thursday release, but the French Big Data firm later clarified that the bottom line actually met estimates for a loss of 31 cents a share after adjusting for the share count following its initial offering. Revenue rose 38% to $25.4 million, just beating. Talend sees Q3 losses in line with views, but it guided revenue slightly higher. Shares fell 4% after much bigger intraday losses.Best Buy (BBY) stock jumped 21% for the week to a 17-month high on better-than-expected sales and earnings for its fiscal second quarter, including a surprise increase in same-store sales. The consumer electronics retailer credited rising demand for wearable technology, appliances and home-theater systems for the increase. Video game and electronics retailer GameStop (GME) disappointed investors with in-line EPS and below-forecast sales.Discount retailers Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) suffered double-digit share price losses, as both reported second-quarter results that came up short of Wall Street expectations, with falling grocery prices and tougher competition hurting sales. Those results came as Wal-Mart is waging its own campaign to cut prices, a move that could draw more customers who have become more cautious with their spending.Meanwhile, the jeweler Tiffany (TIF) held to its full-year outlook, while its Q2 EPS beat views, helping to boost shares. However, Signet Jewelers (SIG), the parent of mall jewelers Kay, Jared and Zales, slashed its fiscal-year outlook, partly due to difficulties ""in the energy-dependent regions."" Those regions' economies have been hurt by cheap oil and other commodities.HP Inc. (HPQ) reported that its fiscal Q3 earnings per share minus one-time items jumped 37% in fiscal Q3 to 48 cents on a 4% decline in sales to $11.89 billion, both better than views. For the current quarter, the printer and PC maker sees non-GAAP EPS of 34-37 cents, vs. consensus for 41 cents. HP is reducing its printing supplies inventory and is deeply discounting printers to expand its installed base. Shares closed little changed after a brief Thursday morning sell-off.

71,DG,"The Dow Jones industrial average and, briefly, the S&P 500 index undercut their 50-day moving averages, while the Nasdaq composite pulled back from a record high. Fears that President Donald Trump will impose sweeping tariffs on Chinese tech and telecom products worried investors and slammed Boeing stock. Trump also blocked Broadcom (AVGO) from buying Qualcomm (QCOM), though chip stocks still outperformed. United Airlines raised forecasts and faced yet another public relations fiasco. Adobe Systems (ADBE) rallied on earnings and guidance. General Electric (GE) dove on dividend fears.Stocks ran into turbulence amid concerns that President Trump will soon levy stiff tariffs on Chinese goods over their trade and investment practices. Trump also nixed a possible Broadcom (AVGO) takeover of Qualcomm (QCOM).

The interagency body also was worried that the U.S. would lose its leadership position in 5G wireless technology if Qualcomm was acquired by the notoriously low-R&D Broadcom. Analysts say Broadcom is likely to remain acquisitive, but will pursue smaller chip firms. A day after abandoning its pursuit of Qualcomm, Broadcom reported fiscal first-quarter sales and earnings that beat Wall Street's targets, but gave in-line revenue guidance for the current quarter amid a sharp decline in wireless chip sales.The digital media and marketing software firm earned an adjusted $1.55 a share, up 65% year over year, on sales of $2.08 billion, up 24%, in its fiscal first quarter ended March 2.

Volume in the stock market today was running about even with Wednesday's pace. Neither the Nasdaq nor the S&P 500 has had a day of above-average volume in roughly three weeks.

79,DG,"Discount retailers Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) report second-quarter earnings this week. Here's what to expect.Dollar General reports on Thursday. Analysts expect the company's earnings per share to rise 15% to $1.09, with revenue increasing 8% to $5.497 billion.Both Dollar General and Dollar Tree use smaller stores to compete with Wal-Mart (WMT).The smaller-store model allows the companies to set up shop without requiring a huge plot of land or a large workforce. The model also allows the dollar stores to set up locations along the way to a local Wal-Mart that can pick off customers who would rather not wander around a massive store to buy only a few grocery items.Dollar General in July even announced that it bought 41 former Walmart Express locations -- part of Wal-Mart's failed attempt to compete with the dollar stores in a small-store format. However, Wal-Mart's sales still dwarf those of the dollar stores, and Jefferies this month downgraded Dollar General, citing recent pricing competition from the company's big-box rival.While the downgrade was not tied to any concerns surrounding Dollar General's second-quarter sales, Wal-Mart's moves could be a threat down the road and weigh on Dollar General's guidance.Jefferies analyst Daniel Binder wrote that ""we did start to see evidence of increased pricing activity from Walmart."" He added: ""Walmart is at the beginning of its price investment campaign, so that risk considered, shares of DG after a big run look less attractive.""Wal-Mart also said this month that it would buy discount e-commerce upstart Jet.com. The acquisition could help Wal-Mart compete with Amazon (AMZN) and strengthen a sales channel that the dollar stores don't really have.Analysts have said that dollar stores have some insulation from e-commerce because it often doesn't make sense for customers to buy only a handful of grocery items online and pay for the shipping costs.Dollar General's stock jumped 4.6% on May 26, the day it reported first-quarter earnings, breaking out of a consolidation with an 87.52 buy point. The stock rose as high as 96.88 on July 27, but then started to retreat. Shares have fallen back below their 50-day line and are now within the 5% buying zone from the 87.52 entry.Shares fell 0.1% to 90.79 in the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Wal-Mart reported rising U.S. same-store sales and faster e-commerce growth last week. But operating profit fell amid rising costs. Wal-Mart warehouse unit Sam's Club has a new scan-and-go app that will shoppers skip the cashier.  Analysts expect Dollar Tree, which also holds its earnings call on Thursday, to report EPS of 73 cents, nearly tripling from a year earlier. Sales are seen jumping 69% to $5.084 billion. The company acquired Family Dollar last year.However, Dollar Tree still has ""considerable work"" ahead in its efforts to improve Family Dollar locations, BB&T Capital Markets said last month. Many dollar stores across the space have gotten makeovers -- an effort that has helped to draw or retain customers and drive sales.BB&T analyst Anthony Chukumba said that some of the Family Dollar stores he visited in the New York area were in ""terrible condition, with rampant out-of-stocks, messy displays and dirty floors.""But he said the revamped Family Dollar locations ""are likely generating much higher sales per square foot and store contribution than their untouched counterparts, which highlights the opportunity for Dollar Tree of upgrading the fleet and implementing consistent store standards chain-wide.""Dollar Tree rose 0.2% to 95.76 Monday. The stock broke out after its latest earnings report in late May and continued climbing. Shares have been finding support above their 50-day line in recent days.Wal-Mart fell 11 cents to 72.70, closing below its 50-day line for a second straight session.

The feature is available on Apple devices and coming soon to Android devices.Shares rose 1.2% to 126.51 this week.IBD'S TAKE: Facebook is still in range from a 121.18 buy point cleared back in late July. But it's also setting up a potential 128.43 entry area from a base-on-base formation. Here's a recent base-on-base primer, and take a look at Facebook's stock chart.Berkshire Hathaway continued to build up its stake in the energy giant, disclosing the purchase of 83,466 shares worth $6.5 million.

88,DG,"The U.S. created jobs in August, but at a slower pace that suggests no Fed rate hike soon. The EU said Apple (AAPL) must repay $14.5 billion in taxes and Mylan (MYL) buckled to pressure and offered a half-priced generic EpiPen. Salesforce (CRM) gave weak guidance, while United Airlines (UAL) hired a key American Airlines (AAL) executive.The major market averages rose modestly for the week, continuing the long string of sideways action near record highs. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.6% while the S&P 500 and Dow industrials climbed 0.5%. Investors see a Fed rate hike in September as even less likely now. Fiber-optic stocks remained hot, generic drugs rebounded. Apparel stores were among the notable losers.The European Union's executive arm ordered Apple to repay 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) in back taxes plus interest to Ireland, part of a broader crackdown into EU member nations' special tax treatments for big multinationals. Apple CEO Tim Cook vowed to appeal the decision and criticized the commission's 'unprecedented"" action as ""total political crap."" Apple set plans for a Sept. 7 event, with widespread expectations that it will unveil the iPhone 7.Apple shares rose 0.7% to 107.73 for the week, approaching a 110.33 by point.The U.S. added 151,000 jobs in August, below views and down from gains of 275,000 in July and 271,000 in June. Meanwhile, ISM's manufacturing index for August signaled its first contraction in six months. The odds of a September rate hike, already low, fell further. But markets still expect a year-end hike.Ford Motor (F), General Motors (GM) and most other big automakers reported lower U.S. sales in August vs. a year earlier. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' (FCAU) sales rose 3%. But it was the only one of the seven top U.S. sellers to report higher demand.U.S. sales totaled 16.98 million vehicles at a seasonally adjusted annualized rate vs. a 17.88 million pace in July. GM joined Ford in forecasting lower domestic sales for the industry in 2016 after hitting record levels last year.GM and Ford shares fell modestly Thursday on the auto sales news, but rose slightly for the week. Tesla Motors (TSLA) tumbled 10% to a 2-month low amid cash-crunch concerns about the electric car maker and its takeover target, SolarCity (SCTY).U.S. crude oil prices fell 6.7% to $44.44 a barrel, its worst weekly loss since early July. Crude inventories rose for a second straight week, while mixed economic data also weighed. U.S. oil rig counts edged higher to a seven-month high.Drugmaker Mylan (MYL) launched a generic EpiPen on Monday, responding to a frenzy of criticism over price hikes on its allergy treatment. But it faced new lawmaker calls for EpiPen-related documents, while others asked the FDA for an explanation of what was holding up approval for other generic versions. On Friday, some lawmakers accused Mylan of overcharging Medicaid for EpiPen, while Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said she would crack down on drug-price hikes. Mylan fell 7.1% this week after tumbling 11.6% in the prior week.Palo Alto Networks (PANW) earned 50 cents a share excluding items, meeting fiscal Q4 views for a 79% gain. Revenue growth topped. But EPS guidance for current Q1 was weak and indicated yet another quarter of decelerating Palo Alto growth from very high levels. Despite solid full-year EPS guidance and a $500 million buyback plan, shares fell 7.2% on Wednesday, but rallied for a 3.2% weekly gain, just below its 200-day line.Chipmakers Broadcom (AVGO) and Ambarella (AMBA) late Thursday posted top- and bottom-line beats for quarters ended July 31, and both gave guidance that topped Wall Street … and both stocks fell Friday and for the week. One problem is that investors and analysts have some doubts about crucial products about to be announced by key customers.Ciena (CIEN), a major fiber-optic company, earned 42 cents a share excluding items in its fiscal Q3, up 13.5% and beating by four cents. Sales grew 11% to $670.6 million, slightly below views for $672.2 million. Ciena stock broke out of a consolidation, rising 5.8% for the week. Ciena and Cisco (CSCO) are lead vendors on a major 100-gigabit metro rollout for Verizon (VZ). Telecoms, cloud computing giants and China are seeing huge demand for fiber-optic gear, lifting hot IPO Acacia Communications (ACIA) and others.Salesforce.com reported Q2 earnings and revenue that beat estimates. But billings were below expectations, with Q3 guidance that implied billings growth might tick down again. Salesforce, which said it sees some ""softness"" in U.S. demand, projects fiscal Q3 revenue of $2.11 billion to $2.12 billion, vs. Wall Street consensus of $2.12 billion. It expects EPS minus items of 20 cents to 21 cents, below the consensus of 24 cents.Salesforce stock fell 6.2% for the week, trading below its 200-day line for the first time since the end of March.Closeout retailer Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI) topped earnings and sales forecasts, and guided full-year estimates higher. Teen-centric retailer Five Below (FIVE) gave weak third-quarter guidance. That followed murky forecasts from Target (TGT), Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR). The results come as Wal-Mart (WMT)begins its own price-cutting campaign, potentially drawing customers away from rival discounters.Ollie's stock rose 4% for the week, retaking a 26.65 buy point after falling below its 50-day line. Five Below fell 6.5% as it extended its losing streak to eight straight sessions.Lululemon Athletica (LULU) met earnings estimates of 38 cents a share, marking 12% growth, but missed on revenue, as sales grew 14% to $514.5 million vs. forecasts for $515.5 million. Currency-neutral same-store sales rose 5% for the yogawear maker and retailer. Some analysts were anticipating an earnings turnaround, but Lululemon issued cautious Q3 guidance. Shares sank 10%, erasing virtually all of Lululemon's gains from its breakout after its prior earnings report.Shares of United Airlines (UAL) jumped this week after Scott Kirby joined the carrier from American Airlines (AAL), where he had served as president. Kirby, now United's president, is seen by some as one of the industry's best revenue strategists. The move rounds out United's recent efforts to shake up its executive team to compete with American and Delta Air Lines (DAL). United rose 9% for the week, retaking its 200-day line. American climbed 0.8%. Delta, which reported that August unit revenue fell 9.5% vs. a year earlier as it suffered outages that forced cancellations, rose 3%. Hawaiian Holdings (HA), parent of Hawaiian Airlines, rose 4.8%, breaking past a buy point, but in light volume.Smith & Wesson (SWHC) late Thursday reported first-quarter results that easily beat Wall Street forecasts. It raised full-year guidance, helped by new acquisitions. But shares of the gunmaker slid 6.4% on Friday to a two-month low and back below its 50-day line. That's in part due to FBI data on August background checks — a loose indicator of firearm demand — that didn't exhibit the surge seen in previous months. Shares of rival Sturm Ruger (RGR) fell 2.5% on Friday.Stun-gun maker Taser (TASR) broke out of short consolidation on Tuesday, then crashed to fall 6.8% for the week, diving through its 50-day line.Veeva Systems (VEEV) was expected to report a soft Q2 due to the lumpiness of its bookings, but Veeva earnings beat estimates, while 34% sales growth also surprised. Analysts credited strong uptake of the Vault content-management system. The stock rose 5% for the week, hitting its best levels since late 2013 and keeping its place on the IBD 50.

97,DG,"Retail hardly feels like a safe bet these days. IBD's Retail-Department Stores group finally, briefly, came up for air above their 200-day moving average earlier in August, while off-price darling TJX (TJX) slipped below its 50-day and out of buy range on disappointing guidance.Even discounters aren't a safe space: Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) each took a beating on weaker-than-expected results, as Wal-Mart (WMT) embarks on a price-cutting campaign.In any case, value retailers Five Below (FIVE) and Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI) each report quarterly results late Wednesday. Here's what investors should expect.Wall Street analysts are looking for 31% profit growth to 17 cents a share on a 20% increase in revenue to $219.2 million.In Q1, Five Below earnings rose 50%, for its best gain in nearly three years.

Construction materials and other stocks seen as benefiting from post-Harvey rebuilding and purchases rebounded.Over 3 million barrels per day of refining capacity, or 16% of total U.S. capacity, was offline due to Hurricane Harvey, according to S&P Global Platts, sending gasoline futures soaring to two-year highs. Refineries could be shut for several weeks. Gas Buddy said the national gasoline average jumped by over 11 cents per gallon from the prior week with more price hikes on the way. U.S. crude futures fell as fewer refiners were available to convert oil to gasoline and other products. U.S. crude inventories fell by 5.4 million barrels in the latest week with gasoline supplies flat, the Energy Information Administration reported, but that doesn't reflect Harvey's impact. Domestic production was essentially flat at 9.53 million barrels a day, still near the record high of 9.61 million reached in June 2015.Two days after Gilead Sciences (GILD) said it would pay $11.9 billion, or $180 a share, for Kite Pharma (KITE) and pivot to cellular therapies, Novartis (NVS) was the first to grab FDA approval for a CAR-T treatment.

116,DG,"Wal-Mart (WMT) is in talks to purchase e-commerce discounter and Amazon (AMZN) rival Jet.com, Dow Jones reported, a move that could strengthen the big-box retailer's online and delivery offerings as it contends with higher labor costs and more nimble rivals like Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Dollar General (DG).It was unclear how far along the discussions were or what the purchase price of Jet.com might be. A source told Dow Jones that Jet might be valued at up to $3 billion. Bloomberg reported Jet was valued at $1 billion in its last round of fundraising and had a sales run rate of $1 billion last month, adding that the talks could also result in a strategic investment, not an acquisition.Jet.com launched about a year ago with the intention of providing a cheaper alternative to Amazon, Wal-Mart and Costco (COST). The company in May even began offering fresh grocery delivery in some markets in the Northeast and Washington, D.C. Amazon has also expanded its grocery delivery services. Wal-Mart gets about half its sales from groceries.However, Dow Jones noted, the startup e-commerce firm was potentially facing ""years of losses"" due to aggressive promotional efforts and difficulties getting customers to defect from Amazon.IBD'S TAKE: Like all brick-and-mortar retailers, Wal-Mart has lost hold of customers who do more buying online. But its shares have hovered above their 50-day line following its earnings report in May. Rival Target has struggled. See which discounters are trending higher in IBD's Stock Checkup.Along with the enduring threat of e-commerce, Wal-Mart's large stores can make it difficult or inconvenient to navigate for people looking for a few items -- a weakness its smaller dollar-store rivals have cashed in on over the years.Wal-Mart shares closed down 0.3% in the stock market today. Amazon dipped 0.8%, while Costco lost 0.2%. Dollar Tree and Dollar General rose 0.6% and 0.65%, respectively.

131,DG,"X Amazon.com's (AMZN) planned $13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods Market (WFM) would put the resources of a $470 billion company with a massive delivery infrastructure behind the growing demand for better, fresher ingredients and seems likely to upend the way Wall Street thinks about companies that have anything to do with food.The planned merger marks a ""seminal moment in the world of eating,"" RBC analyst David Palmer said in a research note, calling the combined company a potential ""category killer"" in home meals.""Virtually all of the companies in coverage — both in the food and the restaurant space — should be huddling up about the long-term implications,"" he wrote.Prior to the deal, some eateries were making moves in e-commerce. Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and Papa John's (PZZA) have already worked digital ordering into deliveries, while fast-food giants like McDonald's (MCD) have also made a push into delivery and mobile ordering.The merger seems almost certain to deepen the bruising price war between chains like Kroger (KR), Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) and Target (TGT) as an oversupply steers supermarkets toward discounts.Weaker demand in Asia and Europe has in recent years contributed to an oversupply of dairy, while cyclicality has pushed beef prices lower, spurring price cuts to move items off shelves more quickly.Meanwhile, discount European grocers like Aldi and Lidl plan to expand in the U.S., which could bring lower prices for shoppers but also lower profits for the industry.But in Amazon, the industry now faces a retailer that can ""price aggressively, and the smaller regional supermarket chains and independents will bear the most pain,"" Moody's Vice President Mickey Chadha said in a statement.Amazon's move also seems likely to hasten consolidation in the industry, Chadha added. Rumors have persisted through the year that Whole Foods or Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) were possible takeover targets by Albertsons.For now, news of Amazon's plans to barrel into the grocery business proved merciless to shares of many of its rivals-to-be.Shares of Kroger tumbled 9.2% to finish at 22.29 on the stock market today, but closed well off intraday lows. On Thursday, the stock sank nearly 19% after Kroger slashed earnings guidance but vowed not to ""lose on price."" Target fell 5%, and Wal-Mart, whose own discounts have escalated the price war in supermarket aisles, dropped 4.7%. Sprouts sank 6.3%. Grocery store operator and distributor SuperValu (SVU) crashed 14%, and distributor United Natural Foods (UNFI) lost 11%.The Amazon-Whole Foods deal would create a top-five grocer in the U.S., but it wouldn't be without challenges. Fresh groceries are lower-margin and require more work to handle.UBS analyst Michael Lasser said in a research note that wholesaler Costco (COST) could be protected from Amazon's move. He added that dollar stores Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) serve rural areas, where consumers have limited resources or are just looking for quick, fill-in trips.""Thus, those models may not see as much change as is feared,"" he said. ""We would use this as a chance to parse through the noise.""Cowen analysts in March said the intersection of food sales and digital technology could drive U.S. e-commerce growth over the next five years. Their survey data said that younger consumers, who do more through their smartphones, were ""leading the U.S. shift"" and that U.K. survey data suggested ""3x more online grocery purchasers than the U.S., a positive indicator for U.S. adoption.""As more analysts speculate about retail's connected future — with the store perhaps not vanishing completely but sharing more space with online and mobile shopping — an Amazon-Whole Foods tie-up could help normalize a kind of shopping that bounces data from the price-tags in the store to the device in your pocket.""Amazon now has a high-end retail space where they can truly experiment with IoT, retail analytics, behavioral management, and consumer tracking techniques,"" Stephen DiFranco, an investment advisor to Silicon Valley venture capital firms, said in an emailed statement.As also stated in that email: ""You will never be alone in aisle 6 again.""RELATED:What Amazon's Whole Foods Deal Means For RetailCould Trump-Bezos Tension Imperil Amazon-Whole Foods Deal?Wal-Mart Beefs Up Online Ops With $310 Million Bonobos Deal 
"
132,DG,"X Unhinge jaw, devour Whole Foods Market (WFM). Amazon's (AMZN) latest acquisition is its largest ever at $13.7 billion, and one that promises to shake up the retail space — though exactly how is unclear.A combined Amazon and Whole Foods Market would create the fifth largest U.S. grocery retailer behind Wal-Mart (WMT), Kroger (KR), Costco (COST) and Albertsons/Safeway, said Cowen analyst John Blackledge in a Friday note.As Investor's Business Daily has previously reported, Amazon's foray into the grocery aisle isn't new. Through Amazon Fresh and Prime Pantry, Amazon already has some level of grocery-delivery built into its fulfillment strategy, though the complexity of handling produce and perishables at its fulfillment centers means that the rollout has been relatively slow.It was not until the latter half of 2016 that Amazon ""meaningfully ramped up its expansion efforts"" to be in approximately 20 major U.S. markets, wrote Blackledge in an earlier report from March.Engulfing Whole Foods now brings 460 additional brick-and-mortar locations in the U.S., Canada and the U.K., and around 87,000 more employees to Amazon's arsenal. Whole Foods raked in $16 billion in sales in fiscal 2016.That expanded presence in the real world could mean all manner of retail ripples. Amazon could use the acquisition to increase its product offering through Prime Now or expand its beta-tested curbside pickup offering, among other things, noted Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson. The e-commerce titan could also incorporate its private-label items, ""compressing costs and removing differentiation currently enjoyed by retailers like (Wal-Mart).""Whole Foods will expand Amazon Fresh's potential footprint to most of the U.S., especially in upscale areas, Olson added. ""We believe Amazon can therefore launch nationwide grocery delivery coverage within 12-18 months.""For Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM), ""it will likely complicate its delivery partnership with AMZN through Amazon Prime Now,"" wrote UBS analyst Michael Lasser. Amazon and Sprouts announced a Denver grocery delivery partnership on Thursday.Additionally, ""we consider it to be a negative read for (Target), as it could further complicate its efforts to gain traction creating a stronger, better-for-you food offering in its stores,"" he said.The buyout could also increase the existing allure of Amazon's Prime membership.In the cybersphere, Amazon Prime was already the ""most used"" platform to buy groceries online in 2016, according to a Cowen survey from March. Prime's 47% share outguns Wal-Mart 39% piece of the pie, and Cowen's Blackledge added that the U.S. grocery retail market is ""greatly underpenetrated online,"" projecting earlier this year that online grocery sales could reach $177 billion in 2022, up from an estimated $71 billion this year.And there appears to be plenty of room to grow within Amazon's own ecosystem: Consulting firm Magid said only 13% of Prime subscribers buy groceries on Amazon.Analyst reaction has been swift. BMO Capital Markets upped its price target on Whole Foods to 42, Amazon's offer price. Oppenheimer raised its target on Whole Foods to 45 from 40, and said it can't rule out the possibility of another bid for the upscale grocer as a defense measure against Amazon.Some investors apparently agree with Oppenheimer. Whole Foods shares shot up 29.1% to 42.68 on the stock market today. Amazon rose 2.4% to 987.71.Calling the buyout a ""somewhat surprising step"" from Amazon, RBC analyst Mark Mahaney also noted surprise that Amazon is wading further into brick-and-mortar retail.The question of what Whole Foods can bring to Amazon appears to be answerable in a dozen different ways. A murkier question appears to be what Amazon can do for Whole Foods.""We could see AMZN perhaps improving WFM's procurement processes, but it's very unclear to us how Amazon would improve the rest of WFM's operations,"" said Mahaney, noting that Amazon ""has typically not bought fixer-uppers.""""So we see substantial execution risk here, offset only by the reality that in the AMZN scheme of things, this is actually a relatively modest acquisition,"" he wrote.UBS' Lasser sees potential for ""deeper price investments"" at Whole Foods, which he says is ""necessary"" to re-accelerate same-store sales growth at the grocer.Looking to Amazon's peer in China might offer some clues about what comes next in the plan.""If you look at Alibaba (BABA) and what they've been able to do in China with the grocery stores that they've invested in, that might be a model, but you don't know because Amazon is always going to be on the forefront,"" ACSI Funds CEO Phil Bak told Investor's Business Daily. Amazon and Whole Foods Market are both holdings in the company's fund.Alibaba recently inked a deal with Chinese supermarket heavyweight Shanghai Bailian Group, which has 4,700 locations in the country, and the China e-commerce giant has an approximate one-third stake in Sanjiang Shopping Club.Amazon ""is not following anyone else's model,"" said Bak. ""They're going to pave the way, and they're going to create a new model for how grocery shopping can be.""One thing is clear: This massive acquisition means that the list of Amazon-proof stores is getting smaller.""As other brick and mortar retailers have come to realize the hard way that competing with Amazon is a formidable challenge, supermarkets will now have to contend with not only competition with each other and nontraditional grocers like Wal-Mart and Target, but with a retailer like Amazon which has the financial capacity to price aggressively,"" said Moody's Vice President Mickey Chadha in an emailed statement, adding that ""smaller regional supermarket chains and independents will bear the most pain.""Kroger, which plunged 19% Thursday after warning on full-year earnings, sank 9.2% on Friday to a two-year low.Wal-Mart, Costco and Target shares also were big losers, along with dollar stores and drugstores with significant grocery operations. Sprouts Farmers Market was down 6.3% after losing 9.4% Thursday.Wal-Mart has been seen as a growing Amazon competitor online, reporting revived e-commerce growth in recent quarters and making several initiatives such as curbside delivery and discounts for in-store pickups. It's also made several online acquisitions, announcing Friday that it will buy Bonobos, an upscale online men's apparel site, for $310 million.But UBS' Lasser said the Amazon news may have a more limited impact on Costco and specialty stores.""COST's limited assortment, low cost structure, and deep private label penetration probably means that its fortunes will be preserved, at least for the foreseeable future,"" Lasser wrote. ""Further, the dollar stores like DG and DLTR tend to serve a customer segment that lives in rural areas or has limited resources or looking for a fill in trip. Thus, those models may not see as much change as is feared.""RELATED:Amazon Is Buying Whole Foods For $13.7 Billion, Roiling SectorAmazon-Whole Foods Merger Could Be 'Category Killer' For Food, EateriesCould Trump-Bezos Tension Imperil Amazon-Whole Foods Deal?Amazon's Next Big Growth Play Will Surprise You

Volume was tracking higher across the board vs. the same time Thursday.Nonfarm payrolls rose 38,000 in May, well below economists' expectations for 158,000 added jobs. In other economic news, the ISM services index came in below forecasts at 52.9 for May, while April factory orders climbed 1.9%, also short of views. The odds of a Federal Reserve rate hike in June fell to 4%, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.The disappointing data underscored concerns about slowing economic growth, sending investors flocking to defensive stocks. Gold miners and utilities were among the biggest gainers, with gold jumping 2.5% to $1.242.30 an ounce. The 10-year Treasury yield fell eight basis points to 1.71%.Banks and other financial stocks were among the biggest losers in the stock market today, as Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan gave up more than 2% each on the Dow.But some stocks bucked the decline. Broadcom (AVGO) gapped up, soaring 5% to a new high in heavy volume and surpassing a 159.75 flat-base buy point. It's still in buy range from the entry.

163,DG,"Stocks coasted to a quiet outcome Thursday as the market awaited the second take on first-quarter GDP. The Nasdaq crept up 0.1%, while the S&P 500 was flat. The Dow Jones industrial average edged down 0.1%. The IBD 50 advanced 0.3%. Volume fell on both major exchanges. From a chart perspective, a pause in the indexes was natural after a 5% pop…

164,DG,"Staying on top of the stock market involves more than knowing whether the stocks in your portfolio are rising or falling.What else is there to check? How about a sector count of the IBD 50?The IBD 50 is a computer-generated list of the stocks with the strongest fundamentals and technicals. Breaking down the IBD 50 with a sector count can give you an idea of where the strength resides in the stock market.In the list published in IBD Weekly for the week of June 13, the sector breakdown looked like this: Nine stocks from the medical sector; six in software; five each in retail, building and chips; and three for internet. Other sectors involved only one or two stocks.The first question we might ask is this: How does this compare with the IBD 50 lineup at the start of the year?At the end of 2015, there were eight medical stocks; six from the software sector; five in finance; four each in retail and business services; and three each from banks and chips.At first glance, there appear to be similarities. The medical, software, retail and chip counts stayed about the same.However, we need to ask a second question: Has rotation occurred within the sector?The medical sector shows the biggest change, despite an essentially unchanged count. For example, at the end of 2015, the biotechs were well into a downward trend. Former leaders such as Biogen (BIIB) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) peaked in the first half of 2015. By the end of 2015, only three biotechs were in the IBD 50. And in the recent IBD 50, two biotechs made the list, but they were not the big winners of the previous up cycle. The two stocks are Medivation (MDVN) and Emergent BioSolutions (EBS).Could they be leaders of a biotech rebound? Possible but unlikely: Only four biotechs have a Composite Rating of 90 or better -- the two mentioned above, along with Anika Therapeutics (ANIK) and Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) .Software stocks have been a steady story. Four software stocks in the IBD 50 at the end of 2015 are still in the list. In the building sector, only one stock made the IBD 50 at the end of 2015. Now there are five, but none of them are homebuilders.Retail is a mix of fresh names and old names. Dave & Buster's Entertainment (PLAY) and Ulta Beauty (ULTA) were in the IBD 50 at the end of the year and are in it now. Two stocks left the list -- Alibaba (BABA) and Starbucks (SBUX).Alibaba has a Relative Price Strength Rating of 65, meaning that a hefty 35% of the market is outperforming the China-based stock. Also, earnings growth decelerated over the past three quarters, and the Street has revised annual earnings lower for this year and next.Starbucks also has struggled since departing the IBD 50. The RS Rating is a miserable 37. Annual earnings revisions, however, are upward. Quarterly earnings growth has been steady, though revenue growth has stepped down.The other current retail stocks in the IBD 50 are Five Below (FIVE), Copart (CPRT) and Dollar General (DG).Sometimes a sector check won't lead to many big conclusions. Aside from the rotation in the medical sector and the increase in the building sector, the changes appear minimal.

165,DG,"Sellers were back in the stock market Thursday, one day after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged. The market still expects two rate hikes this year, but six Fed officials now see just one hike this year, vs. just one official back in March.Among the Dow industrials, Walt Disney (DIS) fell 1%. Its $5.5 billion theme park opened in Shanghai today. Early gainers in the Nasdaq 100 included Ctrip.com (CTRP) and Priceline (PCLN).

167,DG,"The major indexes are capping a fine week with moderate gains in late-afternoon trading Friday. The surprising bump up in the number of fresh breakouts serve as corroborating evidence that institutional investors are warming again to stocks.Stocks gave up some gains after Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen said an interest rate hike would be ""appropriate"" in the coming months, but soon firmed again. The Nasdaq composite led the upside, up 0.4%, while the S&P 500 climbed 0.2% and the Dow Jones industrials 0.1%. Smaller companies outperformed, with the S&P 600 up 0.6% and the mid-cap S&P 400 up 0.4%. Volume was tracking lower on both exchanges ahead of the Memorial Day holiday weekend.Veeva Systems (VEEV) rushed 10% higher, further moving past a 28.05 handle within a four-month cup base. That base is nestled within a much longer and deeper base. The software firm focuses on the health care industry and is rising on a 25% jump in fiscal first-quarter profit to 15 cents a share, smashing Wall Street's 11-cent view. Revenue rose 33% to $120 million, accelerating from gains of 28% and 31% in the prior two quarters.The 25% profit jump is especially impressive when considering that in the year ago April-ended quarter, earnings blasted 140% higher to 12 cents a share.Veeva, an October 2013 IPO, earns an excellent Composite Rating of 95 on a scale of 1 to 99. It's part of IBD's Computer Software-Medical industry subgroup.What other companies beside Veeva hold outstanding IBD Ratings? Check for free at IBD Stock Checkup.Weibo (WB) is rising past a 24.89 buy point in a tight consolidation that could serve as an entry point for aggressive investors. The China-based Twitter-like service had broken out of an excellent cup with handle at 19.20 in early April. On the retailing side, Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Dollar General (DG) have moved sharply past proper buy points at 83.82 and 87.52, respectively. Such action among leading individual stocks reflects growing confidence that the Federal Reserve plans to further normalize the cost of money with the possibility of raising interest rates either in June or July. The Fed in December last year hiked the fed funds rate for the first time since 2006. But rates remain drastically low; the 10-year Treasury yield remains below 2%. On Friday, Fed chief Janet Yellen made comments during a Q&A session at Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass., indicating that she too is ready to remove some ""policy accommodation.""Low interest rates actually help stocks in the sense that the so-called ""earnings yield"" for S&P 500 firms is higher than long-term bond yields. With the consensus estimate for full-year 2016 earnings at roughly $119 and the S&P 500 trading near 2093, the index's earnings yield stands at 5.7%.S&P Global Market Intelligence estimates that earnings in 2016 will rise a little more than 2%.On Tuesday, IBD's Market Pulse showed a change in the current outlook to ""Uptrend resumes"" from ""Uptrend under pressure"" as the major indexes continued to rally and distribution days expired. But the overall distribution count remains elevated.

"
170,DG,"Bears and bulls alike showed patience late Thursday afternoon as the stock indexes stayed close to the break-even level. The market is likely waiting for the second take on first quarter GDP, which will be released Friday before the opening bell.The Nasdaq inched up 0.3% Thursday, the S&P 500 rose 0.1% and the Dow Jones industrial average was fractionally lower. The Dow Jones utility average led the upside with a 0.9% pop. Volume was running lower on both major exchanges.GDP has been revised upward in each of the previous three quarters' second takes. In the first Q1 estimate, GDP came in at a weak 0.5%. The Street's consensus view expects the percentage to be adjusted upward to a still-sluggish 0.9%. The range of estimates ran from 0.5% to 1.1%.On Thursday, blue chips were mostly down. Of the 30 stocks in the Dow, only one attracted higher volume. Apple (AAPL) cranked up volume more than 40% above the usual pace, gaining 1.1% to 100.69. The stock is headed toward its fifth daily gain in a row and was testing its 100 price level. Apple has wiped out most of the losses tied to its April earnings report. The stock chart, though, still looks ugly.A report from Morgan Stanley says Apple is spending heavily on auto technologies' research and development. Apple’s R&D spending rose 30% in Q1 to $2.51 billion. This kind of investment could bring Apple back into the growth camp. Some market analysts say that Apple is now more of a conservative stock than a growth stock.How many failing red marks does Apple get in IBD Stock Checkup?Economic news was generally bullish Thursday. Durable goods orders in April bulldozed past the Street's estimate. April's increase was 3.4% vs. views for 0.3%. The March percentage was revised upward from 0.8% to 1.9%. Meanwhile, first-time jobless claims came in lower than expected.Pending home sales for April boomed 5.1% vs. views for 0.8%. The home sales number reached the highest level in 10 years. The reaction, however, among housing stocks was subdued. For example, D.R. Horton (DHI) was flat as the market headed into its final hour of trade.The one negative note came from the Kansas City Fed's manufacturing gauge. The needle pointed to minus 5 in May vs. minus 4 in April. Manufacturing, which accounts for 12% of GDP, has been a sore point in the U.S. economy.Breakouts Thursday included Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR). Dollar General rose 5% intraday while Dollar Tree shot up 13.5%, both on earnings reports.

171,DG,"Deep-discount variety store chains Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Dollar General (DG) crushed first-quarter earnings estimates amid strong expansion, driving shares up early Thursday.Dollar Tree said Q1 EPS jumped 25% to 89 cents, compared to views for 71 cents.

Still, Chief Executive Bob Sasser said in a written statement he was generally pleased with the company's performance in ""what continues to be a challenging economic environment.""The company projects second-quarter earnings of 66-72 cents a share and sees $5.03 billion-$5.12 billion revenue. Consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters is for 75 cents earnings per share and $5.1 billion revenue.Meanwhile, rival Dollar General's first-quarter adjusted earnings climbed 23% to $1.03 a share, and revenue grew 7% to $5.27 billion. Wall Street expected 95 cents earnings per share and $5.28 billion revenue.It was the second quarter in row of better-than-expected earnings after the company missed in the prior three quarters last year amid strong competition from Amazon.com (AMZN) and big-box discount chains such as Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) and Target (TGT).For the quarter ended April 29, Dollar General's same-store sales at outlets open more than a year grew 2.2% vs. the same quarter a year earlier, and operating profit rose 16 basis points to 30.6%. The company said it plans to open 900 new stores this year.Dollar General has been forming a flat base with an 87.52 buy point, pushing it close to its all-time high at 87.42 set on April 1. Dollar General shares finished trading up 4.6% to 88.01 in the stock market today.

179,DG,"Sellers battered retailers on Wednesday on a range of company and earnings news, but discount chains have held up better.In late trading, retail and apparel industry groups had 16 of the day’s 20 worst losses among the 197 groups tracked by IBD.That’s a tough day.The stock market has been hard in general on the retail sector, with retail groups holding four of the 10 worst industry rankings. One exception has been discount and variety stores, essentially the dollar-store chains. Those were in the top five rankings on Wednesday and have held top-20 rankings for nearly eight straight weeks.Dollar stores for the past several years have offered a combination of defensive and offensive plays. Like Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT), the stores tend to attract more customers when economic times turn tough, as consumers hold down spending. At the same time, they have provided a growth story as the once highly fragmented industry consolidates into a smaller numbers of larger players.But the group wasn’t immune to Wednesday’s selling pressure.Get a closer look at Macy's fine points using IBD's Stock Checkup feature.Five Below (FIVE), Big Lots (BIG), Dollar Tree (DLTR), Ollie’s Bargain Outlets (OLLI) and Dollar General (DG)  slid.But none of that really caused any chart damage within the group, with one exception. Five Below pared its losses after diving almost 8% in opening trade. It had already tripped a sell signal last week, after falling more than 8% below a 42.36 buy point. Wednesday's action showed the stock losing its grip on its 50-day moving average. It also sent shares more than 8% below a prior buy point of 41.57, triggering a sell rule for investors who bought at that level.Ollie’s has been the group’s barn-burner, ripping ahead 27% from a March 18 breakout to a peak on April 28. Anywhere above a 20% increase from the buy point would have been a good place for investors to book profits. Those who held on rode a pullback over the past three weeks. Shares are now testing support at the 10-week moving average and about 10% above the stock's buy point.If the stock rises off its 10-week line in strong trade, it would present an add-on buying opportunity. If it cuts that line in heavy trade, it could mark a sell signal, depending on how severely the stock breaks support.Ollie’s sells name-brand goods -- from clothing to sporting goods to flooring and food -- at steep discounts. The bargain chain operates some 200 stores across the East.Dollar General took a light bounce off support at its 10-week moving average. It is working on the sixth week of a flat base with an 87.52 buy point. It is in a base-on-base pattern, with its low sitting around the high of a prior base. Dollar General broke out of that pattern after reporting its Q4 results on March 10. The company plans to report Q1 results on May 19.All the companies in the group operate on a January year-end calendar.Dollar Tree had outflanked Dollar General last year, spending $8.5 billion to win over Family Dollar and bump Dollar General out of a bid for market dominance. The deal left the dollar-store market with two peers of essentially equal size: Dollar Tree-Family Dollar with nearly 14,000 stores and Dollar General with just under 13,000.Dollar General's revenue for fiscal 2015 was $20.4 billion. Dollar Tree-Family Dollar booked revenue of $15.5 billion. In terms of earnings, analysts' consensus is for a 15% rise in Dollar General’s EPS this year in what would make a tenth straight advance.Dollar Tree’s outlook: a 55% jump in EPS and a 35% surge in revenue as the company fully digests Family Dollar. Next year estimates slow to a 23% earnings gain and a 6% sales rise.Despite the sharp upturn in financials, the jury is still out among investors with regard to the Dollar Tree-Family Dollar combo. Shares have traded sideways since January after recovering from an October low, but they remain about 6% below their March 2015 high.Big Lots is the group’s struggling turnaround story. Quarterly earnings and revenue have wobbled up and down. The stock continues to trade at about 14% below a November 2014 high.The stock is basing, but fundamentals continue to look weak. Earnings are forecast to grow 11% this year on a 1% revenue gain, rising to a 14% gain next year with revenue growth holding steady.

180,DG,"Investors this week learned to stop worrying and love the rate hike. Even as Fed officials and fresh economic data bolstered the case for a summer interest rate increase, stocks rallied. Apple (AAPL) and banks continued to climb, while energy stocks took heart from $50 oil. Top-rated Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and deep-discount stores shrugged off retail earnings woes. Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) kept spinning. Alibaba (BABA) disclosed an SEC accounting probe, while Alphabet (GOOGL) and Bank of America (BAC) won key court battles.Odds for a Federal Reserve rate increase at the June or July meetings continued to climb, but stocks rallied. The Nasdaq rose 3.4%, the S&P 500 2.3% and the Dow industrials 2.1%, with all three regaining their 50-day lines as the market direction returned to a confirmed uptrend. Apple advanced 5.4% after climbing 5.2% last week. Financial and energy stocks also rallied, with the latter rising along with oil prices. U.S. crude oil futures briefly topped $50 a barrel Thursday, a seven-month high, as U.S. inventories and production fell. Crude rose 3.3% for the week to $49.33.Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen, who has been among the more dovish policymakers publicly in recent months, said Friday that raising rates cautiously would be ""appropriate"" in the coming months as the economy continues to improve. Earlier in the week, San Francisco Fed President John Williams said he sees two or three rate hikes this year, with three or four more next year. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard reiterated that the U.S. job market is tight and may start to push inflation higher -- cause for another rate hike. Fed Gov. Jerome Powell said the benchmark rate could go up soon, but weak productivity growth could curb further increases.While odds of a rate hike at the June policy meeting are about 33%, the chances for at least one quarter-point hike by the July meeting are above 60%.Economic data largely backed calls for a rate hike. New-home sales spiked 16.6% to an eight-year high, while pending-home sales shot up to their best level in 10 years. Durable goods orders rose 3.4% on soaring aircraft demand, but the report also showed core capital goods bookings slid to a five-year low.In the coming week, May data on manufacturing (ISM index), U.S. auto sales and employment may lock in expectations for or against a Fed rate hike.Automaker-tech pairings continued. Toyota (TM) said it will invest an undisclosed amount in Uber after last year disclosing plans to invest $1 billion in R&D on self-driving cars. Toyota will offer auto leases to Uber drivers. BMW i Ventures said it will invest in Scoop Technologies, creator of the Scoop carpooling mobile app. Volkswagen (VLKAY) will invest $300 million in Gett, an Uber rival in Europe and New York City. The trio join Apple, which in early May said it would invest $1 billion in top China ride-hailing service Didi Chuxing as it reportedly works in secret on an Apple Car project. (Didi itself is backed by Alibaba and Tencent (TCEHY), while Uber partners in China with Baidu (BIDU)). Also, General Motors (GM) in January said it would invest $500 million in Lyft, an Uber rival.The specialty beauty retailer continues to be an outperformer among a field of retail disappointments. Ulta Beauty notched a 39% EPS gain -- the biggest in three years -- on 24% revenue growth to $1.07 billion, way above views. Ulta also amped up its full-year outlook. Q2 guidance was mixed. More retailers are scheduled to report this week. Shares rose 11.8% for the week, mostly on Friday's post-earnings jump.IBD's Take: How beautiful is Ulta's stock based on IBD criteria, and does it stand out vs. rivals? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupDollar-or-less variety store chains Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) crushed first-quarter earnings estimates Thursday amid strong expansion. Dollar General reported a 23% EPS gain and plans to open 900 new stores this year. Dollar Tree reported a 25% EPS advance. One troubling sign was that both fell short of Wall Street revenue targets. Still, Dollar Tree CEO Bob Sasser said he was generally pleased with the company’s performance in “what continues to be a challenging economic environment.”Dollar General stock leapt 10.1% this week, and Dollar Tree gained 15.7%, both breaking out to new highs.Alibaba disclosed an ongoing SEC investigation into potential violations regarding the e-commerce giant’s transaction and consolidation practices, as well as its operating data from Singles Day, the Chinese company’s most lucrative shopping day of the year.Shares plunged 6.8% Wednesday, Alibaba’s worst one-day percentage decline in more than a year. But Alibaba ended 2.8% higher this week.Evercore, Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank analysts all said they remained positive on the stock.Hewlett Packard Enterprise said it would spin off its Enterprise Services business and merge it with Computer Services Corp. (CSC), a move the company said would create a $26 billion global IT behemoth. HPE, itself a spin-off of Hewlett-Packard, also kept its full-year EPS guidance above views.HPE stock rose 15.1% for the week. Computer Sciences spiked nearly 41% to a six-month high.Bank of America, Citigroup (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and other big banks are back on the hook for a potentially crippling sum of cash after a U.S. appeals court overturned a 2013 lower-court ruling against antitrust lawsuits that alleged the banks rigged Libor and hurt investors. The lower court found the plaintiffs didn’t show sufficient harm, but the appeals court felt the opposite. Now the lower court will deliberate further on the matter and decide whether the plaintiffs are justified to sue at all.That same appeals court overturned a $1.27 billion suit against Bank of America that alleged the bank’s Countrywide Financial misled mortgage giants Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FMCC) on loan sales in the run-up to the financial crisis. The court said Countrywide’s actions were likelier to fall under ""breach of contract"" rather than outright fraud. The court also dismissed a civil suit against Rebecca Mairone, who was once an executive at Countrywide.A jury ruled that Alphabet's Google didn't need approval from Oracle (ORCL) to use the latter's programming tools -- APIs -- to build Android, the world's leading mobile operating system. Oracle had sought $9 billion in damages and possible additional royalties, saying Google violated its copyrights. But the jury said the Alphabet unit exercised fair use. Oracle said it will appeal.Alphabet stock rose 3.6% for the week, closing back above its 50-day moving average.Monsanto (MON) agreed that a deal with Bayer (BAYRY) made financial sense, but the agriculture giant rejected the $122 per share, or $62 billion offer, saying it was worth more money. But it also said it was open to more talks. Bayer said it looks to further talks with Monsanto and said it could address potential financing and regulatory issues. Monsanto stock rose 7.85% to 109.49. Bayer fell 5% to a 3-year low.Gannett (GCI)  threatened to withdraw its $15 per share offer for Tribune Publishing (TPUB) after the the owner of the L.A. Times and Chicago Tribune issued 4.7 million new shares and sold them to Nant Capital. The investment firm Towle, which controls 3.85% of Tribune shares, blasted the move and said it supports an acquisition by Gannett.Tribune Publishing stock dived 20.9% after spiking 24% in the prior week. Gannett stock fell 3.2%.Palo Alto Networks (PANW) guided to $386 million to $390 million in fiscal Q3 sales and 48-50 cents earnings per share ex items, missing the midpoints of the consensus model of $389.3 million and 50 cents. The No. 2 cybersecurity firm's fiscal Q2 sales grew 48% year over year to $345.8 million, topping Wall Street for $339.5 million. Q2 EPS shot up 83%, though that merely met analyst forecasts.Palo Alto shares dived 8.4% this week after crumbling 12.4% on Friday.Tiffany (TIF) reported Q1 EPS fell 14.8% to 69 cents but beat views by a penny. Sales fell 7.4% to $891.3 million, under views for $915.1 million. European and Asia-Pacific same-store sales were down 15%, while Americas unit comps were down 10% on lower tourist spending.

187,DG,"After watching its main rival fatten up on a big acquisition last year, deep discount retailer Dollar General (DG) has something smaller in mind for 2016 -- namely, the size of some of its stores.The company has announced plans to expand its test of its smaller-format stores this year even as other retailers, Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) in particular, have abandoned the concept.Dollar General currently is trying out around 30 of the smaller-format stores, which are less than 6,000 square feet vs. 7,400 square feet at the typical location. Earlier this month the company said it will open about 80 smaller-format stores this year as part of an overall plan to open 900 new stores.The smaller stores help Dollar General ""capture growth opportunities"" in more densely populated metropolitan areas, Chief Executive Todd Vasos said on a March 10 conference call with analysts.""Sales productivity and returns based on the early results are very encouraging,"" Vasos said. ""By eliminating less productive product segments and adding or expanding product departments to meet the needs of our urban customers, we believe this smaller-format store will allow us to have higher capture rate per-site selection.""He also reckons that the concept will work well in sparsely populated rural areas.""With this smaller format, we have even greater confidence in our real estate strategy for metro sites and smaller, lower household rural sites,"" Vasos said.Dollar General no doubt hopes to have a better go of it with the smaller format than Wal-Mart. The retail giant’s Express concept also aimed to capture more business in densely populated urban areas, but ultimately fell flat with consumers.There are some obvious differences between Wal-Mart and Dollar General, however -- the biggest being the gap in size between small and large formats.Dollar General’s smaller stores only have about 1,400 fewer square feet than typical stores. In contrast, Wal-Mart’s Express stores, at about 15,000 square feet, were around 170,000 square feet smaller than the typical Supercenter. That’s akin to retail culture shock for consumers who associate Wal-Mart with size and breadth of product offerings. In January, Wal-Mart said it would close all 102 of its Express stores as part of a total of 269 store closures.Although Dollar General looks to capture more business in urban and rural markets with the smaller-format stores, the concept might take a while to have much impact on the overall financial performance.""While a smaller format should allow the company to be more flexible with future site selection, given that plans call for just 80 units on a nearly 12,500 store base, we do not expect the decision will have a material impact on performance in the near- to medium-term,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Scot Ciccarelli noted in a recent report.The bigger impact will come from Dollar General’s aggressive plan to open a total of 900 new stores overall, which would bring the total store count to more than 13,000. That would help it close in on main rival Dollar Tree (DLTR), which currently has about 13,600 stores.Dollar Tree more than doubled its size following last year's $10 billion buyout of Family Dollar Stores, which closed in July. That deal brought Dollar Tree 8,100 stores and $2.6 billion in annual sales, and came after a failed bid by Dollar General to acquire Family Dollar.Dollar General still ranks No. 1 in sales, however. It logged $20.4 billion in revenue during fiscal 2015, which ended in January. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect sales this fiscal year to reach $22.4 billion. Dollar Tree took in $15.5 billion in revenue last fiscal year and is expected to record about $21 billion this year.Meanwhile, Dollar General also has produced better bottom-line growth. While Dollar Tree has reported lower year-over-year earnings each of the last three quarters, Dollar General has strung together six straight quarters of double-digit EPS gains.Dollar General’s steady growth is the product of both internal initiatives and macro trends, Ciccarelli said: ""We believe the company has broadened its customer base through a combination of low prices and conveniently located stores, helped by economic necessity on the part of U.S. consumers and a reduction in the pre-recession social stigma that surrounded shopping at dollar stores.""The company earned $1.30 a share during the fiscal 2015 fourth quarter, up 11% from the prior year and above consensus estimates for $1.26. Revenue gained 7% to $5.29 billion, slightly above views for $5.28 billion. Same-store sales climbed 2.2%, in line with consensus.The company’s sales per square foot reached $226 during 2015, up from $223 the prior year. As recently as 2008, Dollar General had sales per square foot of less than $160, JPMorgan analyst Matthew Boss noted in a report.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Dollar General to grow earnings 15% this fiscal year and another 12% next year.Boss says growth in the metric has been driven by internal initiatives such as expanding the size of Dollar General’s coolers, tweaking its apparel and home goods lineups, and selling beer and wine in some stores.""In addition, the combination of an aging baby boomer population and higher income demographic has placed the company in a sweet spot for traffic,"" Boss wrote.

189,DG,"Calvert Equity Portfolio follows what it calls a ""responsible"" path of investing, while also controlling risk and seeking market-leading stocks.It sounds like a challenging juggling act. But the$2.1 billion mutual fund has been relatively successful lately. In the year ended going into Tuesday, Calvert Equity gained 2.12% as its large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. averaged a 1.80% loss and the S&P 500 gained 2.15%. That put the fund ahead of 88% of its peers.It's beaten 89% of its direct rivals so far this year.

190,DG,"Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI) late Wednesday reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings of 31 cents a share excluding one-time items, beating analysts' consensus by three cents a share and pushing shares up late Wednesday.The retail closeout chain said that its revenue rose 21% to $243.4 million, topping views for $239.1 million and accelerating from 16% in its fiscal Q3.For the current fiscal year, which ends Jan. 28, 2017, Ollie's guided sales of $865 million to $875 million, the midpoint of which is below analysts' consensus for $872.3 million. It expects 83-85 cents EPS, vs. views for 76 cents. ""We feel very good about the current outlook and trends across our business,"" CEO Mark Butler said in a written statement. But it sees same-store sales growth of just 1.5%-2.5% after a 5% jump in Q4.Ollie's stock rose 5.7% to 22.99 in late trading. Shares closed up 0.9% to 22.70 on the stock market today, retaking a 22.63 buy point.

It expects to add 28-32 stores this year and doesn't plan to close any outlets.Ollie's joined Dollar General (DG), Dollar Tree (DLTR), Big Lots (BIG) and Five Below (FIVE) as a publicly traded company last summer after pricing at 16 and launching trading on July 16 in its initial public offering.The discounter is in the Retail & Discount Variety group, ranked an excellent 4 on IBD's list of 197 industries.

192,DG,"Dollar General (DG) shares bumped up past their buy point Thursday as the dollar-store chain's candy and snacks, perishables, tobacco and food departments experienced the ""most significant"" sales increases in the fourth quarter.Earnings grew 11% to $1.30 per share on 7% revenue growth to $5.29 billion, ahead of consensus views for $1.26 earnings per share and $5.28 billion in revenue.Shares shot up past their buy point of 76.85 on the report after developing a cup-with-handle base for the last eight months, and closed up 10.7% to 83.23.""At first glance we were impressed by Dollar General's better-than-expected Q4 '15 results, which were consistent with our view that the company remains the 'least risky' way of gaining exposure to the deep-discount retailing space,"" wrote BB&T Capital Markets analyst Anthony Chukumba in a brief note Thursday morning, prior to the earnings call.Dollar General's Q4 same-store sales growth of 2.2% was in line with Chukumba's estimate. Reuters cited Consensus Metrix analysts as expecting a 1.9% rise.In keeping with the company's newly established long-term growth model, it is broadly targeting 7%-10% annual net sales growth and a 10%-15% rise in diluted earnings per share every year. Wall Street is anticipating 9% sales growth and a 13% EPS rise for the year.Dollar General said it approved on Tuesday a 14% boost to its regular quarterly cash dividend to 25 cents a share. It plans to open 900 new stores in fiscal 2016.Competitor Dollar Tree (DLTR), which recently acquired Family Dollar, fell short of Q4 estimates when it reported at the beginning of the month.

194,DG,"Large-cap growth mutual funds have lagged their large-cap value counterparts so far this year. But large-cap growth funds have outperformed over the past decade.The reasons for the outperformance are worth bearing in mind whenever you make buy or sell decisions in your portfolio, especially the diversified portion -- your mutual funds and ETFs. Knowing the reasons for the decade's worth of outperformance could help lubricate your funds' forward motion.Growth funds lagged this year and early in the decade -- especially during the 2008-09 financial crisis downturn. But the ballgame has largely gone to large-cap growth funds since late 2010.Since the start of 2006 through March 11, large-cap growth funds averaged a yearly gain of 6.79% vs. 5.38% for large-cap value funds, according to Morningstar Inc.If you had invested $10,000 on Dec. 31, 2005, in large-cap growth funds, your money would have grown into $19,826 by March 11.But if you had invested in large-cap value funds instead, your $10,000 would have expanded into only $17,828.If you have invested, say, $100,000 at the outset, that would be a $20,000 advantage for the large-cap growth route. That would be a nice help to any portfolio, and a nice tailwind for your retirement planning in particular.In the past decade plus this quarter, the top performing large-cap growth fund with $100 million or more in assets is $5.4 billion Alger Spectra Fund (SPECX). The fund averaged an 11.07% yearly gain.As of Dec. 31, 2015, the fund had 90% of its money at work in U.S. stocks and 5% in foreign stocks. The balance was in cash.The fund had 49% of its assets in giant-cap stocks, 28% in large caps, 19% in midcaps and the rest in small caps.The fund's biggest sector was technology, with a 31% weighting. Health care was the next largest sector; it had a 21% weighting. Consumer cyclical was next at 19%. No other sector cracked a double-digit weighting.Recent holdings include Dollar General (DG).

"
203,DG,"The market is back in an uptrend, but the S&P 500 is still trading below its high from May. It is easy to see eight months of a struggling market reflected in IBD’s blue chip Big Cap 20 list. Fully 14 stocks on the current list qualify as defensive names.Utilities including Southern Energy (SO), Consolidated Edison (ED) and WEC Energy Group (WEC) are defensive because their prices to consumers are generally locked, and customers have little choice but to use the product. Also, the stocks typically offer healthy dividends.Another factor: Utilities are a segment into which mutual funds working to maintain minimum levels of investment rotate into during choppy markets. This demand can hold share prices steady or even drive them higher while the general market corrects.On the other hand, four stocks on the list qualify as solid growth stocks: Cognizant Technologies (CTSH),  Equinix (EQIX) and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG).McDonald’s (MCD) carries some combined traits of defensive and growth stocks, giving it an interesting leg up in the current market. The fast-food chain’s turnaround under new Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook has made the stock a growth contender with regard to a number of fundamental and technical attributes: earnings growth, same-store-sales, relative strength and accumulation/distribution.McDonald’s still falls short on the standard punch list of CAN SLIM elements. But the turnaround has made the stock much more attractive for investors looking for healthy dividend names and/or double-threat defensive plays.McDonald’s, which fell off the list Monday, was extended after last week’s bounce off its 10-week moving average, and from a breakout in October.Dollar General (DG) was a double-threat growth/defensive stock from its re-entry to public markets in November 2009 through July 2012. It and its now-merged competitors Family Dollar and Dollar Tree (DLTR) were grabbing market share from Wal-Mart (WMT) and buying up smaller, regional chains across the U.S. Dollar General’s EPS growth is forecast at a healthy 13% for the year ended in January, and 15% in 2017. Revenue growth has slowed to high single digits.O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY) torqued up nearly 1290% from October 2008 to October 2015. During that period, when the market was choppy or in a correction, auto parts chains were seen as dual growth/defensive plays because they were consolidating and gaining market share while benefiting from consumers holding on to their cars longer than they had in the past.O’Reilly, which announces its Q4 results on Feb. 10, is forecast to remain in the camp through 2015 with full EPS growth forecasts of 24%. Revenue growth is seen slowing to 8%. For 2016, analyst consensus puts EPS growth at 14% and sales growth at 7%.Big Cap 20 stocks tend to be stable, healthy performers, but they are not a list of pick-and-play buy opportunities. Investors need to look carefully at the fundamentals and make sure they understand both the company and its value proposition. Sudden changes in market direction can generate significant changes in the companies on the list.

205,DG,"Warmer weather, online shopping and heavy discounting have made retail a tough space to be in right now, but at least five stocks on the IBD 50 list are bucking the trends.Ulta Beauty (ULTA) has held off Amazon (AMZN) better than its retail peers, partly because of the experiential nature of buying beauty products and partly because of the dedicated customer loyalty that companies like Ulta and Sephora have built, according to analysts.Notably, specialty beauty retailers have the benefit of not being in a seasonal industry, say experts, which means that they are not subject to the promotional pressures that department stores and clothing retailers face.Ulta, a member of IBD's Retail-Specialty industry group, has risen 35% over the last year. The group has collectively lost 6%.Nike (NKE) and Under Armour (UA) have also fared well amid a struggling retail backdrop as ""athleisure"" continues to make its way out of the gym and into offices and even major fashion houses.Health and wellness trends -- think juice bars, cleanses and the much-anticipated SoulCycle (SCYL) IPO -- have worked in both companies' favor, and Under Armour's push into wearable technology has inserted itself into the tech conversation alongside Fitbit (FIT) and the Apple (AAPL) Watch.Nike's stock has climbed 31% and Under Armour has grown 17% since Jan. 29, 2015. Shares of the Apparel-Shoes and Relating Manufacturing group and Apparel-Clothing Manufacturing have risen 5% and declined 15%, respectively.Both companies are not the only two activewear companies on the list. Foot Locker (FL), which carries both Nike and Under Armour in its stores, also made the cut.Starbucks (SBUX), for its part, isn't afraid of a slowdown in China. The java giant is expanding assertively into the country, with a goal of operating 3,400 stores there by 2019.Starbucks missed Q1 revenue and guided Q2 below consensus estimates when it reported on Jan. 21, but CEO Howard Schultz expressed enthusiasm about bringing Starbucks' mobile-order-and-pay feature to Chinese consumers. He anticipates that it will be a ""runaway success.""Domestically, its mobile efforts have yielded success, with over a fifth of all U.S. transactions now made via smartphone.Starbucks shares have grown 36% while IBD's Retail-Restaurants group has tumbled 15%.Ross Stores (ROST) doesn't even have an e-commerce presence, but the chain of off-price stores has been labeled ""un-Amazonable"" by Cowen analyst Oliver Chen, citing the appeal of the ""treasure hunt"" experience that compels shoppers to visit brick-and-mortar stores.Amid a shift to off-price retailers, analysts agree that there's room for square-footage growth as Ross expands into other regions stateside.Ross Stores' stock has risen 20% over the last year, compared to the Retail-Apparel/Shoes/Accessories group, which has declined 14%.A number of other consumer stocks abound on the IBD 50 list, including energy-drink maker Monster Beverage (MNST), discounters Five Below (FIVE) and Dollar General (DG), and baby-clothing merchant Carter's (CRI).RELATED:Why Under Armour’s Market Share May Be Bigger Than You ThinkThink We’re In A Recession?

220,DG,"TJX (TJX) topped estimates and raised its guidance going into the all-important holiday quarter, and the off-price retailer doesn't appear to be burdened by the same inventory and pricing issues that plague full-price peers.In contrast to Macy's (M) and Nordstrom's (JWN) weak results and forecasts last week, TJX lifted its full-year same-store sales growth estimate to 4%-5% from a prior outlook for 3%-4% growth. Q3 earnings edged up over 1% to 86 cents per share, topping by 2 cents, and revenue grew over 5% to $7.75 billion, vs. views for $7.73 billion.""It's a broader reflection of core middle- and lower-income consumers, which makes up 70% of the population,"" Retail Metrics' Ken Perkins told IBD. ""They are looking for value.""TJX shares climbed 3.85%, and Wal-Mart gained 3.5%.Fourth-quarter and full-year guidance fell short of expectations, however, as the company accounted for a variety of factors — including its late October acquisition of Australian off-pricer Trade Secret — that should weigh on EPS growth by 9%.Meanwhile, Wal-Mart (WMT) saw a 14% drop in Q3 EPS to 99 cents, topping by a penny. Revenue dipped 1.3% to $117.4 billion, missing views, but U.S. comps grew for the fifth straight quarter amid turnaround efforts.Shift In Spending HabitsA ""healthy U.S. consumer backdrop,"" cleaner stores and upgraded staffing, among other factors, will likely drive holiday demand at Wal-Mart, noted Cowen & Co.'s Oliver Chen, who has a market perform rating on the stock.But Wal-Mart still faces competition from Amazon (AMZN), said Perkins, and the big-box retailer is also feeling the heat from dollar stores like Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR).Weighing on traditional retailers and department stores is a shift in spending habits. Perkins pointed to off-pricers' post-recession success as a reason why Macy's, Nordstrom and other companies are pursuing the discount space themselves, with offshoots like Macy's Backstage, Nordstrom Rack and Saks Off Fifth, among others.And in an increasingly cutthroat shopping environment that pits brick-and-mortar shops against Amazon and other online shopping destinations, the battle is being fought on several fronts.But shoppers also aren't as interested in apparel, say both Perkins and Morningstar analyst Bridget Weishaar. Those dollars are going into a variety of different areas, including home goods and bigger-ticket items such as automotive needs.Outside of cheaper products, another advantage that off-pricers like TJX and Ross Stores (ROST) have is faster and higher inventory turnover, giving it a flexibility that makes it more akin to fast-fashion favorites Forever 21 and Zara than Macy's or Nordstrom.""The ones that are outperforming right now are the ones that are most responsive to what consumers want,"" Weishaar said.Traditional retailers have a six- to nine-month lead time for orders, she explained, while off-pricers can buy merchandise much closer to the start of each season. This helps to ""weatherproof"" against factors such as, say, a warmer fall that keeps shoppers enjoying the changing foliage instead of shopping for snow boots.When asked about the impact of warm weather — which several other retailers have blamed in recent earnings reports — TJX CEO Carol Meyrowitz said that she'd ""rather not talk about weather,"" focusing instead on her team's performance.""That's all about execution and delivering the right product to the right stores at the right time,"" she said on the post-earnings call. ""Every year, we learn and we get better at weatherproofing our business. It just comes back to the model — we keep ourselves very flexible.""For department stores, improving lead time is easier said than done, said Perkins. ""It's like trying to turn around a battleship.""The good news for shoppers, at least, is that Santa's likely to deliver plenty of discounts for the holidays.Perkins said he expects the promotional environment to be ""comparable, if not even steeper"" and potentially more aggressive than last year's holiday quarter, as retailers try to get rid of leftover inventory from the fall.Weishaar was even less optimistic: ""It's going to be horrible. It's going to be one of the worst we've seen in a long time.""

221,DG,"Retail sales disappoint in September
"
222,DG,"Retail sales rose just 0.1% last month after an unchanged August. Auto sales were strong, but outside of the sector, sales slid 0.3%, the worst showing since January. Sales were unchanged excluding both autos and gas stations. Cheaper gas prices are hitting gas station revenue, but should be bolstering discretionary income for other spending. Nonstore sales — mostly ecommerce — fell 0.2%. So did electronics and appliance store sales.

249,DG,"Few things feel as homey and comfortable to chart readers of the CAN SLIM ilk as cup-with-handle bases.Cup-with-handle bases are common and easy to identify, and often preface powerful rallies. Most cup bases possess a number of basic traits, discussed in Tuesday's column.  They can be as short as seven weeks long. But they are generally longer -- occasionally reaching lengths of a year or more.This time frame can make even a common, familiar base type tricky to spot. The tendency among growth investors is to set aside leading stocks that slump into long-term consolidations. Many of them take years to recover. Others never do.One recent example of a long-term cup was Dollar General (DG), which cleared an eight-month cup with handle on Thursday. Lululemon Athletica (LULU), on the other hand, has been struggling to clear a buy point in a similar, six-month base.A model case was Biogen (BIIB), which crafted a cup-with-handle base throughout most of 2010, when it was called Biogen Idec.The base began late in March. Seven of 12 weeks on its down leg were weekly declines in above-average volume. Yet this action showed institutional investors selling in a controlled rather than panicked fashion. Six of seven weeks on the upside were advances, and four of them occurred in above-average trade. During the last two, trade rose 46% and 57%, respectively, above Biogen’s weekly average.Both of those weeks closed below the midpoint of their weekly ranges. This activity raises a warning flag. But unless other flaws appear, it is not a deal killer for a base. The depth of the base was 24%, well within the 35% maximum limit from intraday high to low for normal cups.The right side of the cup topped out in the weeks that ended July 30 and Aug. 13, 2010. In both weeks, the stock notched a high of 58.16. The handle slipped 9% lower in quiet trade, retesting its converging 10- and 40-week moving averages.A burst of heavy trade shook out the final sellers and left the stock perched atop its 10-week moving average in the week that ended Sept. 24. Biogen traded quietly for a few more weeks. On the day of its breakout past a 58.26 buy point, Biogen held a 92 Composite Rating from IBD. Its EPS Rating was a powerful 96, and its RS rating -- despite nearly seven months of basing -- was an imperfect but still healthy 81. Its Sales, Margins and Return on Equity grade was an A, Accumulation/Distribution a B+.The outcome: a 725% rally over the next 53 months.

278,DG,"After shoring up its position in the hotly competitive discount arena by acquiring a larger rival last year, Dollar Tree faces the task of turning its newly acquired muscle into bigger sales and profits.If it is to be successful, Dollar Tree (DLTR), now the biggest U.S. discount chain, needs to get a better performance from its Family Dollar Store outlets, which were struggling prior to the merger.Wall Street is tentative on Dollar Tree's prospects.""There are some natural synergies that came out of the deal with regard to buying and some expenses,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Peter Keith told Investor's Business Daily. ""But the jury is still out on whether Dollar Tree can drive material improvement at the Family Dollar business. At this point, I believe what investors will want to see is better sales productivity from Family Dollar stores, which should in turn drive improved operating margins and overall profitability.""Dollar Tree closed on the purchase of Family Dollar Stores July 6 after a heated takeover battle with rival deep discounter Dollar General (DG). It paid $6.8 billion in cash and 28.5 million shares of the company’s stock valued at $2.3 billion.Prior to the merger, Dollar Tree enjoyed a long-running streak of double-digit quarterly profit. The merger has the potential for synergies and productivity gains, and could enable Dollar Tree to serve a broader range of customers, tap new markets and enhance market share in existing ones while enhancing the company’s financial performance and improving its growth prospects, the company said at the time of the buy.“The draw (for investors) is the opportunity the company has to dramatically improve the earnings power of the Family Dollar segment,” Northcoast Research analyst Nicholas Mitchell told IBD.But the integration and turnaround processes present challenges, say followers. While analysts praise Dollar Tree management’s capabilities, opinions are mixed on the extent to which Dollar Tree will achieve its objectives.“I think Dollar Tree is a very successful retailer and they're very good operators,” Stifel analyst Taylor LaBarr told IBD. “But it was a big step acquiring a company that was bigger than they are, with even more employees, more distribution centers and more stores. It is a big acquisition and integration task for any situation, but they’re also trying to fix and turn around a struggling retailer. So we really like the core Dollar Tree business, but it’s going to be a tough integration.”Dollar Tree’s stock price rose 9.7% last year, though it’s been up and down so far this year. Its stock price has also soared 44% since the retailer announced its intent to buy Family Dollar on July 28, 2014.Dollar Tree operated 13,851 stores across 48 states and five Canadian provinces as of Jan. 30. Stores operate under the brands of Dollar Tree, Family Dollar, Dollar Tree Canada and Deals. It expects to have 217 of the 222 Deals stores converted to the Dollar Tree brand and five to Family Dollar brands by July. Dollar Tree converted 52 Deals stores to Dollar Tree stores in January.Dollar Tree operates fixed-price point stores, selling everything for $1 or less, while Family Dollar operates multiprice point stores, selling the majority of its products at $10 or less.Post merger, Dollar Tree faces new rivals.When it acquired Family Dollar, Dollar Tree gained more direct competition with Dollar General, convenience stores, the front end of drug stores, and to some degree giant discounters Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) and Target (TGT), says analyst Mitchell.“The acquisition made the business more complicated and levered up the balance sheet,” Mitchell said. “It used to be a very uncomplicated investment story that investors felt comfortable buying with the intention of holding the shares as a core position. These guys were so good at merchandising and real estate site selection that the cash flow could efficiently be reinvested in the business with expectations of earning a high return on the incremental capital.”Mitchell went on to say: “After it acquired Family Dollar, the story went from being a very clean investment story with very good unit economics and a strong competitive advantage to a story that's half the same and the other half a turnaround story. I would imagine that it has probably been a little more challenging than (management) thought it would be at the start, but they are making good progress cleaning up many of the underlying problems they inherited.”On the plus side, Dollar Tree has turned out two straight quarters of positive same-store sales for Family Dollar, which is a nice improvement, Mitchell says. It’s also cleaned up the Family Dollar stores, strengthened the end-of-the-aisle displays and improved the “in-stock” position in these stores, he says.“It’s going to take time to get the consumer back,” he added. “There’s a lot of work ahead that needs to be done. The final verdict on whether this was a smart move will be a function of execution in the next 12 to 18 months.”In the fiscal 2015 fourth quarter, which ended Jan. 30, Dollar Tree’s adjusted earnings fell 13% to $1.01 per share. Revenue surged 117% to $5.37 billion, boosted by $2.68 billion in sales from the Family Dollar segment. Family Dollar stores saw a low single-digit rise in same-store sales, driven by growth in both traffic and the average ticket.In a note to clients on Dollar Tree’s fourth-quarter results, UBS analyst Michael Lasser was upbeat about the company's prospects.“After parsing back the one-time items, (Dollar Tree) put together another solid (quarter) that puts it on pace to substantially grow its earnings over time,” he wrote.He notes that the company has now seen growth in same-store sales in each of the last seven months.“Its traffic is accelerating, and improvements are being made,” he added. “This provides a more stable base from which its (same-store sales) can accelerate.”

280,DG,"Teens and tweens love shopping, and a weekly allowance stretches far at Five Below (FIVE).With its ever-rotating trendy offerings, the rapidly expanding store chain is a haven for the adolescent set. There are shelves of cell-phone accessories, toys, fashions, sports gear, candy and seasonal items -- all for just $5 and below.To the average adult, it may sound like a pubescent-laced nightmare. But there's serious money behind catering to one of the more free-spending demographics out there.Dan Binder, an analyst with Jefferies, says he’s had a buy rating on the stock since its initial public offering in July 2012.“I like the story; I like the store concept,” Binder told IBD. “Most importantly my teenage girls like it too. I will regularly offer them the opportunity to go to movies or to go to Five Below. They usually pick Five Below.”And for those who would gladly leave the shopping at Five Below to their kids, consider this: It currently has 437 outlets in 27 states and has opened 70 of those in 2015 alone.""We’ve had a great year,” Chief Executive Joel Anderson said on a January 2016 conference call. The company says it will grow even faster in 2016, adding roughly 85 stores.Anderson says the company is growing using four strategies: opening new stores and new markets; smart merchandising; increased digital marketing and brand awareness; and building infrastructure and systems that scale. He says the company is now spending “2.5% to 3% of sales” on marketing.""We want to grow to 2,000 or so stores in the U.S.,” he said. “This concept is pretty simple. We think about it as '1/10/100,' less than a one-year payback (on investment in a store), 10 years of consistent comparable store growth, and 100% of our stores are profitable.”Net income for the company’s third quarter, ended Oct. 31, rose a hefty 30% to $4.3 million from $3.3 million. Diluted earnings per share rose 33% to 8 cents from 6 cents in the year-earlier quarter.In the third quarter of 2015, Five Below reported a rise in net sales of $31.7 million or 23% to $169.7 million from $138 million in Q3 2014. Comparable or same-store sales for the period increased 4.8%, the company said.On Jan. 7, 2016, Five Below reported net sales for the nine-week period ended Jan. 2, including the holiday season, rose 24% to $286.1 million from $230.7 million in the comparable nine-week period of 2014. It also said that same-store sales for the nine-week period were up 4.1% year over year.And Five Below also said its outlook for the full fourth quarter, with final results out by the end of this month, calls for net sales of $323 million to $326 million and earnings per share of 75 to 76 cents for the quarter. Zacks puts earnings per share for the company’s fourth quarter at 76 cents.Analysts are smitten with the company’s rapid growth, market positioning and its ability to make its new stores pay.“The payback on new stores is the shortest I’ve ever seen in retail -- they have been paying back their investment in under a year,” Matt Nemer, analyst with Wells Fargo Securities in San Francisco, told IBD.Nemer has an outperform rating on the company’s stock. He notes that growing and opening stores at this rapid a pace could be cause for concern.“What mitigates that is a pretty simple store concept, and then they cluster the openings,” Nemer said. By doing that, the company is able to “focus on that market, and leverage its advertising and marketing.”Analyst Binder from Jefferies also notes that the company has been smart about how it’s building out its network of stores: “They’re keeping it pretty tight; they’re not trying to build in California when they’re still trying to fill out in the East.”Five Below’s share price has had an up and down ride over the past 12 months. It hit a 52-week intraday high on June 23 of 41.47 per share. But it tumbled all the way down to close at 27.50 on Nov. 17, due to worries about retailer Christmas sales. Since then, the price has been climbing -- even in a tough market -- and it’s now trading around 39 a share.Like other retailers, Five Below has also been clever about finding what it calls “wow” items. At Christmas, it sold a remote control helicopter for just $5, which drove a lot of traffic to its stores, analysts said. These items keep tweens and teens coming back to hunt for treasures that usually sell out quickly.In January 2015, CEO Anderson brought in Michael Romanko as executive vice president of merchandising. Nemer says that Romanko has improved the merchandise Five Below sells by bringing in more fitness and electronics products and other products he considers compelling.Binder says the company doesn’t really have a direct competitor, but rather has several rivals, from Walmart (WMT) to Target (TGT) for some goods, and Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS) for sports gear.But he said Five Below is “deep value.” And unlike dollar stores such as Dollar General (DG) or Dollar Tree (DLTR), Five Below doesn't offer food or household items.“Without a doubt, merchandising to teens is their sweet spot,” he said.A year ago, Anderson said the company was focused on “outlining its digital marketing campaign with TV, email, social media and mobile” all being pieces of it.Anderson understands that his core customers, “teens and tweens,” are “living online.”But Five Below is using its online marketing to drive retail store sales. Analysts say that at its product price point of $5 and less, the company doesn’t have to worry about competition from online retailers.“Five Below’s product prices are so low it would be very difficult to make money shipping them to someone’s home,” said Nemer.Five Below’s puny prices also give the stores the ability to “do well in a strong or a weak economy” when customers have less money to spend, noted Nemer.

284,DG,"Today's IBD 50 list includes four highly-rated retailers that have shown strength lately, while giants like Wal-Mart (WMT) have been losing ground.The world's largest retailer cut its full-year forecast Thursday and now sees sales coming in about flat, dashing hopes that recent initiatives would spark faster growth.Meanwhile, consumers continue to watch their budgets closely, and that's helping discount clothiers Ross Stores (ROST), Five Below (FIVE) and deep discounter Dollar General (DG) outperform the market.At the high end of the retail spectrum, shares of luxury clothing and accessories brand Michael Kors (KORS) popped 24% on Feb. 2 after it reported quarterly earnings and sales growth that easily beat Wall Street estimates.The chain is well positioned to weather the current market uncertainty and rising competition from online retailers such as Amazon.com (AMZN), Morningstar and others say.""They're one of the best"" traditional brick-and-mortar retailers, Morningstar analyst Bridget Weishaar told IBD recently, referring to Ross.Ross doesn't tout luxury brands or even have an online shop. But it's outperformed rivals in part by purchasing ""packaway"" inventory -- goods bought at a low price and packed away for months or years for later sale, no matter what the current fashions are.Shares have formed a deep first-stage base with a 56.78 buy point. Ross, which which will report fourth-quarter results on March 1, closed down 0.2% Friday.Teen apparel discount chain Five Below is expected to report robust holiday sales when it announces Q4 earnings next month. On Jan. 7, the company raised its guidance for the nine-week period ended Jan. 2.CEO Joel Anderson said at the time in a written statement that, ""given our holiday performance, we are raising our net sales outlook for the fourth quarter to a range of $323 million to $326 million and are narrowing our earnings per share guidance range to 75 cents to 76 cents.""That's up from Five Below's earlier outlook for EPS of 74-76 cents on $318 million-$323 million in revenue. Shares lost 0.2% Friday.Deep discount general merchandise retailer Dollar General has seen earnings and revenue growth fall off in recent quarters, though the company continues to show remarkable stability.That led Morgan Stanley to raise its rating on Dollar General on Feb. 16 from equal-weight to overweight.Its shares have a 93 IBD Composite Rating, meaning it's outperformed 93% of all stocks in recent quarters on key metrics such as sales and profit growth. Dollar General slipped 0.8% Friday.The outlier in the group, Michael Kors, is a leader in the luxury clothing, accessories and footwear category.In its Feb. 2 fiscal Q3 earnings announcement, Kors reported a 7.4% rise in EPS to $1.59 on a 6.2% increase in revenue to $1.397 billion. Both were an upside surprise to Wall Street.The company forecasts fiscal 2016 sales of $4.65 billion, easily topping analyst consensus for $4.42 billion.Chairman and CEO John Idol said in the earnings statement, ""As we look ahead, we are excited about our upcoming Spring collections that embody design innovation and underscore Michael Kors fashion leadership.""

285,DG,"Stock indexes in the U.S. were mixed in early afternoon trade Friday as volume picked up from the previous session.The Nasdaq reversed from early losses to ante up a 0.4% gain. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average were down 0.1% and 0.3%, respectively. Volume was running higher in the stock market today, which is normal on an options expirations day.Blue chips were mostly down. American Express (AXP) posted the best price gain in the Dow, up 1% as it headed toward a fifth up day in a row. Bloomberg News reported this week that the company plans to cut costs by $1 billion over the next two years.In the IBD 50, a list of the best stocks in fundamentals and technicals, the discount stores were hesitating. Ross Stores (ROST) and Dollar General (DG) each fell about 1% in above-average volume. Five Below (FIVE) was down moderately in slow trade.The discount stores are somewhat defensive. Aggressive growth investors would like to see those kind of retail stocks leave the computer-generated IBD 50 in favor of more aggressive plays. However, it isn't clear whether conservative stocks are ready to step aside for growth stocks.Many growth stocks are badly damaged. For example, analysts expect Under Armour (UA) to crank up earnings growth 25% this year and 28% next year. That would be an improvement over 2015's 11% earnings growth and a return to the five-year growth rate of 26%.However, Under Armour remains under its 200-day line and is 23% off its high.

The stock is working on a cup-with-handle base with a 76.85 buy point.IBD 50 stocks were mixed. Universal Display (OLED) led on the upside, rising nearly 5% in heavy volume.  The maker of electronics products such as light-emitting diodes for flat panel displays is trying to recover from a failed breakout over a 55.93 buy point.The company will release Q4 results Feb. 25 after the close.

287,DG,"Today's IBD 50 list, which pinpoints top-performing growth stocks, includes five that made the elite list, fell off and then climbed back aboard.They are Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM), Michael Kors (KORS), Five Below (FIVE), Sturm Ruger (RGR) and Smith & Wesson (SWHC).Here's a look at what's happened at these top performers that's put them back on the IBD 50.Natural and organic foods grocer Sprouts Farmers Market continues to rise on strong earnings growth while rivals Whole Foods Market (WFM) and The Fresh Market (TFM) saw lackluster growth last year amid rising competition from supermarket giant Kroger (KR), Amazon (AMZN) and others.On Feb. 25, Sprouts reported a 50% surge in Q4 earnings  and a 27% pop in revenue to $930.3 million. Both figures crushed analyst estimates.Meanwhile, reports that Kroger is looking to buy The Fresh Market have added to expectations of industry consolidation.Sprouts, which boasts a 98 IBD Composite Rating out of a best-possible 99, fell 1.6% Friday.The trendy Hong Kong-based maker of fashion clothes, footwear and accessories took the U.S. and Europe by storm a few years ago. Its stock price soared 405% from 20 at its initial public offering in December 2011 to an all-time high of 101.04 on Feb. 28, 2014, before it consolidated amid execution problems.In February, Kors had its biggest up week in four years on an earnings report that surprised Wall Street analysts.On Feb. 2, its stock shot up 24% and continued rising. Shares ended essentially flat Friday.Deep discount retailers such as Five Below, which sells preteen and teen products for $5 or less, along with Dollar Tree (DLTR), Dollar General (DG) and bulk discounter Big Lots (BIG), saw sales surge during and after the Great Recession, when people were pinching pennies.The trend among consumers to buy at discounts has lingered even as the recession has receded. On Wednesday, Five Below opened its first store in Miami, expanding its store count in the state to 17, with plans to open over 100 more in Florida.Five Below rose 2.8% to 38.77.The nation's largest firearms maker, Smith & Wesson, sees dramatic swings. The Aurora, Colo., movie theater shooting in July 2012 and the Sandy Hook school shooting in December 2012 sent sales, profit and the stock soaring as fears of tougher laws sparked a rush to buy ahead of any legislative action.But demand waned as attempts in Congress to pass new gun limits failed, sending Smith & Wesson's stock tumbling.The mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., on Dec. 2 revived the gun debate and helped fiscal Q3 results top views late Thursday.Its stock cleared a cup-with-handle base on Friday, touching an all-time high at 27.99 before closing at 27.06, up 6.5% for the day.No. 2 U.S. firearms maker Sturm Ruger reported Q4 results last month that handily beat Wall Street forecasts.On a conference call with analysts, CEO Michael Fifer predicted a ramp-up in demand if Democrats take the White House and Senate, as the next president could get several opportunities to appoint new Supreme Court justices.Sturm Ruger shares closed up 5%.Image provided by Shutterstock.

299,DG,"Dollar Tree (DLTR) stock sold off Tuesday on weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and current-year guidance, but shares rebounded off their 50-day moving average to turn higher.Dollar Tree earnings fell 13% to $1.01 per share, falling short of views for $1.07 a share. Revenue shot up 117% to $5.37 billion, thanks to the company's Family Dollar takeover, but still missed estimates for $5.41 billion.Same-store sales at Dollar Tree stores grew 1.7% on a constant currency basis vs. 5.6% comp growth in Q4 of last year. Sales at Dollar Tree stores open for at least a year rose 1.3% once adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, the company said.Dollar Tree expects diluted per-share earnings of 75-83 cents in Q1, in line with consensus for 79 cents. The midpoint of its revenue guidance for $5.05 billion-$5.12 billion falls slightly below analyst estimates for $5.1 billion.For the year, the company guided for $3.35-$3.65 a share in earnings, below forecasts for $3.76 a share. The midpoint of targeted revenue of $20.76 billion-$21.11 billion is a hair above current estimates for $20.93 billion.Soon after the open, Dollar Tree stock tumbled to 77.77, just below its 50-day moving average, but it then rallied strongly and closed up 2.2%. The stock had briefly undercut an 80.14 buy point.Dollar General broke out of a cup-with-handle base in early January at that 80.14 buy point, but the attempt quickly failed, and shares have been up and down since then. Shares hit an eight-month closing high on Friday. Another buy point at 82.86  is available on a longer-term consolidation going back to the all-time high set in March 2015.Rival Dollar General (DG) shares rose 1.75%.Image provided by Shutterstock.RELATED:What Correction? Dollar Tree Breaks Out.

300,DG,"The IBD 50 is coming out of its worst-ever correction, a temblor that's changed the composition of the list.To its February low, the IBD 50 declined more than 26% from a peak in July 2015. The move marks the largest decline in the index since its inception in 2011. (That's excluding its predecessor, the IBD 100.)After a drop of such magnitude, you can expect significant changes in the composition of the list. The high-growth companies typically found in the list thinned out, while some slower-growth stocks emerged.Equity Lifestyle Properties (ELS) exemplifies the new crop. The real estate investment trust increased earnings 5% to 12% the past four quarters. Sales rose 5% to 7% over those periods. The stock itself is in fine shape, trending upward and near highs.It is one of several REITs in the IBD 50, as companies that reward shareholders with high dividends gained the favor of Wall Street.Dollar General (DG), the deep-discount retailer, typically has profit and sales growth in the teens or lower. Prestige Brands (PBH) -- which makes cleaning products and over-the-counter medications -- posted an EPS gain of 10% in Q4 and sales only 1% higher. Both stocks are forming bases.That's not to say the IBD 50 is no longer a growth screen. The average earnings-per-share increase for the 50 companies in the most recent report was a solid 37%. The average EPS estimate for the next report is nearly 26%.Indeed, some faces on the IBD 50 are experiencing a resurgence in growth.For instance, Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) on Thursday beat profit expectations as EPS soared 50%, with its 2016 forecast above estimates. Earnings rose 9%, 10% and 17% in the previous quarters, respectively, so the organic-groceries chain is in a rapid acceleration.A.O. Smith (AOS), which is recovering from a steep correction, has been bouncing back since it reported a 41% rise in earnings Jan. 29. The maker of high-efficiency water heaters is also enjoying accelerating profits, but sales growth has slowed.Vantiv (VNTV) has generated a more moderate acceleration, with EPS rising 15%, 19%, 20% and 23% over the respective four latest quarters. The payment-processing company is benefiting from the shift to cards with embedded chips for higher security, as today's IBD Stock Analysis explains on Page B10.For the week, the IBD 50 rose 0.5%, lagging the Nasdaq's 1.9% gain and the S&P 500's 1.6% advance.

577,DG,"Let's say that perfect stock you've been watching has finally cleared its buy point in heavy volume, setting off a screaming buy signal.You're tempted to go all-in because the stock's fundamentals are strong and the base was beautiful. But wait. What happens if the market tanks, or there's some bad news that sends the stock tumbling? You could lose a big chunk of change in a hurry.Rather than investing all of your allotted capital at once, consider making a few, progressively smaller purchases at key points as the stock moves up from its buy point. This concept, called pyramiding, was developed by legendary investor Jesse Livermore as a way of reducing risk.Typically, you would spend half of your allotted capital when the stock breaks out above its buy point. Then invest another 30% if the stock rises 2%-2.5% from the buy point and the remaining 20% if the stock climbs 4%-5% above the entry.It's true you'd make more money if you invested the full amount at the breakout, assuming the stock continued to rise. But it's also true that you'd lose more if the stock were to fall.For example, if you invest all of your $10,000 savings in a stock that ends up falling 8% below the purchase price — triggering the golden sell rule — you'd lose $800. If you start with half of a position, you'd lose just $400.In this way, pyramiding requires the stock to prove itself before you put more money to work. Yet ""averaging up"" isn't commonly used by investors.""Most of them average down, meaning they buy additional shares as a stock declines in price in order to lower their cost per share,"" IBD founder William J. O'Neil wrote in ""How To Make Money In Stocks."" ""Why add more of your hard-earned money to stocks that aren't working?""Dollar General (DG) behaved well following its breakout. The stock cleared a 35.19 buy point in a flat base on Aug. 30, 2011. Volume was 174% above normal.The stock boasted a near-perfect 98 Composite Rating, putting it in the top 2% of all stocks based on five key IBD metrics. Its B+ Accumulation-Distribution Rating indicated strong demand.An investor using the pyramiding technique would have made an initial purchase at the breakout. A second buy between 35.89 and 36.07 could have been established a few days later on Sept. 2, (1) when the stock rose more than 2% past the 35.19 entry.Dollar General pulled back for two sessions to as low as 34.22. (2) It was not severe enough to force an investor to sell the first or second batch of shares. The stock found its footing and continued to climb. A final buy between 36.60 and 36.95 could have been made Sept. 14 as it rose more than 4% past the initial buy point. (3) Dollar General hit as high as 56.04 in July 2012, up 59%.You can also pyramid when the stock forms a new base or pulls back lightly to the 10-week line for the first or second time.

608,DG,"The Williams-Sonoma store on Manhattan's Upper East Side drew a nice crowd during its summer clearance sale on the last Wednesday in July.
"
609,DG,"But customers weren't only drawn to the bargains. They were also snapping up pricier items like carving boards that cost $79.95 to $99.95 and bottles of organic olive oil for $24.95, while at least one browser eyed a Nespresso Maestria Espresso machine for $699.95.
"
610,DG,"Judging from its financial results,Williams-Sonoma (WSM) doesn't need a sale to lure customers or deliver solid profit growth.
"
611,DG,"The luxury home goods retail operator has grown earnings by at least double digits in all but two of the past 16 quarters. During this year's first quarter it logged a 17% year-over-year increase in EPS and 10% gains in both overall sales and comparable brand sales.
"
612,DG,"Tiffany, Kors Shine
"
613,DG,"Williams-Sonoma isn't the only luxury retailer on a roll. In the first quarter, upscale jewelers Tiffany & Co. (TIF) andSignet Jewelers (SIG) and high-end fashion house Michael Kors Holdings (KORS) all posted double-digit earnings growth, while luxury home furnishings retailer Restoration Hardware (RH) saw a triple-digit gain.
"
614,DG,"In contrast, retailers that target the middle- and lower-income consumer — including deep discounters Family Dollar Stores (FDO) and Dollar General (DG) as well as giant discounter Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) — reported little or no growth during the latest quarter.
"
615,DG,"As a group, luxury retailers have outpaced the broader market since the first quarter of 2010 and discounters since the fourth quarter of 2009.
"
616,DG,"The luxury group's Q1 profit rose 9% from the prior year. That compares with a 7% drop for the discount group and a 4.5% decline for the retail industry, says Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics.
"
617,DG,"Luxury retailers typically cater to consumers with an annual household income above $100,000. For obvious reasons, these consumers can spend more freely than those who make less money.
"
618,DG,"Affluent consumers have benefited from the rise both in real estate and equity markets during the economic recovery, Perkins says. Most moderate-to-low-income consumers did not benefit from these assets.
"
619,DG,"In addition, Perkins added, ""the economy has been unable to generate enough well-paying jobs to generate a higher level of consumer spending. That's had an impact on many middle- and lower-income consumers. Their wages are stagnant or in decline.""
"
620,DG,"Analyst Bradley Thomas, who covers retail hardlines for KeyBanc Capital Markets, offers a similar take.
"
621,DG,"""There's definitely a bifurcation, he said. ""Clearly, the wealth effect is the tailwind for high-end retailers and manufacturers.""
"
622,DG,"Williams-Sonoma and Restoration Hardware have had ""standout results,"" Thomas says. But chains that are more exposed to low-income consumers — such as rent-to-own operators Rent-A-Center (RCII) and Aaron's (AAN) — have had a ""fair amount of weakness this year.""
"
623,DG,"The low-end consumer also has been faced with a ""litany of small cost increases that really add up,"" Thomas says. These include a reduction in food stamp benefits and unemployment benefits.
"
624,DG,"Luxury retailers, meantime, have done their fair share to lure consumers.
"
625,DG,"Take Williams-Sonoma, whose lineup of retail operations includes Williams-Sonoma, Pottery Barn and West Elm. It has seen double-digit profit growth in all but one of the past nine quarters.
"
626,DG,"Thomas says one reason for the company's strong results ""comes down to their omnichannel model, which it does better than just about anyone.""
"
627,DG,"""Omnichannel"" refers to the fact that each of the company's brands sells through its own stores, online and through their catalogs.
"
628,DG,"""Williams-Sonoma has omnichannel in their DNA dating back to their heritage as a catalog business, which has translated very well into being an online business as well as a brick-and-mortar retailer,"" Thomas said.
"
629,DG,"In a July report initiating coverage on Williams-Sonoma with a ""buy"" rating, Nomura analyst Jessica Schoen Mace said the company's ""numerous store formats, strong retail brands and established e-commerce presence (44% of the business) should result in continued market-share growth both in the U.S. and internationally.""
"
630,DG,"This in turn should help Williams-Sonoma exceed its planned mid- to high single-digit revenue growth and low- double-digit to mid-teens EPS growth, Mace added.
"
631,DG,"Real Estate Restoration
"
632,DG,"Restoration Hardware has also been a standout, with a long run of double-digit or better earnings and sales growth. The company is undergoing a real estate transformation that involves scrapping some smaller stores in favor of bigger ones, including Full Line Design Galleries of 25,000 to 60,000 square feet.
"
633,DG,"As part of the transformation, Restoration Hardware is also revamping its supply chain and system platform. These initiatives have helped the company deliver industry-leading same-store sales gains.
"
634,DG,"But times have been tough on the discount front — so tough that even the world's biggest retailer, Wal-Mart, has seen several quarters of declining U.S. same-store sales.
"
635,DG,"Company officials hope a management shakeup will help turn things around. On July 24, Wal-Mart announced that its U.S. CEO, Bill Simon, is stepping down and being succeeded by Greg Foran, president and CEO of Wal-Mart Asia.
"
636,DG,"Wal-Mart's core customer ""has been under pressure since the recovery,"" Perkins said. ""It's being forced to broaden its online effort to bring in more customers, and to expand its (small-format) Neighborhood Market stores to capture some of the business they've been losing to Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Dollar General.""
"
637,DG,"Perkins points out that Simon noted just last month that the middle-to-low-end consumer has not seen much recovery.
"
638,DG,"Deep Discount Powerhouse
"
639,DG,"Meanwhile, Wal-Mart might be facing more competition. Deep discounter Dollar Tree, which sells everything for $1 or less, announced on July 28 that it had agreed to buy struggling Family Dollar in an $8.5 billion deal that would create a new No. 1 player in the deep discount space and create a 13,000-store retail powerhouse.
"
640,DG,"The merger should result in improvements at Family Dollar, says Wedbush analyst Joan Storms. ""It clearly would improve its merchandise assortment. That will lead to increased store productivity and operating margin expansion, which would make it a stronger competitor to the likes of Wal-Mart (smaller format) Express stores.""
"
641,DG,"One thing many agree on is that the bifurcation between the low-end and high-end retail consumer will continue.
"
642,DG,"""It's not because the 'have nots' are getting worse, but because the 'haves' are getting better faster,"" said Joel Bines, managing director at consultancy AlixPartners.
"
643,DG,"This has allowed luxury retailers to increase prices and create an even bigger separation between the two segments, he says. ""This also puts enormous pressure on retailers who cater to the lower-end consumer since they can't grow by raising prices.""The Williams-Sonoma store on Manhattan's Upper East Side drew a nice crowd during its summer clearance sale on the last Wednesday in July.But customers weren't only drawn to the bargains.

"
645,DG,"So said ISI Group analysts in a retail M&A report published on Sunday.

652,DG,"Not so attractive M&A candidates are Staples (SPLS), Office Depot (ODP), Best Buy (BBY) and HH Gregg (HGG), whose toplines are shrinking, he says.
"
653,DG,"The report notes that industry consolidation could help increase productivity and reduce excess capacity. The recent bidding war between Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) for Family Dollar (FDO) ""highlights the potential to rationalize dollar-store capacity,"" the analysts said.
"
654,DG,"For example, they said that dollar stores are saturated in the eastern half of the U.S. and that if Dollar General were to win Family Dollar, then Family Dollar would provide Dollar General with an opportunity to expand into the less saturated western half and create a ""rational duopoly"" with Dollar Tree.
"
655,DG,"The team didn't look at retailers trading above 10 times enterprise value/EBITDA — it would make a high teens return on invested capital tough.

661,DG,"Deep discounter Dollar General took the lead in the quest to draw consumers with low prices, according to a pricing study by Sterne Agee analyst Charles Grom.The study compares prices at Dollar General (DG), deep discounter Family Dollar Stores (FDO), and giant discounter Wal-Mart Stores (WMT).Based on Grom's most recent round of prices checks, Family Dollar's prices fell sequentially vs. his last study in mid-April, while both Wal-Mart and Dollar General's prices were up.Still, Dollar General's basket was priced around 40 basis points lower than the overall baskets at both Family Dollar and Wal-Mart.Grom's ""dollar store"" studies follow Family Dollar's announcement earlier this year that it would be investing $50 million in prices across 1,000 stock-keeping units (SKUs), or items, as part of a move back to everyday low pricing.Relative to the mid-April study, prices rose 0.5% sequentially at Dollar General and 0.3% at Wal-Mart in Grom's latest study.A 2% rise in consumables items prices at Dollar General moved its basket price higher, while the Wal-Mart basket increase came from the food and beverage category.The total basket of 42 SKUs declined 10 basis points at Family Dollar to $149.39, as lower prices in household products and in food and beverages offset rising prices in consumables.Dollar General ""maintains price leadership as (the) gap continues to narrow,"" Grom notes.Even more interesting than the fact that Dollar General's basket price was 40 basis points lower than that of Family Dollar and Wal-Mart, he noted, is how closely all three baskets are priced.In the recent study, Family Dollar's basket at $149.39 was 0.4%, or 64 cents, higher than Dollar General's, compared to last May when the spread between Wal-Mart and Family Dollar was $7.81 or 5.3%.The dollar stores are getting much more competitive in food and beverages, Grom noted. Wal-Mart's prices in this category, which were once as much as 12% lower than the dollar stores, are now just 3.5% lower, he tallied.Prices were down around 2% from June 2013 at the dollar stores and up 2.4% at Wal-Mart. The total basket price fell 1.8% vs. last June at Dollar General and 2.1% at Family Dollar.Family Dollar stock has risen 17% this month, and Dollar General stock has moved up 14%, while Wal-Mart stock has moved down 1% as of late-afternoon trading in the stock market today.

717,DG,"In Tuesday's column, we discussed the 10-week moving average as a gauge of a stock's resilience in a poor market. Support at the 10-week line hints at healthy demand by large investors.This begs the question: What should one do when a stock has tested this moving average numerous times?An examination of true market leaders shows that the 10-week line can act as a sturdy trampoline from which the stock bounces back to new highs, stretching the rally over months or years.However, there comes a time when such a pattern of action becomes unrepeatable.For that reason, IBD's rule is to add shares to an existing position, or initiate a position, in a highly rated stock only on the first or second successful test of the 10-week line after a breakout from a base. Later entry points may still make money, but the risk of losing money also rises, especially when the market grows sour.Consider Dollar General (DG), which has made a respectable run since it returned to the public markets following a multiyear restructuring.Two weeks ago, the stock bolted back above its 10-week line, snapping a three-week losing streak. Volume was unimpressive, though, below its 50-day average and less than the prior week.If an investor had bought shares, he or she would have to sell fast to pinch a small gain or break even.It was the wrong time to buy. The breakout from a lengthy double-bottom base took place in the week ended Sept. 2. Volume shot up to 15.6 million shares, the highest in three months. From there, the stock had found support at the 10-week line at least four times before the latest pullback.See the A1 story in Tuesday's IBD for details on Dollar General's April-quarter results.

768,DG,"Note: The following is an excerpt from this week’sEarnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>Here are the key points:•    Retail sector results show strong growth, but a smaller proportion of retailers are beating EPS and revenue estimates relative to other recent periods.•    With results from 98.5% of the Retail sector’s market cap in the S&P 500 out, earnings and revenue growth is on track to be notably above other historical periods, though positive EPS and revenue surprises are not as numerous as had been the trend in other recent periods.•    For the 493 S&P 500 members that have reported Q1 results already, total earnings are up +24.3% from the same period last year on +8.7% higher revenues, with 76.9% beating EPS estimates and 74.4% beating revenue estimates. The earnings season has ended for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors. •    Except for the proportion of these 493 index members beating EPS and revenue estimates, which are tracking roughly in-line with the preceding quarter’s level, growth in Q1 is notably tracking above historical periods.•    Looking at Q1 as a whole, total earnings are expected to be up +24.2% from the same period last year on +8.6% higher revenues, the highest quarterly earnings growth pace in 7 years. Net Income margins for the quarter are on track to expand by 1.5 percentage points, with the strongest gains in the Finance, Technology and Energy sectors. •    Q1 Earnings growth is in double-digit territory from the year-earlier level for 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors, including the Technology and Finance sectors. The Auto sector has the weakest growth of all 16 sectors, with +0.3% earnings growth on +1.4% higher revenues.•    Energy sector earnings increased +75.7% from the same period last year on +14.2% higher revenues. Excluding the Energy sector, total S&P 500 earnings growth drops from +24.3% to +22.6%.•    For the small-cap S&P 600 index, we now have Q1 results from 94.3% of the index’s total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +25.2% on +9.4% higher revenues, with 55.6% beating EPS estimates and 72.1% beating revenue estimates. In addition to earnings and revenue growth, revenue surprises are notably tracking above historical periods for the small caps.•    For the quarter as whole, total S&P 600 earnings are expected to be up +20.7% on +9% higher revenues. We have more details about small-cap data on page 28 of the full report.•    For full-year 2018, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +19.6% on +5.9% higher revenues. For full-years 2019 and 2020, earnings are expected to be up +9.6% and +9.7%, respectively. Revenues for the index are expected to be increase by +4.5% in each of the two years.•    The implied ‘EPS’ for the index, calculated using current 2018 P/E of 17.4X and index close, as of May 30th, is $156.35. Using the same methodology, the index ‘EPS’ works out to $171.29 for 2019 (P/E of 15.9X) and $187.87 for 2020 (P/E of 14.5X). The multiples for 2018 and 2019 have been calculated using the index’s total market cap and aggregate bottom-up earnings for each year.   Retail Sector ScorecardWith results from Dollar General (DG  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report), and other traditional retailers out now, we have Q1 results from the equivalent of 98.5% of the sector’s market capitalization in the in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Retail sector companies that have reported results are up +21.3% from the same period last year on +9.3% higher revenues, with 69.4% beating EPS estimates and 63.9% beating revenue estimates.The comparison charts below put the sector’s Q1 results in a historical context.Please note that the Zacks Retail sector includes the online vendors and restaurant players in addition to ‘traditional’ brick-and-mortar players.The comparison charts above show that while growth (both earnings as well as revenues) is tracking notably above historical periods, the proportion of positive EPS surprises is in-line with historical periods and revenue surprises are tracking below the 4-quarter average (but above the 12-quarter average).With respect to growth, Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) blockbuster numbers, particularly on the revenues front, has a big role in the very strong growth picture at this stage. Amazon’s Q1 earnings increased +125% on +42.9% higher revenues, with the net dollar increase in the online retailer’s revenues an impressive $15.3 billion.The comparison charts below try to look at the sector’s growth picture with and without the Amazon contribution.The right-hand chart that compares the sector’s Q1 earnings and revenue growth on an ex-Amazon basis shows that growth still compares favorably with other periods even without the online giant’s considerable contribution.Weak Revisions TrendWhile growth in Q1 has been very strong, analysts have been hesitant to raise their estimates for Q2. The fact is that aggregate expectations for the quarter have barely budged since the quarter got underway, as the chart below shows.This revisions trend is in contrast to the very positive trend we saw ahead of the start of the Q1 earnings season. A big part of the positive revisions we saw at the start of the year was directly tied to the impact of tax cuts. But estimates had actually been moving favorably since the second half of 2017 and we expected some of that to show up in estimates for Q2 as well. This didn’t happen, as the above chart shows.There is not much change to estimates for the second half of the year either, as the chart below shows.While estimates for Q2 as a whole haven’t moved much, they haven’t been that static at the sector level, with estimates for 7 of the 16 Zacks sectors going down and estimates for 8 sectors going up. On the negative revisions side, estimates for the Conglomerates, Construction, Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors have been cut.On the positive side, the Energy sector really stands out, but estimates for the Technology and Retail sectors have gone up as well. Excluding the positive revisions to the Energy sector’s Q2 earnings estimates, aggregate estimates for the index would be modestly down since early March.Expectations Beyond Q1The chart below contrasts the Q1 earnings growth rate with what was actually achieved in the last 5 quarters and what is expected in the coming three periods.As you can see, the growth picture remains very strong, even though it is expected to decelerate in the coming quarters from Q1’s lofty level. The worrying part isn’t the seeming deceleration, but the underwhelming revisions trend for Q2 and beyond. This lack of positive revisions coupled with ongoing strength in the U.S. dollar and questions about the global economy likely provide sufficient grounds for the market’s less-than-enthusiastic reaction to Q1 results.Note: Sheraz Mian manages the Zacks equity research department.

You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>Here are the key points:•    Retail sector results show strong growth, but a smaller proportion of retailers are beating EPS and revenue estimates relative to other recent periods.•    With results from 98.5% of the Retail sector’s market cap in the S&P 500 out, earnings and revenue growth is on track to be notably above other historical periods, though positive EPS and revenue surprises are not as numerous as had been the trend in other recent periods.•    For the 493 S&P 500 members that have reported Q1 results already, total earnings are up +24.3% from the same period last year on +8.7% higher revenues, with 76.9% beating EPS estimates and 74.4% beating revenue estimates. The earnings season has ended for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors. •    Except for the proportion of these 493 index members beating EPS and revenue estimates, which are tracking roughly in-line with the preceding quarter’s level, growth in Q1 is notably tracking above historical periods.•    Looking at Q1 as a whole, total earnings are expected to be up +24.2% from the same period last year on +8.6% higher revenues, the highest quarterly earnings growth pace in 7 years. Net Income margins for the quarter are on track to expand by 1.5 percentage points, with the strongest gains in the Finance, Technology and Energy sectors. •    Q1 Earnings growth is in double-digit territory from the year-earlier level for 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors, including the Technology and Finance sectors. The Auto sector has the weakest growth of all 16 sectors, with +0.3% earnings growth on +1.4% higher revenues.•    Energy sector earnings increased +75.7% from the same period last year on +14.2% higher revenues. Excluding the Energy sector, total S&P 500 earnings growth drops from +24.3% to +22.6%.•    For the small-cap S&P 600 index, we now have Q1 results from 94.3% of the index’s total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +25.2% on +9.4% higher revenues, with 55.6% beating EPS estimates and 72.1% beating revenue estimates. In addition to earnings and revenue growth, revenue surprises are notably tracking above historical periods for the small caps.•    For the quarter as whole, total S&P 600 earnings are expected to be up +20.7% on +9% higher revenues. We have more details about small-cap data on page 28 of the full report.•    For full-year 2018, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +19.6% on +5.9% higher revenues. For full-years 2019 and 2020, earnings are expected to be up +9.6% and +9.7%, respectively. Revenues for the index are expected to be increase by +4.5% in each of the two years.•    The implied ‘EPS’ for the index, calculated using current 2018 P/E of 17.4X and index close, as of May 30th, is $156.35. Using the same methodology, the index ‘EPS’ works out to $171.29 for 2019 (P/E of 15.9X) and $187.87 for 2020 (P/E of 14.5X). The multiples for 2018 and 2019 have been calculated using the index’s total market cap and aggregate bottom-up earnings for each year.   Retail Sector ScorecardWith results from Dollar General (DG  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report), and other traditional retailers out now, we have Q1 results from the equivalent of 98.5% of the sector’s market capitalization in the in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Retail sector companies that have reported results are up +21.3% from the same period last year on +9.3% higher revenues, with 69.4% beating EPS estimates and 63.9% beating revenue estimates.The comparison charts below put the sector’s Q1 results in a historical context.Please note that the Zacks Retail sector includes the online vendors and restaurant players in addition to ‘traditional’ brick-and-mortar players.The comparison charts above show that while growth (both earnings as well as revenues) is tracking notably above historical periods, the proportion of positive EPS surprises is in-line with historical periods and revenue surprises are tracking below the 4-quarter average (but above the 12-quarter average).With respect to growth, Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) blockbuster numbers, particularly on the revenues front, has a big role in the very strong growth picture at this stage. Amazon’s Q1 earnings increased +125% on +42.9% higher revenues, with the net dollar increase in the online retailer’s revenues an impressive $15.3 billion.The comparison charts below try to look at the sector’s growth picture with and without the Amazon contribution.The right-hand chart that compares the sector’s Q1 earnings and revenue growth on an ex-Amazon basis shows that growth still compares favorably with other periods even without the online giant’s considerable contribution.Weak Revisions TrendWhile growth in Q1 has been very strong, analysts have been hesitant to raise their estimates for Q2. The fact is that aggregate expectations for the quarter have barely budged since the quarter got underway, as the chart below shows.This revisions trend is in contrast to the very positive trend we saw ahead of the start of the Q1 earnings season. A big part of the positive revisions we saw at the start of the year was directly tied to the impact of tax cuts. But estimates had actually been moving favorably since the second half of 2017 and we expected some of that to show up in estimates for Q2 as well. This didn’t happen, as the above chart shows.There is not much change to estimates for the second half of the year either, as the chart below shows.While estimates for Q2 as a whole haven’t moved much, they haven’t been that static at the sector level, with estimates for 7 of the 16 Zacks sectors going down and estimates for 8 sectors going up. On the negative revisions side, estimates for the Conglomerates, Construction, Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors have been cut.On the positive side, the Energy sector really stands out, but estimates for the Technology and Retail sectors have gone up as well. Excluding the positive revisions to the Energy sector’s Q2 earnings estimates, aggregate estimates for the index would be modestly down since early March.Expectations Beyond Q1The chart below contrasts the Q1 earnings growth rate with what was actually achieved in the last 5 quarters and what is expected in the coming three periods.As you can see, the growth picture remains very strong, even though it is expected to decelerate in the coming quarters from Q1’s lofty level. The worrying part isn’t the seeming deceleration, but the underwhelming revisions trend for Q2 and beyond. This lack of positive revisions coupled with ongoing strength in the U.S. dollar and questions about the global economy likely provide sufficient grounds for the market’s less-than-enthusiastic reaction to Q1 results.Note: Sheraz Mian manages the Zacks equity research department.

770,DG,"Dollar General (DG  -  Free Report) and Dollar Tree (DLTR  -  Free Report) are two of the largest discount stores in the country, and for many investors, hard to distinguish in terms of business structure and expectations. With both companies releasing their earning reports tomorrow, here is what investors need to know in order to stay ahead of the curve.Comparative MetricsDollar General and Dollar Tree are sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), respectively. Dollar General stock is currently priced at $95.54 per share, while Dollar Tree is priced at $94.76 per share. Both stocks have seen slight losses of no more than 1% on the month.While broader share price movement has been nearly symbiotic, trading on the day seems to speak otherwise. Dollar Tree’s price is currently level with its close yesterday, while Dollar General is down nearly 1% in early trading today, perhaps speaking to investor sentiment.ForecastWhile the two companies seem homogenous, looking at our Zacks Consensus Estimates, it is easy to see some key differential statistics.Current quarter consensus revenue and earnings estimates for Dollar General stand at $6.2 billion (+10.3% year-over-year growth) and $1.40 per share (+35.9%). Dollar Tree’s estimates are substantially less in terms of growth, with revenue estimates at $5.6 billion (+5.4%) and earnings estimates of $1.23 per share (+25.5%).Earnings estimates have trended slightly upwards for Dollar General, moving from $1.39 to $1.40 per share over the course of the past two months. In the same time frame, Dollar Tree’s EPS estimates have dropped from $1.24 to $1.23 per share.Bottom LineWhile Dollar Tree has not seen negative share price movement on the day thus far, its lower Zacks Rank and diminished revenue and earnings estimates combine to provide potentially better prospects for Dollar General heading into the release of their earnings reports.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

771,DG,"The grocery war is heating up with tech giants fast trying to invade the space. Reportedly, Microsoft, Inc. (MSFT  -  Free Report) is working on a technology that will eliminate the role of a cashier in a store. And if reports are to be believed, the tech giant is already in talks with retailers, including Walmart, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report). Understandably, the technology is being developed in a move to compete with Amazon.com, Inc.’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Amazon Go, the e-commerce giant’s cashier-less store.That said, an increasing number of retailers and grocers are focusing on customer convenience. From speeding up delivery to introducing digital shopping scanners and coming up with cashier-less stores, retailers are aggressively pumping in more money to develop new technologies and adding muscle to their delivery arm to stay ahead in the race.Microsoft Challenges AmazonMicrosoft is reportedly developing a technology wherein a cashier would no longer be required in a brick-and-mortar store. The tech giant is working on a system, which will be able to track what a customer puts in his or her cart in a brick-and mortar store. In fact, Microsoft reportedly has already demonstrated the sample to select retailers.Interestingly, the new technology could revamp the company’s previous failed attempt of check-out free shopping. Moreover, Microsoft plans not to introduce this technology in its stores first. Instead, it is reportedly in talks with Walmart. Understandably, the new technology is in a move to challenge Amazon Go, the e-commerce giant’s cashier-less store. Amazon, over the last few years, has changed the entire retail ballgame that has made brick-and-mortar stores like Walmart, Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report), The Kroger Co (KR  -  Free Report), Dollar Tree, Inc. (DLTR  -  Free Report) and Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) shift focus to online.However, Microsoft’s aim is to develop a cost-effective retail tech system that will not only eliminate the role of a cashier but also will help in cutting down the cost of thousands of cameras installed on the ceilings of brick-and-mortar store.Others Join the RaceIn January 2018, Amazon opened the first Amazon Go store in Seattle. The 1,800-square-foot automated store has replaced cashiers with a smartphone app and hundreds of small cameras that tracks customers’ purchases. This certainly was a revolutionary move by Amazon and a direct challenge to brick-and-mortar giants.However, brick-and-mortar giants too have been increasingly focusing on online sales and using technology to stay abreast in the race. Walmart, Amazon’s biggest rival, already has its Scan and Go technology that allows customers to shop at its stores without interacting with a cashier.In fact, earlier this year, Walmart announced that it will be expanding its Scan and Go technology to an additional 100 stores. Amazon sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Moreover, immediately after the launch of Amazon Go, Kroger announced that it will expand its Scan, Bag, Go technology to new divisions. The technology helps customers to visit a store self-checkout area for payment. Apart from expanding its Scan, Bag, Go technology to 400 stores by the end of this year, Kroger is also working on a new technology wherein customers can skip checkout and directly pay through an app.Understandably, everyone is trying to build a loyal clientele by playing on the customer- convenience quotient. Amazon too is planning to open more Amazon Go stores by the end of this year, thus heating up the retail race.Bottom LineTechnology undoubtedly has changed the entire retail game in the last few years, with the gap between online and offline fast disappearing. Microsoft’s new technology certainly will make things easier for retailers and intensify competition.Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

772,DG,"Brown-Forman Corporation (BF.B  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jun 6, before the market opens. In the last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 7.3%. The company’s third-quarter fiscal 2018 results marked its third straight earnings and sales beat. It also marked the company’s sixth straight quarter of growth in underlying sales.This leading producer and distributor of premium alcoholic beverages delivered a positive earnings surprise of 9.3% in the trailing four quarters.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Brown-Forman will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 22 cents per share, reflecting a decline of 26.7% from the year-ago quarter. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter has been trending down in the last 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues of $747.7 million, up nearly 7.7% from the year-ago quarter.Brown-Forman Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Brown-Forman Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Brown-Forman Corporation QuoteMoreover, we note that the stock has outperformed the industry in the last three months. The company’s shares have moved up 2.4% while the industry declined 7.5%.Factors at PlayBrown-Forman’s strong performance can be attributed to its strong brand portfolio, efforts to expand globally, strategic initiatives and a robust outlook. The company is also gaining from solid growth in underlying sales, improved margins, continued momentum at its focus categories and strength in Jack Daniels brand. Further, management remains optimistic about its premium American whiskey and tequila brands.Brown-Forman remains confident of consistent growth in fiscal 2018 and updated its earnings guidance to account for new tax reforms. Management believes that it is on track to deliver high-quality, top-tier results in fiscal 2018. The company reiterated its underlying sales growth of 6-7% for the fiscal. It now envisions adjusted earnings per share of $1.56-$1.61, reflecting mid-teens growth year over year.Moreover, we expect the company’s continued focus on pricing, product innovation and expanding operations in emerging markets to boost its operational performance, and strengthen its market position. Brown-Forman anticipates witnessing growth on the back of strong worldwide demand for its authentic American whiskey brands, consumer interest in flavored whiskey and a rising trend in premium spirits.However, the company anticipates a volatile global economic situation, mainly in emerging markets, and intense competition in developed economies to hinder results.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively show that Brown-Forman is going to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Brown-Forman has an Earnings ESP of -3.01%. Although the company has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about earnings surprise.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies that you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:United Natural Foods Inc. (UNFI  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.73% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Ulta Beauty, Inc.

773,DG,"We believe that Dollar General Corporation’s (DG  -  Free Report) commitment toward price management, cost containment, private label offering, effective inventory management, merchandise and operational initiatives should drive sales and margins. Evidently, Dollar General’s comparable-store sales growth story is impressive. However, higher SG&A costs are a threat to margins.We note that fiscal 2017 was the 28th consecutive year of comparable-store sales growth for the company. Through 2017, comps increased 0.7%, 2.6%, 4.3% and 3.3% in the four quarters respectively. Markedly, the solid trend was maintained in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, wherein comps grew 2.1% on higher average transaction.Moreover, in order to increase traffic, Dollar General is focusing on both consumables and discretionary categories. In fact, the rollout of tobacco has been a key factor driving traffic. In addition, the company is expanding its cooler facilities to enhance the sale of perishable items and is rolling out the DG digital coupon program as well. Sales at the consumables division continued to improve, driving comps and market share in first-quarter fiscal 2018. Well, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is trying to expand its store base continuously to drive customer count. The company anticipates to open 900 stores, remodel 1,000 and relocate approximately 100 in fiscal 2018. Moreover, Dollar General is focusing on smaller format stores as these require less capital expenditure and will help to cope with space constraint.All said, the company’s robust comps history along with its efforts to expand by opening new stores have instilled confidence in investors. Although Dollar General’s shares that have rallied 2.4% in the past month, underperforming the industry’s gain of 4.5%, we believe these efforts will help the stock rebound.On the flip side, the company is incurring higher SG&A expenses to attract customers and counter competition. During the first quarter, Dollar General’s SG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales, rose 60 basis points (bps) to 22.4%, which also impacted operating margin.The rise in SG&A expense rate was because of elevated retail labor, occupancy and utility costs. Also, increased property taxes on lease stores led to the increase. Management stated that a major chunk of the SG&A rate deleverage was a result of accelerated store investments and increased utility costs.As Dollar General is committed toward investing in store expansion, cost hurdles associated with the same are a threat to margins. Apart from this, the company is facing higher freight and fuel cost-related challenges, which are expected to alleviate over time.Check These Hot PicksUrban Outfitters (URBN  -  Free Report) delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 19.8% in the trailing four quarters.

774,DG,"Big Lots, Inc. (BIG  -  Free Report), which recently disappointed with dismal first-quarter fiscal 2018 results, seems to be making efforts to regain investors’ confidence. To this end, the company unveiled an accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) contract, which sent its shares up by 1.1% during yesterday’s after-market trading session.Per the agreement, Big Lots will buy back common shares worth roughly $100 million from Goldman Sachs in a privately negotiated ASR transaction. While Big Lots will pay the purchase price of $100 million to Goldman Sachs by June 7, 2018, the latter will make an initial delivery of nearly 2.0 million shares to Big Lots. The total number of shares repurchased by Big Lots under the ASR deal will depend on the “Repurchase Price.”The transaction, which will be funded by Big Lots through cash in hand along with available borrowings, is anticipated to conclude during the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Further, the completion of this buyback program will mark the end of Big Lots’ 2018 Share Repurchase Program that was authorized on Mar 7, 2018. Well, the ASR program speaks of Big Lots’ solid free cash flow and balance sheet status alongside reflecting its commitment to shareholders.In fact, the company’s healthy financial status has helped it make shareholder-friendly moves like dividend payments and share buybacks for quite some time now. Evidently, the company returned $195 million and $288 million to shareholders in the form of share repurchase and dividends in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively. In fiscal 2015, Big Lots returned $239 million to shareholders under its share repurchase program.Apart from Big Lots, retailers like Dollar General (DG  -  Free Report), Ross Stores (ROST  -  Free Report) and Dillard’s (DDS  -  Free Report) among others are also known for their robust shareholder-friendly moves.Coming back to Big Lots, although the news offered some respite to investors, it may take some time for this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock to revive from the darkness caused by its first-quarter fiscal 2018 show. Incidentally, Big Lots’ earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate after nine straight quarters of beat. Further, it lagged sales estimates for the third straight quarter. Moreover, comparable store sales and margins remained soft, while the guidance for fiscal 2018 was also discouraging.Consequently, Big Lots lost 3.3% since the drab outcome, while it plunged close to 27% in the past three months, against the industry’s 7.3% upside.

775,DG,"After delivering negative earnings surprise for two consecutive quarters, Kirkland's, Inc. (KIRK  -  Free Report) surprised investors with first-quarter fiscal 2018 results. Both top and bottom lines improved year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, courtesy of robust sales-driving efforts and efficient cost management. Markedly, shares of the company gained 16.2% on the solid outcome.Quarter in DetailKirkland's, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Kirkland's, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Kirkland's, Inc. QuoteThis Brentwood, TN-based company posted adjusted breakeven earnings for the first quarter, which fared better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate as well as the year-ago period loss of 9 cents.Kirkland’s net sales for the 13-week period ended May 5, 2018, came in at $142.5 million, reflecting a 7.2% rise from $132.8 million recorded in the 13-week period ended Apr 29, 2017. Also, net sales came ahead of the consensus mark of $140 million. Comparable store sales (including e-commerce) rose 1.4% in the first quarter, better than 3.8% drop witnessed in the same period a year ago.  Comps were backed by solid e-commerce sales that surged 39%. Also, greater average ticket and increased conversions at Kirkland’s brick and mortar stores more than offset reduced traffic, thereby aiding comps growth.Notably, e-commerce sales jumped to $17.3 million year over year and represented about 12% of Kirkland’s total revenue. This was backed by robust improvements in website traffic and conversion. Further, sales from third-party drop-ship strategy provided an impetus to e-commerce revenues. Clearly, the company’s constant focus on enhancing omni-channel business and online product range is reaping results.In fact, these efforts have helped this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock rally about 41.1% in a year, outpacing the industry’s growth of 7.2%. Costs & MarginsThe home decor retailer’s gross profit increased 5.8% year over year to $45.3 million. However, gross margin (including depreciation of store and distribution center facilities) contracted 50 basis points to 31.8%.Nonetheless, merchandise margins rose 35 bps to 56%, driven by continued gains from increased IMU and prudent promotions, somewhat negated by elevated inbound freight costs. Outbound freight costs (including e-commerce shipping) grew 65 bps as a percentage of sales, mainly due to greater e-commerce penetration.Additionally, the company incurred greater store occupancy expenses, which rose 15 bps as a percentage of sales. Also, central distribution expenses escalated 5 bps.Operating costs improved 110 bps to 31.7% of sales, on the back of e-commerce expense leverage. Adjusted EBITDA increased $2.4 million year over year to $6.5 million in the first quarter.Store UpdatesDuring the first quarter, Kirkland’s introduced 10 stores and shuttered three down, taking the total count to 425 stores at the end of the quarter.Management intends to open 10-15 new stores in fiscal 2018, with nearly half in the second and third quarters each.Other Financial DetailsKirkland's exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $58.2 million and no long-term debt or borrowings. Further, net shareholders' equity as of May 5, 2018 came in at $137.4 million.During the quarter, Kirkland used cash flow from operating activities of approximately $8 million. Capital expenditures during the quarter amounted to $11.1 million. Also, Kirkland’s bought back 316,000 shares at an average price of $9.42 million during the first quarter and has buybacks worth less than $6 million remaining under its current program.For fiscal 2018, the company anticipates capital expenditures to be in line with the year-ago period, including investments in e-commerce and supply-chain enhancements.Fiscal 2018 GuidanceManagement remains impressed with its first-quarter performance, which was driven by e-commerce growth, improved product margins, disciplined cost management and efforts to improve customer experience. Going forward, Kirkland’s remains on track to solidify its e-commerce operations. The company intends to extend its vendor direct shopping, enrich assortments and improve mobile experience.   All said, management reiterated its guidance for fiscal 2018 and envisions earnings per share to come in a band of 50 cents to 60 cents, which includes costs related to CEO transition. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 49 cents for fiscal 2018 is pegged slightly lower and is likely to witness upward revisions.Also, management stated that it expects each quarter (other than the second quarter) in the fiscal to deliver year-over-year bottom-line growth. The second quarter earnings growth is likely to be impacted by a one-time adjustment that boosted results in the year-ago period. Excluding this, second quarter earnings is anticipated to be nearly in line with the year-ago period.Looking for More Promising Stocks?

Notably, the company redesigned and leveraged the rollout of new information systems to improve online purchase and planning execution. Additionally, third-party drop shipping is providing customers a wider assortment of product offerings. These efforts have been yielding significant results, evident from the strong e-commerce momentum witnessed of late. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, e-commerce sales surged 30% year over year and represented about 10% of Kirkland’s top line. In the near term, the company is expected to continue expanding its third-party partnerships, improve ‘buy online pick up in store’ capability and refine fulfillment processes to boost the profits from the Ship to Home business.Kirkland's also undertakes frequent store openings to support top-line growth. In this respect, the company resorts to the strategy of opening stores at popular locations, while shuttering smaller underperforming stores.Going ahead, management is committed toward making several experiments to attract more customers — online and in stores. That said, Kirkland’s anticipates net sales in fiscal 2018 to advance 3-5%, owing to increased store count and contributions from e-commerce sales. Also, the guidance is based on comps growth of 1-2%. Well, such positive top-line view for the fiscal combined with the company’s constant efforts to bolster sales raises the possibility of the company to deliver solid performance in the impending quarter. Incidentally, analysts polled by Zacks project sales to rise almost 5.4% during first-quarter 2018 to reach $140.1 million.Kirkland's, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Kirkland's, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Kirkland's, Inc. Quote Unimpressive Bottom-Line PictureWhile the sales picture looks positive for Kirkland’s, we are somewhat cautious about its bottom-line performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Higher promotional spending, stemming from consumers’ accelerated changes in shopping patterns has been weighing on Kirkland’s bottom line, as witnessed during the latter half of the fourth quarter. Apart from this, higher store occupancy costs and outbound freight costs have marred profits. These factors led to a surge of 60 basis points (bps) in operating costs during the fourth quarter, while operating margin contracted 190 bps.Needless to say, higher operating expenses are a considerable threat to Kirkland’s profitability. We note that the company has delivered negative bottom-line surprise in three out of the past four quarters. The bottom line has portrayed an unimpressive run in the past eight consecutive quarters. In fact, the company reported a loss in five of them. To top it, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is currently pegged at a loss of 9 cents, remaining flat with the prior-year quarter’s loss figure. This estimate has been stable over the last 30 days.Wrapping it up, while Kirkland’s initiatives to improve sales are encouraging, it is yet to be seen if such growth plans can offset lingering challenges pertaining to rising operating expenses. That said, lets take a look at what the Zacks Model reveals about Kirkland’s upcoming quarterly release.Zacks ModelOur proven model does not show that Kirkland’s is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

778,DG,"Dollar General Corporation’s (DG  -  Free Report) solid prospects, brand recognition and earnings outlook bode well for the stock. The company’s commitment toward better pricing, private label offering, effective inventory management, and merchandise and operational initiatives should drive sales and margins. These along with a compelling store growth story at convenient locations and focus on consumable products provide the company an edge over competitors.Increased focus on the consumables category, a significant contributor to sales, is likely to help drive traffic and comparable-store sales improvement by endorsing itself as a one-stop shopping destination for necessary items. Increased set-up of cooler facilities to boost the sale of perishable items is likely to drive trips and basket size. The digital coupon program and DG Go app will also in all probability increase conversion rate.Dollar General’s comparable-store sales growth story is remarkable. Fiscal 2017 marked the 28th consecutive year of comparable-store sales growth for the company. The trend was maintained in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, with comps rising 2.1% on increased transactions. Consumables provided a major boost.Dollar General Corporation Price and Consensus Dollar General Corporation Price and Consensus | Dollar General Corporation QuoteManagement anticipates net sales for fiscal 2018 to increase by 9% year on year. Further, earnings for the fiscal are envisioned in the range of $5.95-$6.15 per share, up from $4.49 in fiscal 2017.The company has adopted a disciplined approach to store openings, expansion and refurbishment. It plans to open 900 stores, remodel 1,000 and relocate approximately 100 in fiscal 2018. Of the planned remodels, roughly 400 locations are likely to be upgraded to Dollar General Traditional Plus format with a higher cooler count. This is likely to lift comparable sales by 10-15%. Moreover, the company is focusing on smaller format stores that require less capital expenditure and help cope with space constraint.As Dollar General is committed toward ramping up investments in store expansion, cost hurdles associated with the same is a threat to margins. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales, have been on the rise due to elevated retail labor, occupancy and utility costs. During the first quarter, Dollar General’s SG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales, rose 60 basis points to 22.4%, which also impacted operating margin.We note that shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have surged 42% in a year, almost in line with the industry.3 Picks You Can’t MissUrban Outfitters (URBN  -  Free Report) delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 19.8% in the trailing four quarters.

In the quarter under review, earnings came in at $1.36 per share falling short of the consensus mark of $1.40.

Contribution from new outlets favorably impacted the top line.Moreover, Dollar General’s comparable-store sales increased 2.1% year over year, primarily owing to a rise in average transaction, which marginally overshadowed decrease in customer traffic.

780,DG,"If you’re looking for a profitable portfolio of stocks that will offer the best of value and growth investing, try the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy. It helps an investor gain exposure to stocks that are undervalued and have impressive growth prospects. Unlike a blend strategy, a portfolio that uses GARP investing is expected to include stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing.GARP Metrics – Mix of Growth & Value MetricsThe GARP approach helps to zero in on stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main aspects that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is also a tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics – price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is another value metric that is considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Last 5-year EPS & projected 3–5 year EPS growth rates between 10% and 20% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)ROE (over the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)P/E and P/B ratios less than M-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicates that the stocks are undervalued.)These few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only seven.Here are five of the seven stocks that made it through the screen:Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) is a health care company. It provides medical products through its subsidiaries. The company delivered an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 7.2%.

On Nasdaq, a 2.58-to-1 ratio favored Declining issues.How did the Benchmark Perform?The Dow shed 196.1 points, posting its eighth straight day of decline, matching its longest losing streak since Mar 2017. The S&P 500 lost 17.56 points, its biggest single-day decline since May 29.

This saw stocks tumbling, which continued on Thursday, as investors panicked leading to huge selloffs.Supreme Court Makes it Difficult for Online RetailersOn Thursday, the Supreme Court in a ruling said that states could collect sales tax from online retailers, who do not have physical presence in their states. Till the ruling, retailers were required to collect sales tax only if they had a physical presence in a state. This gave e-commerce companies the advantage of not collecting sales tax thus making the product cheaper. This resulted in states making huge losses in revenues.The new ruling now enables states to force online retailers to pay sales tax. This saw shares of online retailers like Amazon, E-Bay and Etsy, Inc.

782,DG,"The earnings season, which is nearing its end, has been quite impressive this time around. However, the show is not over yet. With several retail behemoths including Walmart, Macy’s and Target, queued up to report their quarterly numbers, investors are likely to keep their eyes on the Retail-Wholesale sector's progress card.We note that the sector has gained 4.7% in a month, outdoing the S&P 500’s 2.1% growth. This can be attributable to a number of micro and macro factors, which have been viewed as positive signals for retailers’ upcoming results.Retail on Growth Trajectory: Here’s WhyThe recent uptick in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity, bodes well. Incidentally, consumer spending inched up 0.4% in March, following 0.2% growth in January while remaining flat in February. This renewed momentum in March emerged from continued rise in income, indicating that consumers may drive economic growth in 2018. In fact, March retail sales advanced 0.6%, bearing testimony to this.  Apart from this, the sector is poised to gain from massive tax cuts and a robust labor market. Notably, the unemployment level that remained stable at 4.1% for six months till March, declined even further to 3.9% in April.Turning to micro factors, companies in this space are also expected to gain from aggressive omni-channel efforts to keep pace with the changing consumer shopping patterns. To this end, retail players’ solid e-commerce endeavors, compelling pricing strategy, promotional activities, and efforts to strengthen portfolio and enhancing stores experience remain major drivers.Surely, these strategic investments are eating a portion of margins but retailers are playing smart by undertaking stringent cost-cutting and restructuring activities.Notably, total earnings of the S&P 500 retailers that have already reported results increased 26.1%, on the back of 14.9% jump in revenues, per the latest Earnings Preview. Well, about half of the retailers in the S&P 500 index released their quarterly outcomes, with 68.4% topping bottom-line estimates and 63.2% delivering positive revenue surprise.Given the favorable backdrop, the sector is likely to catch investors’ attention. So, picking stocks that are likely to trump estimates can fetch handsome returns. This is because a stock generally picks up steam on earnings beat.Picking the Prospective Winners for the SeasonThat said, let’s take a look at some gems in this space that look promising on the earnings front. These stocks carry a favorable Zacks Rank – Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP.  Well, our research shows that chances of a positive earnings surprise of stocks with this combination is as high as 70%.

784,DG,"The Supreme Court on Jun 21 ruled that states have the right to collect sales tax from online purchases even if a company doesn’t have any physical presence in that state. This certainly is a game-changing decision given that businesses, primarily online retailers, so long were not bound to collect sales tax in states where they do not operate physically.The Supreme Court ruling has been cheered by brick-and-mortar stores, which have been struggling to survive the e-commerce onslaught. That said, many online retailers are already collecting sales tax on their products in different states. Given this scenario, it needs to be seen, how big a pinch e-commerce companies would feel now.Online Retail Hits RoadblockThe Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that states can collect sales tax on online purchases, overturning a 1992 decision that traditional retailers so long complained was putting them at disadvantageous position compared with online competitors. Although retailers with a physical presence were required to collect sales tax, it wasn’t binding on online retailers and upstarts, which would often skip it, thus making their products look cheaper.The latest ruling definitely will bring relief for brick-and-mortar stores, which are striving to compete with e-commerce companies. The new ruling saw shares of traditional retailers jump immediately. Shares of Walmart, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) and Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) increased 0.7% each, while Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) jumped 1%.On the other hand and quite predictably, shares of online retailers like Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), eBay, Inc. (EBAY  -  Free Report) and Etsy, Inc. (ETSY  -  Free Report) slid 1.1%, 3.2% and 0.6%, respectively. Amazon has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Amazon is Still SafeAmazon took advantage of the law for years and refrained from collecting sales tax on its book sales and then other products for years. This made the company’s products look cheaper and was one of the key factors behind turning the fortunes of the company, which is now an e-commerce behemoth.However, Amazon started collecting sales tax in all states since Apr 2017. Hence, it might not pinch the company much. That said, more than 50% of Amazon’s sales are from third party marketplace sellers, who often don’t collect sales tax. This is one area which might hurt Amazon, as with sales tax, the price of the products is likely to increase.Other Online Retailers to Feel the HeatAmazon may have started collecting sales tax but it’s the other small and medium-size online retailers that have been pushed to an uncomfortable corner with the new ruling. Companies like eBay, Etsy and Wayfair Inc. (W  -  Free Report) will now need to collect sales tax on the products they sell, which they so long had been avoiding.Online furniture company, Wayfair, saw its shares fall 1.6% immediately after the ruling was passed. Online home furnishing and products retailer Overstock, Inc. (OSTK  -  Free Report) saw its shares plummeting as much as 7.2%, while Shopify Inc. (SHOP  -  Free Report) declined 4.5%. Understandably, the new ruling is likely to affect small and medium sized online retailers more, particularly those with no physical presence at all, as they had so long been giving stiff competition to brick-and-mortar stores by charging less for their products.Level-Playing Ground for Traditional Retailers  Brick-and-mortar stores have been long ruing that an absence of sales tax on online sales put them at a disadvantage. However, the new ruling will definitely give them a level playing ground. Moreover, traditional retailers like Walmart, Target and The Kroger Company (KR  -  Free Report) that are increasingly shifting focus toward online, collect sales tax for products sold online.However, much like Amazon, they too don’t collect sales tax on goods sold by third parties on their platform. That said, online sales still make for a very small portion of the revenues for most traditional retailers. Walmart gets generates only 3% of its revenues online in the United States.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?

785,DG,"It is again that time when the earnings outcome of companies grabs all the attention. Analyst opinion, at this time, is usually centered on whether a company delivers an earnings beat or a miss. The first-quarter 2018 reporting cycle has almost crossed the half-way mark, with a robust picture of all-round strength. With solid earnings and sales growth so far, this season is likely to record the highest growth in seven years.Among all the sectors, our focus here will be on Retail-Wholesale, which is presumed to be invariably in business. While the majority of the players generally report earnings in the last leg of the reporting cycle, we note that there is significant momentum in these stocks due to a favorable economic backdrop. The sector is gaining from favorable economic data, including steady rise in wages, stable labor market and improved consumer spending.Consequently, the sector has gained 5.1% in the past month, outpacing the S&P 500’s growth of 1.3%.Consumer spending, which accounts for 70% of the economic activity, rose 0.4% in March, following 0.2% growth in January and remaining flat in February. This renewed momentum in March emerged from continued rise in incomes, indicating that consumers may drive economic growth in 2018.The well-being of consumers is usually linked to the prosperity of retailers as this segment attracts a large sum of total spending. We believe that the increased spending in March will somewhere reflect in earnings of retailers, who will report first-quarter outcomes very soon.As per National Retail Federation (NRF), total retail sales increased 5% year over year in March and 0.3% from February. This included a 7.6% increase in online and other non-store retail sales. Moreover, NRF continues to project retail sales growth of 3.8-4.4% for 2018.A close look at the sector reveals that retailers are reaping the benefit of increased investments in digital commerce, as evident from significant growth in e-commerce sales. Digital sales have been the key contributing factor in the top-line growth of most retailers. Additionally, this has led to a revival in the comparable store sales (comps) trend of the sector on the whole.However, the sector is grappling with soft margins due to higher investments to enhance presence and increased operating costs. Increased promotional activities, higher spending toward online portal and lower traffic at stores are some other issues, denting retailers’ margins. While retailers are resorting to strict cost-cutting measures to lift margins, a turnaround on this front may take time.Q1 Earnings ScorecardLooking at the earnings scorecard of the overall S&P 500 Index so far, about 267 S&P 500 members released first-quarter earnings results. Total earnings for these companies are up 25.1%, on 10% revenue growth. Further, about 76.8% delivered positive earnings surprises and 73.8% beat revenue estimates. The blended beat ratio (companies beating both earnings and revenues) so far has been 61.4%.Key takeaways from results so far point to clear momentum both for revenues and earnings growth. Further, the quarter has witnessed an above-average proportion of positive earnings surprises while revenue surprises are tracking below that of the preceding earnings season.Coming to expectations, total first-quarter earnings for the S&P 500 are expected to increase 22.6% year over year on 8.4% rise in revenues. This follows 13.4% earnings growth and 8.6% revenue increase in the fourth quarter of 2017.For the retail sector, earnings in the first quarter are expected to improve 17.8%, with 7.8% revenue growth.The real picture of the trend so far is visible from our latest Earnings Preview report, published on Apr 27.That said, we bring to you five stocks from the Retail-Wholesale sector that may show promise based on their favorable Zacks Rank – Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – and a positive Earnings ESP.

786,DG,"Brushing off market gyrations, market pundits are of the opinion that the economy is not in a bad shape after all. The Fed’s optimistic view also highlights the same. The Fed Chairperson envisions economic growth of 2.7% in 2018, up from the previous forecast of 2.5%. Jerome Powell expects a drop in unemployment rate from the current level of 4.1% to 3.8% in 2018 and further to 3.6% in 2019. All these paint a bright picture for retailers.Industry experts believe that the strengthening labor market may lead to gradual wage acceleration and in turn boost consumer confidence. We expect this positive sentiment to translate into higher consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Moreover, individual tax cuts have paved the way for higher disposable income, which is likely to drive demand for discretionary items.This brings the focus back to the Retail-Wholesale sector. We are cautiously optimistic about the sector’s overall performance. Heightened online competition, lower footfall and changing consumer spending patterns have compelled retailers to re-examine their strategies. They are now focusing more on enhancing omni-channel capabilities, optimizing store fleet and restructuring activities.Out of the numerous industries in the sector, we are focusing on the retail-discount industry. We note that the industry, which occupies the top 46% (119 out of the 256) position, has rallied approximately 14.3% in the past six months compared with the S&P 500’s 6%.Here we have picked three discount retailers that are trading higher than the industry.Burlington Stores (BURL  -  Free Report) has made multiple changes to its business model to adapt to the ongoing transformation in the sector. Notably, it has increased vendor counts, made technological advancements and initiated a better marketing approach. These along with effective inventory management and cost containment efforts have helped boost the gross margin. Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have surged 39% in the past six months. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Dollar General’s (DG  -  Free Report) commitment toward better price management, cost containment, private label offering, effective inventory management, merchandise and operational initiatives should drive sales and margins. In addition, the company is expanding its cooler facilities to enhance the sale of perishable items and is also rolling out a DG digital coupon program. Dollar General’s impressive comparable-store sales also support its growth story. This Zacks Rank #2 stock has rallied 15.8% in six months’ time.Ross Stores’ (ROST  -  Free Report) commitment toward better price management, merchandise, cost containment and store expansion plan have been aiding its quarterly performance. The company’s proven off-price business model along with competitive bargains continues to make its stores an attractive destination for customers. Additionally, the company has been committed toward improving merchandise assortments in the ladies’ apparel business in order to boost the top line. These factors collectively underscore the company’s solid potential. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 19.3% in the said period.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over.

787,DG,"The U.S. stock market is about to wrap up a volatile month of April, bracing for neck-snapping gyrations from midterm elections in May. Investors, in the meantime, have time and again sold stock holdings in May to survive the seasonal decline in equity markets. This time around, May won’t be a particularly bad month for the stock market.Among the two pillars of the U.S. economy, consumer confidence remains at elevated levels and corporate earnings growth continues to pick up. Courtesy of these positives, investors should focus on fundamentally sound companies that can make the most of the current scenario.May is Particularly Bad in Midterm YearsMay is traditionally bad in midterm years, according to the Stock Trader’s Almanac. Since 1950, the Dow Jones Industrial Average normally remains flat in May but loses 0.7% on average during midterm years. For the S&P 500, May has been the eighth best month of the year but during midterms, the broader index has seen an average drop of 0.9%.  May is usually the fifth best month for the Nasdaq, however, the tech laden index slipped 1.2% on average in midterms.This year is likely to be the same. After all, Democrats are poised to regain control over the House of Representatives even though Republicans are expected to maintain an upper hand in the Senate, based on recent polls. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) forecasts that Democrats will have nearly a 70% chance of repossessing the House but there is less than 40% chance of regaining a majority in the Senate. Goldman added that such a divided government doesn’t bode well for investors.“Sell in May and Go Away” Is a Common AgendaThe adage “Sell in May and go away” is also being widely discussed. Sell in May and go away encourages investors to sell stock holdings in May to avoid getting affected by the seasonal decline in equity markets. The strategy involves getting back into the equity markets in November, thereby evading the typical volatile May-October period.Historically, stocks have underperformed in the six-month period commencing May and ending in October, compared to the six-month period from November to April. Mostly lower trading volumes in the summer season and substantial increase in investment during the winter months are cited to be the main reasons for this discrepancy.Markets Have Been Trading in a Tight Range for MonthsThe stock market, by the way, has failed to break out from a tight range over the past several weeks. This shows that enthusiasm over equities has been dissipating and might derail the extended bull run in the near term.Only 32.7% of investors expect stock prices to be at higher range in 12 months from now, per data by the Conference Board. This is the lowest percentage since November 2016. At the same time, 33% of respondents anticipate that stocks will be lower in a year, the highest reading since July 2016.Stock valuations are already at multiyear highs raising questions as to whether the equity market has more room to scale higher. To top it, trading volumes have been unusually low, which indicates that investors are reluctant to participate.Rise in inflationary pressure and a more hawkish Fed are potential headwinds for stocks, while investors continue to fret about the likelihood of an inverted yield curve that has been viewed as an indicator of a pending economic recession.Here’s Why You Shouldn’t Sell in MayMay is almost upon us, and even though there are ample of reasons to stay away from stocks, we shouldn’t be doing so from an investment standpoint. This is because the two pillars of the U.S. economy – consumers and corporates – look solid.Consumer Confidence Rebounds Close to 18-Year High in AprilU.S. economic growth in the first quarter was a little firmer than anticipated, while consumer spending slowed down sharply. Consumption came in at only 1.1% as compared with 4% in the final quarter of 2017. However, consumer confidence rebounded this month to a near 18-year high. The consumer confidence index climbed to 128.7 in April from 127 in March, per the Conference Board. And with more confidence, households are expected to bump up their spending levels.Q1 Earnings Strongest in 7 YearsTurning to corporate America, we have entered the first-quarter earnings season. In the first quarter, total earnings are likely to increase 20% from the same period last year on 8% higher revenues. This will follow 13.4% earnings growth recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 on 8.6% higher revenues, marking the best quarterly performance in seven years. In fact, full-year earnings are expected to be up 18.5% from the year-ago level on 5.5% higher revenues. This, if achieved, will be the highest annual growth since 2010.5 Solid ChoicesSince a ‘buy-in-May’ opportunity maybe playing out in the equity market, investing in solid stocks will be prudent. These stocks not only possess a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) but also are poised to gain significantly in the near term.

788,DG,"Companhia Brasileira de Distribuicao (CBD  -  Free Report) or Grupo Pao de Acucar reported first-quarter 2018 results, wherein net income from continuing operations came in at R$108 million ($33.3 million), up 40.1% (in local currency) from R$77 million ($23.7 million) recorded in the year-ago period. Increased sales and higher adjusted EBITDA led to the upside.Notably, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has rallied 11.6% in a month’s time, surpassing the industry’s gain of 1.1%.  Results in DetailNet revenues in the quarter came in at R$11,343 million ($3,494.4 million), compared with R$10,552 million ($3,241.5 million) in first-quarter 2017. Net revenues increased 7.5% year over year in local currency.Gross profit jumped 5.3% in local currency to R$2,547 million ($784.6 million), whereas the gross margin contracted 40 basis points (bps) to 22.5%. Adjusted EBITDA advanced 14.6% to R$546 million ($168.2 million), with the adjusted EBITDA margin expanding 30 bps to 4.8%, courtesy of higher margins at both segments.Segment DetailsMultivarejo gross sales came in at R$6.8 billion, which was hurt by food deflation as well as shut down of Extra Hiper stores that were converted to Assai stores. Further, same store sales dipped 2% excluding calendar effect, while gross same store sales inched up 0.7%. While the segment began the quarter on a dull note, the scenario improved in March, wherein trends reversed with same-store sales growth of 11.8% (up 3.9% excluding calendar effect).Notably, the company implemented several new commercial actions in early March, including relaunch of the company’s Collect & Win campaign, launch of “My Rewards” in the same app as “My Discounts” which reinforced the company’s loyalty program. Also, the segment benefited from greater promotional activities.   SG&A costs at this segment dropped 4.9%, courtesy of reduced selling costs which stemmed from productivity gains from employee multi-role program and measures undertaken last year. Also closure of Extra Hiper stores for conversion to Assai stores contributed to the fall in selling costs. These factors also benefited adjusted EBITDA margin expand 30 bps to 5.5%.Net sales at Assai surged 25% in local currency to R$5.5 billion. The sturdy growth was driven by higher comps and 20 store openings. Markedly, Assai’s comps jumped 9.9% (up 5.1% excluding conversions), on the back of 8% jump in sales volume and 12 % growth in customer traffic. These also led to a rise in market share.Gross margin grew 90 bps to 15.4%, courtesy of store expansion efforts and favorable taxation, somewhat offset by food deflation. SG&A costs (as a percentage of sales) remained flat year over year as solid performance from mature stores was countered by food deflation and speed of expansion. However, adjusted EBITDA margin grew 80 bps to 4.8% on account of gross margin growth and the other aforementioned factors.Under the Assai banner, the company introduced one store in Sergipe, alongside having seven under construction and two under conversion. Further, four Extra Hiper stores were shut down for conversion under the Assai banner. Companhia Brasileira operates 127 Assai stores across 19 states.Financial DetailsThe company ended 2017 with cash and marketable securities of R$1,701 million ($514.4 million), net debt (adjusted for balance of not discounted receivables) of R$3,121 million ($943.9 million) and total shareholders’ equity of R$13,271 million ($4,013.6 million).During the quarter, the company spent R$330 million ($101.7 million) toward expansion of Assai and renovations of Pao de Acucar stores.OutlookCompanhia Brasileira’s performance in the first quarter remained solid, owing to continued strength at Assai and reversed trends in Multivarejo. Management also stated that it regained its leading position in the Brazilian food space, which in turn was a result of its strategic plan to focus on the cash-and-carry segment. That said, the company remains confident of strengthening this position, courtesy of continued strength in Assai and expected enhancements at Multivarejo.For 2018, management continues to envision same store sales at Assai to be more than the inflation level, while that in Multivarejo is expected to be on par with food inflation. Both segments are anticipated to witness continued market share gains.Further, EBITDA margin for Multivarejo and are likely to come in a range of 5.5-5.6% and 5.8-5.9%, respectively.3 Retail Stocks You Can’t MissBuckle (BKE  -  Free Report) has an impressive earnings surprise history.

789,DG,"Tractor Supply Company (TSCO  -  Free Report) delivered lower-than-expected results in first-quarter 2018. However, both earnings and sales increased year over year. Also, management reiterated its guidance for 2018.Following the soft quarterly results, shares of this leading rural lifestyle retail store chain were down 1.8% in pre-market trading. In the past three months, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 21.4% wider than the industry’s decline of 11%.Q1 HighlightsTractor Supply reported quarterly earnings of 57 cents per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. However, the bottom line increased 23.9% year over year backed by its growth initiatives.Also, the company’s revenues increased 7.6% to $1,682.9 million but fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,690 million. This year-over-year growth can be attributed to rise in comparable-store sales (comps), which improved 3.7% against a decline of 2.2% in the year-ago period. While comparable store transaction count grew 3.2%, average ticket inched up 0.5%. Furthermore, traffic and sales growth were aided by the company’s ongoing efforts to build customer loyalty and enhance digital capabilities. Additionally, comps gained from improvement across all geographic regions as well as major product categories.Tractor Supply also witnessed strength in everyday basic products across the consumable, usable and edible categories as well as winter seasonal products. Improvement in comps was somewhat compensated with soft sales across spring and summer seasonal products.

This increase can be primarily attributed to investments in team member wages, increased store expenses and investments in infrastructure and technology to support the strategic long-term growth initiatives.Financial PositionTractor Supply ended first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $132.4 million, long-term debt of $679.6 million and total stockholders’ equity of $1,313.2 million.In the quarter under review, the company repurchased shares for $157.5 million.

790,DG,"While earnings season has come to an end for most of the sectors, the show is still on for the Retail-Wholesale sector, which occupies the top 44% (7 out of 16) position in the list of Zacks sectors. The sector has advanced roughly 9% in the past six months, comfortably outpacing the S&P 500’s growth of 3%.Per the latest Earnings Preview, approximately 90% of retailers in the S&P 500 index have already reported quarterly results. Well, roughly 73.5% of these companies have delivered positive earnings surprises, while about 67.7% beat top-line expectations. Earnings of these companies have increased 21.1% from the year-ago quarter, while revenues have risen 9.3%.Notably, gradual wage acceleration, low unemployment rate of 3.9%, rising consumer sentiment and sound economic fundamentals are working in tandem for the sector. Additionally, the cut in corporate tax rate is allowing retailers to channelize the surplus money toward best possible alternatives. Further, an individual tax cut is also paving way for higher disposable income, which is likely to trigger demand for discretionary items. For obvious reasons, retailers are the end gainers.Certainly, the sector has borne the brunt of heightened online competition from Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), lower footfall and evolving consumer shopping patterns but retailers have left no stone unturned to rapidly adapt to the changing retail landscape. Rise in online shopping prompted retailers to rapidly enhance omni-channel capabilities, optimize store fleet and undertake restructuring activities.Our today’s article revolves around three discount store retailers — Costco (COST  -  Free Report), Dollar General (DG  -  Free Report) and Burlington Stores (BURL  -  Free Report). We note that the retail-discount industry, which occupies the top 42% (108 out of the 256) position, has rallied approximately 9% in six months comfortably outperforming the S&P 500’s growth.So, let’s find out what’s special about these three discount retailers.These three discounters are likely to trump estimates, given a favorable combination of positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that for stocks with such combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%. Moreover, these stocks also look well poised to register year-over-year growth in both top and bottom lines. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Let’s analyze them.Which Factors Hold Key to Costco’s Performance?Costco, the operator of membership warehouses, is scheduled to come up with third-quarter fiscal 2018 financial results on May 31.

You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Costco seems somewhat unfazed by tough retail scenario. The company’s growth strategies, sturdy comparable-store sales performance, strong membership trends and higher penetration of Citi Visa co-brand card program are the pillars that reinforce its position. The company’s strategy to sell products at heavily discounted prices has helped it to remain on growth track. We are also encouraged by Costco’s expansion strategy, as it remains committed to opening new clubs and expanding e-commerce capabilities.What Will Drive Dollar General’s Results?Dollar General, which is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 31, is a solid bet.

This discount retailer has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +0.95%.Dollar General’s commitment toward better price management, cost containment, private label offering, effective inventory management, merchandise and operational initiatives should drive sales and margin trends.

Additionally, the company is expanding its cooler facilities to enhance the sale of perishable items and is rolling out DG digital coupon program too.

The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +0.62%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is at $1.09, reflecting an increase of 49.3% year over year. Revenue is expected to come in at $1,496 million, up 11% from the year-ago period.Burlington Stores has implemented multiple changes to its business model to resonate well with the changes in the industry. Impressively, the company’s current model is helping customers to get nationally branded, fashionable, high quality and fair priced products. Furthermore, it has increased vendor count, made technological advancements, initiated a better marketing approach and focused on localized assortments. Apart from this, in order to drive the top line, Burlington Stores has been concentrating on store expansion.

792,DG,"If you’re looking for a profitable portfolio of stocks that will offer the best of value and growth investing, try the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy. It helps an investor gain exposure to stocks that are undervalued and have impressive growth prospects. Unlike a blend strategy, a portfolio that uses GARP investing is expected to include stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing.GARP Metrics – Mix of Growth & Value MetricsThe GARP approach helps to zero in on stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main aspects that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is also a tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics – price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is another value metric that is considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Last 5-year EPS & projected 3–5 year EPS growth rates between 10% and 20% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)ROE (over the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)P/E and P/B ratios less than M-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicates that the stocks are undervalued.)These few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only 16.Here are seven of the 16 stocks that made it through the screen:VMware, Inc.

793,DG,"As expected, the Federal Reserve, headed by the new chairman Jerome Powell, raised interest rates for the sixth time since the financial crisis by 0.25% to 1.50-1.75%. The central bank hinted at gradual hikes for this year with two lift-offs but turned hawkish for 2019 and 2020, citing growing confidence in the strengthening economy.The Fed is cautious about rising trade tensions. Trump has recently announced tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and is seeking to slap a series of tariffs on China imports, targeting the technology, telecommunications and apparel sectors that could hit $60 billion goods in the world's second-largest economy. The action could lead to threats of retaliation or even a trade war.However, Powell signaled for faster rate hikes for the next few years as the massive $1.5 trillion tax cut and a bipartisan $300-billion spending plan could overheat the robust labor market, flaring up inflation and calling for aggressive policy tightening. The Fed now sees a total of eight quarter-point hikes in the fed-funds rate through the end of 2020 to near 3.4%. This includes three increases this year, including the latest move, three in 2019, and two in 2020.The Fed raised the economic growth forecast to 2.7% this year from 2.5% and 2.4% for 2019 from 2.1%. Inflation is expected to stay at 1.9% this year and return to the Fed’s target of 2% in the next. Additionally, unemployment rate, which is at 17-year low of 4.1%, is expected to fall further to 3.8% at the end of this year and 3.6% at the end of the next.Higher Rates: A Reason to WorryHigher rates would attract more capital to the country, thereby boosting the U.S. dollar against the basket of other currencies. This would leave a huge impact on commodity-linked investments, reflecting that a rising rate environment will hurt a number of segments. In particular, high dividend paying sectors such as utilities and real estate would be the worst hit given their higher sensitivity to rising interest rates.Additionally, securities in capital-intensive sectors like telecom would also be hit by higher rates. Higher rates would result in tighter lending conditions and curtail consumer spending on a wide range of products like cars and houses. This will in turn dent profitability across various segments. Further, businesses will also face higher loan rates over time.All these combinations would lead to heightened market volatility and threaten the nine-year bull market. Against such a backdrop, quality stocks tends to outperform as these are rich in value characteristics with healthy balance sheets, high return on capital, low volatility, elevated margins, and a track of stable or rising sales and earnings growth. Quality investing also seeks safety and protection against volatility in turbulent times.Given this, we have highlighted five solid picks targeting this niche strategy for investors seeking to capitalize higher rates and a volatile market.How to Select Quality Stocks?To find out the best stocks in this space, we have used the Zacks Stock Screener. The parameters include Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), VGM Score of B or better, ROE of at least 10%, debt-to-equity ratio of less than 1, positive 5-year historic EPS growth, positive current-year EPS growth, positive current-year earnings estimate revisions over the past 30 days, and dividend yield of greater than 1%.Universal Forest Products Inc.

794,DG,"The retail war is intensifying with the focus gradually shifting toward minimum delivery time of your groceries. In February, Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) started offering two-hour Whole Foods delivery to its Prime members. And now Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report), Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) and The Kroger Co. (KR  -  Free Report) are following suit with same-day delivery services.Almost all retail giants are pumping in more money and either acquiring or partnering with delivery service companies for same-day delivery to stay ahead in the race. With changing shopping habits, retailers are bent on minimizing the time between the actual placement of an order and its delivery. Needless to say, the gap between online and offline retail is fast disappearing and it’s only a matter of time when others jump the bandwagon.Amazon Shows the Way for Same-Day Delivery Amazon set the ball rolling by playing to its strength — a strong delivery wing — when it started offering free-two-hour delivery service from Whole Food stores to its Prime members in February. The move came within a year of the e-commerce giant’s $13.7-billion acquisition of supermarket chain Whole Foods that stocks a wide range of fresh produce, meat, seafood, flowers and other items (read: Will Amazon's 2-Hour Whole Foods Delivery Skew Retail Pitch?).It goes without saying that Amazon has been a pioneer in minimizing the gap between online and offline retail space. The company is pulling items from Whole Foods stores, packing them and getting the goods delivered by its own drivers. Moreover, it is all free and within two hours. This move is in a bid to explore and add novelty to the untapped online groceries market, and the Whole Foods acquisition was a giant leap toward this direction.Naturally, the idea is to lure more customers on the convenience quotient and the two-hour delivery service has certainly given Amazon enough power to compete with brick-and-mortar giants like Walmart, Target, Kroger, Dollar General (DG  -  Free Report) and Dollar Tree (DLTR  -  Free Report). Understandably, same-day delivery is the need of the hour and Amazon’s recent initiative has not only made its rivals sit up and think, but also gear up for an ensuing battle.Walmart Fights BackBrick-and-mortar giants like Walmart, Kroger and Target, which so long, in order to compete with Amazon, were stressing on increased investments in e-commerce, have perhaps realized that bridging the online and offline gap is the ideal way to compete. So, most of these companies are busy reallocating their investments to add muscle to their delivery service wing. Walmart recently announced that it will be expanding its delivery service to 100 metropolitan areas by the end of 2018, with orders fulfilled at more than 800 stores across the country and delivered to shoppers contracted through Deliv, Uber and other delivery contractors. Moreover, customers who order a minimum of $30 and pay a delivery fee of $9.95 will get their purchases delivered in four hours provided they order by 1 p.m. This definitely is a challenge to Amazon.Interestingly, Walmart’s e-commerce sales growth in the United States slowed to 23% in the fourth quarter, marking a sharp decline from 50% in the prior quarter. This is being viewed as a setback for investors. However, Walmart is hopeful of registering 40% growth in online sales this year, as it has plans of investing extensively in e-commerce, which is expected to drive organic sales by 40% in fiscal 2019. Walmart has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Kroger, Target Expand Same-Day DeliveryTarget too isn’t lagging. In December 2017, the company announced plans of acquiring grocery delivery service Shipt for $550 billion and using its technology platform to expand same-day delivery at Target Stores. And come Mar 29, Target and Shipt will start same-day delivery of more than 55,000 groceries and home goods, toys, electronics and other products in Baltimore and Washington. The company also expects to make same-day delivery available from most Target stores before 2018 end and for products in all of its major categories by the end of 2019.Much like Walmart and Target, Kroger too will be expanding its partnership with same-day grocery delivery service Instacart to offer home delivery from 55 central Ohio Kroger locations. The company currently offers home delivery in 45 markets, with Instacart partnering in 27 of those markets. Also, Kroger has plans of offering delivery in 100 markets by the end of 2018.In ConclusionNo doubt, Amazon has taken the retail landscape to a different level altogether with minimum delivery time and others following suit. According to NPD Group, about 7% of U.S. households bought groceries online last year. Among them, most prefer their orders delivered to their doors, while the rest pick up from the store. This certainly emerged as an area of prime importance for most retailers and major players are going all out to tap this same-day delivery service space.Moreover, according to Nielsen and the Food Marketing Institute, although only 23% of consumers in the United States buy groceries online, the next five-seven years is expected to see a whopping 70% preferring the same. So it may well be assumed that the same-day delivery space will heat up pretty soon.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

January data, however, was revised upward to show sales dipping 0.1% instead of decline of 0.3% as previously reported. It marked three months of decline in a row, since April 2012.  Among the various components of the retail sales, vehicles sales declined 0.9% in February, according to the monthly report. Furthermore, furniture sales, health care and personal care sales, declined 0.8% and 0.4%, respectively. Sales at gasoline stores were down 1.2% and food sales decreased 0.1%.However, the month’s bright spots were a 1.9% increase in building materials against a decline of 1.7% in January and 0.2% restaurant sales growth from a 0.1% gain the previous month. Also, sales at non-store retailers jumped 1% after a sharp fall in January.Is There a Cause for Concern?Following the data release, J.P. Morgan cut its first-quarter 2018 GDP forecast from 2.5% to 2%, while Goldman Sachs reduced the same to 1.8% from 2%. The Atlanta Fed’s GDP estimate fell to 1.9%, down from 2.5%.Given that retail sales for the first two months of the first quarter were not so strong, its contribution to the quarter’s GDP should be below than last quarter and weigh on economic growth. In the fourth quarter, the economy grew 2.5%, but expectations are growth of 3% per the third revision which is due later this month.However, looking further, core retail sales (which exclude sales related to vehicles, gasoline, building materials and food services and more closely indicate GDP trends)  inched up 0.1% after remaining unchanged in the month of January. The number was, however, lower than the consensus estimate of a 0.5% gain. Also, the monthly report states that retail sales increased 4% year over year, provided some breather.Economists believe that an increase in spending on services should buoy first-quarter retail sales results and there is the likelihood of strong service spending given solid recent data.Strong Service Sector GrowthInstitute for Supply Management (ISM) data for the month of February showed that the non-manufacturing index (NMI) was 59.5, topping analysts’ estimates of 58.4. This was also more than an average of 57 for all of 2017. NMI reading above 49% indicates an expansion for the broader economy.The non-manufacturing index saw uninterrupted expansion for the 97th consecutive month and indicated that the broader economy is on track for steady growth this year. Expansion was witnessed in sectors related to education services, transportation and warehousing, utilities, real estate, finance & insurance, healthcare, construction, mining, retail trade, agriculture and information. Service spending trends thus look rosier, which should aid U.S. retail sales in the first quarter of 2018.  Alongside, the environment for the retail sector remains favorable against the backdrop of economic strength underpinned by gradual wage acceleration, a 17-year low unemployment rate and rising consumer confidence, and a reduction in tax rate.  The Retail-Wholesale sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) has put up a good show by advancing roughly 10.7% in the last three months, comfortably outperforming the S&P 500’s growth of approximately 3.1%.Top 4 PicksGiven the prospective growth of retail sales, investors may consider buying sound stocks from this space.

797,DG,"The last few weeks of first-quarter earnings season has been dominated by retailers, from Target (TGT  -  Free Report) to Macy’s (M  -  Free Report). This trend is set to continue, so Zacks has investors covered with three retail stocks that look poised to top quarterly earnings estimates. The retail industry has been under pressure not only from Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and other online sellers but also from investors. Clothing retailer Gap (GPS  -  Free Report), which had been on a strong run over the last year, saw its stock price tumble nearly 14% on Friday after it released lower-than-expected Q1 earnings results Thursday. Therefore, retail investors need to be on the hunt for stocks that look set to top quarterly earnings estimates.Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to surprise, in one way or the other. This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Today, we are giving our readers a free look at three of these stocks ahead of their upcoming quarterly earnings reports. Check them out now:1.      DSW Inc. (DSW  -  Free Report)Shares of DSW have climbed nearly 31% over the year 12 weeks and 14% during the last four weeks, in a sign that investors might be expecting big things from this footwear retailer when it reports its first-quarter earnings results before the opening bell on Wednesday, May 30. DSW’s Q1 revenues are actually expected to slip by 1% from the year-ago period to $684.11 million, based on our Zacks Consensus Estimates.But top-line growth is not all that matters. The company’s first-quarter earnings are projected to pop by 12.5% to touch $0.36 per share. Meanwhile, DSW’s Most Accurate Estimate—the representation of the most recent analyst sentiment—calls for quarterly earnings of $0.37 per share, which is 1 cent better than our current consensus estimate. The company is also currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and sports an Earnings ESP of 3.47%. Therefore, investors should consider DSW as a stock that could beat Q1 earnings estimates.2.       Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report)Dollar General stock has surged 33.7% over the last year, yet shares have slipped over 2% in the last four weeks. However, this recent decline doesn’t seem to be based on the off-price retailer’s first-quarter outlook, with Dollar General’s quarterly revenues expected to climb by 10.3% to $6.19 billion. Moving on to the other end of the income statement, DG is projected to touch $1.40 per share, which would mark a nearly 36% surge from the prior-year period.DG is also currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and rocks an earnings ESP of 0.95%. The company’s Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.41 per share, coming in 1 cent above our current consensus estimate. This means that Dollar General might be able to impress investors with a bottom line beat when it reports its Q1 financial results before the market opens on Thursday, May 31.3.       Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU  -  Free Report)Shares of this upscale athleisure giant have skyrocketed over 118% over the last year and 31% during the last 12 weeks. Lululemon’s quarterly revenues are projected to climb by 18.45% to touch $616.32 million. Investors should also be very excited to see that LULU’s earnings are expected soar 40.63% to hit $0.45 per share.Lululemon is also currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), with an Earnings ESP of 0.29%. LULU’s Most Accurate Estimate also currently sits 1 cent above our current consensus estimate. Therefore, as investors know at this point, Lululemon could top earnings estimates when it reports its Q1 financial results after market close on Thursday, May 31.For more retailer earnings previews, make sure to check out: Upcoming Earnings Reports to Watch: CRM, COST, ULTALooking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?

798,DG,"Michael Kors Holdings Limited (KORS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 30, before the market opens. In the last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 37.2%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Which Way Are Top & Bottom-Line Estimates Headed?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review stands at 60 cents, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 17.8%. The consensus estimate is above the company’s guided range of 50-55 cents per share. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased by a penny in the last 30 days.Michael Kors has a remarkable history, at least in terms of the bottom line. The company’s third-quarter fiscal 2018 results marked the 11th consecutive quarter of earnings beat. In the trailing four quarters, the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 32.7%.Michael Kors Holdings Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Michael Kors Holdings Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Michael Kors Holdings Limited QuoteWell the obvious question that comes to mind is whether Michael Kors will be able to sustain its positive earnings surprise streak in the fiscal fourth quarter. Though the past trend indicates a positive surprise, it will not be wise to jump to a conclusion without analyzing the factors at play.Deciding FactorsMichael Kors has been constantly deploying resources to expand product offerings, open stores and build shop-in-shops. Management intends to upgrade e-commerce platform and expects the channel to be a significant contributor in the long run. We note that despite the possibility of heavy investments weighing on margins in the short term, the company continues to take up strategic endeavors.Michael Kors’ Runway 2020 strategic plan, which focuses on product innovation, brand engagement and customer experience, is likely to drive the top line. The company had earlier launched Bancroft in the Michael Kors collection line as part of its strategy of product innovation.However, stiff competition, declining comps, aggressive promotional environment and waning mall traffic are making things tough. We noted that comparable sales dropped 3.2% in third-quarter fiscal 2018, following declines of 1.8% and 5.9% in the second and first quarter, respectively. For fiscal 2018, the company continues to anticipate comparable sales decline in the mid-single digit range.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model shows that Michael Kors is likely to beat estimates this quarter as the stock has the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen.   Michael Kors has an Earnings ESP of +9.64% and carries a Zacks Rank #2. This makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Other Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.97% and a Zacks Rank #2.Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.39% and a Zacks Rank #3.Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.94% and a Zacks Rank #3.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

799,DG,"Ross Stores, Inc. (ROST  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected first-quarter fiscal 2018 results despite an unfavorable weather throughout the quarter. Notably, both top and bottom lines beat estimates and improved year over year. However, the company provided a softer-than-expected earnings view for second-quarter fiscal 2018. Further, the company’s projection of higher freight costs has hurt investors’ sentiment.Notably, higher freight costs have been a headwind for the company for over a year now. The increase mainly stemmed from significant rise in market rates due to a very tight capacity, due to driver shortages, impacts of increased regulation and the stronger economy. Further, diesel costs shot up nearly 20% in the fiscal first quarter compared with last year. Consequently, the company expects headwinds related to higher freight costs to persist throughout fiscal 2018, which is reflected in its guidance.On that note, shares of Ross Stores declined 4.8% in yesterday’s after-hours session. However, the stock has gained 3.2% in the past month, outperforming the industry’s 0.6% upside.Ross Store posted adjusted earnings of $1.11 per share, which surpassed the company’s guidance of $1.03-$1.07 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.06. Earnings also improved 35.4% from 82 cents reported in the prior-year period.Ross Stores, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Ross Stores, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Ross Stores, Inc. QuoteTotal sales rose 8.5% to $3,588.6 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,534 million, driven by 3% increase in comparable-store sales (comps). Notably, sales and comps growth surpassed the company’s projected rise of 6-7% and 1-2%, respectively. Comps growth can primarily be attributed to the rise in traffic and increased average basket size.Cost of sales increased 8.2% to $2,522.2 million and 20 basis points (bps) as a percentage of sales. The increase was driven by 30 bps rise in merchandise margin, 15 bps decline in distribution costs and 15 bps leverage in occupancy expenses. However, these were partly offset by higher freight expenses and buying costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 25 bps due to higher wage-related costs.Operating margin contracted 5 bps to 15.1% as higher freight costs and wage-related investments more than offset the improved merchandise margins and favorable timing of packaway-related expenses. However, operating margin outperformed the company’s expectation of 14.6-14.8%.Store UpdateRoss Stores remains on track with its store expansion plans by opening 23 Ross and six dd’s DISCOUNTS stores in first-quarter fiscal 2018. As of May 5, 2018, Ross Stores operated 1,651 outlets, including 1,432 Ross Dress for Less stores and 219 dd's DISCOUNTS stores.In second-quarter fiscal 2018, Ross Stores plans to open 30 stores, including 22 Ross and eight dd’s DISCOUNT outlets. For fiscal 2018, total store openings are estimated to be 100, with 75 Ross and 25 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. This guidance does not include the company’s plans to close or relocate nearly 10 older stores.FinancialsRoss Stores ended first-quarter fiscal 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of $1,302.8 million, long-term debt of $312.1 million and total shareholders’ equity of $3,130.3 million.During the reported quarter, the company bought back 3.3 million shares for $255 million. Further, the company remains on track to repurchase shares worth $1.075 billion in fiscal 2018. Additionally, it approved a quarterly cash dividend of 22.5 cents per share. The increased dividend is payable on Jun 29, to shareholders of record as of Jun 12.GuidanceRoss Stores remains encouraged by strong earnings and sales in first-quarter fiscal 2018. It expects retail environment at both online and physical stores to be highly competitive throughout 2018. Further, it projects strong multi-year sales comparisons as the year progresses. Despite competition and strong comparisons, the company anticipates retaining its robust performance due to the strength in the apparel space.However, the company provided a softer-than-expected earnings view for the second quarter of fiscal 2018. It expects comps to increase 1-2% while earnings per share are projected to be 95-99 cents, including the benefit from lower taxes, partly offset by the shift in packaway-related expenses. Earnings guidance is significantly below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.02 per share.Other assumptions include sales growth of 5-6% in the fiscal second quarter. Anticipating comps in line with the guidance, the company projects operating margin to be 13.3-13.5%, reflecting a decline from 14.9% in the year-ago quarter. This decline is mainly attributed to the unfavorable timing of pack away related costs, and the company’s already announced wage and benefit investments. Net interest expenses are estimated at about $900,000 while the tax rate is expected to decline to nearly 24-25%.Based on the solid fiscal first-quarter results and the second-quarter view, the company raised its earnings outlook for fiscal 2018. It projects earnings per share for fiscal 2018 of $3.92-$4.05 compared with the previous guidance of $3.86-$4.03 and $3.55 per share reported in fiscal 2017. Earnings guidance includes the benefit from lower taxes.The company previously projected comps growth of 1-2% for fiscal 2018 compared with 4% growth registered in each of the last three years. Also, it projected sales growth of 3-4% in fiscal 2018.Zacks Rank and Key PicksRoss Stores currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the retail space include The Buckle Inc. (BKE  -  Free Report), Urban Outfitters Inc. (URBN  -  Free Report) and Dollar General Corp. (DG  -  Free Report).

801,DG,"If you’re looking for a profitable portfolio of stocks that will offer the best of value and growth investing, try the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy. It helps an investor gain exposure to stocks that are undervalued and have impressive growth prospects.However, one should not confuse GARP investing with the blend strategy. While the blend strategy promotes investment in both value and growth stocks, GARP investing requires both value and growth features in a single stock.GARP Metrics – Mix of Growth & Value MetricsThe GARP approach prefers stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is also a tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics – price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is also considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Last 5-year EPS & projected 3–5 year EPS growth rates between 10% and 20% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)ROE (over the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)P/E and P/B ratios less than M-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicate that the stocks are undervalued.)These few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only nine.Here are seven of the nine stocks that made it through the screen:VMware, Inc.

802,DG,"Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST  -  Free Report), a membership warehouse retailer, gave investors a reason to cheer by boosting its dividend payout. The hike in dividend accentuates this Issaquah, WA-based company’s financial stability and resilience toward the tough retail landscape.The Board of Directors raised the quarterly dividend by 14% to 57 cents a share to be paid on May 25, 2018. The dividend yield based on the new payout and the last closing market price is approximately 1.18%. Last year in April, Costco increased regular quarterly dividend by 11% to 50 cents and also declared a special cash dividend of $7.00 per share.We believe that such hikes not only enhance shareholders’ value but raise the market value of the stock as well. In fact, through these dividend increases companies persuade investors to either buy or hold the scrip instead of selling it. People looking for regular income from stocks are most likely to choose companies that have a track record of consistent and incremental dividend payouts.3 Other Things That May Raise InterestStock Ascends 19% in Six MonthsCostco, which came under pressure after the news of Whole Foods’ buyout by Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) surfaced, has emerged stronger since then. The company’s growth strategies and sound fundamentals reinforce its position.Notably, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have advanced 18.5% in the past six months compared with the industry’s growth of 15.9%. The stock has also comfortably outperformed the Retail-Wholesale and the S&P 500 index that advanced 11.2% and 3.1%, respectively. Further, the stock is hovering close to its 52-week high of $199.88.We see no reason why Costco with a VGM Score of A and long term earnings growth rate of 10.5% could not breach that mark in the near term.Sturdy Comps Performance ContinuesImproving labor market, rising disposable income and elevated consumer sentiment have ushered confidence in Costco that continued with its stellar comparable sales (comps) performance in 2018. Comps rose 8.6% in March, following an increase of 10.5% in February and 6% in January.

803,DG,"Nielsen Holdings Plc (NLSN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26.The company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average negative earnings surprise of 18.67%.Last quarter, Nielsen reported earnings of 52 cents per share, which excluded a provisional non-cash tax charge of 29 cents per share. The figure increased 18.2% year over year and 26.8% sequentially.Revenues increased 6.3% year over year and 7.3% sequentially to $1.76 billion. Top-line growth was driven by contribution from the acquisition of Gracenote, continued strength in the company’s Watch segment and growth in emerging markets, partially offset by weakness in the U.S. Buy segment.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Robust Product Portfolio to Boost ResultsNielsen’s regular investments in innovative technologies bode well for its product portfolio expansion.Recently, Nielsen launched Advanced Audience Forecasting tool which provides forecasts of TV audiences defined by advanced audience segments to its clients.Further, the company introduced Connected Partner Program, which helps companies to connect their network, discover new connected partners and utilize the measurement data provided by Nielsen.Also, the company launched Nielsen Branded Integration Intel, which provides standardized measurement of brands appearing within video content, including TV programs.These endeavors are likely to benefit the company’s first-quarter results.Strategic Partnerships Remain PositiveStrategic partnerships have been shaping Nielsen’s growth trajectory over the past few years.Recently, Nielsen extended its partnership with Dollar General (DG  -  Free Report), post which, the latter will increase the use of Nielsen's insights and solutions. This is likely to benefit the Buy segment of the company which did not perform well in the last quarter.However, the segment is expected to witness sluggish growth in the first quarter due to weakness in the U.S. market.Earlier this year, Nielsen entered into a multi-year renewal agreement with Sinclair Broadcast Group (SBGI  -  Free Report). This partnership will allow the Sinclair Broadcast to deploy Nielsen TV ratings in its business model.Last year, the company also signed an agreement with Cumulus Media, post which Nielsen has started providing radio and network radio ratings services to 446 radio stations across 90 local markets.These partnerships will continue to aid the strong performance of Watch segment of the company.We believe the above-mentioned moves taken by the company will boost its top-line growth by improving its clientele in the soon-to-be reported quarter.Nielsen Holdings Plc Price and EPS Surprise Nielsen Holdings Plc Price and EPS Surprise | Nielsen Holdings Plc QuoteWhat Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

804,DG,"Kirkland's, Inc. (KIRK  -  Free Report) posted mixed results for fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, as the bottom-line performance remained drab due to increased promotions and soft margins. However, the top line grew year over year, thanks to solid contributions from store and e-commerce sales.While shares of the company gained 1.1% on Mar 16, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company has slumped about 20% in a year, against the industry’s growth of 5.9%. This can be mainly blamed upon its dismal bottom-line history.Quarter in DetailThis Brentwood, TN-based company reported earnings of 79 cents per share which plunged 12.2% year over year and fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 89 cents. Results were on par with management’s update provided in February, wherein it highlighted the unfavorable impact of consumers’ everchanging shopping patterns — leading to a tough retail environment marked by intense promotional activities. Kirkland's, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Kirkland's, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Kirkland's, Inc. Quote Nonetheless, the company has been making several investments like improving merchandise assortments, rationalizing SKUs, undertaking repairs at various categories and enhancing pricing and mix to enhance overall execution. These efforts are reaping benefits, as evident from Kirkland’s impressive comparable store sales (comps) and sales for the fourth quarter.Kirkland’s net sales for the 14-week period ended Feb 3, 2018 came in at $224.6 million, reflecting a 10.5% rise from $203.2 million recorded in the 13-week period ended Jan 28, 2017. Net sales almost came in line with the consensus mark of $225 million. Notably, net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 includes nearly $10 million from the extra week. Excluding this, comparable store sales (including e-commerce) on a comparable 13-week basis rose 2% in the fourth quarter — better than a 4.6% drop witnessed in the same year-ago period. Comps were backed by solid e-commerce sales, strength in California and Colorado store sales and greater average ticket that compensated for the soft traffic. Further, sales in the quarter were backed by a robust start to the holiday quarter, thanks to a sturdy November and Black Friday weekend. The company generated particularly strong sales of seasonal décor, while its e-commerce sales also remained solid —depicting a surge of 30% year over year.Further, e-commerce sales remained robust, surging to $22.6 million year over year and representing about 10% of Kirkland’s top line. This came on the back of the company’s constant focus on enhancing omni-channel business, online product range and fulfilment operations. This was backed by robust improvements in website traffic and average order value. Further, sales from third-party drop-ship strategy provided an impetus to e-commerce revenues.Costs & Margins While Kirkland’s began the fourth quarter on a superb note, it witnessed a slowdown in store traffic in the latter half — given consumers’ accelerated changes in shopping patterns during the holiday season. This, in turn compelled the company to undertake greater-than-anticipated promotional activities which weighed on merchandise margins — thereby pressurizing the bottom line.The home decor retailer’s gross profit increased 6.7% year over year to $79.1 million. However, gross margin declined 130 basis points to 35.2%. Well, merchandise margins fell 30 bps to 53.1% owing to unfavorable mix of third-party drop-ship revenues and heightened promotional activities. This was partly compensated by gains from increased IMU and initiatives to remove stacking of coupon offers.Additionally, the company incurred greater store occupancy expenses, which rose 35 bps as a percentage of sales. Also, the company witnessed an 85 bps increase in higher outbound freight costs (including e-commerce shipping) as a percentage of sales, while it also incurred greater central distribution expenses. Operating costs jumped 60 bps to 25% of sales. Consequently, operating income declined 8.2% to nearly $21.1 million, with the operating margin shrinking 190 bps to 9.4%.Store UpdatesDuring fiscal 2017, Kirkland’s introduced 31 stores while shutting 17. This included five store openings and two closures undertaken in the fourth quarter.For fiscal 2018, management intends to open 20-25 new stores and close 10-15 stores.Other Financial DetailsKirkland's exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $80.2 million and no long-term debt or borrowings. Further, net shareholders' equity as of Feb 3, 2018 came in at $140.8 million.During fiscal 2017, Kirkland generated cash flow from operating activities of $45.1 million. Capital expenditures during the fiscal amounted to $28.4 million. Also, Kirkland’s bought back 33,000 shares at an average price of $11.70 million during the fourth quarter and remains on track to continue with share buybacks in fiscal 2018.For fiscal 2018, the company anticipates capital expenditures to be between $26 million and $29 million, owing to greater investments in e-commerce and supply-chain enhancements.Fiscal 2018 GuidanceKirkland’s remains focused on taking steps to enhance operating efficiency and curtail operating costs. The company also expects to gain from its ongoing efforts to mend underperforming categories and enrich customers’ experience further. In this regard, Kirkland’s is on track to allocate capital to enhance its e-commerce network in fiscal 2018. Also, the company remains committed toward making several experiments to attract more customers — both online and in stores.Kirkland’s anticipates net sales in fiscal 2018 to advance in a range of 3-5%, thanks to increased store count and contributions from e-commerce sales. Also, this guidance is based on comps growth in a range of 1-2%.Finally, Kirkland’s envisions earnings per share to come in a band of 50 cents to 60 cents. This is partly attributable to the recent tax reforms, owing to which — tax rate for fiscal 2018 is anticipated to be 24%, sharply down from 46% in fiscal 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 47 cents for fiscal 2018 is pegged much lower and is likely to witness upward revisions.Nervous About Kirkland’s?

Further, the consensus estimate for salon business’ revenues is pegged at $80 million, up 8.5% from fourth-quarter fiscal 2017.However, Ulta Beauty has been grappling with soft margins for a while now. The company witnessed contraction of both gross and operating margins in the fiscal fourth quarter. Gross profit margin contracted 50 basis points due to deleveraged merchandise margins and one-time bonus payment with respect to tax reforms. Higher SG&A expenses along with lower gross margin led to the decline in operating margin.Further, the company is exposed to risk in the customer-driven industry as cheaper alternatives might deter buyers’ loyalty for the brand, consequently impacting the sale of products under Ulta banner.Zacks ModelOur proven model shows that Ulta Beauty is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

811,DG,"The fight for e-commerce retail supremacy is heating up with The Kroger Co (KR  -  Free Report) acquiring meal-kit company Home Chef. The latest development comes within a week of the company striking a deal with British online grocer Ocado to use its robotic technology to fill up orders at its warehouses. The retail landscape is fast changing with almost all major brick-and-mortar stores increasingly focusing on their e-commerce segment.It goes without saying that Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) has changed the entire retail ballgame in the last few years, which is compelling its peers re-strategize their business model. Moreover, the grocery industry, which till some time ago remained insulated from the e-commerce war, isn’t safe anymore, with retailers acquiring grocery companies and taking the fight to the delivery race. Given this scenario, the Ocado deal coupled with the acquisition of Home Chef definitely is a move by Kroger to stay abreast in the retail race.Kroger Heats Up the E-Commerce WarOn Wednesday, Kroger announced that it will be buying Chicago-based meal-kit company, Home Chef, in a deal that could amount to $700 million. The initial price is $200 million and could go up to $700 million over the next five years in earnout payments to Home Chef if it meets certain sales and performance targets.Kroger, the largest U.S. supermarket chain by stores and sales, has been testing the market of its own meal kits at its own stores for quite some time now. Understandably, the Home Chef buyout is in a move to stay in the e-commerce race that follows Amazon’s takeover of the Whole Foods Market.Much like a number of other brick-and-mortar stores, Kroger too has been making efforts to survive the e-commerce onslaught. The Home Chef acquisition is definitely give Kroger a shot in the arm, as Home Chef saw its sales jump 150% to $250 million in 2017.Moreover, the tie-up with Ocado last week will help Kroger will help the company run automated warehouses and deliver food with the help of Ocado’s robots. Kroger certainly is taking the challenge to face both Amazon and Walmart, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) with its increased push in grocery and delivery race.Brick-and-Mortar Stores Take Up the ChallengeThe e-commerce retail war heated up after Amazon’s $13.7-billion acquisition of supermarket chain Whole Foods in 2017. Moreover, the e-commerce giant announced two-hour same-day grocery delivery service in February, which set the alarm bells ringing for brick-and-mortar stores like Walmart, Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Dollar Tree (DLTR  -  Free Report) and Dollar General (DG  -  Free Report) that so long rested assured of business safety. Target has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Walmart, undoubtedly, is Amazon’s biggest rival and has been making inroads into the e-commerce space. The brick-and-mortar giant’s recent $16 billion acquisition of India’s e-commerce company Flipkart is been viewed as a bold step toward the online shift.Target too has been increasingly focusing on the e-commerce and delivery front. The company has made e-commerce an important part of its $7 billion turnaround plan. Keeping this mind, Target will be introducing voice-activated shopping with the help of Alphabet, Inc’s (GOOGL) Google assistant. Also, earlier this month the company slashed the next-day delivery feel to almost half to attract more customers.Meanwhile, Dollar Tree has been taking up the challenge by opening more stores. The company will be introducing 650 more stores in 2018 in order to lure more customers. Given that all products at Dollar Tree stores are priced at $1 or below (pricing is its biggest strength) the company is being able to keep itself afloat amid the e-commerce onslaught. Similarly, Dollar General too plans to open 900 stores in 2018.Summing UpThe retail landscape has certainly changed with e-commerce running the show. This definitely has made brick-and-mortar stores sit up and think. However, the race for supremacy seems to be heating up with more players adding muscle to their e-commerce and delivery arm with more acquisitions and technological assistance.Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

812,DG,"Shares of Target (TGT  -  Free Report) tumbled over 5.5% on Wednesday after the retail giant reported lower-than-expected first quarter earnings. This seems like a bit of an overreaction, which means investors might want to take a look at Target’s current growth outlook and other fundamentals to see if they should consider buying Target stock.First QuarterTarget’s adjusted first-quarter earnings climbed roughly 9.4% to touch $1.32 per share, which fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.38. Meanwhile, Target’s Q1 revenues jumped 3.4% to $16.78 billion, topping our estimate of $16.53 billion.The big-box retailer’s digital sales surged 28%, while overall traffic popped 3.7%. This growth helped comp sales pop 3%. Target’s comp growth looks even better compared to rival Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), which saw its U.S. comp sales grow 2.1%, with comp traffic up just 0.8%.Overall, Target investors should be pleased with this top line expansion and same-store sales growth because this is what will matter in the long run as the company invests heavily in its future.Business InitiativesTarget’s bottom line was negatively impacted by an array of new growth initiatives that it undertook to adapt to changing shopping patterns and compete against the likes of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and other online sellers. Target remodeled 56 stores and opened seven new locations, and that's just the start.On top of rolling out three new brands, Target introduced its online ordering, curbside pickup service called “Drive-Up” in more than 250 stores. The company also expanded its “Restock” program nationwide, allowing customers throughout the U.S. to shop from thousands of popular items for next day delivery. Lastly, Target introduced same-day delivery at over 700 locations.Some of these moves are part of Target’s $7 billion reinvestment plan, which currently runs through 2020, to update stores and open smaller locations in urban markets.OutlookMoving on, Target now projects its comparable store sales will grow in the low to mid-single-digit range. The company also expects to report adjusted Q2 earnings between $1.30 and $1.50 per share. This high-side projection comes in well above our current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.34 per share, which marks a nearly 9% climb from the year-ago period.Looking ahead to the current full-year, our estimates are calling for Target’s revenues to hit $72.7 billion, representing a 1.2% climb. Meanwhile, Target’s earnings are projected to surge by over 12% to $5.29 per share. With all that said, let’s move on to Target’s recent price performance, before we take a look at what kind of value the stock presents at the moment.Price MovementComing into Wednesday, shares of Target had climbed roughly 31% over the last year, outpacing the S&P 500’s 13% surge. Target stock has also outperformed its industry’s 23% gain, which includes the likes of Dollar General (DG  -  Free Report), Burlington Stores (BURL  -  Free Report), TJX Companies (TJX  -  Free Report), and others. Year to date, shares of Target have also performed above its industry’s average.Investors will also see that Target stock has crushed Walmart’s performance over the last year. Furthermore, spurred by Wednesday’s decline, Target stock currently rests almost 10% below its 52-week high.ValuationLastly, Target stock is currently trading at 14.2X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which marks a significant discount compared to the broader, nonfood retail-wholesale market industry’s 27.2X. Target stock is also trading well below its industry’s 18.1X.Over the last 5 years, Target stock has traded as high 20.1X, as low as 10.9X, and at a 5-year median of 14.3X.Therefore, investors can say with some confidence that Target stock appears relatively attractive at its current level, especially considering how it stands against its peers and rival Walmart, which is currently trading at 16.9X.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

813,DG,"The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report) was launched on 06/19/2006, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund designed to offer broad exposure to the Consumer Discretionary ETFs category of the U.S. equity market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?The ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on market capitalization weighted indexes that are designed to represent the market or a particular segment of the market.Market cap weighted indexes offer a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns, and are a good option for investors who believe in market efficiency.If you're the kind of investor who would rather try and beat the market through good stock selection, then smart beta funds are your best choice; this fund class is known for tracking non-cap weighted strategies.This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.Even though this space provides many choices to investors--think one of the simplest methodologies like equal-weighting and more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting--not all have been able to deliver first-rate results.Fund Sponsor & IndexXRT is managed by State Street Global Advisors, and this fund has amassed over $359.24 M, which makes it the largest ETF in the Consumer Discretionary ETFs. This particular fund seeks to match the performance of the S&P Retail Select Industry Index before fees and expenses.The S&P Retail Select Industry Index represents the retail sub-industry portion of the S&P TMI. The S&P TMI tracks all the U.S. common stocks listed on the NYSE, AMEX, NASDAQ National Market and NASDAQ Small Cap exchanges. The Retail Index is a modified equal weight index.Cost & Other ExpensesSince cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.35%, making it the least expensive product in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.59%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.For XRT, it has heaviest allocation in the Consumer Discretionary sector --about 86.20% of the portfolio --while Consumer Staples and Healthcare round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Dsw Inc. Class A (DSW  -  Free Report) accounts for about 1.44% of total assets, followed by Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) and Dick's Sporting Goods Inc. (DKS  -  Free Report).The top 10 holdings account for about 13.25% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskXRT has lost about -1.54% so far this year, and as of 04/25/2018, it's up approximately 4.44% in the last one year. In the past 52-week period, the fund has traded between $37.93 and $48.91.The ETF has a beta of 1.06 and standard deviation of 19.12% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium choice in the space.

814,DG,"Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST  -  Free Report) seems somewhat unfazed by the tough retail scenario. While major chains are grappling with sluggish store and mall traffic as consumers switch to online shopping, this Issaquah, WA-based company seems rather resilient to the challenging retail backdrop. The company’s growth strategies, sturdy comparable-store sales (comps) performance, strong membership trends and higher penetration of Citi Visa co-brand card program are the pillars that reinforce its position.Notably, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have advanced 19.2% in the past six months compared with the industry’s growth of 15.8%. Further, the stock is hovering close to its 52-week high of $199.88. There is no doubt why Costco, which shares space with Target (TGT  -  Free Report), could not breach that mark in the near term.Costco continues to be one of the dominant retail wholesalers based on the breadth and quality of merchandise offered. In fact, the strategy to sell products at heavily discounted prices has helped it to remain on growth track. It is also steadily expanding e-commerce capabilities in the United States, Canada, the U.K., Mexico, Korea and Taiwan. As a result, comparable e-commerce sales have surged 33.2%, 38.1% and 34.8% in March, February and January, respectively.Additionally, a differentiated product range enables Costco to provide an upscale shopping experience for its members, consequently resulting in market share gains and higher sales per square foot. Notably, membership fees have increased 12.6% and 9.8% in the second and first quarter of fiscal 2018, respectively.We noted that total revenue grew 10.8% and 13.2% during the second and first quarter of fiscal 2018, respectively.

815,DG,"Kirkland's, Inc. (KIRK  -  Free Report) has been in troubled waters for a while, thanks to higher operating and promotional costs. Consequently, this retailer of home decor products has been reporting losses for quite some time. These headwinds were sufficient to mar investors’ optimism on the Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock that lost close to 13.4% in a year, while the industry declined 5%.Factors Affecting KirklandSince Kirkland’s operates in an extremely consumer-driven environment, changes in spending habits adversely impact its performance. In fact, such a headwind weighed upon the company during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. While Kirkland’s began the fourth quarter on an impressive note, it witnessed a slowdown in store traffic in the latter half due to rapid changes in consumers’ shopping patterns during the holiday season. This in turn, compelled the company to undertake greater-than-anticipated promotional activities which dented merchandise margins, thereby pressurizing the bottom line.Apart from this, Kirkland’s has been incurring higher operating expenses for several quarters due to increase in store occupancy costs. Incidentally, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, store occupancy expenses rose 35 basis points (bps) as a percentage of sales. Also, the company has been struggling with surging outbound freight costs. It witnessed an 85 bps increase in outbound freight costs (including e-commerce shipping) as a percentage of sales, while it also incurred greater central distribution expenses.The company’s dismal past performance has caused the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for first-quarter fiscal 2018 to witness a downtrend.Any Scope of a Turnaround?  While the bottom line has been a concern for Kirkland’s, the company’s top line has been improving year over year for nine straight quarters. The company has been gaining from efforts to enhance merchandise assortments, develop e-commerce business and constant store additions. These factors fueled Kirkland’s sales in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, wherein net sales increased year over year, courtesy of solid comps. Notably, comps (including e-commerce) on a comparable 13-week basis rose 2% in the fourth quarter. Comps were backed by solid e-commerce sales, strength in California and Colorado store sales as well as greater average ticket that compensated for the soft traffic.Additionally, the company has been making several investments like rationalizing SKUs, undertaking repairs at various categories and enhancing pricing as well as mix to enhance overall business efficiency.While Kirkland’s initiatives to improve sales bode well, it is yet to be seen if growth plans can counter the aforementioned hurdles and revive the stock.Unsure About Kirkland’s?

820,DG,"Last week, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) suffered its worst day on Wall Street in more than 30 years, with shares plunging 10.2% on a single day after it reported lower-than-expected fourth-quarter results, primarily because of slower e-commerce sales growth.Naturally, investors are concerned but the company is confident of bouncing back by doubling down on its investments in e-commerce and online grocery sales. Moreover, slower e-commerce sales growth was somewhat expected as this was also the first time that Jet.com sales in the year-ago period was included in e-commerce revenues. Hence, the picture isn’t as gloomy as it looks at first glance.Why Walmart Slipped UpThe most eye-catching development was Walmart’s e-commerce sales growth in the United States that slowed to 23% in the fourth quarter, marking a sharp decline from 50% in the prior quarter. This might have been viewed as a setback for investors but it’s too early to draw conclusions.Incidentally, what most people are overlooking is that last year’s results got a big boost because of its acquisition of Jet.com. Moreover, it was expected that growth would slow because Jet.com’s sales in the year-ago period was included in Walmart’s e-commerce revenues for the first time.That said, Walmart is hopeful of registering 40% growth in online sales this year, which should boost investors’ confidence. Moreover, the panic among investors is not a result of Walmart’s slower e-commerce sales growth but because of increasing competition from Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), which has in the last few years changed the entire retail ballgame by bridging the gap between traditional and online retail. How Amazon Has Changed the Retail GameThe biggest move in the brick-and-mortar space was made by Amazon when it acquired Whole Foods for $13.7 billion in 2017. It slashed the prices of a number of products to enhance its online retail sales, which worked in its favor.The Whole Foods’ acquisition came within a year after Walmart decided to penetrate the e-commerce space with the $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com. The acquisition immediately gave Amazon access to Whole Foods’ 450 stores across the United States, thus providing it enough power to compete with brick-and-mortar giants like Walmart, Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Dollar Tree (DLTR  -  Free Report) and Dollar General (DG  -  Free Report). Walmart has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Moreover, Amazon recently announced that it will offer free, two-hour delivery from Whole Foods’ stores to its Prime members in four cities — Austin, Dallas, Cincinnati and Virginia Beach.Amazon certainly has established its dominance in the online retail space but the other players aren’t lagging either. Walmart continues to be the country’s largest grocer and is trying to tap this space by offering customers the option of ordering online and a free pick-up from the store. Target brought online grocery-delivery company Shift to add muscle to it online delivery arm. Interestingly, Walmart’s shares have increased 28.32% in the last year, while that of Target has risen 13.38%. Dollar Tree and Dollar General’s shares have increased 34.25% and 19.85%, respectively, in the last 12 months.Walmart Fights BackBesides registering slower-than-expected e-commerce sales, Walmart also acknowledged a few mistakes it made during the fourth quarter that negatively impacted its sales. One of these was an increase in TVs, toys and electronics in its warehouses that eliminated space for basic items during peak holiday sales.However, it’s not the end of the road for Walmart as it seems on track to boost its online sales. The company has plans of investing extensively in e-commerce this year, which is expected to drive organic sales by 40% in fiscal 2019. Since acquiring Jet.com, Walmart has spruced up its online services and increased the number of available items.Moreover, it has acquired brands such as Bonobos and ModCloth and intends to revamp its website with a focus on fashion. Also, Walmart recently launched a home shopping vertical on its website with a focus on furniture, accessories and other decorative items. The company is also making huge investments in training its employees.Beyond Brick and MortarOne of biggest strategic moves made by the company lately was to do away with “Stores” from its corporate name in order to give an impression to customers that it doesn’t want to restrict itself to a traditional brick and mortar company. Walmarts’ stores, however, give it an edge over Amazon, its biggest competitor. Keeping that in mind, the company is planning to double the locations offering grocery delivery, which is likely to boost sales.The biggest advantage for Walmart is that it is a lot larger than Amazon in terms of revenues. The company’s 2017 sales crossed $500 billion, making it three times bigger than Amazon. Moreover, while Walmart’s stock nosedived last week, it traded at an all-time high with a 12-month gain of more than 60% in late January just before the market entered correction territory.Not the End of the RoadThe sharp decline in the company’s shares might have made investors skeptical but Walmart has a lot of things going in its favor, with the Republican tax cut likely to help retailers save an astounding $175 billion, per the National Retail Federation (NRA). Moreover, the company is confident of registering 40% growth in online sales in fiscal 2019 with huge investments in e-commerce to include a re-launch of its website along with other initiatives.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

821,DG,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Burlington Stores (BURL  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 9.7% over the past month. BURL hit a new 52-week high of $140.15 in the previous session. Burlington Stores has gained 12.2% since the start of the year compared to the 4.4% move for the Retail-Wholesale sector and the 5.2% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on March 8, 2018, Burlington Stores reported EPS of $2.17 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.09 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2.92%.For the current fiscal year, Burlington Stores is expected to post earnings of $5.76 per share on $6.6 billion in revenues. This represents a 31.81% change in EPS on an 8.5% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $6.74 per share on $7.16 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 16.93% and 8.42%, respectively.Valuation MetricsBurlington Stores may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for BURL? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Burlington Stores has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and D, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 23.9X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 18.6X versus its peer group's average of 15.99X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.30. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Burlington Stores, Inc. Price and Consensus Burlington Stores, Inc. Price and Consensus | Burlington Stores, Inc. QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Burlington Stores currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Burlington Stores passes the test. Thus, it seems as though BURL shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.How Does Burlington Stores Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of Burlington Stores have been moving higher, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also impressive, including Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report), Dillard's (DDS  -  Free Report), and ASOS PLS ADR (ASOMY  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 38% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for BURL, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.

822,DG,"The fight over who will acquire a majority stake in India’s e-commerce retail giant Flipkart is intensifying. According to reports, Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) is already in advanced talks to acquire a 51% stake in Flipkart. On the other hand, Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) too is leaving no stone unturned to capture a significant stake in the company. So much so that Amazon reportedly has offered a breakup fee of nearly $1-$2 billion as part of its bid to acquire a considerable stake in Flipkart. That said, it is too early to predict who will have the last laugh, as none of the three companies have yet commented on this.However, the big question is how much does Flipkart matter to Amazon and Walmart. It surely does, given that Flipkart is the biggest e-commerce company in India and has an enviable customer base in that country, it will only strengthen the presence of both Amazon and Walmart in this vast market. Understandably, India is a lucrative market for both Amazon and Walmart, which are fighting hard to take a lead in the retail race much like every in other country.Flipkart to Help Build Stronger PresenceFlipkart is the world’s third-most funded private company and one of the most successful Indian e-commerce startups. The company has raised more than $7 billion from a number of global investors such as Softbank, Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) and DST Global and has completed quite a significant number of acquisitions in the past few years, thus making it a name synonymous with retail e-commerce in India. For Amazon and Walmart, a stake in Flipkart definitely means a lot, as they will get to operate in a lucrative market.In fact, Flipkart to Indians is much like Amazon and is the biggest e-commerce company. Amazon, on the other hand is the second biggest. Flipkart has overtaken the likes of Snapdeal and other e-commerce companies in India within 10 years of its inception and is clearly ahead of others including Amazon. Understandably, Amazon stands to benefit if it succeeds in acquiring a considerable stake in Flipkart and it will also end the rivalry between the two companies in India. Walmart, on the other hand, too will benefit as it is striving hard to compete with its biggest rival Amazon in the e-commerce space.Moreover, one of the biggest reasons behind Flipkart’s success has been the cash-on-delivery model of business, a feature that has struck a chord with shoppers. Today, most e-commerce companies in India have adopted this model, which has helped them earn the trust of consumers, thereby increasing their revenues.Amazon and Walmart’s India Presence to Get a BoostGlobally, Amazon is clearly ahead of other retail giants like Walmart, Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) Dollar General (DG  -  Free Report) and Dollar Tree (DLTR  -  Free Report) in the e-commerce race. However, Walmart continues to be its closest rivals given that the brick-and-mortar giant is making fast moves to make its online presence felt. Undoubtedly, adding Flipkart will only strengthen Amazon online dominance and at the same time take the competition to the global arena.Moreover, Amazon is the second largest e-commerce company in India and a major reason behind this is that Flipkart enjoys the trust of customers, a lot of which comes from its cash on delivery model of business. If Amazon happens to acquire a considerable stake in Flipkart, it will most likely put an end to this competition. Moreover, Flipkart already has a strong delivery arm much like Amazon has in the United States. This will help Amazon use Flipkart’s logistics wing and aid both the companies to focus more on increasing their revenues instead of competing. This will not only help Flipkart in strengthening its profits but also add muscle to its supply chain and aid in boosting its efficiency in procurement and product assortmentOn the other hand, Walmart has a negligible presence in the estimated $670 billion retail market in India with a meager 21 wholesale stores, while it has no presence in the e-commerce space. The company has been trying hard to make its presence felt in the online retail market since 2014 and adding Flipkart will definitely help it expand its footprint in India. Moreover, Walmart’s failed joint venture with Bharti Enterprises of a 50:50 partnership to run the wholesale cash-and-carry business has left the company with no choice but to acquire an existing business. If the deal fall into place, it is likely to strengthen Walmart’s position against Amazon, by helping it leverage the large market Flipkart caters to. While Amazon sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Walmart carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Summing upAlthough nothing has been finalized yet, Flipkart definitely looks to be a lucrative proposition for both the companies given the huge retail market in India. Moreover, Flipkart too stands to benefit as the company has been incurring losses despite its mass appeal. While, for Walmart, acquiring a considerable stake in Flipkart will help the company get an edge of Amazon in the e-commerce space in India, for Amazon it will become easier to spread out and the same time focus more on its profits that competing with Flipkart in India.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs Pending A medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

828,DG,"GameStop Corp. (GME  -  Free Report) is expected to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 24. In the trailing four quarters, this consumer electronics’ retailer has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 12.7%. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.1%.Let’s delve deep and take a look at the factors that will be influencing the quarterly results.Factors at PlayGameStop has been performing well with respect to its new hardware and software as well as collectibles. In fact, new consoles such as Nintendo Switch, the PS4 Pro and the Xbox One X are driving sales in the hardware category. Also, the investments made in the collectibles business like square footage expansion in its video game stores to offer compelling products have proved conducive to the company. In the last report, collectibles increased 22.8% on a year- over-year basis.Further, management is focused on capitalizing growth opportunities in the areas such as pre-owned and Technology Brands. With regard to this, GameStop is expected to leverage its loyalty program, trade credit benefits as well as develop skills of its sales associates to provide value to customers. Going ahead, it expects Nintendo Switch games to enhance the pre-owned business.However, pre-owned and value video game products sales declined 2.6% year over year in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Further, the company has been witnessing soft performance across its Technology Brands due to some changes in the compensation structure by AT&T, operational execution headwind and delay in launch of the iPhone 8 and iPhone X. Per management, performance of Technology Brands was also not up to the mark in fiscal 2017 and fell short of estimates. Sales at Technology Brands were down 14.2% in the last reported quarter compared with the year-ago period. Unfortunately, AT&T compensation changes will continue lingering and hurting Technology Brands, which in turn is likely to dent the company’s first-quarter results.Additionally, GameStop has been grappling with margin constraints for a while now.  Apparently, gross margin shriveled 380 basis points (bps) in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017. Also, operating margin contracted 250 bps due to higher SG&A expenses.GameStop Corp. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise GameStop Corp. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | GameStop Corp.

Over the last 30 days, the consensus mark has moved south by 5 cents.Zacks ModelOur proven model also does not show that GameStop is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

While, shares of Hibbett have surged 45.5%, the industry gained 7%.However, the company has been grappling with strained margins for a while now.

The reported figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,673 million. The improvement in sales can be attributed to the company’s transformation efforts and other customer-centric initiatives, somewhat offset by soft comps.Comps dropped 0.6% due to lower number of store transactions, somewhat mitigated by higher average transaction amounts. While comps from customer-facing digital networks improved, comps at stores fell at mid-single digits rate.Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. QuoteGross profit slipped 0.7% to $1,333.3 million, while gross profit margin contracted 210 basis points (bps) to 35.9%. Lower margin can be attributed to higher net direct-to-customer shipping expenses, lower merchandise margin, rise in coupon expenses on account of increased redemptions, and increase in average coupon amounts. This coupled with a rise in SG&A expenses led the operating profit to decline nearly 21.6% to $337.1 million. Further, the operating profit margin contracted about 310 bps from the prior-year quarter to 9.1%.Financial PositionBed Bath & Beyond ended fiscal 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of $346.1 million, long-term debt of $1,492.1 million and total shareholders' equity of roughly $2,888.6 million.In fiscal 2017, the company generated cash flow of about $859.7 million from operating activities, while deploying nearly $375.8 million toward capital expenditures.Share Buyback & DividendIn the fiscal fourth quarter, the company bought back 2 million shares for nearly $45 million, under the current buyback plan of $2.5 billion.

Further, the company is likely to adopt a new revenue recognition accounting standard in the first quarter, which should have a minimal impact on fiscal 2018 results.However, fiscal 2018 earnings are likely to be impacted to the tune of 5 cents per share due to the absence of the 53rd week compared with the previous year.

Bed, Bath & Beyond anticipates an earnings shift from the third quarter to the fourth quarter as well.For fiscal 2018, the company expects consolidated net sales to remain relatively flat to marginally up year over year. Driven by persistent growth in the customer-facing digital channel, the company envisions comps to increase in the low-single digit percentage range.Furthermore, Bed, Bath & Beyond projects gross margin deleverage in fiscal 2018 mainly owing to continued investment in the customer value proposition and the constant shift to the digital channels. SG&A is estimated to increase on account of investments toward transformation. However, the company expects to witness operating margin decline lower than that in fiscal 2017.

835,DG,"Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) recently announced that it will be adding 500 Pickup Towers to its U.S. stores by the end of 2018. Understandably, this is in a move to stay in the retail race and compete with Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), which has changed the retail landscape over the last few years.Pickup Towers help customers collect their online orders from tall kiosks inside Walmart stores. Given that Walmart is primarily a brick-and-mortar giant, the company is playing to its strength, much like Amazon is making use of its strong delivery arm to win customer loyalty.Although Amazon has a similar service, Amazon Lockers, Walmart certainly has an edge over the e-commerce behemoth given that it has more physical stores. And more Pickup Towers will only help the company in luring a greater number of customers. Amazon, in the last few years, has redefined the retail space, tapering the gap between online and offline. Walmart’s decision to add more towers in its stores is another instance of other retail giants following in Amazon’s footsteps.Walmart Pickup Towers to Boost Online SalesWalmart is trying to compete with Amazon by offering discounts on its online products only if customers pick up the goods from stores instead of having them shipped to their homes. Naturally, the decision to add 500 Pickup Towers is aimed at increasing online sales. The company introduced Pickup Towers in 2017. Pickup Towers allow customers to order online and then pick up their orders from these 16-feet-tall orange vending machines inside Walmart Stores.Already, Walmart has 200 Pickup Towers and the idea of adding 500 more comes after the company witnessed more than 500,000 orders being sent to the towers. Walmart believes that the expansion will give 40% of the country’s population access to Pickup Towers by the end of 2018. Understandably, Walmart is getting mileage out of its key strength, its well-distributed brick-and-mortar stores across the country.Walmart will also be debuting Pickup Lockers inside its towers, which will store expensive and fragile purchases like televisions, for safety reasons. Moreover, Walmart has another concept similar to Pickup Towers in mind. For this, it has entered into a partnership with Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report), wherein customers will be able to place orders using Google’s voice-activated digital assistant.  Amazon on the other hand only has Whole Foods stores, which it acquired for a whopping $13.7 billion in 2017, to bank on for this line of expansion. So Walmart certainly will have an advantage over Amazon in this regard.That said, the expansion is a strategic move, wherein Walmart will be able to stay in the retail race by embracing technology and e-commerce and at the same time cut down on costs. For Walmart, shipping products to its stores will cost a lot less than using its fleet of more than 6,700 delivery trucks to drop packages at individual homes.Amazon Intensifies CompetitionAmazon’s strong delivery arm has been its strength and it is giving stiff competition to brick-and-mortar giant Walmart. In February, the company started offering free-two-hour delivery service from Whole Food stores to its Prime members.Naturally, the idea is to lure more customers on the convenience quotient and the two-hour delivery service has certainly given Amazon enough power to compete with brick-and-mortar giants like Walmart, Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report), Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) and Dollar Tree, Inc. (DLTR  -  Free Report).And despite not having too many physical stores like Walmart, Amazon is making strategic moves through innovations. Much like Walmart, Amazon has a similar facility, Amazon Lockers, a parcel delivery service, wherein customers can select locker locations as their delivery address and pick up orders.Moreover, Amazon recently launched its Hub delivery lockers. These lockers can be installed in apartment complexes and customers can pick up their orders from nearby lockers.While Walmart has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), Amazon sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

836,DG,"Zumiez Inc.  is slated to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Mar 15. Last quarter, the company delivered earnings in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.In fact, the company surpassed estimates in the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 22.2%.Zumiez Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Zumiez Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Zumiez Inc. Quote What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Zumiez will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 90 cents per share, reflecting 21.6% growth from the year-ago quarter. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter has been stable in the last 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues of $301.8 million, up 14.5% from the year-ago quarter.Moreover, we note that the company’s shares have outperformed the industry in the past month. The stock has inched up 1.9%, while the industry has dipped 0.6%. Factors at PlayA mall-based specialty retailer of action sports-related products, Zumiez has been riding on robust top and bottom-line surprise trends alongside solid comps performance in recent months. Though the company’s earnings matched estimates in third-quarter fiscal 2017, it has delivered a positive earnings surprise in the preceding eight quarters. Moreover, sales topped estimates for the sixth straight quarter. Additionally, it has reported positive comps in the last five quarters.Zumiez’s favorable comps trend continued in January 2018 having delivered 6.3% growth in the metric for the month. Moreover, sales surged 33.6% to $66 million. Excluding the 53rd week, sales rose 12.8%.Backed by higher-than-anticipated sales in January, the company now expects earnings per share for fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 at the higher end of its previously guided range of 88-90 cents.Additionally, Zumiez has been gaining from its efforts to keep pace with the evolving retail trends, evident from its focus on omni-channel development. Its strategic initiatives, authentic lifestyle positioning and commitment to enhancing customer service place it well for market-share gains.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively show that Zumiez is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

837,DG,"Ulta Beauty, Inc. (ULTA  -  Free Report) is slated to announce fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings on Mar 15. In the preceding quarter, it came up with a positive earnings surprise of 1.8%.In the trailing four quarters, the company’s earnings outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 4.1%. In fact, it delivered an earnings beat for 16 straight quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Ulta Beauty Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Ulta Beauty Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Ulta Beauty Inc. Quote What to Expect?Investors are keen on finding out whether Ulta Beauty will be able to continue with its positive earnings surprise streak in the to-be-reported period. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2017 is pegged at $2.77 per share, reflecting year-over-year growth of 23.7%. However, the consensus mark has been witnessing a downtrend in the last 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.94 billion, representing a 22.6% increase from the year-ago quarter.Nonetheless, we note that shares of the company have underperformed the industry in the past six months. The stock has declined 9%, wider than the industry’s decrease of 0.9%. Factors at PlayUlta Beauty has been gaining from its effective marketing initiatives, loyalty program, sturdy e-commerce business, superb salon operations as well as strength in prestige cosmetics. Additionally, a favorable traffic is driving comparable store sales (comps) growth. Its notable growth in e-commerce sales has also helped it stand out amid intense online competition.Furthermore, Ulta Beauty has maintained a solid earnings surprise trend, having reported 16 straight quarters of earnings beat. The company’s top line has also surpassed estimates in 15 of the last 16 quarters. Robust top and bottom-line performances can be attributed to enhanced market share gains and benefits from attractive loyalty program offers. Additionally, the company is witnessing sturdy growth across all product categories with prestige cosmetics standing out.Looking ahead, the company expects comps growth (including e-commerce) in the 10-11% range for fiscal 2017. Meanwhile, it anticipates e-commerce sales growth of 50-60%. Earnings per share are envisioned to rise in the band of high 20s’ percentage.However, declining margins and stiff competition remain impediments. Ulta Beauty witnessed contraction of both gross and operating margins in the fiscal third quarter. Also, the company is exposed to risk in the customer-driven industry as cheaper alternatives might hinder buyers’ loyalty for the brand, thereby impacting the sale of products under Ulta banner.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively show that Ulta Beauty is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

838,DG,"Williams-Sonoma, Inc. (WSM  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 23, after the market closes.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.07%. Earnings surpassed estimates in two of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 3.2%.Let’s discuss some of the key factors that might influence the company’s first-quarter fiscal 2018 results.E-commerce Growth StrongImportantly, sales from e-commerce channel are an important source of revenues. In 2017, the company saw a 5.5% growth in e-commerce channel. The upside was driven by the West Elm brand, the Williams-Sonoma brand, the company’s newer businesses Rejuvenation and Mark and Graham along with international operations. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.Brand PerformanceComing to the different brands, Pottery Barn — the company’s largest brand — is expected to witness comps growth of 1.8% in the quarter to be reported, per the consensus estimate. Pottery Barn Kids’ comparable revenues are likely to grow 1.5% in the first quarter, reflecting an improvement from a rise of 0.9% in the prior quarter. PBteen is likely to see 6% comps growth in the quarter, reflecting improvement from a rise of 2.6% reported in the preceding quarter.The West Elm brand has also been witnessing significant growth, courtesy of the addition of new stores and comps growth. Comps are currently growing in the double-digit range and are expected to witness 10% growth in the to-be-reported quarter, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company’s namesake brand is expected to witness comps growth of 1.5%, reflecting a decline from 4.3% growth in the prior quarter.Williams-Sonoma’s focus on enhancing customer experience through improved and innovative marketing techniques looks encouraging. The company is using web tools that utilize augmented reality, creating videos on social media sites and making digital advertisements. Such initiatives along with innovative products are likely to help the company generate higher sales in the to-be-reported quarter.For the first quarter of 2018, the company expects net revenues in the band of $1.13-$1.17 million, reflecting an improvement from $1.11 million in the prior-year quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.16 billion, showing an increase of 4.6% year over year.High Costs to Hurt MarginAs Williams-Sonoma derives substantial revenues from efficient catalog circulation and digital marketing, it is affected by costs associated with continued investments in e-commerce. Further, supply chain investments are denting the company’s operating margins. In fact, in 2017, the company’s operating margin contracted 70 basis points (bps) year over year. High costs might mar first-quarter fiscal 2018 results to some extent.Overall, the company expects earnings per share in the range of 55-60 cents in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, compared with 51 cents in the prior-year quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 57 cents per share, reflecting an increase of 11.8% year over year.Quantitative Model PredictionWilliams-Sonoma does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — to increase the odds of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Williams-Sonoma has an Earnings ESP of -2.37%.Zacks Rank: The company carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).We caution investors against the stock going into the earnings announcement, as a negative Earnings ESP combined with a Zacks Rank #4 lowers the possibility of an earnings beat.Williams-Sonoma, Inc.

840,DG,"Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) posted first-quarter fiscal 2019 results, wherein both earnings and revenues improved year over year and exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate. With this, Walmart reverted to its positive earnings surprise track, after delivering a miss in the fourth quarter. Also, the company’s U.S. comparable-store sales (comps) increased for the 15th straight period.Walmart has long been gaining from its constant efforts to combat the growing dominance of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report). In this regard, the company recently clinched contracts to buy a 77% stake in Flipkart, which is expected to hurt its bottom line for a while. This has made investors somewhat apprehensive about this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock that has lost 17.2% in three months, compared to the industry’s decline of 16.8%. Quarter in DetailWalmart’s adjusted earnings of $1.14 per share came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.12 and surged 14% year over year. Including one-time items, earnings slumped 28% to 72 cents per share. Walmart Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Walmart Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Walmart Inc. Quote Total revenues advanced 4.4% to $122.7 billion that surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of nearly over $120 billion. The upside was driven by strength at the U.S. and international businesses. On a currency-neutral basis, total revenues advanced 2.7% to $120.7 billion.Consolidated operating income slipped 1.6% to approximately $5.2 billion, whereas the operating income margin contracted 200 basis points to 4.2%.

U.S. comps, excluding fuel, jumped 2.1%, compared with 1.4% growth in the prior-year quarter While comp traffic improved 0.8%, average ticket inched up 1.3% in the quarter. Moreover, e-commerce sales positively impacted quarterly comp sales at Walmart U.S. by 100 bps.Notably, e-commerce sales in the segment jumped 33%, much better than a 23% rise reported in the fourth quarter. E-commerce sales in the first quarter improved on the back of strength across Walmart.com and online grocery, keeping management encouraged about achieving 40% growth in fiscal 2019. Operating income at the segment dipped 3.1% to over $3.9 billion.Walmart International: Segment net sales went up by 11.7% to $30.3 billion. On a currency-neutral basis, net sales improved 4.5% to $28.3 billion, gaining largely from solid Walmex performance. In fact, eight out of 11 markets delivered favorable comps, including four of Walmart’s largest markets.  Further, operating income rose 11.1% to $1.3 billion.

However, comps were hurt to an extent of about 140 bps from lower tobacco sales.Comps were backed by traffic that grew 5.6%, while ticket dipped 1.8%. E-commerce sales positively impacted comps by approximately 100 basis points in the quarter. The segment generated an operating income of $0.3 million, down 18.5% year over year.Other Financial UpdatesWalmart ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of roughly $7,885 million, long-term debt of nearly $29,477 million, long-term capital lease and financing obligations of $6,828 million and shareholders’ equity (excluding noncontrolling interest) of $75,552 million.In the first quarter of 2018, Walmart generated cash flow from operations of $5.2 billion and incurred capital expenditures of $1.8 billion, resulting in free cash flow of $3.3 billion. Walmart paid $1.5 billion in dividends and made share buybacks worth $0.5 billion during the quarter.Recent Developments & ViewApart from announcing investments in Flipkart, Walmart recently unveiled intentions to combine its UK grocery unit, Asda with J Sainsbury. Additionally, the company plans to divest its banking operations in Walmart Chile and Walmart Canada.Overall, management remains pleased with the solid start to fiscal 2019 and is on track to further strengthen its digital operations and enhance its business portfolio. However, management expects investment in Flipkart to dent fiscal 2019 earnings per share by 25-30 cents, if the deal is concluded at the end of the second quarter.Retail Stocks You Can’t MissDollar General (DG  -  Free Report), with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) has a long-term earnings per share growth rate of 14.6%.

841,DG,"Big Lots, Inc. (BIG  -  Free Report) is expected to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Mar 2. Notably, the company’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate for eight straight quarters now, with a trailing four-quarter average of 11.1%.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.42 for the fiscal fourth quarter has moved up by a penny in the last 30 days and is likely to witness a year-over-year growth of more than 7%. Analysts polled by Zacks also expect revenues of $1,649 million in the impending quarter, up nearly 4.3% from the year-ago quarter.Big Lots, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Big Lots, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Big Lots, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up prior to the earnings announcement.Factors Likely to Impact 4Q17Big Lots’ furniture financing programs and soft home category have been consistently gaining traction, which is likely to continue in the fourth quarter as well. Meanwhile, management has been expanding assortments in the furniture category by including lawn and garden items. In order to tap the opportunities in the furniture and soft home categories, the company also added more brands and revamped the food department by giving it a fresh look for the convenience of customers. Moreover, the company’s merchandising strategies and effective marketing seem to be paying off quite well.Notably, all these initiatives are driving the company’s comparable-store sales (comps), which increased in 13 of the trailing 15 quarters. For the fourth quarter, comps are expected to be up in the range of flat to up 2%. Comps are likely to grow roughly 1% in fiscal 2017. Further, adjusted earnings per share are envisioned in the band of $4.23-$4.28 for the fiscal, which represents growth of 16-18% from the previous year. For fiscal 2017, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at $4.30.However, Big Lots is not doing well on the revenue front. Its sales have lagged estimates in seven of the last nine quarters. Also, management had earlier trimmed sales guidance for fiscal 2017. Sales growth for the year is projected to be up approximately 2% compared with 2-2.5% anticipated earlier. Analysts surveyed by Zacks expect revenues of $5.28 billion for the fiscal year.Moreover, sluggishness in electronics, toys and accessories remains a concern. Gross margin is expected to decline year over year in the final quarter of fiscal 2017 as well.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Nonetheless, our proven model shows that Big Lots is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

842,DG,"Despite reporting better-than-expected earnings for nine straight quarters, Big Lots Inc. (BIG  -  Free Report) stock was down 10.1% on Mar 9.

Increase in sales was owing to  an extra week this quarter, which overshadowed the negative impact from lower store count year over year. Decline in comps was the biggest surprise this quarter. Comps were down 0.1%, lower than the company’s guided range of flat to up 2%. Notably, comps had declined in only three out of the trailing 16 quarters.While, the company’s gross profit grew 4.4% year over year to $682 million, gross margin expanded 10 basis points to 41.5%.

843,DG,"A favorable event lures investors, while an unfavorable one drives them away from the market. The current investment scenario has turned topsy-turvy of late, as tensions about a possible trade war between two of the world’s biggest economies flared up.Wall Street investors are playing safe with the hope that the United States and China amicably settle all disputes. However, the market has already paid the price for confrontation with China over trade policies. In a month, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 5.5%, while the S&P 500 declined approximately 6.5%. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index shed roughly 8.5%.Nonetheless, ignoring the market jitters, a few stocks have managed to rise 10% or more in a month. Here we have highlighted four such stocks from the Retail-Wholesale sector. Notably, per the latest Earnings Outlook, as of Apr 6, the sector is expected to record top and bottom-line growth of 7.6% and 12%, respectively, in the current reporting cycle.With unemployment rate still at 17-year low, consumer spending being favorable and government expenditure increasing, things appear to be fairly rosy for the U.S. economy. Notably, a strengthening labor market may lead to gradual wage acceleration, and in turn boost consumer confidence. All these sound constructive for retailers.We expect this positive sentiment to translate into higher consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. We note that consumer spending ticked up 0.2% in February, following an equal rise in January.Meanwhile, personal income surged $67.3 billion or 0.4% in February, marking the third straight month of a similar percentage increase. All these factors paint a bright picture for retailers, who are also benefiting from the corporate tax rate cut.4 Prominent PicksIt is quite apparent that the market has witnessed a slew of events and to fetch higher returns amid such an investment climate is a difficult task.

The world’s largest retailer’s operations and popularity outside the United States has been one of the major factors shaping its growth story. In fact, international forms Walmart’s second-largest segment (by revenues) with operations spread across China, Mexico, Canada and UK.Incidentally, sales from Walmart’s international unit formed about 24% of its total revenues in the last quarter, trailing 65% contribution from its largest U.S. division.

846,DG,"The Gap, Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 24. The company has delivered a positive earnings surprise in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average of 11.1%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings is pegged at 45 cents, mirroring a year-over-year improvement of 25%. However, the estimate has moved down by a penny in the last seven days.The Gap, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  The Gap, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | The Gap, Inc. QuoteLet’s delve deeper to see how things are shaping up prior to the quarterly earnings announcement.What You Should KnowGap remains committed toward its growth strategy, which mainly focuses on the Old Navy and Athleta brands. Management expects net sales of more than $10 billion and $1 billion, respectively, at each of the brands over the next few years, with these gains coming as a result of U.S. store expansion and mobile and e-commerce growth. Also, the company’s comps have been benefiting from robust Old Navy performance fueled by strength in category and improved traffic since the past few quarters.In addition, the company’s solid focus on enhancing product quality and responsiveness to changing consumer trends bode well. Also, Gap’s endeavors to enhance the e-commerce and omni-channel capabilities by adopting a number of initiatives are commendable. Notably, the company has increased online presence across all of its brands. This, in turn, has made Gap’s online division the most profitable one, posting double-digit sales growth. In the fiscal first quarter, these factors are likely to add value to the company’s top-line growth and profitability.Notably, analysts surveyed by Zacks expect sales of $3.61 billion, up nearly 5% from the year-ago period. For Old Navy brand, the consensus estimate for sales is pegged at $1,634 million, up 4.6% year over year.However, Gap’s significant international presence exposes it to adverse currency fluctuations, which might adversely impact the company’s top and bottom line. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, currency dented earnings per share growth by about 2 cents per share. Also, currency woes along with stiff industry completion and other macroeconomic headwinds remain threats.Softness across the company’s namesake and Banana Republic brands also remains a concern. Notably, for the sales at Gap and Banana Republic brands the consensus mark is pegged at $1,152 million and $514 million, respectively, reflecting a year-over-year decline of about 1% for both brands.Given this backdrop, let’s wait and see what lies ahead of Gap in first-quarter fiscal 2018.Zacks ModelOur proven model does not show that Gap is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Gap has an Earnings ESP of -6.06% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which makes surprise prediction impossible.As it is we caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revision.Stocks Likely to Beat EarningsHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Urban Outfitters, Inc.

847,DG,"Investors on the lookout for stocks with the potential for maximum growth and value investing may consider the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy.This popular strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks with impressive growth prospects that are trading at a discount. GARP investing employs popular value metrics — price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book value (P/B) ratio — to evaluate whether a stock is undervalued.GARP Metrics – Mix of Growth & Value MetricsThe GARP approach helps identify stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth history and impressive prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, picking stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a preferred tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics — price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is another value metric that is considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Last 5-year EPS & projected 3–5 year EPS growth rates between 10% and 20% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)ROE (over the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)P/E and P/B ratios less than M-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicates that the stocks are undervalued.)These few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only 16.Here are seven of the 16 stocks that made it through the screen:VMware, Inc. (VMW  -  Free Report) provides virtualization solutions from the desktop to the data center. The company delivered an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 3.8%.

848,DG,"Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Mar 1, after the closing bell.The company has been gaining from the smooth execution of customer strategy along with disciplined inventory management. Also, it is enhancing market share through persistent store expansion and strengthening capabilities via further investments. Notably, these initiatives helped the company to deliver sixth straight positive earnings surprise in third-quarter fiscal 2017, wherein sales marked its second successive beat. However, higher expenses continue to remain a headwind, which are likely to weigh upon the company’s near-term margin performance.Nordstrom, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Nordstrom, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Nordstrom, Inc. QuoteThe Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.24 for the fourth quarter reflects a year-over-year decline of 9.5%, though it remained stable in the last 30 days. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues to come in at $4,611 million, up 6.8% from the prior-year quarter. Furthermore, the consensus mark for sales at Nordstrom full-line stores and Nordstrom Rack are pegged at $2,060 million and $1,097 million, respectively, showing year-over-year increases of 38.4% and 13.6%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the earnings announcement.Factors at PlayNordstrom is making significant progress with respect to its customer-based strategy and is on track to reach its long-term growth target of $20 billion by 2020. With regard to cost savings, the company plans to strike a balance between its sales and expense growth. Also, it is focused on advancing in the technology space by boosting e-commerce and digital networks, and improving its supply-chain channels and marketing efforts. Management anticipates online penetration to exceed 25% by the end of the year.Recently, the company also released sales and comparable store sales (comps) for the combined months of November and December, which primarily comprises the holiday season. Nordstrom recorded a 2.5% increase in net sales for the nine weeks (ended Dec 30, 2017) while comps for the period rose 1.2%. The solid holiday show was primarily driven by growth in Nordstrom’s full-line and Rack stores compared with the year-to-date sales performance and persistent strength in e-commerce at Nordstrom.com and Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook.Driven by the robust holiday sales, management raised its previously stated guidance for fiscal 2017. The company now expects sales growth of nearly 4.2%, including the 53rd week, with comps expected to gain 0.5%. Additionally, Nordstrom anticipates earnings in the range of $2.90-$2.95 per share, marking an increase from the prior guidance range of $2.85-$2.95 per share. The revised guidance assumes strong sales growth, persistent stability in merchandise margins and higher supply chain, technology, and occupancy costs related to the company’s growth initiatives.These factors have boosted the company’s share price performance in the last three months. The stock has gained 22.7% compared with the industry’s growth of 11.7%.Though Nordstrom’s growth strategy bodes well, higher investments related to occupancy, technology, supply chain and marketing are likely to hurt the company’s performance. Apparently, the company’s merchandise margin was hurt by higher occupancy expenses related to new Rack and Canada stores in the fiscal third quarter. This led contraction in gross margins and increase in SG&A expenses. For fiscal 2017, the company anticipates Retail gross profit to be impacted by higher new store occupancy expenses and mix impact from off-price growth.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not show that Nordstrom is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen.

849,DG,"Avon Products Inc. (AVP  -  Free Report) is no more in investors' good books, thanks to its dismal surprise trend. The company’s soft sales and earnings numbers have largely weighed on the stock’s performance. Its bleak prospects are evident from the recent fall in estimates and its Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Stock Continues to DeclineShares of Avon have declined around 35.4% in the past month, significantly wider than the industry’s fall of 8.5%. Additionally, the stock has witnessed a downside of 24.8% since reporting soft first-quarter 2018 results on May 3.Avon delivered in-line earnings in first-quarter 2018. However, the company lagged earnings estimates in eight of the last 11 quarters. Furthermore, it has an unimpressive top-line surprise trend, with a negative sales surprise in five of the trailing seven quarters. This dismal sales trend can be attributed to soft Representatives growth.Avon Products, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Avon Products, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Avon Products, Inc. QuoteEstimates DeclineFollowing the dismal first quarter, the company’s estimates for the next quarter and full year witnessed a downtrend.The Zacks Consensus Estimate moved downward in the last 30 days. Notably, estimates of 1 cent per share for the second quarter moved down by a penny. Additionally, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 declined from 18 cents per share to 13 cents while estimates for 2018 declined by 7 cents to 21 cents.Soft Active Representatives Hurt PerformanceAvon has been troubled by soft Active Representatives growth for the past several quarters. This has been a major hurdle in the company’s efforts to revive top and bottom lines. Notably, the top line was impacted by lower Active Representatives as well as challenges in key markets in the first quarter of 2018. Active Representatives declined 4%, driven by fall in South Latin America and North Latin America. Moreover, Ending Representatives dipped 1% on account of softness in South Latin America and North Latin America, offset by growth in Europe, Middle East & Africa.Though management has been aggressively trying to boost Representatives, this might take some time.  Management anticipates the intensely competitive environment in Brazil to adversely impact pricing despite the improving economy.Competition to Take a TollAvon faces intense competition from cosmetics products retailers in the domestic and international markets. Changing market trends and evolving consumer preferences might also weigh on the performance and hurt overall profits.Forget Avon, Check These Stocks That Witnessed Positive Estimate RevisionsInter Parfums Inc’s (IPAR  -  Free Report) earnings estimates for full-year 2018 have increased by 3 cents to $1.60 per share in the last seven days while estimates for 2019 rose 5 cents to $1.82 per share.

850,DG,"Gap Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Mar 1. The company has been progressing well backed by its solid focus on enhancing product quality and responsiveness to changing consumer trends. Apparently, the company has pulled off a positive earnings surprise in three consecutive quarters, with a trailing four-quarter average beat of 10.3%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 59 cents, reflecting year-over-year growth of 15.7%. Also, the estimate has moved up by a penny in the last seven days. Gap, Inc. (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Gap, Inc. (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Gap, Inc. (The) QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up prior to the earnings announcement.Factors at PlayGap remains committed toward its growth strategy, which mainly focuses on the Old Navy and Athleta brands. The company, which had reported growth in comparable-store sales (comps) in the preceding four quarters owing to Old Navy’s robust performance, is likely to continue the momentum in the fourth quarter.Earlier, management had stated that comps reflected strength for the fiscal fourth quarter owing to persistent momentum at key areas of the company’s business. For fiscal 2017, comps are anticipated to grow in low-single digits versus previous projection of flat to marginal improvement.Moreover, comps performance buoyed Gap’s top line, delivering fourth straight beat in the fiscal third quarter. Encouragingly, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $4,667 million in the quarter under review, up nearly 5.4% year over year. Markedly, the consensus estimates for the Old Navy, Gap and Banana Republic brands are pegged at $2,118 million, $1,610 million and $713 million, respectively, representing year-over-year increases of 20.5%, 21.8% and 28%.Also, Gap’s solid strategic efforts are well reflected in the company’s share price movement. In a year’s time, the stock surged 31% substantially outperforming the industry’s gain of 1.5%.Furthermore, Gap continues to focus on boosting its digital and mobile offerings, omni-channel capabilities as well as enhancing its footprint in the value and active space. Backed by these initiatives and a sturdy performance in the nine months of fiscal 2017, management raised outlook for the year as well. For fiscal 2017, Gap envisions adjusted earnings per share in the range of $2.08-$2.12, up from $2.02-$2.10 projected earlier.However, Gap’s significant international presence exposes it to adverse currency fluctuations, which might adversely impact the company’s top and bottom lines. In the third-quarter, currency headwinds impacted the bottom-line growth by nearly 3 percentage points.  What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model shows that Gap is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

851,DG,"Stocks opened higher on Friday after the February jobs report came in ahead of expectations and cooled concerns about rising inflation. But as the latest employment numbers seemingly confirm the overall health of the U.S. economy, recent earnings results in the retail sector have started to raise questions about the state of consumer spending.For the most part, fourth-quarter earnings season was relatively strong. However, results in the retail space were somewhat mixed. Total earnings growth from the sector’s S&P 500 members broke 9% on the back of 9.6% higher revenues, which is an impressive trend.But of the 195 companies in our “Retail and Wholesale” that have reported so far, only 56% have managed to surpass earnings estimates—and over the past few days, we have seen disappointing reports from Kroger (KR  -  Free Report), Costco (COST  -  Free Report), Dollar Tree (DLTR  -  Free Report), and more (also read: Kroger Extends Disappointing Week for Retail Sector Earnings Reports).The traditional earnings season is effectively over, but a few marquee reports—especially in the retail sector—remain to be released. Investors should remember that they can always use the Zacks Earnings Calendar to plan out their schedules for earnings, dividend announcements, and other important financial releases. This handy tool is your perfect one-stop-shop to properly prepare for the market events that will have an impact on your own portfolio.Today, we’ve made that task even easier for you. Using the Earnings Calendar, we looked ahead to next week and selected most-important retail reports to watch. Make sure to keep an eye on these companies as they prepare to report during the week of March 12!1. Dick’s Sporting Good’s, Inc. (DKS  -  Free Report)Sporting goods retailer Dick’s is scheduled to release its latest quarterly financial results before the market opens on March 13. Dick’s recently grabbed headlines for its decision to change its own gun sales rules in the wake of several mass shootings, but now investors will want to see how the company has actually been performing lately.DKS is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Based on our latest Zacks Consensus Estimate, we expect the company to report adjusted earnings of $1.20 per share, down about 9% year over year. However, total quarterly revenues are expect to improve nearly 10% to touch $2.73 billion. 2. Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report)Discount retail giant Dollar General is slated to post its most recent quarterly earnings report before the opening bell on March 15. The pressure will be on the company after fellow “dollar store” retailer Dollar Tree failed to impress this week. DG is currently holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for adjusted earnings of $1.48 per share and revenues of $6.22 billion. This earnings results would be basically flat year over year, while the revenue projection would mark a 3.5% improvement. The key for Dollar General will be whether or not its core customer base—lower income families—have started to feel a noticeable tax break and have been spending the extra money for shopping purposes. 3. Ulta Beauty Inc. (ULTA  -  Free Report)Beauty retailer Ulta is expected to report its latest quarterly financial results after the market closes on March 15. Ulta was a Wall Street darling for most of 2016 thanks to strong comps and EPS growth, but the stock struggled last year as growth rates began to slow a bit. However, the company still has plenty of attractive growth opportunities.Ulta is holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). According to our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates, the company is expected to report adjusted earnings of $2.77 per share and revenues of $1.94 billion. These results would both represent year-over-year growth of about 23%. Want more market analysis from this author?

852,DG,"A slew of traditional retailers and department store chains filed for bankruptcy this year, as they were affected by changing customer habits, price wars and consumers’ inclination towards online shopping.However, record end-of-year holiday season sales have given them a shot in the arm as Americans continue to feel optimistic about their financial wealth as a result of strengthening economy and a stable labor market. Such buoyancy will further drive retailers in the upcoming year. This calls for investors to double down on the hottest retailers right away.2017 – A Tough Year for RetailersThe traditional retail industry witnessed one of its most difficult years, with store closing announcements touching a record 7,000, per retail think tank Fung Global Retail and Technology. So far in 2017, about 662 retailers have filed for bankruptcy, up 30% from the same period last year, according to BankruptcyData.com. While most bankrupt retailers were small mom-and-pop stores, major retailers on the list included Toys R Us, Payless Shoes, Gymboree and Rue21. In fact, The Limited closed down and RadioShack shut almost all of its remaining stores. Understandably, this is because shoppers have made it clear that they want to do shopping on their smartphones instead of hitting traditional brick-and-mortar stores.However, experts did say not to count on it, as they believe that the demise of traditional retailing is overblown. After all, store openings also increased this year compared with last year, as per Fung. Lest we forget that two bargain brands Dollar Tree (DLTR  -  Free Report) and Dollar General (DG  -  Free Report), recently, announced their store opening plans. Tom McGee, CEO of the International Council of Shopping Centers, a trade group of mall owners, said that occupancy rate at the nation’s malls have escalated about 93% this year.Retailers Saw Best Holiday Season Sales Since 2011Retailers are also witnessing plenty of green this holiday season. Total retail sales jumped 4.9% compared with the same period last year. This turned out to be the largest year-over-year uptick since 2011, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse report released on Dec 26.  Some of the largest jumps were seen in electronics and appliances. The segment climbed 7.5% and registered the strongest growth in the last 10 years. Home furniture and furnishings grew 5.1% and so did home improvement. Department stores and specialty apparel saw moderate gains, which is quite encouraging given the recent store closings. The jewelry segment also gained 5.9%, primarily driven by last-minute sales.The strong economy was a contributing factor but a pretty low unemployment rate encouraged investors even more to spend this holiday season. Moreover, consumers continue to feel confident and optimistic about spending this year and beyond.Jobless Rate at Record Low, Consumer Confidence Steady The unemployment rate was at 4.1% in November and continues to remain at a 17-year low. The U6 unemployment rate was 8% last month, up from 7.9% in the prior month. But, the broadest measure of unemployment and underemployment remained near the lowest since 2006.U.S. employers also added 228,000 jobs in November, steering past expectations of 200,000. In fact, job additions in the U.S. economy topped the 200,000 mark for the second straight month, reflecting a bounce back after hurricanes in Texas and Florida affected hiring in September (read more: 4 Best Staffing Stocks to Buy on Blockbuster Jobs Report).A key measure of U.S. consumer sentiment slipped for the second straight month in December but continued to show an uptick in household confidence during the holiday shopping period. The University of Michigan’s survey of consumer attitudes came in at 95.9 in early December, down from 98.5 in November. However, Richard Curtin, Michigan survey’s chief economist, said that on an average, consumer sentiment this year was the highest since 2000.2018 Could be Retail’s Big Comeback Year: 5 Must BuysGiven the aforesaid positives, investing in sound retail stocks seems judicious.

853,DG,"Williams-Sonoma, Inc. (WSM  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Mar 14, after the market closes.Last quarter, the company’s earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Williams-Sonoma surpassed earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 3.24%.Let’s see us discuss some of the key factors that might influence the company’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results.Marketing Initiatives Boosts DemandWilliams-Sonoma’s focus on enhancing customer experience through improved and innovative marketing techniques is encouraging. The company is using web tools that utilize augmented reality, creating videos on social media sites and making digital advertisements. Such initiatives along with innovative products are likely to help the company generate higher sales in the to-be-reported quarter.For the fourth quarter of 2017, the company expects net revenues in the band of $1.61-$1.68 billion, reflecting an improvement from $1.16 billion reported in the prior-year quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.65 billion, showing an increase of 4.3% year over year. Notably, less furniture sale occurs in the fourth quarter for the holiday season.Brand PerformanceComing to the different brands, Pottery Barn — the company’s largest brand — is expected to witness comps growth of 0.75% in the to-be-reported quarter, per the consensus estimate. Pottery Barn Kids’ comparable revenues are likely to increase 2% in the fourth quarter, compared with an increase of 0.1% in the prior quarter. PBteen is likely to see 3% comps growth in the fourth quarter, in line with the preceding quarter’s level.Per the consensus estimate, the company’s West Elm brand has also been witnessing significant growth, banking on addition of new stores and comps growth. Comps are currently growing in the double-digit range and are expected to witness 10.5% growth in the to-be-reported quarter, per the consensus estimate. The company’s namesake brand is expected to witness comps growth of 2.5%, up from 2.3% reported in the prior quarter.E-commerce Growth StrongImportantly, sales from e-commerce channel are an important source of revenues. The segment reported net revenues of $690 million in the quarter, up 6.4% year over year.

The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter with revenues pegged at $865 million, per the consensus estimate.Margins under PressureHowever, the company’s margins are reeling under pressure, thanks to increased competition and lack of robust comps growth. Gross margin was down 90 basis points (bps) from the year-ago figure and operating margin was down 40 bps in the third quarter. Fourth-quarter operating margins are expected to be less than the prior-year quarter’s level.Overall, the company expects earnings per share in the range of $1.49-$1.64 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, compared with $1.55 in the prior-year quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.63 per share, reflecting an increase of 5.2% year over year.Quantitative Model PredictionWilliams-Sonoma has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.

854,DG,"Though the prospect of faster-than-expected rates hikes and rising bond yields have diminished the appeal of dividend stocks, applying some smart beta strategies to the dividend investing world could fetch higher returns in a rising rate environment.In particular, stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth are usually of high quality and deliver excellent risk-adjusted returns in the longer term. When compared with the ones that pay out high yields, dividend growth stocks form a healthy portfolio, with more scope for capital appreciation.Inside Dividend Growth StocksStocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.These stocks pose a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. All these superior fundamentals make dividend growth a promising investment as opposed to their traditional dividend counterparts. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that a future hike is likely. This makes the portfolio healthy and safe.Furthermore, these have a long history of outperformance over the long term. However, it does not necessarily mean that they have the highest yields.Here are the screening parameters that could result in a winning dividend growth portfolio:5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3-5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past one year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment.VGM Score of B or better: This is simply a weighted combination of Value, Growth and Momentum.

855,DG,"Sales at U.S. retailers picked up last month disregarding the rise in gas prices. Americans ramped up spending on wage gains and bigger paychecks owing to the recent tax cuts.Apparel outlets, furniture merchants, building-materials outlets, Internet retailers and department stores, to name a few, saw an uptick in sales. Thus, it’s time to invest in retailers that are likely to make the most of the bullish sentiments.Retail Sales – The NumbersRetail sales that measure outlays at stores, online-shopping websites and restaurants increased at a seasonally adjusted rate of 0.3% in April from March, according to the Commerce Department. March sales were, in fact, revised to show a 0.8% advance instead of 0.6%.The so-called core retail sales that exclude food services, auto dealers, building materials stores and gasoline stations rose 0.3%, after an upwardly revised 0.4% gain in March. This indicated that rise in gasoline prices failed to affect consumer spending levels.Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the national average price for a gallon of gasoline came in at $2.76 in April, up almost 17 cents from March and the highest since mid-2015. With global oil prices rising after Trump’s decision to pull the United States out of the Iran nuclear deal and impose tougher sanctions on Tehran, gasoline prices are likely to remain elevated (read more: Trump Nixes Iran Nuclear Deal: Winners & Losers).Winners & LosersRetail sales were mostly broad-based, excluding gasoline and autos. Nine of the 13 major retail categories saw a rise in sales, with clothing and accessories retailers notching the highest increase last month. This is because Americans purchased new outfits for the warm weather. Sales at clothing stores shot up 1.4%.Receipts at furniture stores increased 0.8%, while sales were up 0.2% at department stores and 0.3% at general merchandise outlets. Receipts at building material stores also rose 0.4% last month and online retail sales advanced 0.6%.Grocery-store sales, in the meantime, went up 0.5% in April from the prior month. Kemper Isley, chairman and co-president of Natural Grocers by Vitamin Cottage, Inc., a Colorado-based chain said that they “are pleased with the continued sales momentum.”But, sales at restaurants and bars dropped 0.3%, the steepest decline since February 2017. Receipts at electronics and appliance stores, sporting goods and hobby stores, and health and personal care stores also fell 0.1%, 0.1% and 0.4% last month, respectively.What Drove Spending?Consumer outlays were off to a firm start this quarter after slowing sharply in the first quarter. April’s increase in spending came on the heels of a strong jobs market in at least two decades. April marked the 91st successive month of job additions, by far, the longest streak of job gains on record. At the same time, the jobless rate was 3.9%, the lowest since 2000. Average earnings also ticked up by 4 cents an hour and 2.6% year over year (read more: In a Tight Employment Market, Staffing Services are in Demand).The recent cut in taxes increased take-home pay. This in turn gave Americans the means to spend. The “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” lowered the individual income tax brackets. While the top rate got trimmed from 39.6% to 37%, the 33% bracket declined to 32%, the 28% bracket to 24%, the 25% bracket to 22%, and the 15% bracket to 12%.The rise in spending level easily outpaced the uptick in prices of essential commodities. After all, the consumer price index increased 2.5% in April from a year earlier, per the Labor Department.5 Top WinnersTaking the spending spree into account, retailers are set to witness a strong rally. Hence, it will be prudent to invest in five of the best retail stocks from the categories that have witnessed a significant rise in receipts.

856,DG,"Investors on the lookout for stocks with the potential for maximum growth and value investing may consider the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy.This popular strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks with impressive growth prospects that are trading at a discount. GARP investing employs popular value metrics — price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book value (P/B) ratio — to evaluate whether a stock is undervalued.GARP Metrics – Mix of Growth & Value MetricsThe GARP approach helps identify stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth history and impressive prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, picking stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a preferred tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics — price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is another value metric that is considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Last 5-year EPS & projected 3–5 year EPS growth rates between 10% and 20% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)ROE (over the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)P/E and P/B ratios less than M-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicate that the stocks are undervalued.)These few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only eight.Here are six of the eight stocks that made it through the screen:Grand Canyon Education, Inc. (LOPE  -  Free Report) is a regionally accredited provider of online postsecondary education services focused on offering graduate and undergraduate degree programs in its core disciplines of education, business, and healthcare.

857,DG,"Off-price business model, effective merchandising strategy and store-expansion plans have been the key growth drivers for Ross Stores, Inc. (ROST  -  Free Report). These initiatives have helped the company to deliver seventh straight quarter of earnings and sales surprises in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.However, shares of the company have been down 5.6% since it reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Mar 6. Year to date, the stock has declined 5.5% against the industry’s gain of 1.1%. Let’s find out what’s pulling down the shares of this leading discount retailer.Headwinds Weighing on Share PerformanceRoss Stores believes challenging multi-year comparisons and a competitive retail landscape remain major concerns for fiscal 2018. Notably, the company’s guidance for the fiscal year includes impacts from plans related to competitive wage and benefit-related investments, which will increase its minimum wage to $11.00 per hour. This justifies management’s cautious approach in formulating guidance for the fiscal year. It projects operating margin between 13.3% and 13.5% for fiscal 2018 compared with 14.5% last year. The decline is likely to stem from flat merchandise margin and the impact of the aforementioned wage and benefit-related investments. For the fiscal first quarter, operating margin is envisioned in the range of 14.6-14.8% compared with 15.2% in the year-ago quarter.Furthermore, an evolving retail landscape characterized by heightened online competition, lower footfall and changing consumer spending patterns have been largely weighing upon the company’s price performance. The company also faces stiff competition from online and brick and mortar retailers.Can Strategic Actions Offset Hurdles?Ross Stores’ proven off-price business model along with competitive bargains continues to make its stores an attractive destination for customers. Additionally, the company constantly upgrades its systems and processes to enhance productivity and improve its merchandise assortments to drive top line.Meanwhile, Ross Stores remains on track to attain the target of expanding store count to 2,500, comprising 2,000 Ross and 500 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores, over the long term. In fact, the company surpassed its fiscal 2017 target of opening 90 stores, comprising 70 Ross and 20 dd’s DISCOUNTS outlets. In fiscal 2018, it plans to introduce 100 stores, including 75 Ross and 25 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. Amid a tough retail scenario where consumers prefer online shopping over offline, Ross Stores seems to be aggressively committed toward expanding its store base with all required facilities for customers.Adding to these positives, analysts are growing optimistic on the stock as apparent from uptrend in the Zacks Consensus Estimate. In the last 30 days, the consensus estimate of $1.06 for the first quarter and $4.04 for fiscal 2018 moved north by 4 cents and 29 cents, respectively. Earnings per share are envisioned in the range of $1.03-$1.07 for the quarter and $3.86-$4.03 for the fiscal.Although Ross Stores has been battling against a tough macro backdrop for quite some time now, we believe the company’s strategic endeavors will definitely reflect in its share price performance in future.Rightly, Ross Stores carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Interested in Solid Retail Stocks, Count on TheseMacy's, Inc.

858,DG,"Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report), and countless others retailers have been forced to revamp their business models on the fly to help fend off a wave of online sellers over the past few years. However, at least one retail industry—discount retail—actually seems to be better off these days.There are an array of reasons that off-priced sellers are bucking sector-wide trends, most of which relate directly to the socioeconomic background of their customers and physical retail locations.The discount retail uptick occurred even before the new Republican tax law was passed, but now analysts seem more confident in the sector based on these GOP-related headwinds.

859,DG,"Burlington Stores, Inc. (BURL  -  Free Report) is expected to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Mar 1. The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this retailer of branded apparel products will be able to maintain its positive earnings surprise streak in the to-be reported quarter as well.Notably, the company’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 16 straight quarters now, with a trailing four-quarter average of 15.2%.

Management had earlier projected total sales increase of 11-12% including 5% from the 53rd week for the fiscal fourth quarter. For the impending quarter, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1,882 million, up nearly 11.6% year over year.Additionally, amid a competitive retail backdrop, Burlington Stores’ comparable-store sales (comps) have witnessed constant improvement over the past few years.

861,DG,"On Tuesday, Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, missing on earnings after surprises on the positive side in three straight quarters. The company’s shares too fell 5% in late trading despite a 10% jump in revenues. The dismal showing was largely attributable to an increase in cost of sales and higher SG&A expenses, for which higher compensation costs were hugely responsible.However, it might be too early to write off the Target stock just on the basis of an earnings fiasco and investor concerns. This is because Target has extensive expansion plans, ranging from increasing minimum wages to expanding its shipping services and even drive up delivery to 1,000 stores by the end of 2018. Plus, another good news is that Target’s sales are improving, thanks to stronger traffic both online and in stores.Target Misses Q4 Earnings Estimates, Sales Beat Target reported fiscal fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.37 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents and declining 5.8% from the prior-year quarter. However, the company generated total sales of $22,766 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22,463 million for the fourth quarter in a row, and increasing 10% from the prior-year quarter (read: Target's Q4 Earnings Miss, Sales Beat Estimates).It was a rise in cost of sales and higher SG&A expenses that weighted on the company’s bottom line. Target’s SG&A expenses rate was 18.5% in the fourth quarter compared with 17.5% in 2016. SG&A expenses were primarily pushed up by higher compensation costs, which included both an increase in incentives of team members and an impact of investments in store member hours and wage rates. However, even higher sales could not act as a savior and Target’s shares plunged 5% in late trading on Mar 6.Surviving the Amazon OnslaughtOne of the key areas where Target is spending a lot is online order delivery. This is definitely in a bid to push into e-commerce and compete with Amazon. Moreover, Target also intends to invest further in 2018 in order to stay in the race. Amazon, on the other hand, has been constantly making smart moves both in the online and offline retail space.Over the last few years, Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) has redefined the retail space and the online and offline gap is fast disappearing. In doing so, it is giving stiff competition to all retail behemoths that include the likes of Dollar Tree (DLTR  -  Free Report), Dollar General (DG  -  Free Report) and Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report). And much like other retail giants, Target’s bid to compete with Amazon is affecting its profits.The company recently announced that it would be offering free, two-hour delivery from Whole Foods stores to its Prime members in four cities. The move came within a year of the e-commerce giant’s $13.7-billion acquisition of supermarket chain Whole Foods. While Target and other retail behemoths like Walmart, Dollar Tree and Dollar General are trying to push into e-commerce, Amazon is fast capturing the offline space too (read: Will Amazon's 2-Hour Whole Foods Delivery Skew Retail Pitch?).Target’s Extensive Expansion PlansTarget’s earnings may have raised concern among investors but the retail gaint seems confident about making a turnaround. Target announced Tuesday at its annual investor conference in Minneapolis that it will raise hourly minimum wage from $11 to $12 this spring and expects it to reach $15 by 2020. The American job market has heated up in recent times and Target’s move is a response to a tighter labor market. The company has also announced plans of expanding Drive Up to almost a thousand stores in the United States by end 2018. Drive Up allows customers to place online orders using the Target app brought out to their cars by a store team member, minutes after arriving.Moreover, Target, in order to compete with Amazon, will also be starting a free, two-day shipping service for hundreds of thousands of items on Target.com, with a $35 minimum threshold unless a shopper has a Target credit card. The company’s decision last year to add muscle to its delivery wing by acquiring Shipt will help it to manage costs as it launches its free-shipping initiatives.The company will also expand Restock, its next-day essentials delivery service, to around 40 markets. Naturally, the company is leaving no stone unturned to stay in the race.Shares of Target have gained 18.2% in the last three months. Target has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.All’s Not Lost for TargetIt goes without saying that Target has been performing well amid stiff competition. Investors might feel a shade jittery after the company missed on earnings but the stock has enough potential given that both its online and in-store sales have risen. Moreover, Target looks sure of making a turnaround and has massive expansion plans that include increasing minimum wages as well as investment in shipping and drive up delivery services across the country.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than Visa The total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

862,DG,"The investment pattern of the millennials is gradually tending toward hybrid investment from pure play theories like growth or value. According to them, to make a long-term investment more effective, the principles of both value and growth strategies need to be combined.GARP (growth at a reasonable price) investment, often known as a special case of value investment, is finding prominence among new generation stakeholders. What GARPers look for is whether the stocks are somewhat undervalued and have solid sustainable growth potential (Investopedia).And here lies the importance of a not-so-popular fundamental metric, the price/earnings growth (PEG) ratio. Although it is categorized under value investing, this strategy follows the principles of both growth and value investing.The PEG ratio is defined as: (Price/ Earnings)/Earnings Growth RateIt relates the stocks P/E ratio with future earnings growth rate.While P/E alone only gives the idea of stocks, which are trading at a discount, PEG while adding the growth element to it, helps to find those stocks that have solid future potential.A lower PEG ratio, preferably less than 1, is always better for GARP investors.Say for example, if a stock's P/E ratio is 10 and expected long-term growth rate is 15%, the company's PEG will come down to 0.66, a ratio that indicates both undervaluation and future growth potential.Unfortunately, this ratio is often neglected due to investors' limitation to calculate the future earnings growth rate of a stock.There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though. It doesn't consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at very high growth rate followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term.Hence, PEG-based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration.Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy:PEG Ratio less than X Industry MedianP/E Ratio (using F1) less than X Industry Median (For more accurate valuation purpose)Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) (Whether good market conditions or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1  or #2 have a proven history of success.)Market Capitalization greater than $1 Billion (This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity.)Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than 5%: Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism, suggesting further bullishness.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 (Hold) offer the best upside potential. Here are five of the 16 stocks that qualified the screening:The Timken Company (TKR  -  Free Report): This company develops and markets bearings, transmissions, gearboxes, belts, chains, lubrication systems, couplings, industrial clutches and brakes, and related products worldwide.

863,DG,"Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) is the latest among the FANG stocks to take a beating. The company’s shares plummeted 4.4% on Wednesday and erased $30 billion of its market capitalization after the news website Axios reported that President Donald Trump wants to take on the company’s growing powers and its tax treatment.Trump has long been arguing that the e-commerce giant has been getting an unfair tax treatment compared with brick-and-mortar retailers, which have been suffering the Amazon onslaught for quite some time now. Moreover, Trump has always been critical of Amazon and its CEO Jeff Bezos, expressing time and again how much he dislikes the company. However, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders denied that the administration is planning anything against Amazon. ""We have no announcement and no specific policies we are pushing for,"" Sanders said, related to Amazon.That said, it’s still unclear what Trump will ultimately plan or do with Amazon. If he really decides to implement an Internet tax, Amazon’s revenues will be affected and its customers will have to shell out more. This is because Amazon will likely pass on its extra cost burden to its customers.Trump Versus BezosTrump’s dislike for Amazon and Bezos isn’t unknown and dates back a long time. On Wednesday, the company’s shares nosedived once again on reports of Trump planning to take on the Internet retail behemoth and its tax treatment. This saw its shares tumbling as much as 7% at one point of the day and almost $53 billion of its market capitalization being wiped out, before it closed the day at down 4.4%. The selloff was fueled by fears of a prospective Internet tax, which would cut heavily into the profits of the company. Now, this was not something out of the blue. Back in August 2017, Trump had tweeted: “Amazon is doing great damage to tax paying retailers. Towns, cities and states throughout the U.S. are being hurt - many jobs being lost!""In fact, he had also said that the United States Post Office is losing billions of dollars every year by charging the likes of Amazon and others a pittance to deliver their packages. This, Trump suggested is only making Amazon richer. Interestingly, Trump’s dislike is perhaps more for Bezos, who also owns Washington Post. Trump has often criticized Washington Post and on one occasion, misleadingly referred to it as “Amazon Washington Post.”A tweet by Trump, last year, read: ""The #AmazonWashingtonPost, sometimes referred to as the guardian of Amazon not paying Internet taxes (which they should) is FAKE NEWS!"" Understandably, Trump doesn’t like Amazon’s business style and the latest report is further proof of that.Amazon Changing the Retail LandscapeAmazon undoubtedly has changed the retail landscape in the last few years. The company has grown from strength to strength with innovations in the delivery space and by bridging the gap between online and offline retail business. Amazon’s shares have increased 63.7% in the last year and 2.4% year to date. Amazon has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This definitely is giving other brick-and-mortar giants like Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report), Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report), Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) and Dollar Tree, Inc. (DLTR  -  Free Report) a run for their money. This is especially so because the traditional incumbents are constantly striving to stay in the race.The biggest move in the brick-and-mortar space was made by Amazon when it acquired Whole Foods for $13.7 billion in 2017. Moreover, Amazon recently started free, two-hour delivery from Whole Foods’ stores to its Prime members in four cities — Austin, Dallas, Cincinnati and Virginia Beach.Of course Amazon has established its dominance in the online retail space and it’s not only the retail giants but also the smaller players that are suffering the most with many shutting shop. Michael Kors (KORS  -  Free Report) will be closing 100-125 stores over the next two years. Sears & Kmart closed 358 stores in 2017 and 63 in January 2018. Toys R Us is nearing closure too. Naturally, Trump’s concern is for brick-and-mortar stores, which are finding it difficult to survive the Amazon onslaught.But What About Amazon’s Profits?Although it really isn’t known what Trump plans to do, an Internet tax will dent Amazon’s booming online business without an inkling of doubt. In 2017, Amazon accounted for 44% of all e-commerce sales and about 4% of total U.S. retail sales, according to CNBC’s One Click Retail study. The company’s e-commerce sales for 2017 are expected to grow almost $197 billion, reflecting a 32% increase from 2016. This says a lot about the company’s dominance in e-commerce retail. And a lot of this is because Amazon is spared from any Internet tax.Moreover, according to the study, Amazon’s grocery sales in 2017 totaled $1.5 billion, up 33% from 2016, thus making it an undisputed leader in the e-commerce space. Naturally, if an Internet tax ultimately comes to effect, Amazon’s profits are sure to take a hit. More taxes mean less profits or steeper prices in case the tax burden is passed on to consumers. This in its turn might cause a slump in sales.In ConclusionTrump’s dislike for Amazon has often come to the fore and the recent news has sparked fears in the minds of investors. An Internet tax certainly isn’t a good sign for the e-commerce giant. However, with nothing concrete on the table now, and the White House denying any imminent action against Amazon, investors can be a little more patient with the stock.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs Pending A medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it. Companies are already generating substantial revenue, and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline. Cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in sight, and so are big potential profits for early investors. Zacks names 5 stocks to buy now.Click here to see them >>

864,DG,"Brush off market volatility, here’s some good news to cherish. With unemployment rate still at a 17-year low, initial jobless claims below the psychological mark, consumer spending being impressive and government expenditure increasing, things appear to be fairly rosy for the U.S. economy. These sentiments were rekindled when the Bureau of Economic Analysis released its third and final estimate for real GDP yesterday.Markedly, real GDP rose 2.9% in the fourth quarter of 2017, higher than the second estimate of 2.5% and analysts’ expectations of 2.7%. Moreover, real GDP for 2017 climbed 2.3% from the 2016 level, much better than 1.5% growth witnessed in 2016. Also, consumer spending (accounting for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity) grew 4% in the fourth quarter, marking its highest improvement since the fourth quarter of 2014.Apart from this, the favorable economic indicators led to a sixth Fed rate hike last week (since the financial crisis), which was also followed by a raised GDP outlook for 2018. The Fed officials now envision GDP growth rate to be 2.7% up from 2.5% for the year, which may witness two more rate hikes. While President Trump’s latest take on trade policies may hurt business sentiment and expenditure on capital goods, analysts expect government spending and the $1.5-trillion tax cuts to boost economic growth in 2018.Retail Space Rides on Favorable Indicators Clearly, these factors bode well for the Retail-Wholesale sector that has surged 24.6% in a year, outperforming the S&P 500’s rally of 12.4%. As consumers form the lifeline of the sector, metrics like consumer spending and consumer sentiment remain the deciding factor of the retail space’s fate. Though soft traffic and mounting competition due to consumers’ evolving shopping patterns have made things challenging for retailers, they’re exploiting every nook and cranny to keep pace with the changing trends. Retailers are going all the way to enhance omni-channel capabilities, optimize store fleet and undertake restructuring activities.How to Identify the Potential Winners?That said, we picked five top-ranked stocks from the space that have gained more than 30% in a year, crushing the sector’s solid growth.Backed by sound fundamentals and impressive past records, these stocks are surely to be a valuable addition to your portfolio. Moreover, these stocks carry a favorable Growth Style Score, thereby doubling the treat. Growth stocks have solid earnings or revenue growth potential, which should lead to higher stock prices. Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) provide the best returns.Shuffle Your Portfolio: 5 Key PicksCalifornia-based The Gap, Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report), with a splendid earnings surprise history, is a solid bet. We commend Gap’s efforts to expand omni-channel operations and its solid focus on Old Navy and Athleta brands. Driven by these efforts, the company has surged about 31% over the past year, faring better than the sector. With a Growth Score of A and a long-term earnings growth rate of 8%, we expect this premier international specialty retailer to reach greater heights. Notably, this Zacks Rank #2 has seen its estimates for the current quarter and the fiscal go up by 5 cents and 32 cents to 46 cents and $2.63, respectively, over the past 30 days. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Investors can also count on Burlington Stores, Inc. (BURL  -  Free Report), which has seen its stock soar 33.5% in a year. This retailer of branded apparel products has been riding on solid comparable store sales and gross margin expansion trends, thanks to its strategic growth efforts like focus on store expansions. Moreover, the company has topped earnings estimates consistently for 17 straight quarters. Further, we remain optimistic about Burlington, given its Growth Score of A and a long-term growth rate of a solid 18.6%. Estimates of this Zacks Rank #2 company have gone up by 9.1% to $1.08 and 7.2% to $5.76 for the current quarter and fiscal respectively, over the past month.You may also consider Boot Barn Holdings, Inc. (BOOT  -  Free Report), a lifestyle retail chain devoted to western and work-related footwear, apparel and accessories, headquartered in California. The stock flaunts a Zacks Rank #2 and has a Growth Score of A. The company’s bottom line outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of nearly 23% in the trailing four quarters and has a long-term growth rate of  20.7%. Further, Boot Barn has seen estimates for the current quarter go up from 13 cents to 17 cents in the past 30 days. Notably, the company has put up a superb bull run over a year, with its shares up a whopping 73.7%.Investors can also place bets on Kohl’s Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report), which has returned 67.6% over the past year. Flaunting a Growth Score of A, this department store chain is likely to continue gaining from its superb traffic boosting initiatives, robust brand portfolio, inventory management efforts and growing e-commerce business. These strategies have helped this Zacks Rank #2 company deliver positive earnings surprises in three of the trailing four quarters. Also, the company with nine positive estimate revisions (in the last 30 days) for the current fiscal has a long-term growth rate of 6.7%.Finally, we suggest taking a look at Tennessee-based, Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report). This major discount retailer delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 2.3% in the trailing four quarters and carries a Zacks Rank #2. Moreover, the company has emerged as a strong contender with a long-term earnings growth rate of 14.6% and a Growth Score of B. Dollar General’s commitment toward better price management, cost containment, private label offering, effective inventory management, merchandise and operational initiatives should drive sales and margins. With estimates for the current quarter and fiscal moving north in the past 30 days, the company has returned 33% in a year.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it. Companies are already generating substantial revenue, and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline.Cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in sight, and so are big potential profits for early investors.

By following broker recommendations, one can easily find investment-worthy stocks.Brokers have deeper insight into what’s happening in a particular company as they directly communicate with management.

866,DG,"Oil price has zoomed to the highest levels in more than three and a half years buoyed by potential export disruptions in Iran and falling production in Venezuela. Additionally, the historic output cut deal by OPEC, Russia and other producers to curb production is paying off, paving the way for a rebalancing of the oil market despite rising U.S. production.The global benchmark Brent crude and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI  -  Free Report) rallied above $77 and $71 per barrel, respectively. The bullish trend is likely to continue given that Trump has decided to restore sanctions on Iran, which will disrupt oil supplies in the major Middle East oil producer Iran, resulting in further tightening of the global glut.Additionally, seasonality will continue to support a price surge in the coming months. This is because demand generally picks up in a summer driving season (which starts with Memorial Day at the end of May and lasts until Labor Day in September), leading to higher prices.A BlessingHigher oil price is big boon to energy stocks, especially producers and explorers, which get most of their revenues from selling the crude that they extract. This is because the cost of oil production or extraction remains low as companies look to lock in supply contracts at higher prices. The gap between production cost and selling price keeps on rising when oil price surges even higher, leading to fat profit margins and thus a spike in company’s share price.As a result, the S&P Energy Index has gained 13.6% so far this quarter, easily outperforming the other sector. The Zacks Oil and Energy sector has gained 11% over the past month with some of the outperforming stocks including EP Energy Corporation EPE, Pioneer Energy Services Corp. (PES  -  Free Report), Rex Energy Corporation , Transglobe Energy Corp (TGA  -  Free Report), Penn Virginia Corporation PVAC, and W&T Offshore, Inc. (WTI  -  Free Report). All these have soared more than 50% in a month.The optimism in the energy sector has pushed up gains from Wall Street, which was struggling amid a series of woes. In fact, the major broad indices have turned green from a year-to-date look with the surge in oil prices.Further, rising oil prices coupled with rising interest rates are acting as catalysts to the financial sector given that most banks are highly exposed to the energy space. This is because rising oil price alleviates the default risks for banks’ exposure to oil and gas companies, and creates additional credit demand that could result in improving credit quality. In particular, big banks like Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) could be the largest beneficiaries with their direct exposure to the energy sector. These stocks climbed 2.4%, 0.8%, 3.7% and 0.6%, respectively, over the past month and have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A CurseWhile almost every corner of the energy segment is shining, oil refiners might be hit. This is because the players in this industry use oil as an input for processing refined petroleum products. Hence, higher oil prices would crimp margins for refiners, leading to weak stock prices.Higher oil price has also resulted in a spike in gasoline and jet prices that would make summer driving most expensive in four years, per the Energy Information Administration. According to AAA, the average price at the pump is about $2.83, up 21% year over year, with drivers in nine states paying $3 a gallon for regular gasoline. As such, transportation stocks could see rough trading with airline stocks such as American Airlines (AAL  -  Free Report), Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report), and United Continental (UAL  -  Free Report) being the biggest losers, as high fuel price may cut their profit margins.Rising pump price is threating Trump’s tax cut benefits, which is the major pillar for future America. According to Morgan Stanley, higher gas prices are on track to cost Americans an extra $38 billion in 2018, wiping out about one-third of the benefits from the reduced tax rates. Per the analyst at Moody’s, sustained increase in the gasoline price would cost the average American $450 a year, offsetting about half the tax benefit.Added to the woes is the resultant inflationary pressure that would raise the price of the products leading to a reduced consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economic activity. The discretionary and retail sectors would thus bear the brunt. However, these are the biggest gainers of the improving American economy and record consumer confidence. As a result, investors seeking to remain invested in these sectors should focus on the top-ranked stocks having Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).

867,DG,"Shares of RH (RH  -  Free Report), formerly Restoration Hardware, rallied 15.7% in after-hours trading on Nov 15. The gain was prompted by the home furnishings retailer’s raised guidance for the fiscal third quarter and fiscal 2017. Per management, this “demonstrates the earnings power of our new membership model, and a dramatically more efficient operating platform.""It is worth mentioning here that RH’s shares have performed well so far this year and have rallied more than 171%, significantly outperforming the industry’s gain of just 1.8%.Estimates for the fiscal third quarter and the fiscal year moved up by 17.1% and 6.6%, respectively, over the last 60 days, reflecting analysts’ optimism. The new business model coupled with several growth initiatives should drive the stock’s performance.Revised OutlookDespite a 1% or 5 cents per share of negative impact from hurricanes Harvey and Irma, RH’s adjusted earnings are expected to be in the range of $1.02 to $1.04 per share for the fiscal third quarter compared with the previous guidance of 68 cents to 80 cents. This reflects a substantial increase from the year ago level of 20 cents.Net revenues for the quarter for this leading luxury retailer in the home furnishing space are likely to be about $592.5 million compared with the previous guidance range of $575-$590 million. The updated guidance reflects an increase of 8% year over year, despite an approximate 1% negative impact from the recent natural calamities.RH has also increased its fourth-quarter adjusted net income guidance to the range of $37-$41 million from its earlier prediction of $33- $37 million. The increased outlook reflects the improved business performance RH is experiencing along with $2 million of tax benefit despite an approximate $1.5 million negative impact as a result of its decision to delay the opening of its New York Design Gallery to Spring-Summer 2018.However, net revenues for the fourth quarter are now expected to be in the range of $655-$680 million compared with the previous expectation of $664-$689 million.

It now expects full-year capital expenditures between $120 million and $130 million, down from the range of $120-$140 million.The company said that it expects fiscal 2018 net revenues between $2.58 billion and $2.62 billion, adjusted net income in the range of $125-$145 million, and free cash flow of more than $240 million.Other DevelopmentsRH wrapped up its distribution facility in Los Angeles and has plans of shutting down its distribution center in Dallas by fiscal year 2017 end. Overall, with the elimination of an estimated 1.75 million square feet of distribution space, RH generated savings of approximately $15 million annually.Meanwhile, RH has completed around 90% of the redesign of its reverse logistics and Outlet business. The move is expected to generate cost savings and enhance margin of $15 million to $20 million annually.The company anticipates margins to rise and costs to fall as it plans to reduce inventory and benefit from its new operating model. RH remains optimistic about reaching its long-term goal of $4-$5 billion in North American revenues with industry leading operating margins and returns on invested capital.Zacks Rank & Key PicksRH currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector are TravelCenters of America LLC (TA  -  Free Report), Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) and Dollar Tree, Inc.

869,DG,"The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein both earnings and revenues improved year over year. While hurricanes and warm weather posed as headwinds, improved traffic at major segments and enhanced merchandise margins fueled results.  Quarterly DetailsThe company’s earnings of $1.00 per share came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and also met the higher end of management’s guidance range. Further, the bottom line grew 10% from adjusted earnings of 91 cents in the year-ago period. Notably, currency translations had a 4 cents positive impact on earnings per share.Net sales advanced 6% year over year to $8,786.2 million, backed by improved traffic. Also, currency translations benefited consolidated net sales growth by 1%. However, the figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8,876 million.TJX Companies' consolidated comps remained flat year over year, in comparison with 3% rise witnessed in the preceding quarter. Results were affected by hurricanes, with demand for apparel at the Marmaxx division also being hurt by warm temperatures in the United States. Nonetheless, trends at the division improved eventually as weather normalized. Further, the company witnessed greater traffic and transactions at all major segments.Segment-wise, comps rose 3%, 4% and 1% respectively, in HomeGoods, TJX Canada and TJX International segments. On the contrary, comps slipped 1% at Marmaxx.     Gross margin expanded 0.3 percentage points to 29.8%, thanks to gains from inventory hedges and enhanced merchandise margins. This was partly offset by greater supply chain expenses and expense deleverage on flat comps.However, selling, general and administrative costs, as a percentage of sales, increased 0.5 pp to 18.1% due to increase in wages and costs associated with hurricanes. TJX Companies' consolidated pre-tax profit margin dipped 0.1 pp (from adjusted pre-tax margin) to 11.6% of sales. High wages have been a hurdle for the company for a while now. We also note that this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock has lost 4.3% so far this year, as against the industry’s growth of 3.9%.  Other Financial UpdatesThe company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $2,364.2 million, long-term debt of $2,229.8 million and total shareholders’ equity of $4,645.6 million. Cash flow from operations for the first three quarters of the fiscal was $1,929.4 million.During the quarter, the company repurchased 4.9 million shares for $350 million and paid dividends worth $197 million. For fiscal 2018, the company still expects to repurchase shares worth approximately $1.5-$1.8 billion.During the quarter, the company opened 139 stores, taking its total store count to 4,052 stores as of Oct 28, 2017.Q4 GuidanceTJX Companies remains encouraged about the fourth quarter, courtesy of the solid holiday season opportunities. For fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, the company expects adjusted earnings (excluding a nearly 11 cents benefit from an additional week in the quarter) in the range of $1.14-$1.16 per share, reflecting 11-13% increase from the year-ago period earnings.

The company now projects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $3.80-$3.82, compared with the prior range of $3.78-$3.82. The adjusted guidance (excluding benefit of 11 cents from the 53rd week in fiscal 2018) will represent an 8% increase from the year-ago period earnings.

870,DG,"In an intensely competitive retail landscape, Burlington Stores, Inc. (BURL  -  Free Report) has done exceedingly well and emerged as a strong contender to be an investment choice. This is quite evident from the stock’s performance in a year. In the said period, the stock has surged 34.6% compared with the industry’s gain of 7.4%.We believe there is still momentum left in this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, which is reflected from its long-term impressive earnings growth rate of 12% and VGM Score of A. Stocks such as Big Lots, Inc. (BIG  -  Free Report), Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST  -  Free Report) and Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) which belong to the same industry has witnessed a gain of 0.4%, 15.5% and 19% in a year, respectively. Let’s delve deeper and find out the reason that kept Burlington Stores ahead of its peers in 2017.Changes in Business Model Driving GrowthBurlington Stores has made multiple changes to business model to adapt to the ongoing changes in the industry. The company which started business as a coat-focused off-price retailer is now focusing on “open to buy” off-price model. The current model is helping customers to get nationally branded, fashionable, high quality as well as right priced products. Further, over the years the company has increased vendor counts, made technological advancements, initiated better marketing approach and focused on localized assortments.In order to drive top-line growth, Burlington Stores has been focusing on store expansion. The company’s store count has increased from 13 in 1980 to 592 stores in fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2014, 2015 and 2016, the company has opened 24, 28 and 30 stores, respectively. In fiscal 2017, the company stated that it plans to open 37 net new stores up from 30 net stores estimated previously. It also believes that there is room to increase the store count to 1,000.Results Showing Constant ImprovementThe company’s changes to its business model are well reflected on quarterly results. In third-quarter fiscal 2017, the company’s earnings not only surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 12 successive quarters but also surged 37% year over year. Moreover, we noted that the bottom line has shown constant improvement in the past several quarters. In both the second and first quarter of fiscal 2017, earnings have increased 85% year over year following an increase of 20%, 100%, 105% and 39% in the fourth, third, second and first quarters of fiscal 2016, respectively.The company now envisions fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings in the range of $4.23-$4.27 per share compared with $3.24 reported in the prior year. For the fourth quarter, earnings are expected to come within the range of $2.02-$2.06 per share compared with $1.78 reported in the prior-year period.Burlington Stores has been doing quite well on the revenue front. The company’s revenues have not only outpaced the estimates in five of the seven trailing quarters but have also shown constant improvement in the past few quarters. In third-quarter fiscal 2017, revenues increased 7.1% following an increase of 8.6% and 5% in the second and first quarter, respectively. Meanwhile, we noted that comparable store sales have increased 4.5%, 2.1%, 4.9%, 4.7% and 1.2% in fiscal 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.Margins Continues to SurgeIn an era of high promotional initiatives due to stiff competition most of the retailers are struggling with dwindling margins. However, Burlington Stores has kept itself afloat amid a competitive environment. Improvement in gross margin can be attributed to the company’s efforts toward managing inventory as well as effective cost management and merchandising margin. Gross margin increased 80, 30, 60 and 30 basis points (bps) to 40.8%, 40%, 39.7%, 39.1% and 38.8%, in fiscal 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. In the first, second and third quarter of fiscal 2017, gross margin expanded 80, 110 and 100 bps to 40.9%, 40.7% and 42.2%, respectively.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

871,DG,"Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) finally announced on Wednesday that it will be acquiring a substantial stake in India’s e-commerce giant Flipkart. This is likely the smartest move that Walmart has made in recent times. Flipkart will give Walmart the much-required strength Walmart needs to explore the highly coveted India market.Understandably, Walmart’s decision is powered by the intent to compete with e-commerce giant Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), which has established itself already in the targeted emerging market. That said, despite this big-ticket acquisition, Walmart’s shares took a hit on Wednesday, declining as much as 3.1%. However, it is too early to rule out Walmart given that the Flipkart acquisition will only add to its strengths.Walmart’s Boldest MoveWalmart has agreed to pay $16 billion for a 77% stake in Flipkart, making it the company’s biggest deal ever. This gives Walmart a chance to capture the growing e-commerce market in India. After all, Flipkart is the one of the most successful e-commerce startups over there.Acquiring Flipkart will give Walmart a second chance in India. The retail behemoth has struggled to penetrate the India’s retail market worth $670 billion, despite making its debut 11 years ago. Walmart has a meager 21 wholesale stores in India, and no e-commerce presence. Also, Walmart’s joint venture with Bharti Enterprises of a 50:50 partnership to run the wholesale cash-and-carry business turned sour a few years ago.Understandably, the e-commerce route to tap the India market seems to be the best bet for Walmart. For more than a decade now, different governments in India have denied permission to the likes of Walmart to set up stores in that country. Walmart has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Finally, when permission was granted in 2012, it came with conditions that foreign investors could do business in India only in partnership with that country’s retailers.   At the same time, Walmart too could not have opened its own e-commerce wing as foreign investment as online retailing isn’t allowed in India. Hence, acquiring an existing business was the best option.How Filpkart Can Turn Walmart’s FortunesFlipkart is India’s own Amazon being that country’s biggest e-commerce company. Amazon, on the other hand is the second largest. Moreover, one of the biggest reasons behind Flipkart’s success has been its cash on delivery model of business, a feature that has struck a chord with shoppers. Understandably, Walmart will try to cash in on this quotient.At the same time, this will give Walmart a level playing ground with its biggest competitor Amazon. Jeff Bezos’ company has in the last few years changed the entire retail landscape and is clearly ahead of other retail giants like Walmart, Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) Dollar General (DG  -  Free Report) and Dollar Tree (DLTR  -  Free Report) in the e-commerce race.Wait and Watch GameWalmart’s shares slipped 3.1% following news of the Flipkart acquisition. However, the fall isn’t because investors don’t have faith in the stock. Rather, it occurred because Walmart said that the deal could cut into its projected earnings per share of $0.25-$0.30 in the current fiscal year and around $0.60 in the next fiscal. The company also indicated that it anticipates Flipkart’s operating loss in 2017 to almost double this year.This might have dented investor’s confidence to some extent as they have long known that such a decision was in the coming. Moreover, Flipkart holds 30% of India’s e-commerce market. In fact, investors reacted in similar fashion when Walmart in 2016 acquired Jet.com for $3.3 billion. However, the acquisition turned out to be Walmart’s biggest weapon to compete with Amazon, thus proving to be one of its most successful deals.Summing UpWalmart’s decision to acquire a majority stake in Flipkart undoubtedly is a bold move and perhaps the best possible way to say in the race. The deal definitely gives the company a second chance to tap the Indian market. Moreover, given the strict operating rules for retailers in India, the Flipkart acquisition looks the best and timeliest for Walmart to stay ahead in the highly competitive retail space.Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

872,DG,"Millennials —  population with birth years ranging from 1980-2000 — are slowly turning out to be the backbone of the U.S. economy, outpacing baby boomers in 2015 and reflecting over one quarter of the nation’s population. By 2019, millennials will be America’s largest population cohort, as projected by the United States Census Bureau.This makes it important to track their life goals, shopping patterns and investment preferences for investment purposes. This is a pretty diverse generation with ages ranging from 22 to 37, thus capturing various stages of lives from “post-college to starting a family.”While there are pure-play millennial ETFs like Global X Millennials Thematic ETF (MILN  -  Free Report) and Principal Millennials Index ETF (GENY  -  Free Report) to tap this emerging trend, investors can also play the below-mentioned equity strategies that revolve around millennials and their lifestyles. The following stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or a 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Go OnlineMillennials indulge in social media. As per a report by Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research, 44% of millennials are into text messaging, 38% into both social media and instant messaging and 16% into blogging. The percentages are higher than any other generation. Most of the millennials are occupied and that’s why shop online. They reportedly spend less time in grocery stores than baby boomers and Gen X shoppers. For obvious reasons, such preference patterns put the provider of online direct marketing and media services company QuinStreet Inc. (QNST  -  Free Report), e-commerce behemoth Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Internet-based social expression and personal publishing service company Shutterfly Inc. (SFLY  -  Free Report) in focus.Bet on Broader Technology On a broader level, millennials are tech savvy. As much as 50% of millennials play video games compared with 27% Gen X and 16% Boomers. About 45% are busy chatting compared with 31% Gen X and 10% Boomers. Apart from these, downloading music/videos and watching TV online are part of millennials’ routine. A Google study showed that 60% of millennials hold a smartphone while cooking. Around 85% of the generation prefers artificial intelligence to manage their finances. As a result, semiconductor company Texas Instruments Inc TXN, wireless solution provider for the mobile communications BlackBerry Limited (B  -  Free Report)B), mobile gaming company Glu Mobile Inc. GLUU and computer storage device company Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) will catch investors’ attention.Organic & Healthy Food Habits Millennials are currently the driving factor behind organic produce sales. They are health conscious and aware of the importance in food standards and production methods. Such habits bode well for the wholesale distributor to the natural, organic and specialty industry United Natural Foods Inc. (UNFI  -  Free Report) and the provider of science-based weight management products and nutritional supplements Herbalife LTD. (HLF  -  Free Report).Experiences Important Than Goods Millennials are viewed as a class that prefers experiences to things. About 78% likes to shell out on experiences than on possessions, per a 2017 survey conducted by the Harris Group. They shell out on dining out a lot, shows a Bankrate.com study. So, online travel company Expedia Inc. (EXPE  -  Free Report), airline company SkyWest Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report) and restaurant company Brinker International Inc. EAT should go well with this fondness.Look for ValueMillennials are deemed to be value conscious. They are interested in good deals. This should benefit discount retailers like Dollar General Corp (DG  -  Free Report).Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

The company remains keen on building its interconnected capabilities through its digital assets, upgrade for providing customers with a more seamless experience. Meanwhile, the company has been benefiting from its solid focus on Pro Customers. Notably, the recently-acquired Compact Power Equipment marked another step toward enhancing its portfolio of service offerings for its Pro customers. Notably, sales from this category improved in double digits in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.Further, management has reaffirmed its long-term financial targets to be achieved in fiscal 2020 while updated the return on invested capital target to reflect the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 impacts. Management also plans to accelerate investments in the next three years to boost customers’ experience and shareholder value.Though Home Depot has been posting sturdy results for a long time, its gross margin looks a little strained. In the last reported quarter, gross margin contracted 10 basis points (bps) year over year due to impacts from lower hurricane-related sales. Prior to this, the company’s gross margin deteriorated 12 bps in the third quarter, 6 bps in the second and 10 bps each in first-quarter fiscal 2017 and fourth-quarter fiscal 2016.For fiscal 2018, management expects gross margin of nearly 34%, almost flat with fiscal 2017. Excluding the 53rd week, the company expects gross margin to decline nearly 7 bps. This is mainly due to assumptions of a tightened transportation market and higher fuel costs.While the company’s robust earnings history is encouraging, we would wait and see if soft margins can impact earnings this time around.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively show that Home Depot is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

875,DG,"Shares of Big Lots, Inc. (BIG  -  Free Report) have surged nearly 22.7% in the past three months, outperforming the industry’s growth of 15.4%. Reasons behind the stock’s bullish run can be attributed to positive earnings surprise streak in the eight consecutive quarters along with strategic endeavors undertaken to combat stiff competition and alleviate margin pressure.Hidden catalystBig Lots’ furniture financing programs has been consistently gaining traction. Furniture, which has been the leading performer in the last few quarters, increased in low-single digits in the third quarter. The company is very optimistic about the performance of furniture in fiscal 2017. Soft home has also been doing well in the past few quarters. In the reported quarter, soft home was up by mid-single digits.The company delivered adjusted earnings of 6 cents a share that came a penny ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increased a couple of cents from the year-ago period. Further, earnings surpassed the company’s guided range of 1-5 cents per share.Following better-than-expected earnings, management raised fiscal 2017 projections. Management now envisions fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share in the band of $4.23-$4.28, up from the earlier guidance of $4.15-$4.25. This represents growth of 16-18% from $3.64 per share recorded in fiscal 2016.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.25 and $4.49 for fiscal 2017 and 2018 has increased by 1 and 2 cents, respectively.ConcernsDuring the third quarter, the company not only reported lower-than-expected sales but also trimmed guidance for fiscal 2017. Sales growth for the full year is now predicted to be up approximately 2%, compared with earlier guided range of 2-2.5%. Comps are anticipated to increase by 1%, down from the previous estimate of 1-5%. Moreover, sluggishness in electronics, toys and accessories remains a concern.Gross margin, a key financial metric determining a company’s basic financial health, has declined in both the third and second quarter of 2017. In the third quarter, gross margin fell 10 basis points (bps) to 39.9% following a slump of 10 bps to 40.3% in the preceding quarter.

876,DG,"Dollar Tree Inc. (DLTR  -  Free Report) is in investors’ good books, driven by robust comparable store sales (comps) and improved margins. Also, it is benefiting from the integration of Family Dollar. While its top and bottom lines lagged estimates in the most recent quarter, it has delivered positive earnings and sales surprise in the preceding two quarters. However, volatile consumer environment, intense competition and significant global exposure remain impediments.Notably, shares of Dollar Tree have gained 24.3% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s growth of 12.6%. Let’s analyze the pros and cons of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. Solid Q4 & OutlookDespite posting lower-than-expected results, Dollar Tree’s earnings and sales improved year over year in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017. Earnings gained from higher sales, rise in comparable store sales (comps) and higher margins. Meanwhile, sales benefited from a solid performance at both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores. Additionally, it witnessed the expansion of both gross and operating margins. While gross margin growth was backed by reduced merchandise costs, lower markdowns and occupancy expenses; operating margin benefited from SG&A leverage.Going forward, the company provided a robust outlook for first-quarter and fiscal 2018. It forecasts consolidated net sales for the first quarter to be $5.53-$5.63 billion while earnings are envisioned to be $1.18-$1.25 per share. For fiscal 2018, it expects net sales of $22.70-$23.12 billion and earnings of $5.25-$5.60 per share.Remarkable Comps GrowthDollar Tree displayed remarkable comps growth for the last several quarters, mainly due to competitive pricing and strategic store expansion plans, including remodeling and relocations. Dollar Tree continues the positive trend with consolidated constant-currency comps growth of 2.4% in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, which marked the 40th straight quarter of comps growth. The fourth-quarter comps growth can be attributed to improved customer count and average ticket.While Dollar Tree banner posted comps growth of 3.8% (in constant-currency), comps at the Family Dollar banner climbed 1%. This also marked the third straight quarter of positive comps at Family Dollar, driven by a continued rebuilding of the business. Moreover, the company anticipates comps growth in a low-single-digit range for both the first-quarter and fiscal 2018.Store-Fleet Growth to Drive Top LineCurrently, Dollar Tree is concentrating on expanding its store base and incorporating technological advancements. This, in turn, enables it to generate healthy sales and gain market share. During fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, it opened 137 new stores and expanded or relocated eight. Moreover, the company opened total 603 stores in fiscal 2017.For fiscal 2018, the company expects to open nearly 650 new stores, including 350 Dollar Tree and 300 Family Dollar. Further, it plans to undertake renovations of at least 450 Family Dollar stores, relocate or expand nearly 100 stores and re-banner 50 from Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree. Notably, it remains on track to operate over 10,000 Dollar Tree and over 15,000 Family Dollar outlets across the United States in the long term.Family Dollar Integration on TrackDollar Tree is befitting from the ongoing integration of Family Dollar that was acquired in July 2015. The company is undertaking significant store renovation initiatives for Family Dollar to attract more customers. Through the integration, it expects to generate annual run rate synergies worth at least $300 million by the end of the third year of this acquisition.ConclusionWhile all seems well, Dollar Tree has been facing problems regarding highly competitive market and volatile consumer behavior. Also, significant global exposure poses a serious threat to its performance. However, we believe, its strategies will be able to offset these headwinds.Do Retail-Wholesale Stocks Grab Your Attention?

877,DG,"Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (BGFV  -  Free Report) incurred narrower-than-expected loss in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. However, the company’s top line slightly missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Further, management issued guidance for second-quarter fiscal 2018.Quarterly results marked second straight quarter of positive earnings surprise, while it delivered fourth consecutive sales miss.Q1 in DetailBig 5 Sporting incurred adjusted loss of 5 cents per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 14 cents. This compares unfavorably with earnings of 24 cents per share in the prior-year quarter. Management projected first-quarter loss per share in the band of 6-14 cents.Including one-time items, loss per share came in at 6 cents in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation QuoteNet sales dipped 7.3% to $234.2 million, marginally below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $235.1 million. The downside can be mainly attributed to an extremely challenging environment. Record warm as well as dry weather conditions in its markets have severely hurt the company’s top line this year, mainly in the first seven weeks of the first quarter. However, the arrival of core and winter weather in late February and March drove winter product sales substantially but at the cost of the spring-related product category.Further, comparable store sales (comps) dropped 7.5% against an increase of 7.9% in the year-ago quarter. In fact, comps were down in all three months of the quarter, with the highest decline witnessed in January. Month-wise, comps dipped high-teens in January due to soft sales of winter products. However, it improved every week in February but declined in low mid-single digits. In March, comps were down in low-single digits due to the shift of the Easter holiday in comparison with last year.Big 5 Sporting witnessed greater winter-related sales in March than in January this year, which was largely compensated by the loss of higher traditional spring-related sales.On a categorical basis, the company witnessed comps decline in low-double digits for apparel and in mid to high single-digit range for both hard goods and footwear in the first quarter. Costs & MarginsGross profit was $72.7 million, down nearly 13% from the prior-year quarter. Further, gross margin contracted 200 bps to 31.1% in the first quarter due to 58 bps decline in merchandise margins coupled with increased store occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales.Selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased 190 bps to 31.4%. However, total selling and administrative expenses were down $1.1 million to $73.5 million, courtesy of lower advertising costs.Nonetheless, the company incurred operating loss of $0.8 million compared to operating profit of $8.9 million in the year-ago quarter.Financial PositionBig 5 Sporting had cash of $4.9 million, long-term debt of $68.9 million and total stockholders’ equity of $183 million as of Apr 1, 2018.Management incurred capital expenditures excluding non-cash acquisitions of $2.5 million in the first quarter.

878,DG,"Hibbett Sports Inc. (HIBB  -  Free Report) reported top and bottom-line beat in third-quarter fiscal 2018. This marked the company’s third straight quarter of bottom-line beat. Moreover, the company reversed its trend of having missed sales estimates in nine of the past 10 quarters. Following the robust quarter, the company substantially raised guidance for fiscal 2018.This led the shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock to rally 15.2% on Nov 17. Further, Hibbett has gained 57.6% in the last three months, outperforming the industry’s 0.2% upside.Q3 HighlightsHibbett reported earnings of 37 cents per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 21 cents. However, results compared unfavorably with earnings of 66 cents per share reported in the prior-year quarter. The year-over-year decline in the bottom line can be attributable to lower margins and higher expenses.Hibbett Sports, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Hibbett Sports, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Hibbett Sports, Inc. QuoteNet sales inched up 0.4% to $237.8 million, topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $218 million. Results were driven by improvement in the company’s footwear and apparel businesses, alongside strong e-commerce sales, which now accounts for nearly 5% of total sales. E-commerce sales mainly gained from the company’s early marketing plan and strong conversion from online traffic. Additionally, its ongoing marketing initiatives boosted sales by improving traffic and loyalty members, as well as site navigation strength and product assortments.However, comparable-store sales (comps) fell 1.3% driven by declines in August and September comps, offset by growth in October.Hibbett’s gross profit fell 9.2% to $76.1 million, while gross margin contracted 337 basis points (bps) to 32%. The decline in margin was due to increased promotions and markdowns related to clearing of excess and aged inventory, along with higher freight costs incurred for store-to-home and e-commerce shipments. Operating income of $11.8 million declined 49.1% from $23.2 million in the year-ago quarter. This can be attributed to lower gross margin as well as higher SG&A expenses due to increased marketing expenses related to the launch of e-commerce business. However, this was partly offset by lower logistics and store occupancy expenses.Other Financial AspectsHibbett ended the quarter with nearly $58.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, no outstanding bank debt and full availability under its $80 million revolving credit facility. Total shareholders’ investment, as of Oct 28, was roughly $318.4 million.The company’s capital expenditure was $4.5 million in the quarter toward omni-channel initiatives, persistent investments in new and existing stores as well as other projects to improve business. Further, Hibbett repurchased 1.2 million shares worth $15.9 million during the quarter. As of Oct 28, the company had roughly $213 million remaining under its standing share repurchase authorization.Store UpdateIn third-quarter fiscal 2018, Hibbett introduced 13 new stores, expanded one high-performing store and shut down 11 underperforming ones. As a result, it ended the quarter with 1,082 stores across 35 states. In the long run, Hibbett targets taking its store count to 1,500.OutlookFollowing the robust third quarter, management raised fiscal 2018 earnings guidance and adjusted comps view. The company now anticipates comps decline in the mid-single-digit range, compared with the prior guidance of negative mid to high-single digits. Further, the company now envisions earnings for fiscal 2018 in the range of $1.42-$1.50 per share, up significantly from the previous forecast of $1.25-$1.35.Key PicksBetter-ranked stocks in the retail space include Big Lots Inc.

879,DG,"Groceries, until recently an insular market in the fiercely competitive retail zone, may see a radical shift in the days to come. The landscape is seeing a rapid change, with more players jumping on the offline bandwagon. The latest move in this space comes from Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), which is offering free, two-hour delivery from Whole Foods stores to its Prime members in four cities — Austin, Dallas, Cincinnati and Virginia Beach.  This is perhaps the beginning of a battle that will only intensify in the days and months to come.  The move comes within a year of the e-commerce giant’s $13.7-billion acquisition of supermarket chain Whole Foods. Customers in Austin, Dallas, Cincinnati and Virginia Beach can now order fresh produce, meat, seafood, flowers and other items that their local Whole Foods stores stock.Such a move was expected by Amazon given that it has specific plans of exploring and adding novelty to the untapped online groceries market, and the Whole Foods acquisition was a giant leap toward this direction. Needless to say, this will most likely set alarm bells ringing for brick-and-mortar grocers that so long rested assured of business safety.Consumer Focus Route to Success That said, besides sparking fear among the traditional brick-and-mortar stores, the two-hour free delivery service has been introduced keeping in mind customer demands. Consumers look for convenience and good bargains and Amazon is focusing on both. Per a Walker Sands survey, 40% would buy groceries online if they were less expensive and 23% would for it if it were more convenient. The Whole Foods acquisition was certainly a strategic move by Amazon and perhaps the best option, as most of its other technology-driven food delivery initiatives such as Amazon Go have faltered. The acquisition immediately gave Amazon access to Whole Foods’ 450 stores across the United States, thus giving it enough power to compete with brick-and-mortar giants like Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Dollar Tree (DLTR  -  Free Report) and Dollar General (DG  -  Free Report). Target has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.In doing so, the first step taken by the e-commerce behemoth was to slash prices of avocados, eggs, fruits, fish and prepared food by as much as 50%. Now, its two-hour, free-delivery service is only going to heat up competition for brick-and-mortar grocers. The idea is to lure more customers on the convenience quotient.According to David J. Livingston, a supermarket analyst for DJL Research, people generally buy the same groceries every week. And the biggest question in their mind is if they really need to go and spend an hour at Walmart or Giant for that.Grocery War at Its HeightWhile Amazon is clearing thinking big and taking bold steps, the likes of Walmart, Dollar Tree and Dollar General too are going the online way, thus creating a perfect setup for an intense war in the groceries space. According to NPD Group, about 7% of U.S. households bought groceries online last year. Among them, most prefer their orders delivered to their doors, while the rest pick up from the store. While Walmart, the country’s largest grocer is leaving no stone unturned to tap this area by offering customers the option to order online and a free pick-up from the store, Target brought online grocery-delivery company Shift to add muscle to it online delivery arm.However, Amazon seems to be playing to its strength — a strong delivery wing. The company will pull items from Whole Foods stores, bag them but get the goods delivered by its own drivers. Moreover, it is all free and within two-hours. That certainly is a big challenge for those that are trying to go the online way. More in StoreUnderstandably, there is a lot more that can be expected from retail giants in the near future. Walmart has already entered into a partnership with Japan’s Rakuten to sell e-books in the United States and strengthen its online grocery business in the Asian nation. Amazon’s move may have just ignited a fierce competition that’s only going to flare up. However, the others too seem very much in the race.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

880,DG,"Ross Stores, Inc. (ROST  -  Free Report) reported solid fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein both the top and bottom lines beat estimates and improved year over year. However, the company retained a cautious approach in forecasting views for fiscal 2018 as it continues to anticipate challenges from strong multi-year comparisons and a competitive retail landscape.On that note, shares of Ross Stores declined 6.1% in the after-hours session yesterday. However, the stock has gained 33.3% in the last six months, outperforming the industry’s 23.1% upside.Ross Store posted adjusted earnings of 98 cents a share that surpassed its guidance of 88-92 cents and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 93 cents. Earnings also improved 27.3% from 77 cents reported in the prior-year period.Ross Stores, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Ross Stores, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Ross Stores, Inc. QuoteTotal sales for the quarter rose 16% to $4,067.8 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,953.4 million, driven by a 5% increase in comparable-store sales (comps). Notably, sales and comps growth were also ahead of the company’s expected rise of 11-14% and 2-3%, respectively. Top-line growth was also driven by broad-based strength across major merchandise categories with children’s on the top. Further, sales were the strongest in Florida. Comps growth can primarily be attributed to the rise in traffic and increased average basket size.Cost of sales increased 15.1% to $2,922.6 million and 50 basis points (bps) as a percentage of sales. The increase was driven by a 40-bp rise in merchandise margin as well as a 45-bp decline in occupancy costs. However, these were partly offset by higher freight expenses and volume costs. Additionally, selling, general and administrative expenses contracted 45 bps due to the leverage on comps gain and impact of the 53rd week.Operating margin expanded 95 bps to 14.6%, which was better than the company’s expectation of 14% and 14.2%. This outperformance stemmed from improved merchandise margins, lower expenses on better-than-expected comps growth and gains from the 53rd week.Store UpdateAs of Feb 3, 2018, Ross Stores operated 1,627 outlets, including 1,409 Ross Dress for Less stores and 213 dd's DISCOUNTS stores.In first-quarter fiscal 2018, Ross Stores plans to open 29 new stores, including 23 Ross and 6 dd’s DISCOUNT outlets. For fiscal 2018, total store openings are estimated to be 100, with 75 Ross and 25 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. This guidance does not include the company’s plans to close or relocate nearly 10 older stores.FinancialsRoss Stores ended fiscal 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of $1,290.3 million, long-term debt of $312 million and total shareholders’ equity of $3,049.3 million.During the reported quarter, the company bought back 3 million shares for $226 million. In fiscal 2017, the company completed its share repurchase target by buying back a total of 13.5 million shares for $875 million.Moreover, the company increased its share repurchase authorization for 2018 to $1.075 billion, from $875 million targeted earlier. Additionally, the company also approved a 41% increase in quarterly cash dividend to 22.5 cents per share.

Thus, the company retains a cautious approach in forecasting views for fiscal 2018.

884,DG,"H&R Block Inc. (HRB  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results after the market closes on Mar 6. The company has an impressive earnings surprise history, beating estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 11.8%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key Factors to ConsiderH&R Block is continuing with its aggressive client expansion policy with compelling promotions and product offers. At the same time, the company is actively investing in innovative solutions that leverage its ability to better serve customers through customized products. These include a redesigned website to file taxes anywhere on the go, high security standards to prevent tax identity theft and enhanced security features to safeguard taxpayer information. With such core business focus, the company anticipates providing improved services to its existing clientele while attracting newer ones to augment revenues.Moreover, the company has upgraded its desktop software by adding a slew of new features. The drag and drop feature enables users to import previous tax information and tax returns from any source. In addition, a maximum of five free federal returns can be filed. Free In-person Audit Support including step by step assistance for IRS Correspondence Management, Audit Preparation and Audit Representation will also be provided.

It has also been focused on operational excellence, new product developments, partnerships, compelling marketing campaigns and promotions. The company expects these efforts to result in improved financial performance in fiscal 2018 accompanied by an increase in client trajectory.However, the company faces huge litigations in connection with its various operating activities. H&R Block is also exposed to employment related lawsuits in various parts of the country and compliance fee litigation in Missouri state and federal courts. Such litigations weigh on investors’ sentiments and hamper the company’s goodwill. Moreover, its debt-to-equity ratio compares unfavorably with the sector average. Additionally, the cash position of the company is fluctuating in nature. This raises skepticism about its ability to engage in de-leveraging activities. H&R Block uses multiple digital technologies to collect, transmit and store high volumes of personal client information, which increases information security risks. The company is highly susceptible to cyber attacks including computer viruses, malicious codes, worms, phishing attacks, social engineering, denial of service attacks and other sophisticated attacks. These cyber attacks are designed to electronically circumvent network security for malicious purposes such as unlawfully obtaining personal client information and disrupting ability to offer services. This, in turn, could damage the brand name and credibility, resulting in loss of business. H&R Block has to continually invest in security measures to keep guard against cyber espionage, which leads to additional burden on its exchequer and erodes margins. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that H&R Block is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components.

885,DG,"A layman can end up losing bucks if he decides to pick a stock only on the basis of numbers flashing on a real-time stock screen. A critical analysis of a company’s financial background is essential for a better investment decision.Often investors evaluate a company’s performance by simply looking at its sales and earnings, which sometimes do not reveal the real picture. To be more precise, they do not tell whether a company’s fundamentals are sound enough to meet its financial obligations. Here, the role of coverage ratios comes into play — the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations.Why Interest Coverage Ratio?Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt.Debt, which is crucial to financing operations for a majority of companies, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company. And the company’s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations. Therefore, Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.The Interest Coverage Ratio suggests how many times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm has for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than one suggests that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations, and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships. Definitely one should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.The Winning StrategyApart from having an Interest Coverage ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results.Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X-Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history.Projected EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years. This shows that the stock has near-term earnings growth potential.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: A Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.VGM Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential. Here are five of the 27 stocks that qualified the screening:Skechers U.S.A., Inc.

886,DG,"Rising yields have dampened the appeal for dividend stocks. Although high dividend stocks are an eye soar in the current environment, dividend growth ones pose strong fundamentals and are lucrative, especially given the new tax legislation in the United States and heightened volatility.Why Dividend Growth?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future.Moreover, a history of dividend growth year over year leads to a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those with high yields. Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3–5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past one year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment.Growth Score of B or better: Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.P/E Ratio Less than X-Industry: A ratio less than X-industry indicates that the stock is cheap and undervalued in that industry.Here are five of the 20 stocks that fit the bill:Illinois-based Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. (JLL  -  Free Report) is a full-service real estate firm that provides management services, corporate and financial services and investment management services to corporations and other real estate owners, users and investors worldwide.

Comparable brand revenues are likely to grow in the 2% to 5% range (higher than negative 0.4% seen in the prior-year quarter).Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.29 billion for the said quarter, reflecting a 3.8% increase from a year ago.However, the company’s margins are under pressure owing to increased competition and lack of robust comps growth. That said, the company will continue to strengthen its competitive advantages through innovation in e-commerce in the upcoming quarters.The company expects earnings per share between 80-87 cents in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 (compared with 79 cents reported in the prior year quarter).Overall, for the fiscal third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 84 cents per share, reflecting an increase of 6% year over year.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Williams-Sonoma does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks ESP: Williams-Sonoma has an Earnings ESP of -0.92%.Zacks Rank: Williams-Sonoma carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP.

888,DG,"A glimpse at Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST  -  Free Report) share price movement reveals that it has surged 13.4% in a year compared with the industry’s gain of 3.9%. This clearly indicates that the stock with long-term earnings per share growth rate of 9.7% looks quite disciplined in its approach to adapt to the changing retail landscape.In fact, major chains are grappling with sluggish store and mall traffic as consumers choose to shop online. But Costco’s growth strategies and sturdy comparable-store sales (comps) performance have a different story to tell.Dominant Warehouse RetailerWe believe that Costco continues to be one of the dominant retail wholesalers based on the breadth and quality of merchandise offered. In fact, the company’s strategy to sell products at heavily discounted prices has helped it to remain on a growth track as cash-strapped customers continue to reckon Costco as a viable option for low-cost necessities.Additionally, a differentiated product range enables Costco to provide an upscale shopping experience for its members, thereby resulting in market share gains and higher sales per square foot. It is also gradually expanding e-commerce capabilities in the United States, Canada, the U.K., Mexico, Korea and Taiwan. Consequently, comparable e-commerce sales for October surged 31%.  Positive Comps Performance ContinuesCostco continued with positive comparable-store sales (comps) performance driven by improved store traffic and average transaction size. Comps for October increased 7.5%, following an increase of 8.9% in September, 7.3% in August, 6.2% in July, 6% in June, 4.1% in May, 3% in April, 6% in March, 4% in February and 7% in January. Notably, net sales increased 10.1%, 12.1%, 10%, 8.8%, 7%, 7%, 5%, 9%, 8% and 9% in October, September, August, July, June, May, April, March, February and January, respectively.Enhancing Global FootprintWe are encouraged by the company’s expansion strategy. Evidently, Costco has one of the highest square footage growth in the industry and remains committed toward opening new clubs in domestic and international markets. In sync with this, it opened 23, 29 and 26 net new outlets in fiscal 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively, and plans to open nearly 25 net new warehouses in fiscal 2018. In our view, the company’s diversification strategy is a natural hedge against risks that may arise in specific markets.Deterrents to OvercomeStiff competition and cautious consumer spending remain major threats. Investors also remain concerned about contraction in gross margin and marginal decline in membership renewal rates that is expected to continue for at least a quarter or two.Costco carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Key Picks Investors may consider top-ranked stocks such as Big Lots, Inc. (BIG  -  Free Report), Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) and Ross Stores, Inc. (ROST  -  Free Report) all carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Big Lots delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 81.1% in the trailing four quarters and has a long-term earnings growth rate of 13.5%.Dollar General pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 1.8% in the trailing four quarters and has a long-term earnings growth rate of 10.8%.Ross Stores came up with an average positive earnings surprise of 6.3% in the trailing four quarters and has a long-term earnings growth rate of 10%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

889,DG,"The earnings results are usually the corner stone of gauging a company’s performance. The third-quarter 2017 earnings reporting cycle is drawing closer to an end where we already have a reasonably good picture of the winners and losers in this quarter. This gives investors a hands-on data to re-evaluate their portfolios and take on board stocks that promise handsome returns.Among all the sectors, our focus here will be upon the Retail-Wholesale sector. A close look at the sector reveals that retailers continue to struggle in an Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) dominated market. With market share growing for Amazon Prime, Marketplace and Prime Air, as well as the launch of drone delivery, Amazon is poised for exceptional growth, which undoubtedly presents fierce competition for traditional retailers.The rise of e-tailers has left the retail sector struggling with lower footfall at stores as all the brands are looking to directly sell to consumers through the expansion of digital stores. Further, these retailers are heavily investing in e-commerce and omni-channel functionalities, which are likely to weigh on margins at least in the near term.As the holiday season, which accounts for a sizeable chunk of yearly revenues and profits for retailers, is just around the corner, analysts remain optimistic about the sector’s performance on grounds of gradual wage growth, lower inflation, low unemployment rate, an uptick in the U.S. consumer sentiment and a lift in economic activity post hurricanes. Characterized by the aforementioned improvement in the consumer backdrop, alongside early-hour store openings, huge discounts, promotional strategies, price matching and free shipping on online purchases, the holiday season this November and December is likely to be a huge success.The nation's largest retail trade group, National Retail Federation (“NRF”) rightly projects retail sales for November and December (excluding autos, gas and restaurant sales) to improve 3.6-4% to $678.75-$682 billion, up from $655.8 billion (or 3.6% growth) last year and better than the five-year average sales growth of 3.5%. Additionally, the NRF projects online holiday sales to rise 7-10% to nearly $117 billion in November and December compared with a 9% improvement to $105 billion in 2015.The NRF predicts sales for the period to benefit from a longer holiday season as Christmas is falling on Monday this year and 32 days after Thanksgiving. This will give retailers one extra day of sales from usual, as well as benefit last-minute shoppers in the weekend before Christmas.While the holiday season is likely to impact the fourth-quarter of 2017, we bring our focus back to the third quarter, which is in its climax.Q3 Earnings ScorecardLooking at the earnings scorecard of the overall S&P 500 Index so far, about 436 S&P 500 members that together represent 87.2% of the Index’s total market capitalization have released third-quarter earnings results. Total earnings for these companies were up 6.8%, on 6.2% revenue growth. Further, about 73.4% delivered positive earnings surprises and about 67% beat revenue estimates.Key takeaways from the results so far point to clear revenue momentum as top-line growth has been accelerating compared with other recent periods. Further, the quarter has witness an above-average proportion of positive surprises, reflecting the carry forward of momentum from the preceding quarter. Additionally, the estimates revision trend for the fourth quarter has been favorable, with earnings estimates holding up a lot better relative to other comparable periods.Among the 16 Zacks sectors, results for the Finance sector have been below average this quarter. However, this earnings season has been favorable for the Energy, Industrial Products, Technology, Construction, Business Services, and Medical sectors.Coming to expectations, total earnings for the quarter are expected to increase 6.2% year over year, with a 5.7% jump in revenues. Here, the strength in the Technology and Energy sectors are likely to balance the soft Finance sector results.For the retail sector, in particular, earnings in the third quarter are expected to inch up 0.6%, with 6.2% revenue growth. Notably, the retail sector still has a sizable chunk of earnings to be reported. Only 47.4% of the S&P 500 members have reported results so far. Of these, 83.3% beat earnings estimates, while 66.7% topped revenue estimates. The sector has seen earnings for the quarter rise 2.9% thus far, with revenue growth of 10.9%.The real picture of the trend so far is visible from our latest Earnings Trends report published on Nov 8.That said, we bring to you seven retail stocks that may show promise based on their favorable Zacks Rank – Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – and a positive Earnings ESP.

890,DG,"We expect leading home improvement retailer, The Home Depot, Inc. (HD  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 14. In the last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.8%.Moreover, the company has a spectacular positive earnings surprise record for five years now. For the trailing four quarters, the company has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 3.8%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Home Depot will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is $1.81 per share, up 12.9% from the year-ago quarter. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter has moved up in the last 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues of $24.4 billion, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 5.4%.Home Depot, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise Home Depot, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Home Depot, Inc. (The) QuoteMoreover, we note that the stock has outperformed the industry year to date. The company’s shares have increased 22.5%, while the industry grew 16.9%. This solid growth comes on the back of a spectacular surprise history and growth strategies, including an interconnected strategy and focus on Pro customers.Factors at PlayHome Depot has been gaining from strong earnings trends, robust outlook, efforts to improve customer experience along with promising capital strategy. Additionally a recovering housing market and the rehabilitation process following the hurricanes have been aiding its performance.The company has been displaying solid growth across all regions, both in stores and online. Further, Pro category sales continue to outperform, driven by constant efforts to enrich customers’ experiences.Additionally, the company’s comparable store sales (comps) trend has been encouraging as it has surpassed the Zacks comps estimate for over two years now. In the most recent quarter, the company’s comps improved 6.3%, surpassing the Zacks estimate of 4.7%. Comps growth was aided by robust average ticket, which also topped the Zacks Consensus mark. For the third-quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for average ticket is pegged at 61.Home Depot’s second-quarter fiscal 2017 results gained from growth across the company’s interconnected platform as well as all regions. The company’s relentless focus on affording innovative products, boosting interconnected customer experience and driving productivity seems to be paying off. Additionally, housing market recovery remains a tailwind.The sturdy first half and expectations of improved home prices and re-emergence of first-time homebuyers, encouraged the company to raise fiscal 2017 view. The company anticipates sales growth of nearly 5.3%, alongside a 5.5% increase in comps. Moreover, management now anticipates earnings per share to increase about 13% to $7.29 in fiscal 2017.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that Home Depot is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

891,DG,"Ross Stores, Inc. (ROST  -  Free Report) reported solid third-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein both the top and bottom lines topped estimates and improved year over year. Further, earnings came ahead of the company’s projection despite the tough year-over-year comparisons, volatile retail environment and the impact of two major hurricanes during the quarter.Driven by the continuation of trends witnessed in the third quarter, the company raised its sales view for the fiscal fourth quarter. Also, a sturdy year-to-date performance and robust fiscal fourth-quarter projections encouraged management to perk up its earnings view for fiscal 2017.Consequently, shares of Ross Stores jumped 8.1% in the after-hours session yesterday. Moreover, the stock has gained 19.5% in the last three months, outperforming the industry’s 6% upside.Ross Store posted earnings of 72 cents a share that surpassed its guidance range of 64-67 cents and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 67 cents. Earnings also improved 16.1% from 62 cents reported in the prior-year period.Ross Stores, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Ross Stores, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Ross Stores, Inc. QuoteTotal sales for the quarter rose 7.8% to $3,328.9 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,273 million, driven by 4% increase in comparable-store sales (comps). Comps also surpassed the company’s expected rise of 1-2%. This can primarily be attributed to rise in traffic and increased average basket size.Cost of sales increased 7.4% to $2,369.1 million and 30 basis points (bps), as a percentage of sales. The improvement was driven by a 25-bps rise in merchandise margin, as well as a 20-bps decline in both occupancy and buying costs. However, these were marred by higher freight and distribution expenses. Additionally, selling, general and administrative expenses contracted 35 bps due to leverage on comps gain and non-recurring costs incurred last year.Operating margin expanded 60 bps to 13.3%, which was better than the company’s expectation of 12.4% and 12.6%. This outperformance stemmed from improved merchandise margins and leverage on higher-than-planned sales.Store UpdateThe company’s expansion plan is on track with the inclusion of 10 new dd's DISCOUNTS stores and 30 Ross Stores in the fiscal third quarter. This marked the completion of its store opening target for fiscal 2017. The company had planned to open a total of 90 stores in fiscal 2017, comprising 70 Ross and 20 dd’s DISCOUNTS outlets.Ross Stores expects to close fiscal 2017 with a total of 1,408 Ross and 213 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores.FinancialsRoss Stores ended the fiscal third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,144.2 million, long-term debt of $396.8 million and total shareholders’ equity of $2,858.5 million.During the reported quarter, the company bought back 3.6 million shares for $219 million. Year to date, the company repurchased a total of 10.5 million shares for $649 million. Evidently, it remains on track to repurchase $875 million worth shares in fiscal 2017 under its two-year $1.75 billion share repurchase program approved in February 2017. The company paid dividends worth nearly $186.5 million in the first three quarters of fiscal 2017.Concurrent to the earnings release, the company announced a quarterly cash dividend of 16 cents per share, payable on Dec 29 to shareholders on record as of Dec 1.GuidanceFollowing the solid fiscal third quarter, the company raised its sales view for the fiscal fourth quarter. The company now anticipates comps to increase 2-3% in the fiscal fourth quarter compared with the prior guidance of 1-2% growth. However, the company retained its earnings per share guidance of 88-92 cents versus 77 cents in the prior-year quarter. The company anticipates the benefit from increased comps to be offset by the certain expense timing shift into the fiscal fourth quarter this year.In addition, the company expects sales growth of 11-12% in the fiscal fourth quarter, including a benefit from the additional 53rd week. Operating margin for the quarter is projected between 14% and 14.2% compared with 13.6% recorded in the year-ago quarter. Net interest expenses are estimated at about $1.5 million, while the tax rate is projected at 37-38%.Based on the year-to-date performance and outlook for the fiscal fourth quarter, the company now projects earnings per share for fiscal 2017 in the range of $3.24-$3.28, including benefit from the additional week. On a 52-week basis, this represents growth of 12-13% from earnings of $2.83 delivered in fiscal 2016. Earlier, the company had projected earnings per share in the range of $3.16-$3.23 for fiscal 2017.Notably, the company’s guidance for both fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 includes about 8 cents benefit from the inclusion of an additional 53rd week.Zacks Rank and Key PicksRoss Stores currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

892,DG,"Dollar Tree Inc. (DLTR  -  Free Report) seems to be gaining traction since the past one month, after the decline witnessed following the dismal earnings report in May and soft fiscal 2017 view. Notably, the stock recovered to decline only 5.7% in the last one month compared with the 10.8% fall recorded in the last three months.Further, the Chesapeake, VA-based discount store retailer has outperformed the Zacks categorized Retail – Discount Stores industry’s fall of 9.9% in the last one month. Though Dollar Tree is yet to take flight, let’s take a close look at some factors that have aided recovery.Robust Comps PerformanceDollar Tree has displayed remarkable comparable-store sales (comps) growth driven by its competitive pricing and strategic store expansion plans, including remodeling and relocations. The company’s positive comps trend continued in first-quarter fiscal 2017, which marked its 37th straight quarter of comps growth. The first-quarter comps growth was backed by improved transaction count and average ticket. Moreover, the company anticipates comps growth in the range of slightly positive to low-single digit increase in the second quarter and fiscal 2017.Strategic Growth InitiativesFurther, we believe the company is on track with its long-term growth initiatives, which include store expansion strategies, enhancement of store productivity, creating new store formats, tapping of new markets and incorporating innovative sales channels to serve patrons better. Further, the company continues to implement strategies such as increasing consumables mix, rolling out freezers/coolers at stores along with multi-price point expansion, aimed at boosting top-line performance. Additionally, it is focusing on imported goods, supply chain efficiency and aggressive cost cuts to improve operating margin.Store Expansion StrategyRegarding stores, the company leverages an extensive network of stores to effectively penetrate targeted markets, enabling it to generate healthy sales and gain market share. During first-quarter fiscal 2017, the company opened 164 new stores and expanded or relocated 51 stores. With this, the company remains on track to operate over 10,000 Dollar Tree and over 15,000 Family Dollar outlets across the U.S.Family Dollar IntegrationThe company is also well on track with Family Dollar’s integration, which it had acquired in Jul 2015. The company is set to undertake store renovation initiatives for Family Dollar in the second quarter, which is likely to attract more customers. While the increased costs and cannibalization during the integration and re-banner process are expected to weigh on the company’s results for some time, it anticipates generating annual run rate synergies worth at least $300 million by the end of the third year of this acquisition.In fact, on completion of the integration, Dollar Tree is on track to become a mega U.S. discount retailer that can counter competition single handedly from retail bellwethers in the dollar-discount store segment. Further, the company will be well poised to reach out to more value-seeking consumers through a network spanning vast geographies. It will not only offer broader and multiple assortments at more compelling prices, but also will be better positioned to negotiate with suppliers which will enhance purchasing power.DeterrentsDollar Tree’s earnings missed our estimate in the last reported first-quarter fiscal 2017, after posting back-to-back surprises in the last two. Though sales improved year over year, it was somewhat impacted by delay in tax refunds and cycling of reduced SNAP benefits from last year. Moreover, management cut  fiscal 2017 earnings view.Notably, reduction in SNAP benefits has been a concern for Dollar Tree for a while now, and with chances of President Trump’s proposed food stamp cut getting passed, the situation could get worse. Trump has suggested reducing food stamps program by $193 billion, which is approximately 25% of the budget for the program. Cut in SNAP benefits is likely to hamper Dollar Tree’s performance, as people with low income will have less money to spend and could restrict their spending to low margin products.Bottom LineThough the company’s near-term performance is likely to be troubled, its long-term initiatives and the Family Dollar integration provide a positive outlook for the future. With these initiatives on the cards, we believe the company can surely overcome these near term hurdles.Aptly, Dollar Tree currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Investors looking for growth may, however, consider placing bets on Target Corp. (TGT  -  Free Report) with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), as well as Dollar General Corp.

893,DG,"John Wiley & Sons Inc. (JW.A  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 financial numbers before the opening bell on Dec 6, 2017. In the preceding quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 11.3%. Notably, it has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 14.8%.What to ExpectThe question lingering in investors’ minds is whether John Wiley & Sons will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter is pegged at 83 cents, reflecting a year-over-year increase of more than 9%. Notably, the consensus estimate has been stable in the past 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $429 million in comparison with $426 million, reported in the prior-year period.Factors Influencing this QuarterWe believe the company’s results in the quarter to be reported are likely to be driven by strength in the Research and Solutions divisions as well as online program management and professional assessment. John Wiley & Sons remains on track with efforts to provide better digital products and services to professionals, researchers and educators worldwide. The company is also undertaking plans to realign cost structure and reinvesting in particular areas with growth potential along with efficiently allocating resources.However, the company continues to face weak demand for printed books due to the shift from print to digital and increased share of rentals. Evidently, revenues for publishing declined 7% in fiscal 2017 with book witnessing a fall of 11% primarily due to softness in print market. In fiscal 2018, the company anticipates the overall business to be steady but softness in print book markets will continue to persist.John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | John Wiley & Sons, Inc. QuoteZacks Model Shows Unlikely Earnings BeatOur proven model does not conclusively show that John Wiley & Sons is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. John Wiley & Sons has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 83 cents. Although, the company’s Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.

894,DG,"We often judge a company on the basis of its sales and earnings numbers. These, however, may not be enough. Sometimes, a stock gets a boost if these numbers climb year over year or surpass estimates in a particular quarter. This will definitely be a great opportunity for an investor with a shorter horizon to cash in on. But if you seek long-term returns, investments backed only by sales and earnings numbers may not yield the desired results.A critical analysis of a company’s financial background is a prerequisite for an informed investment decision. Here, coverage ratios that determine whether a company is sound enough to meet its financial obligations play a crucial role. The higher the ratio, the better it is. The focus of this article is on “Interest Coverage,” which is one such ratio.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.Why Interest Coverage Ratio?Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt.Debt, which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and its creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets interest obligations. Therefore, Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.Interest Coverage Ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than 1.0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships. Definitely, one should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.The Winning StrategyApart from having an Interest Coverage Ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results.Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X-Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history.Projected EPS Growth (%)greater than X-Industry Median: This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years. This shows that the stock has near-term earnings growth potential.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.VGM Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential. Here are five of the 28 stocks that qualified the screening:Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report), which is engaged in the designing, building, overhauling and repairing of ships, has an expected EPS growth rate of 15% for 3-5 years with a VGM Score of B. The stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc. (SFM  -  Free Report), which provides fresh, natural, and organic food, has a VGM Score of A. This Zacks Rank #2 stock has an expected EPS growth rate of 12.7% for 3-5 years.Lithia Motors, Inc. (LAD  -  Free Report), which operates automotive franchises, and retails new and used vehicles, has a VGM Score of A. This Zacks Rank #2 stock has an expected EPS growth rate of 20% for 3-5 years.Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report), a discount retailer, has a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of B.

(BURL  -  Free Report), Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) and Big Lots, Inc. (BIG  -  Free Report) have managed to stay afloat amid the changing retail landscape.

898,DG,"Shares of Dollar General (DG  -  Free Report) hit a new 52-week high after the company beat top and bottom line third-quarter estimates on Thursday, helping lift the rest of the discount retail industry—including Burlington Stores (BURL  -  Free Report) and Dollar Tree (DLTR  -  Free Report).The retail sector has been shaky in recent years, as Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) online shopping revolution really heated up. Nevertheless, Dollar General has managed to grow in a more traditional brick-and-mortar fashion.The company reported Q3 revenues of $5.90 billion, which marked an 11% year-over-year jump.

899,DG,"Herbalife Ltd. (HLF  -  Free Report) delivered third-quarter 2017 results, wherein both top and bottom lines declined year over year. Further, earnings came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate, after beating the same for 11 consecutive quarters. Management curtailed its outlook for 2017, which weighed upon investors’ sentiment. Evidently, shares of this nutritional-products company dropped about 6% in yesterday’s after-market trading session.However, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has surged 46.3% so far this year, largely attributable to its impressive earnings surprise history. Further, Herbalife’s stock price performance fared better than the industry, which declined 16.5% in the same period. Thus, let’s delve deeper and see if yesterday’s outcome can turn the tables for the stock, or will Herbalife’s growth initiatives keep it going.Quarter in DetailAdjusted earnings of 82 cents per share came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate, though it slumped 32.2% year over year. Also, the quarterly figure was close to the lower end of the company’s recently updated guidance of 80-90 cents for the third quarter. On a GAAP basis, earnings came in at 66 cents per share, down from $1.01 reported in the year-ago period.Herbalife LTD. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Herbalife LTD. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Herbalife LTD. Quote Increased interest expense, lower volumes and shift of certain promotional event related expenses from the second quarter to the second half of the year weighed upon the bottom line. Further, currency had a negative impact on the bottom line and margins. Evidently, gross margin contracted 120 bps to 80.2% on account of the aforementioned expense shift and unfavorable currency translations.Owing to soft volumes, net sales of $1,085.4 million slipped 3.3% year over year and came slightly below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,086 million. The sales shortfall was within management’s updated guidance range of 1.9-3.4%. On a constant currency basis, sales fell 4%. Well, this was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year top-line decline.Volumes slid 5.6% in the third quarter, compared with an 8% drop recorded in the preceding quarter.  Regionally, volumes in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia Pacific climbed 2.7% and 1% respectively. Sales volumes in all other regions fell, with North America suffering the maximum plunge of 16.1%. Volumes at Mexico tumbled 9%, while South & Central America and China witnessed volume declines of 6.8% and 3.5%, respectively.While the company anticipated that results in the United States and China would be drab, Mexico's volume was lower than expected yet again. This mainly stemmed from the fact that Mexico generates significant business from the areas that were affected by earthquakes. Management stated that this natural disaster hurt Mexican volumes by 200 bps in the quarter and the impact also lingered into early fourth quarter.As for the United States, volume decline improved on a sequential basis, thanks to the implementation of its strategic plan earlier this year, including programs to boost activity. Management expects these efforts to lead to volume growth in North America in the second quarter of 2018, once the changes are annualized. In China, volumes continued being troubled by government’s limits on firms to conduct meetings, thus restricting distributor activities. Other Financial UpdatesHerbalife ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,636.3 million, long-term debt of $2,176.6 million and total shareholders’ equity of $219 million.During the nine months ended Sep 30, 2017, the company generated cash flow from operations of $404.4 million and incurred capital expenditure of $67.9 million.Since the inception of the buyback program approved earlier in the year, the company has bought back nearly 11.3 million shares for approximately $757 million. Following this, the company had shares worth $743 remaining for buyback under its $1.5 billion program.Further, Herbalife concluded a tender offer for nearly 6.7 million shares for a total of roughly $457.8 million, including the CVR per share. Notably, these shares formed 7.2% of the company’s total outstanding shares.OutlookWith 2017 being a transformation year for the company, Herbalife remains focused on implementing new technologies; shifting its distributors’ focus toward learning latest tools and business methods; undertaking innovations and launching new products. The company is progressing well with this strategic plan, and expects to witness improved trends this year, and attain growth in 2018.2017For full-year 2017, management trimmed its sales and earnings outlook. Herbalife now expects sales to decline in the range of 1.9-0.6%. Earlier sales growth was anticipated in a band of down 3% to up 2%. On a currency adjusted basis, sales are expected to fall 2.1% to 0.8%, compared with down 2.7% to up 2.3% expected earlier. Volumes are now expected to be down 4.2% to 2.9%, compared with 5% to flat growth forecasted earlier.Consequently, management now expects adjusted earnings in the range of $4.42-$4.62, compared with $4.30-$4.70 per share expected earlier. The consensus mark is currently pegged at $4.60, and the updated guidance remains lower than the 2016 adjusted earnings of $4.85 per share. This includes a negative currency impact of 20 cents. On a currency adjusted basis, adjusted earnings are expected in a range of $4.62-$4.82 per share.Q4Herbalife expects sales to grow in a range of 2.3-7.3%, while volume growth is envisioned in a band of decline 4% to up 1%. On a currency neutral basis, sales growth is expected to range from 0.7% dip to 4.3% increase.For fourth-quarter 2017, the company expects adjusted earnings per share to range from 84 cents-$1.04. Excluding the currency impact, adjusted earnings are expected in a range of 80 cents-$1.00 per share. The consensus mark is pegged at $1.02.2018Management also provided an initial view for 2018, wherein it expects net sales to jump 5.5-9.5% (up 4.3-8.3% on a currency neutral basis). Volumes are expected to grow 2-6%. Finally, management expects the bottom line to come in a band of $4.60 to $5.00 per share, much lower than the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.65. Currency-neutral earnings are likely to range from $4.50-$4.90 per share.Notably, capital expenditure is envisioned in a band of $20 to $40 million for fourth-quarter 2017, $88-$108 million for full year 2017 and $115-$155 million for 2018.3 Retail Stocks in the LimelightBurlington Stores, Inc.

900,DG,"Are you apprehensive that a bubble formed by an overvalued stock market can burst anytime? Or are you scared of rising rate concerns with both the Fed and ECB giving hawkish signals?Well, fear before Halloween is understandable. But unlike the real event, its effect on the market is not at all scary. In fact, instead of tricking investors, the Halloween Effect is usually a treat.Halloween Effect is a historically observed increase in stock prices from the month of November through the end of April. It is exactly opposite the popular adage ""sell in May and then walk away” which refers to the six months between May 1 and Oct 31.Among overall buoyancy, retail sales deserve a special mention this time around. Vacations, holiday season buying (both Christmas and spring season) and seasonal optimism may play a huge role in this surge.The National Retail Federation expects retail sales to grow between 3.6% and 4%, totaling $678.75 billion to $682 billion in the November-December period. Also, the International Council of Shopping Centers sees a 3.8% uptick in retail sales. Deloitte sees this figure going higher to 4% to 4.5% (without considering cars and gasoline). Forrester Research estimates that online sales will jump 12% this holiday season, to $129 billion (read: 3 ETFs to Tap Upbeat Electronics Sales Forecast).In fact, the likely rosy trend starts with Halloween itself as the event greets the fall season. And “conventional wisdom is that strong Halloween spending is an indicator of strong Christmas season spending” as per an analyst. So, let’s take a look at the Halloween sales projection.Spending to Touch All-Time High This HalloweenHalloween spending jumped three times in the last 12 Years.

The company’s Retailer iQ platform has been doing remarkably well as more retailers and brands are choosing it in order to drive their digital-marketing activities.  In the last quarter, revenues from Retailer iQ surged 69% year over year and represented 41% of total revenue. Promotions revenue increased 15% from the year-ago quarter.Further, the number of retailers that have deployed Retailer iQ at POS and live at retail stores, improved from 25 in the first quarter to 27 in the second quarter.

QuoteMoreover, approximately 50 million shoppers (as compared with 40 million at the end of 2016) are now registered with Retailer iQ, which represents almost 40% of all U.S. households.

902,DG,"The past three months have turned out to be an eventful one for Retail-Discount & Variety industry. The industry has advanced 9.3%, outperforming the S&P 500’s gain of 3.5%. Moreover, it also occupies top 9% (24 out of 265) position among the Zacks classified industries. Stocks such as Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report), Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report), PriceSmart, Inc. (PSMT  -  Free Report) and Ross Stores, Inc. (ROST  -  Free Report) have witnessed a gain of 13.3%, 15%, 9% and 15%, respectively. Today we will focus on Target and try to analyze the catalysts that may help the stock to sustain momentum going forward.Strategic Endeavors Well on TrackTarget’s initiatives such as the development of omni-channel capacities, diversification and localization of assortments along with emphasis on flexible format stores bode well. Management plans to expand merchandise assortments with special emphasis on Style, Baby, Kids, and Wellness categories that are performing well. Moreover, the company is also concentrating on rationalization of supply chain, technology and process improvements.These initiatives helped it to continue with upbeat performance in fiscal 2017 as reflected from impressive second-quarter results and an encouraging earnings outlook. Management now envisions third-quarter earnings in the band of 75-95 cents and fiscal 2017 earnings between $4.34 and $4.54 up from $3.80 to $4.20 per share projected earlier.Focus on Digital TransformationWith digital transformation in shopping and consumers splurging online, store and mall traffic has been hit hard. As a result, most retailers including big-box ones are struggling to compete with e-commerce channels. Nevertheless, this transition in buying pattern has persuaded retailers to come up with innovative ways to market products, and Target is no exception to the trend.In a bid to stimulate digital sales this holiday season, Target is strengthening relationship with Google by allowing customers nationwide to shop through Google Express, including voice-activated shopping. Target informed that customers will get their orders delivered within a couple of days, as the items will be shipped from a nearby outlet.Further, Target, which has taken several strategic initiatives to drive performance, recently launched curbside pickup program, at 50 Twin Cities stores. This program gives customers an option to get their ordered items without leaving the comfort of their cars.To avail the service the customers need to place orders via the latest version of Target’s app and then select “Drive Up”. Target will inform the customers when the order is ready for delivery. Once the shopper arrives to the chosen parking spot outside the Target store, an employee will bring the order to the vehicle.Wrapping UpWe believe company is leaving no stone unturned to attract consumers and attain incremental revenues.

903,DG,"More than a month has gone by since the last earnings report for Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 10.3% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Dollar General Q2 Earnings & Sales Top EstimatesDollar General delivered positive earnings surprise for the third consecutive quarter, when the company posted second-quarter fiscal 2017 results. The company reported earnings of $1.08 per share. However, on an adjusted basis earnings per share came in at $1.10, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny and also increased 2% year over year.Net sales came in at $5,828.3 million, an increase of 8.1% from the prior-year quarter. Moreover, net sales came ahead the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,816 million, marking the third consecutive quarter of beat. Increase in sales was driven by robust performance of consumables and seasonal categories.The company’s comparable-store sales increased 2.6% year over year primarily owing to rise in average transaction amount as well traffic. Consumables and seasonal categories provided a boost to the comparable-store sales while the home products and apparel categories had a negative impact.Sales in the Consumables category increased 8.9% to $4,484.4 million, while the Seasonal category witnessed a rise of 6.5% in sales to $718 million. Home products sales increased 3.8% to $327.6 million and Apparel category sales grew 4.3% to $298.3 million.Gross profit advanced 6.5% to $1,790.5 million, while gross margin contracted 47 basis points (bps) to 30.7% owing to increased markdowns and promotional activities along with a higher percentage of sales of consumables which generally have lesser gross profit in comparison with non-consumables.Operating profit declined 3.1% to $493.1 million, while operating margin decreased more than 90 bps to 8.5%.Other Financial DetailsDollar General ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $214.2 million, long-term obligations of $2,683.1 million and shareholders’ equity of $5,687.1 million. In the first six months of fiscal 2017, the company incurred capital expenditures of $314 million. The company continues to anticipate capital expenditure for fiscal 2017 to be in the range of $715-$765 million.The company bought back one million shares in the second quarter. Since the commencement of the share repurchase program in December 2011, the company has bought back 76.7 million shares aggregating $4.7 billion. At the end of the second quarter, the company has an outstanding authorization of nearly $770 million. Further, management announced a quarterly dividend of 26 cents per share that will be payable on Oct 24, 2017 to shareholders of record as on Oct 10. Further in fiscal 2017, the company continues to expect share repurchase of nearly $450 million.Store AcquisitionThe company stated that in Jun 12, 2017, it completed the buyout of 285 Acquired Stores. The new store sites are expected to be converted in to Dollar General’s banner by November 2017 end.OutlookIncluding the impact from the aforementioned buyout, management now anticipates net sales to rise in the band of 5-7%. However, the company expects GAAP earnings in the band of $4.35-$4.50 per share, up from the previous guided range of $4.25-$4.50.  Same-store sales growth is still anticipated in the band of marginally positive to 2% for fiscal 2017.Moreover, the company intends to introduce roughly 1,285 new outlets, relocate or remodel 760 stores. As of Aug 4, 2017, Dollar General operated 13,865 stores across 43 states.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Following the release, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There has been one revision higher for the current quarter. While looking back an additional 30 days, we can see even more upward momentum. There have been three moves up in the last two months.Dollar General Corporation Price and Consensus  Dollar General Corporation Price and Consensus | Dollar General Corporation QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, Dollar General's stock has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with an F. The stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Zacks' style scores indicate that the company's stock is suitable for value and growth investors.OutlookWhile estimates have been moving upward, the magnitude of the revision is net zero.

904,DG,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Dollar General has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16.9, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Dollar General’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 18.1 over the past five years. Moreover, the current level stands well below the highs for the stock, suggesting that it could be a great entry point.Further, the stock’s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 27.3. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers. We should also point out that Dollar General’s forward PE is roughly same as its trailing twelve months value, so we might say that the forward earnings estimates are incorporated in the company’s share price as of now. We define forward PE as current price relative to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current fiscal year.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Dollar General has a P/S ratio of about 0.9. This is way lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.1 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, DG is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Dollar General currently has a Value Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Dollar General a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?While Dollar General might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of G and a Momentum Score of A. This gives DG a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging. The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to no downward revisions, while the full year estimate has seen two upward and no downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a slightly positive impact on the consensus estimate, as the full year estimate has inched higher by 0.5%, while the current quarter consensus estimate has remained unchanged. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Dollar General Corporation Price and Consensus  Dollar General Corporation Price and Consensus | Dollar General Corporation QuoteHowever, this somewhat bullish trend has likely not yet been reflected in the stock, as we have just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which indicates expectations of in-line performance in the near term.Bottom LineDollar General is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Further, this Zacks Rank #3 company enjoys a solid Zacks Industry Rank (among Top 26% of more than 250 industries).  However, owing to a challenging retail landscape and evolving consumer preferences, the industry has underperformed the broader market in the past two years. This is visible from the chart below:So, value investors might want to wait for the broader industry factors to turn favorable, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

However, the company’s revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter in row.The company posted quarterly earnings of 48 cents per share beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 45 cents and also came above the company’s initial guidance of 40-45 cents, on account of cost optimization as well as non-operating income gains. However, the company’s earnings declined 31% year over year.Despite reporting better-than-expected bottom-line, the company’s shares declined more than 5.5% in after-hour trading session on Aug 16, as investors were hurt by guidance cut.

Total Victoria’s Secret sales dropped 12% to $1,646.3 million, while comparable sales declined 14%.

Other revenues increased 11% to $134.5 million.Adjusted gross profit dropped 8% to $1,027.9 million, while gross margin contracted 120 basis points (bps) to 37.3% primarily due to buying and occupancy expenditure deleverage during the quarter. Adjusted operating income decreased 26% to $300.9 million, while the operating margin fell 320 bps to 10.9%. Decline in operating income was chiefly due to Victoria’s Secret.L Brands, Inc.

906,DG,"On Aug 16, we issued an updated research report on Williams-Sonoma, Inc. (WSM  -  Free Report), a multi-channel specialty retailer of premium quality home products.Innovation & Positive Housing Market Are TailwindsProduct innovation plays a huge role in the company’s success. Williams-Sonoma addresses the ever-changing preferences of the customers’ demand with much expertise.  The company has studios providing infrastructure for development of new products, techniques and collaboration with other artists. The company offers exclusive designs for home-furnishing products, textiles, accessories and entertaining essentials. Williams-Sonoma also collaborates with celebrated brands and designers to offer exclusive designs on home-furnishing products.Apart from its innovative drive, Williams-Sonoma is one of the largest e-commerce retailers in the United States. The company’s direct-to-customer segment operates through e-commerce websites and direct mail catalogues. This segment generates around 52% of its revenues and regularly posts strong operating margins.Also, the company’s investment in merchandising the brands, efficient catalog circulations and digital marketing boosts its e-commerce revenues. In addition, it is consistently improving its website and mobile shopping experience. The company will continue to strengthen its competitive advantages through innovation in e-commerce in the upcoming quarters.Importantly, Williams-Sonoma’s products primarily focus on home-furnishings and demand for its products is therefore related to the broader housing construction market’s performance. Positives like an improving economy, modest wage growth, low unemployment levels, a positive consumer confidence as well as a tight supply situation raise optimism about the housing sector’s performance in 2017. Thus, demand for William-Sonoma’s products should increase as well, thereby driving its revenues further.Soft Comparable Revenues a Major HeadwindWilliams-Sonoma has been witnessing soft comparable brand revenues for quite some time. The rate of increase of comparable brand revenues has decreased significantly from 7.1% in 2014 to 3.7% in 2015 and 0.7% in 2016. Comparable brand revenues inched up 0.1% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, significantly lower than the 4.5% rise recorded in the preceding quarter. The rate of comparable brand revenue increase has softened across all the brands over the years.The PBteen brand has been hurt the most, thus reporting a 6.2% decline in comparable brand revenues in 2016 compared with a 2.7% fall in 2015. Comparable brand revenue of PBteen brand declined 14.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared with a 1.9% increase in the year-ago quarter. In fact, the company expects comparable brand revenues growth in the modest 1–3% range for 2017. This does not indicate any significant improvement from the current trend.Share Price PerformanceThough Williams-Sonoma’s shares have lost 8.6% so far this year compared with the 0.5% gain of its industry, earnings estimate for the current year has moved slightly upward. This signals analysts’ optimism for the stock. Going forward, strong brand portfolio along with focus on innovation and transformation should drive the stock’s performance in the upcoming quarters as well.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksWilliams-Sonoma carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the same sector are Dollar General Corp. (DG  -  Free Report), The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX  -  Free Report) and Target Corp. (TGT  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2.

The decline in the top line was primarily due to 5% fall in URBN retail segment comp, which somewhat offset a robust 10% gain in Free People Wholesale sales as well as a $13 million rise in non-comp sales.Net sales by brands fell 8.5% to $323.8 million at Urban Outfitters and 1.3% to $362.4 million at Anthropologie Group but increased 9.6% to $180.2 million at Free People. For Food and Beverage net sales came in at $6.4 million compared with $5.7 million in the prior-year quarter.The company’s net sales declined 3.1% to $690.4 million at the Retail Segment but jumped 10% to $82.3 million at the Wholesale Segment.Comparable retail segment net sales, including the comparable direct-to-consumer channel, were down 4.9% year over year. Comparable retail segment net sales fell 7.9% at Urban Outfitters and 4% at Anthropologie Group but increased 2.9 % at the Free People. Decline in comparable Retail segment sales can primarily be attributed to dismal retail store sales performance which overshadowed growth in the company’s direct-to-consumer channel. Meanwhile, Wholesale segment net sales jumped 10%.Margin PerformanceGross profit for the quarter came in at $297.3 million, down 13.2% from the year-ago quarter, while gross margin contracted 440 basis points (bps) to approximately 34.1% primarily due to deleverage in customer delivery and logistics expense rates. It was further impacted by higher markdowns due to dismal performance of women’s apparel and accessories product at Anthropologie and Urban Outfitters.Management anticipates gross margin rate to decline year over year in third-quarter fiscal 2018 on account of rise in delivery as well as de-leverage in store occupancy expenditures.Operating income declined to $75.2 million from $118.2 million reported in the year-ago quarter, while operating margin shriveled approximately 466 bps to 8.6% in the quarter.Store UpdateIn the first six months of 2017, the company opened 12 new outlets – six Free People stores, four Urban Outfitters store and one each Anthropologie Group store and Beverage restaurant. The company shuttered six stores – one Anthropologie Group store, Urban Outfitters store, Food and Beverage restaurant and three Free People stores – in the same time frame.During fiscal 2018, the company plans to open a total of 18 net new outlets, while shutting down nine stores to lease expiration. The company anticipates opening four net new Urban Outfitters stores, including three in Europe and one in North America; four net new Anthropologie stores and nine net new Free People stores. The food and beverage division has already opened one restaurant.Urban Outfitters, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Urban Outfitters, Inc.

909,DG,"Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) remains committed toward better price management, merchandise initiatives and cost containment. The company’s strategic endeavors have helped it to deliver better-than-expected numbers for the third straight quarter, as it posted second-quarter fiscal 2017 results. Despite robust results, its shares have gained only 5.4%. However, the stock has outperformed the industry which has witnessed a decline of 3.2%. Let’s delve deeper and find out what is hindering Dollar General’s growth.Gross Margin Woes Taking a TollGross margin, an important financial metric, that gives an indication about the company’s health, has shown constant deceleration in the past four quarters. In the second quarter, gross margin contracted 47 basis points (bps) to 30.7%, following a decline of 34 bps to 30.3% in the preceding quarter due to higher markdowns and promotional activities along with a higher percentage of sales of consumables, which generally have lower margins in comparison with non-consumables. In the fourth and third quarters of fiscal 2016, gross margin contracted 20 bps and 30 bps to 31.6% and 29.8%, respectively.Proposed Cut in SNAP Benefit a Major ObstacleReduction in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefit has been haunting Dollar General for a long time and if President Trump’s proposed food stamp cut get passed, the situation could be worse. Trump suggests on reducing food stamps program by $193 billion, which is approximately 25% of the budget for the program. Cut in SNAP benefit will hamper the company’s performance as people with low income will have less money to spend and could restrict spending to low margin products. It has also stated that cut in SNAP program has impacted 56% of store base. However, the company stated that the impact of both price and SNAP benefits reduction has moderated in the second quarter.ConclusionDespite the above mentioned circumstances, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has kept it afloat in a competitive environment. Dollar General’s comparable-store sales growth story is impressive. Fiscal 2016 was the 27th consecutive year of comparable-store sales growth for the company. The company’s upbeat second-quarter fiscal 2017 performance and buyout of 285 Acquired Stores prompted management to raise earnings outlook. It now anticipates earnings in the band of $4.35-$4.50 per share, up from the earlier estimate of $4.25-$4.50.3 Retail Stocks Hogging the LimelightTop-ranked stocks, which warrant a look in the retail sector includes, Big Lots, Inc.

911,DG,"Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Dec 7. In the preceding quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 0.9%. Notably, the company’s earnings have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 1.8% in three of the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is 94 cents, up nearly 6% year over year. Analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues of $5,803 million, up roughly 9% from the year-ago quarter. Well the obvious question that comes to mind is whether Dollar General will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter under review. Let’s take a look at factors influencing the quarter.Factors at PlayWe believe the company’s results in the quarter to be reported will be driven by the buyout of 285 Acquired Stores. Earlier, the company raised fiscal 2017 outlook primarily due to recent store buyout deal. It anticipates GAAP earnings in the band of $4.35-$4.50 per share, up from the previous guided range of $4.25-$4.50. Further, the company’s commitment toward better price management, cost containment, private label offering, effective inventory management, merchandise and operational initiatives bode well. Moreover, in order to increase traffic, Dollar General is focusing on both consumables and discretionary items.Analyst surveyed by the Zacks expects sales in the Consumables category to be $4,477 million, up 8.2% year over year. Meanwhile, Home products sales are projected to be $340 million, up 3% year over year.Of late, Dollar General has been bearing the brunt of price deflation and the reduction in SNAP benefits that may weigh on comparable-store sales performance. The current administration is suggesting on reducing food stamps program. Cut in SNAP benefit may hurt performance as people with low income will have less money to spend and could restrict their spending to low margin products.Dollar General Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Dollar General Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Dollar General Corporation QuoteWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model shows that Dollar General is likely to beat estimates this quarter as the stock has the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen.Dollar General has an Earnings ESP of +0.89% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.

Evidently, this beauty products manufacturer has surged 66.2% so far, this year, crushing the industry’s growth of 18.7%. So, let’s delve deeper into the factors that have spurred investors’ confidence in this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, which is most likely to keep its spectacular show on. Sturdy Surprise History Estee Lauder has been riding on its solid surprise history, which was retained in first-quarter fiscal 2018. Notably, Estee Lauder marked its 13th consecutive quarter of earnings beat, while sales kept its positive surprise trend alive for the third straight time. Also, both top and bottom lines advanced year over year, with the latter gaining from the buyouts of BECCA and Too Faced. Moreover, the company witnessed strength across nearly all geographic regions and product categories, with skin care standing out. Sales were also fueled by growth in several developed and emerging markets (especially China and Hong Kong). Further, growth in travel retail and online channels have been driving Estee Lauder’s performance.Outlook Boosts EstimatesManagement expects continued growth opportunities in the global prestige beauty industry, which is anticipated to grow 4-5% during fiscal 2018. Additionally, acquisitions, better quality products, innovation and improved market reach are expected to positively impact sales during the year.

Also, investors turned optimistic on the stock, as shares of the company have jumped 12.4% since the earnings release.Solid Presence in Emerging Markets, Especially ChinaEstee Lauder garners a significant amount of revenues from the emerging markets and has bright prospects in China, wherein sales soared nearly 50% in the first quarter. This was driven by double-digit growth in all brands, with MAC, Tom Ford and Lab Series businesses nearly doubling year over year. Also, management stated that its makeup business doubled for the second straight quarter, whereas performance of its skin care and luxury fragrance business also remained favorable in the quarter. The company’s Chinese operations have been gaining from rising demand from millennials, and management envisions continued strength in luxury products in China, which keeps it encouraged about making incremental investments in the region. The company is also growing its online sales in the region through T-mall, the largest digital platform run by Chinese e-commerce giant, Alibaba.Buyouts — Major Growth DriverEstee Lauder’s acquisitions of BECCA and Too Faced (during first-quarter fiscal 2017) has strengthened its fastest growing prestige portfolio and contributed significantly to the reported sales growth in first-quarter fiscal 2018. Also, management expects these brands to contribute roughly 2 percentage points to the company’s overall sales growth in fiscal 2018.The investment in DECIEM — a fast-growing multi-brand company is also likely to aid beauty sales. Such acquisitions help the company to expand its portfolio apart from helping it attain the respective loyal customer base.Strong Online Business to Boost Top LineEstee Lauder has a strong online business and the company expects it to be a major growth engine for the upcoming few years. Notably, online sales grew 33% in first-quarter fiscal 2018, driven largely by increased traffic, order size and conversions. Thanks to technological advancement and the growing popularity of social media, mobile sales constituted about 70% of the company’s online traffic and remains a major growth driver. Well, Estee Lauder remains focused on widening its global online presence by adding new sites and expanding retailer distributions. Evidently, the company launched more than 100 sites in the first quarter.Clearly, the aforementioned growth drivers and encouraging outlook highlight Estee Lauder’s splendid prospects, thus making it a solid investment option.Looking for More?

917,DG,"RH (RH  -  Free Report), formerly Restoration Hardware, is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results (ending Oct 28) after the closing bell on Dec 5.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 38.3%. The company also surpassed/met expectations in each of the last four quarters, with the average beat being 21.7%.In fact, shares of RH, one of the leading home furnishings companies, have rallied more than 200% so far this year, breezing past the Zacks Home Furnishings industry’s gain of only 10.7%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayRH’s efforts toward redesigning its supply chain network, rationalizing product offerings and the Waterworks acquisition are driving growth and are expected to contribute in the to-be-reported quarter as well. The company’s initiatives like RH Modern, RH Teen, RH Hospitality, redesign of RH Interiors Source Book, and rollout of Design Ateliers across its retail Galleries are expected to contribute to growth in 2017 and beyond.Recently, the company raised guidance for the fiscal third quarter and fiscal 2017, highlighting the earnings power of “our new membership model, and a dramatically more efficient operating platform”.The company expects third-quarter revenues to be about $592.5 million, suggesting an increase of 8% on a year-over-year basis despite an approximate 1% negative impact from the recent natural calamities. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues currently stands at $599.2 million, up 9.1% year over year.Again, despite a 1% or 5 cents per share of negative impact from hurricanes Harvey and Irma, RH’s adjusted earnings are expected to be in the range of $1.02-$1.04 per share for the fiscal third quarter compared with the previous guidance of 68 cents to 80 cents. This reflects a substantial increase from the year-ago level of 20 cents.For the fiscal third quarter, the consensus estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.04 per share, implying 444.7% growth.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?RH does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter..  Zacks ESP: RH has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.Zacks Rank: RH carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP.

918,DG,"H&R Block Inc. (HRB  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results before the market opens on Dec 6. The company has a positive earnings surprise history, beating estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters with an average surprise of 11.4%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key Factors to ConsiderH&R Block is continuing with its aggressive client expansion policy with compelling promotions and product offers. At the same time, the company is actively investing in innovative solutions that leverage its ability to better serve customers through customized products. These include a redesigned website to file taxes anywhere on the go, high security standards to prevent tax identity theft and enhanced security features to safeguard taxpayer information. With such core business focus, the company anticipates providing improved services to its existing clientele while attracting newer ones to augment revenues.As part of the nationwide program for health care exchange enrollment, H&R Block partnered GoHealth Insurance whereby its clients can purchase health care insurance online or over the phone through licensed GoHealth agents. GoHealth thus helped H&R Block foray into the health insurance brokerage business. This, in turn, will open up additional revenue-generating opportunities for the company.Furthermore, H&R Block has collaborated with BofI Federal Bank, wherein the latter would become the exclusive refund advance provider for its customers. The Refund Advance program continues to be a valuable product for the early season clients, who are looking to access their refund faster. Also, it supplements its Tax Plus product suite, which is the most robust in the industry.However, the performance of the company is tied to the overall health of the economy. With stressed economic environment, the overall tax filing market is expected to be under pressure. As a result, we expect the impending quarterly earnings to remain stressed.In addition, H&R Block faces huge litigations in connection with its various operating activities. It is exposed to employment related lawsuits in various parts of the country and compliance fee litigation in Missouri state and federal courts. Such litigations weigh on investor sentiments and hamper the company’s goodwill. Moreover, its debt-to-equity ratio compares unfavorably with the sector’s average. Additionally, the cash position of the company is fluctuating in nature. This raises skepticism about its ability to engage in de-leveraging activities.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that H&R Block is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.H&R Block, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  H&R Block, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | H&R Block, Inc. QuoteZacks Rank: H&R Block has a Zacks Rank #3. While this increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.89% and Zacks Rank #2.

919,DG,"Dave & Buster’s Entertainment, Inc. (PLAY  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Dec 5, after market close.Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 29.09%. In fact, the company has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the 12 quarters it has reported so far and has an average positive earnings surprise of 34.36% for the trailing four quarters.Owing to its unique business style, Dave & Buster’s generates favorable store economics and strong return. The company continues to perform well on the customizable experience it offers across its platforms — “Eat, Drink, Play and Watch.”Apart from operating in the restaurant space, Dave & Buster’s offers a wide range of recreational options like games and live sports along with other televised events. Focus on the gaming segment has cushioned the company against headwinds in the restaurant industry and is in turn driving market share and comps.In fact, the company’s entertainment business, which accounted for nearly 57.7% of the total revenues in the last reported quarter has been the most significant contributor to top-line growth.In fact, the consensus estimate for revenues for the quarter is pegged at $255.4 million, reflecting 11.7% year-over-year growth.Moreover, Dave & Buster’s focus on enriching guest experience through digital enhancements also bodes well.  The company believes that it can drive traffic by enhancing in-store and out-of-store customer experience via digital and mobile strategic initiatives as well as through better technology. In fact, the company is preparing to test technology initiatives such as pay at the table along with handheld ordering technologies that should drive the speed of service and overall guest satisfaction.However, rising labor costs, pre-opening costs of outlets given the company’s unit expansion plans and expenses incurred to execute sales initiatives might dent profits in the to-be-reported quarter. Since all the restaurants are owned and operated by Dave & Buster's, instead of signing franchise agreements and putting the burden of costs on the franchisee, the company is solely responsible for the expenses of operating the business.Subsequently, the consensus estimate for earnings for the upcoming quarter is pegged at 25 cents, reflecting a 1.3% year-over-year decline.However, as per our proven model, Dave & Buster’s is likely to beat earnings because it has the perfect combination of the two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Dave & Buster’s has an Earnings ESP of +2.70%. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Dave & Buster’s has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.Conversely, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) that are going into an earnings announcement.Dave & Buster's Entertainment, Inc.

920,DG,"Benchmarks ended mixed on Tuesday despite better than expected retail data and a de-escalation in tensions with North Korea. Weaker than expected earnings from Home Depot weighed on the Dow and pared gains for the blue-chip index. However, the Dow ended in the green following gains from American Express and Apple. The S&P 500 ended in the red overall losses in the market because of the slump in the retail sector. The Nasdaq also ended in the negative territory due to broad based losses for the markets.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 21,998.99, advancing 5.28 points or less than 0.1%. The S&P 500 Index (INX) declined 1.23 points to close at 2,464.61. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,333.01, increasing 7.22 points or 0.1%. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,799 to 946. On the Nasdaq, decliners outnumbered advancers by a 1,671 to 1,016.Retail Sales Notch Up a Seven Month HighSales at U.S. retailers recorded their biggest increase in seven months in July. Retail sales advanced 0.6% last month, the best performance since a gain of 0.9% last December, according to the Commerce Department. Retail sales jumped 4.2% in the past twelve months, which is near the five-year average. Excluding auto and gasoline, retail sales rose 0.5% in July. In fact, excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales went up 0.6% last month. June’s retails sales were also revised to show a 0.3% gain, in contrast to the previously reported 0.2% decline. May’s retail sales were revised up to show no change instead of the earlier report of a 0.1% dip.The lion’s share of the spurt in July retail sales was attributable to a pickup in demand for autos and to what is now a national event, Amazon Prime Day. The annual event, during which consumers flock to Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) for the year’s best shopping deals, contributed to gains for every product category. The Department of Commerce’s report reflects this as a 1.3% monthly increase in what is categorized as non-store retail spending. But for the sudden spurt in auto sales, other notable movements in the consumer spending report also have crucial linkages with Amazon. For instance, the decline in sales at electronics stores is likely a result of most consumers opting to buy this category of products from online alternatives, possibly Amazon.Amazon Fells the Traditional Retail SectorWhile Amazon did end the day around 0.1% lower, investor attention was largely fixed on the fall in traditional retail stocks. Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report), Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report), Kohl's Corporation KSS and Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) declined 2.6%, 1.5%, 1.5% and 3.8%, respectively. Only Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) ended the day unscathed, notching up a minor increase of 0.1%.The Dow closed higher for the third day on Tuesday. The blue-chip index notched 45 points earlier in the day. These gains were offset by weak earnings from the retail sector. The biggest drag on the Dow was falling shares of Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report). The home-improvement company cut about 30 points from the Dow. Such a turn of events makes it amply clear that the company is not immune to “Amazonification” despite its status as a leading specialty retailer. This is particularly surprising since Do-It-Yourself (DIY) and professional customers form Home Depot’s core audience. But the move to sell Kenmore devices via Amazon indicates that even the building products behemoth is now susceptible to the rising power of the Kindle and Fire Stick maker. (Read More: Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) Beats on Q2 Earnings & Sales Estimates August 15, 2017)Telecom, Consumer Discretionary Stocks Drag S&P 500 LowerThe S&P 500 declined on Tuesday as the telecom and consumer-discretionary sectors disappointed. Five of the eleven primary sectors ended in the red, led by consumer discretionary. The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY) was down 0.9%. Moreover, Advance Auto Parts Inc. (AAP  -  Free Report) reported a 16.8% decline in adjusted earnings to $1.58 per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 (ended Jul 15, 2017) from $1.90 earned in the prior-year quarter. The figure also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.65. Adjusted net income declined to $117 million from $141 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016.

921,DG,"The largest increase in retail sales in seven months failed to lift consumer sentiment substantially on Tuesday. Moreover, a selloff in traditional retail stocks followed, raising concerns over the sector’s long-term prospects. Industry watchers may hold differing views on this issue, but it is becoming increasingly difficult to profit from the country's rising purchasing power using traditional retail stocks.At the same time, it is difficult to ignore that a resilient labor market, accompanied by a slow and steady rise in wages, has made U.S. consumers increasingly confident. Traditional retail stocks may have lost their luster, but there are still several other avenues to profit from rising discretionary spending. Investing in consumer discretionary stocks from domains other than retail makes for a smart move at this point.“Amazonification” EffectThe lion’s share of the spurt in July retail sales was attributable to a pickup in demand for autos and to what is now a national event, Amazon Prime Day. The annual event, during which consumers flock to Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) for the year’s best shopping deals, contributed to gains for every product category. The Department of Commerce’s report reflects this as a 1.3% monthly increase in what is categorized as non-store retail spending. But for the sudden spurt in auto sales, other notable movements in the consumer spending report also have crucial linkages with Amazon. For instance, the decline in sales at electronics stores is likely a result of most consumers opting to buy this category of products from online alternatives, possibly Amazon.Home Depot Leads Retail SlideWhile Amazon did end the day around 0.1% lower, investor attention was largely fixed on the fall in traditional retail stocks. Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report), Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report), Kohl's Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) and Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) declined 2.6%, 1.5%, 1.5% and 3.8%, respectively. Only Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) ended the day unscathed, notching up a minor increase of 0.1%.But of particular concern was a 2.7% decline in shares of The Home Depot, Inc. (HD  -  Free Report), even after it reported stellar second-quarter results and raised its guidance for the second time for the year. Such a turn of events makes it amply clear that the company is not immune to “Amazonification” despite its status as a leading specialty retailer. This is particularly surprising since Do-It-Yourself (DIY) and professional customers form Home Depot’s core audience. But the move to sell Kenmore devices via Amazon indicates that even the building products behemoth is now susceptible to the rising power of the Kindle and Fire Stick maker.Our ChoicesConsumer’s growing tendency to switch from offline to online alternatives has been apparent even in the recent past. But this is possible the first spurt in retail trade which is being partially attributed to sales derived only from Amazon.com. Clearly, the days of retail are increasingly numbered.However, this doesn’t mean that you should ignore the higher discretionary spending power of the American consumer. Several profitable alternatives from domains other than retail continue to exist. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our VGM score comes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners.

922,DG,"Macy's, Inc. (M  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 10, before the opening bell.In the previous quarter, this department store retailer reported negative earnings surprise of 31.4%. Also, the company’s bottom line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters by an average of 12.9%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is, whether Macy's will be able to deliver positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter.Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal second quarter has declined by a penny to 44 cents in the last 30 days. This reflects a year-over-year decline of 18%. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $5,490 million, down 6.4% from the year-ago quarter.Coming to Macy's share price performance, we note that the stock plunged over 19% in the last three months, wider than its industry’s decline of 4.8%. On the contrary, the broader Retail-Wholesale sector, of which they are part of, gained 3%. Currently, the sector is placed at bottom 13% of the Zacks classified sectors (14 out of 16).Zacks Model Shows Unlikely Earnings BeatOur proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Macy's this quarter.

In addition, the company warned investors that its margins may continue to feel the pinch and expects gross margin to shrivel by 100 basis points in the second quarter.Furthermore, Macy’s dwindling top-line and bottom-line results remain the primary threat for investors. In fact, a look at the company’s performance in fiscal 2016 unveils that net sales decreased 7.4%, 3.9%, 4.2% and 4% in the first, second, third and fourth quarters, while earnings per share declined 28.6%, 15.6%, 69.6% and 3.3% during the respective quarters.Notably, during the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the scenario was no different, as net sales and earnings per share declined 7.5% and 40%, respectively.Nevertheless, Macy’s has announced slew of measures revolving around stores closures, cost containment, real estate strategy and investment in omnichannel capabilities to improve its performance. Also, in an attempt to improve sales, profitability and cash flows, the company has been taking steps such as integration of operations as well as developing eCommerce business and online order fulfillment centers.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.93% and a Zacks Rank #2.

923,DG,"J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (JCP  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 11. In the preceding quarter, the company reported earnings beat of 127.3%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether J. C. Penney will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. In the trailing four quarters, the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 50.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is currently pegged at a loss of 7 cents. In second-quarter fiscal 2016, it had reported loss per share 5 cents. We noted that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable in the past 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $2,857 million, down about 2% from the year-ago quarter.Factors Influencing this QuarterJ. C. Penney has taken up several strategic initiatives to drive traffic and is likely to impress investors with its second-quarter results. Notably in the previous month, the company stated that the sales performance has improved in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The company expects to post substantial improvement in the top line in the second quarter in comparison with the first quarter.Moreover, in an effort to lure more customers and ramp up sales performance, it has enhanced the loyalty program which was introduced for the first time in 2008. Per the new reward program, every customer will get $10 reward for every 200 points earned. The company, in order to enhance customer shopping experience, has been focusing on remodeling, renovating and refurbishing stores with special focus on enhancing high-margin center core department that houses handbags, fashion accessories, sunglasses and fashion jewelry.In a bid to better align stores with its omni channel network and utilize capital resources in locations where it has ample opportunity, J. C. Penney had earlier announced strategic initiatives, wherein it will shut down two distribution facilities as well as nearly 130–140 stores. The closure of stores, which represents nearly 13–14% of store portfolio, is likely to hurt total annual sales by less than 5%. Weaknesses in apparel sales are also affecting the company’s overall sales.J. C. Penney Company, Inc. Holding Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  J.C. Penney Company, Inc.

Penney has an Earnings ESP of +42.86%, as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at a loss of 4 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is wider at a loss of 7 cents.

924,DG,"Investors in Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Sep 1st 2017 $77.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Dollar General shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Dollar General is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in the Retail - Discount Stores industry that ranks in the Bottom 37% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, the current quarter Zacks Consensus Estimate has seen two upward versus no downward revisions. The net effect has been taken by the Zacks Consensus Estimate going to $1.09 from $1.08 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Dollar General right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

925,DG,"The discount store industry continues to enjoy a favorable spot within the Retail sector, which is evident from solid performance of its players, including Ross Stores Inc. (ROST  -  Free Report). The company is among few in the space that has been consistent with earnings performance and is also gaining momentum from store expansion and merchandising initiatives. Additionally, a robust forward outlook and strong financials anchor its fundamental strengths.Not only this, the company is benefiting from the favorable response of value-focused customers to its extensive collection of brand bargains and solid cost controls. These factors have helped the stock attain the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with a VGM Score of A. The company also possesses a long-term EPS growth rate of 10.4%.Stock Has No Looking BackRoss Stores has achieved a marked 5.6% growth in the past month, outperforming the industry’s 0.3% decline. The momentum in the stock price can largely be attributed to its solid past performances as well as growth initiatives.Strong Earnings Trend Underscores Future PotentialRoss Stores reported strong second-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein both the top and bottom lines beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved year over year. Further, earnings topped the company’s projection. Notably, it has delivered positive earnings surprise in 12 of the last 13 quarters. Moreover, the company’s average positive surprise in the trailing four quarters is pegged at 6.3%.Ross Stores, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Ross Stores, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Ross Stores, Inc. QuoteSecond-quarter results gained from solid top-line growth that was backed by broad-based growth across all merchandise categories and regions. Further, better-than-expected sales and operating profits at dd's DISCOUNTS aided results.Raised FY17 View Drives EstimatesConcluding first-half fiscal 2017 on a strong note, the company provided guidance for the second half and accordingly raised earnings view for fiscal 2017. The company now projects earnings per share for fiscal 2017 in the range of $3.16-$3.23, reflecting a 12-14% growth year over year. Earlier, the company had forecasted earnings per share in the range of $3.07-$3.17 for fiscal 2017.This led to an uptrend in the Zacks Consensus Estimates in the last 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018 rose to $3.22 per share and $3.46 per share, respectively, from $3.15 and $3.39.Splendid Growth StrategiesRoss Stores’ continued focus on enhancing merchandise through investments in workforce, processes and technology, remains a key strategy to keep itself on the growth trajectory. The company continually fine-tunes and upgrades its systems and processes to enhance productivity. Further, it is particularly committed to improving assortments in the ladies’ apparel business. We also applaud Ross Store’s ability to run the business with leaner inventory levels and faster inventory turnover. The company remains focused on cutting down inventories at stores to the optimum level as well as making the right assortments available at the right store at the right time. This is likely to help the company to continue boosting margins. All these endeavors, combined with Ross Stores’ robust store expansion program hint at superb ongoing prospects for the company.Shareholder-Friendly MovesRoss Stores’ commitment toward enhancing shareholders value is evident from its dividend payment history and share repurchase programs. In fiscal second-quarter, the company bought back 3.6 million shares for about $215 million. Further, it remains on track to repurchase $875 million worth shares in fiscal 2017 under its two-year $1.75 billion share repurchase program approved in February 2017. The company paid dividends worth nearly $124 million in first-half fiscal 2017. Other than its focus on shareholders, these moves also underscore the company’s financial flexibility.Bottom LineThough none in the sector are safe from the ongoing challenging backdrop, we believe that this California-based company is moving in the right direction and is likely to sustain its overall performance in going ahead.Looking for More?

926,DG,"In a bid to emerge as an omni-channel retailer officially, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) is set to rechristen itself. The big-box retailer is doing away with the “hyphen” and “stores” from its name and will be known as “Walmart Inc."" effective Feb 1, 2018. The latest move is a significant step for the company, which has been leaving no stone unturned to integrate physical and digital operations and counter rising competition from e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report).How will the Rechristening Benefit?Management stated that the company’s current name is used only in few legal places as it is more popular as just “Walmart”, given its seamless operations across stores, online as well as its app. Thus, this name change will bring uniformity and reveal Walmart’s unified and omni-channel existence universally. In an Amazon-dominated world, the latest move underscores Walmart’s focus on moving beyond brick-and-mortar to resonate with customers’ evolving shopping patterns. Another move in this respect was highlighted earlier this week when sources revealed that Walmart’s Brazilian unit is planning to integrate its physical and digital operations, alongside expanding its online activities. In fact, this supermarket giant has long been undertaking aggressive efforts to enrich customers’ experiences, by facilitating shopping through miscellaneous channels.This is well-evident from its growing online sales, driven by constant e-commerce initiatives — including buyouts, alliances, and improved delivery and payment systems. Evidently, Walmart’s buyouts of Bonobos, ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, ModCloth and Jet.com underscore its quest to build an impressive digital brand portfolio. The company’s Walmart Pay mobile payment system, and Mobile Express Returns program further highlight its focus on accelerating online business and making shopping easier and faster.Apart from this, Walmart is taking initiatives to expand in the booming online grocery space, which was a major contributor to e-commerce sales in the third quarter. In fact, Walmart’s efforts to enhance delivery services resonates quite well with its strategy of growing online grocery sales. In this regard, Walmart recently acquired a delivery start-up Parcel, Inc., which specializes in same-day delivery. Other than this, the company’s Walmart Pickup program enables customers to place orders online and then pick them up at a store for free. In earlier developments, Walmart partnered with ride hailing services Uber and Lyft for speedy online grocery deliveries.Backed by the aforementioned endeavors, Walmart’s U.S. e-commerce sales soared 50% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily owing to Walmart.com, which launched about 17 years back. Moreover, the reflection of Walmart’s impressive efforts is clearly visible in the company’s stellar earnings and comparable store sales record. This, in turn has helped this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock rally 43.6% this year, surpassing the industry’s  growth of 34.5%. Management plans to continue making investments in solidifying its worldwide store base and strengthening its e-commerce capacities to enhance consumers’ convenience.  We believe that these strategies are likely to bolster Walmart’s performance and drive the stock further.Looking for More Retail Stocks?

928,DG,"Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 31. In the preceding quarter, the company recorded a positive earnings surprise of 4%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is $1.09, marginally up from $1.08 reported in the year-ago period. Analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues of $5,814 million, up roughly 8% from the year-ago quarter. Well the obvious question that comes to mind, will Dollar General be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter under review. Let’s take a look at factors influencing the quarter.Factors at PlayWe believe that the company’s commitment toward better price management, cost containment, private label offering, effective inventory management, merchandise and operational initiatives should drive sales and margin trends. Moreover, in order to increase traffic, Dollar General is focusing on both consumables and discretionary items. Additionally, the company is expanding its cooler facilities to enhance the sale of perishable items, and is also rolling out DG digital coupon program.Of late, Dollar General has been bearing the brunt of price deflation and the reduction in SNAP benefits that may weigh on comparable-store sales performance. The current administration is suggesting on reducing food stamps program. Cut in SNAP benefit may hurt Dollar General performance as people with low income will have less money to spend and could restrict their spending to low margin products.Dollar General Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Dollar General Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Dollar General Corporation QuoteWhat the Zacks Model Unveils?Well our proven model does not conclusively show that Dollar General is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

929,DG,"Foot Locker, Inc. (FL  -  Free Report) reported lower-than-expected financial numbers for the second straight quarter, when the company posted second-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings. The New York-based retailer delivered quarterly earnings of 62 cents per share that fell substantially short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 90 cents and also declined 34% year over year. The company’s results in the quarter were impacted by soft performance of “some recent top styles”, which also lagged the company’s projections.Following, the results share of this operator of athletic shoes and apparel retailer are down nearly 17% during the pre-market trading session. In fact in the past three months, the stock has tanked 18.8% compared with the industry’s decline of 11.2%.Total sales of $1,701 million were down 4.4% year over year and also came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,813 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, total sales decreased 4.3%. Comparable-store sales (comps) fell 6% during the quarter.

Further, it believes industry dynamics will continue in 2017, as a result of this it expects comparable sales decline in the range of 3-4% in remaining part of 2017.Nevertheless, we believe by continually capitalizing on opportunities like children’s business, shop-in-shop expansion in collaboration with its vendors, store banner.com business, store refurbishment and enhancement of assortments, Foot Locker is likely to benefit in the long run. International expansion, especially in Europe, is another growth catalyst. Further, the company is enhancing eCommerce platform.Gross margin contracted 340 basis points to 29.6% of sales.

This can primarily be attributed to rise in traffic and increased average basket size.Cost of sales increased 7.5% to $2,420.9 million driven by 35 basis points (bps) improvement in merchandise margins, 20 bps decline in occupancy costs and 10 bps fall in distribution expenses. However, these improvements were marred by higher freight and buying costs. Further, the quarter exhibited a 25 bps decline in selling, general and administrative expenses owing to benefit from legal costs.Operating margin expanded 50 bps to 14.9%, which was better than the company’s expectation of 13.9-14.1%. This outperformance stemmed from improved merchandise margins higher-than-planned sales.Store UpdateThe company’s expansion plan is on track with the inclusion of seven new dd's DISCOUNTS stores and 21 Ross Stores in the fiscal second quarter.Ross Stores plans to open 40 new stores in the fiscal third quarter, including 10 dd's DISCOUNTS and 30 Ross outlets.

931,DG,"Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 1. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this food processing behemoth will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The company delivered a negative earnings surprise in the last reported quarter and has underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the past four trailing quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Price and EPS Surprise   Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Price and EPS Surprise | Archer-Daniels-Midland Company QuoteWhat to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 54 cents, reflecting year-over-year increase of about 32%. However, we note that our earnings estimate has declined by 4 cents over the last seven days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $15.8 billion, up a little over 1% from the year-ago quarter.Archer Daniels forms part of the Consumer Staples sector. Per the latest Earnings Trends, the sector’s earnings are expected to rise 3.1%, while revenues are expected to climb 1.2%.Factors at PlayArcher Daniels has tumbled 9.3% so far this year, as against the sector’s growth of 10%. Well, this could be largely accountable to the company’s dismal sales surprise history. Evidently, Archer Daniels has been missing sales estimates for over three years now. In fact, the company's bottom line has not been impressive too, as the last reported quarter marked its second straight earnings miss. The murky performance can be mainly attributed to fluctuating commodity prices, oversupply in the industry and unfavorable margins.Further, management expects the global landscape in the second half of 2017 to be competitive for the Agricultural Services segment. Also, results at the Oilseeds segment are anticipated to be in a range of flat to down year over year. The company expects soybean crush margins to remain pressurized on account of excess supply and competition. While export volumes in Brazil are expected to improve, margins are likely to be dented by sluggish commercialization. On the other hand, results at the Corn Processing and Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients segments are expected to show better results in the second quarter, as compared with the last year. However, the aforementioned obstacles make us anxious about Archer Daniels’ upcoming results.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Archer Daniels is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Archer Daniels has an Earnings ESP of -1.85% as the Most Accurate estimate of 53 cents is below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 54 cents. Further, the company currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. The combination of Archer Daniels’ dismal Zacks Rank and negative Earnings ESP makes us apprehensive about the stock.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.94% and a Zacks Rank #2.

932,DG,"Leggett & Platt, Incorporated (LEG  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this engineered products manufacturer will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The company delivered a positive earnings surprise in the last reported quarter and has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 2.3% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement. Leggett & Platt, Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise   Leggett & Platt, Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Leggett & Platt, Incorporated QuoteWhat to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 65 cents, reflecting year-over-year dip of 1.5%. We note that our earnings estimate has remained stable over the last 30 days. Notably, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of roughly $1 billion, up over 4% from the year-ago quarter.Leggett forms part of the Consumer Discretionary sector. Per the latest Earnings Trends, the Consumer Discretionary sector’s earnings are expected to fall 1.5%, while revenues are expected to grow 7.8%.Factors at PlayBeing in the third phase of its long-term strategic plan, Leggett is working toward achieving top-line growth of 4–5% annually. In 2017, management expects strength in Automotive, Bedding, Adjustable Bed, Work Furniture, and Geo Components businesses to boost volume growth, which remains a driving factor for sales. Further, management expects sales growth to fuel earnings in 2017, which makes us hopeful of the quarter to be reported.With steel being one of the company’s key raw materials, Leggett remains exposed to volatility in raw material prices. Evidently, Leggett’s bottom line was hurt by steel price inflation in the first quarter. Also, its performance was impacted by fluctuating steel prices throughout 2016. We believe that persistence of inflationary pressure remains a threat to Leggett’s earnings in 2017.While shares of Leggett have gained 7.7% so far this year, it has underperformed its industry’s 12.1% growth. All said, let’s wait and see if Leggett can put up a good show this quarter.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Leggettis likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

933,DG,"Its time again for the second-quarter reporting cycle to gain momentum. In fact, now that we are done with the earnings results from the early reporters and the late comers from the previous quarter, we will witness second-quarter earnings acquiring full impetus. So, let’s brace ourselves for the next round of earnings.Among all the sectors, our focus in the discussion here will be the Retail-Wholesale sector.  A close look at the sector reveals that retailers continue to bear the brunt of the current challenging retail environment due to sluggish mall traffic, volatile consumer spending and increased competition from online players. We believe the impact of the slowdown in traffic trends will clearly be reflected in the diminished sales and comparable store sales (comps) numbers in second-quarter 2017.Further, these retailers are heavily investing in eCommerce and omni-channel functionalities, which are likely to weigh on margins at least in the near term.The data released by the Commerce Department on Jul 14 revealed that retail sales declined for the second month in a row. U.S. retail and food services sales for Jun 2017 declined 0.2% sequentially, compared with a 0.1% decline in May. The decline can be attributed to soft sales at gasoline stations, clothing retailers and department stores. Further, consumers continued to spend lower at restaurants as well as on hobbies.Additionally, the data revealed that retail trade sales for June dipped 0.1% from May but increased about 3% from last year. While non-store retailers registered growth of 9.2% from last year, sales for the Sporting Goods, Hobby, Book, & Music Stores declined 8.9% year over year.However, U.S. retail and food services sales improved 2.8% form Jun 2016. Moreover, total sales for second-quarter 2017 (Apr 2017 through Jun 2017) reflected a 3.8% growth from the prior-year period. The overall increase in the estimate for the second quarter could be attributed to the growing online sales, which now forms a part of core sales of most retailers.Q2 Earnings ScorecardLooking at the earnings scorecard of the overall S&P 500 Index so far, 30 S&P 500 members that together represent 9.3% of the Index’s total market capitalization have released second-quarter earnings results. Total earnings for these companies were up 13.8%, on 6% revenue growth. Further, about 83.3% delivered both positive earnings and revenue surprises.While this represents only a small sample, we can ascertain that the second-quarter earnings season is surely off to a good start. More clarity on the results will be evident from the S&P members reporting earnings in the next few weeks. A look at the earnings calendar shows that we are only few days away from the reporting cycle fully taking off.Coming to expectations, total earnings for the quarter are expected to increase 6.6% year over year, with a 4.5% jump in revenues. For the retail sector, in particular, earnings in the second quarter are expected to inch up 0.1%, with 3.7% revenue growth.The real picture of the trend so far is visible from our latest Earnings Preview report published on Jul 15.That said, we bring to you five retail stocks that may show promise based on their favorable Zacks Rank – Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – and a positive Earnings ESP.

934,DG,"Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) has long been a favorite in the investor community, thanks to its spectacular past performance. This in turn has been driven by its various strategic initiatives, including aggressive efforts to counter Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) growing online dominance. The reflection of these factors and investors’ confidence in Walmart’s ongoing prospects is visible in the company’s marvelous bull run.Well, this big-box retailer has rallied 44.4% year to date, crushing the industry’s 33.7% upside. So, let’s delve deeper into the factors that have spurred investors’ sentiments about this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, which is most likely to keep its robust show on. Sturdy Surprise History Walmart has been riding on its solid surprise history, which was retained in third-quarter fiscal 2018 that marked Walmart’s ninth and 13th straight quarter of positive earnings surprise and U.S. comps growth, respectively. Also, both top and bottom lines advanced year over year, courtesy of constant expansion efforts and splendid e-commerce performance. Incidentally, U.S. comps (excluding fuel) rose 2.7%, backed by improved comp traffic. Moreover, e-commerce sales positively impacted comp sales at Walmart U.S. by 80 bps. Also, management stated that its food categories performed exceptionally well and recorded the highest comps in about six years.Outlook Boosts EstimatesManagement remains encouraged about its ongoing performance, as reflected in its raised earnings guidance for fiscal 2018 and favorable comps view for the fourth quarter. The company now envisions adjusted earnings in the range of $4.38-$4.46 per share, as compared with the prior expectation of $4.30-$4.40. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, Walmart expects both U.S. comps (excluding fuel) and Sam’s Club comps (excluding fuel) to increase in a range of 1.5-2.0%Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Price and Consensus  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Price and Consensus | Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Quote Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2018 has risen from $1.33 to $1.36 and from $4.37 to $4.43, respectively over the past 30 days. Apart from boosting analysts’ sentiment, management’s outlook also appeased investors, as evident from the 8.9% jump in Walmart’s shares since the announcement.E-Commerce: Walmart’s Biggest Driving FactorWalmart is trying every means to evolve with the changing consumer environment to compete with brick-and-mortar rivals and e-commerce king Amazon. In this regard, the company has been taking several e-commerce initiatives, including buyouts, alliances, and improved delivery and payment systems. Evidently, Walmart’s buyouts of Bonobos, ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, ModCloth and Jet.com underscore its quest to build an impressive digital brand portfolio. The company’s Walmart Pay mobile payment system, and Mobile Express Returns program further highlight its focus on accelerating online business and making shopping easier. Apart from this, Walmart is taking strong efforts to expand in the booming online grocery space, which was a major contributor to its e-commerce sales in the third quarter. In fact, Walmart’s focus on enhancing its delivery services also resonates well with its strategy of growing its online grocery sales.International Business Bodes WellWalmart’s international business performed quite well in the third quarter, wherein results were driven by broad-based growth, with 10 out of 11 markets recording positive comps. Notably, Mexico and China performed exceptionally well, while results in UK also improved in the quarter. Walmart’s international sales were mainly fueled by strength in food and staples categories. Also, the company’s constant e-commerce initiatives (like partnership with JD.com) and efforts to enhance logistics efficiencies drove results. The company remains committed toward achieving growth across all its markets, on the back of its fresh products; expansion of online grocery and private brands.Shareholder-Friendly Moves Walmart maintains a disciplined capital allocation strategy and remains focused on using excess cash to enhance shareholder returns through dividend payouts and share buybacks. During third-quarter fiscal 2018, Walmart paid $1.5 billion in dividends and repurchased about 27 million shares worth $2.2 billion under its $20-billion authorization (announced in October 2015). Further, management stated that from Nov 20, it will make buybacks under its October 2017 authorization of $20 billion.We believe that the aforementioned factors set the stage for a sturdy ongoing performance, thus making Walmart a solid investment option.Looking for More?

935,DG,"Kohl’s Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) is set to report the second quarter of fiscal 2017 results on Aug 10 before the market opens. The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether the departmental store will be able to maintain its positive earnings surprise streak in the to-be-reported quarter. We note that the company has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 21.3%. In fact, earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in eight out of past 10 quarters.Kohl’s forms part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. Per the latest Earnings Trends, we note that the above mentioned sector’s earnings growth looks disappointing. Out of the 41.5% S&P 500 companies that have reported in the sector as of Aug 4, we see that total earnings of these companies have declined 2.3% on a year-over-year basis (64.7% of the companies beat EPS estimates) while total revenue increased 8.0% (70.6% beat top-line expectations).Let’s delve deeper how things are shaping up for this announcement.Which Way are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at earnings estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before the earnings release. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review has increased 1.7% over the last seven days and is currently pegged at $1.17 per share, down 4.4% from $1.22 per share delivered in the year-ago quarter. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $4.1 billion, down 1.7% from the prior-year period.Kohl's Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Kohl's Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Kohl's Corporation QuoteWhat the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Kohl’s is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Kohl’s has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.17 per share. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, its ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Factors Influencing the QuarterKohl’s has been struggling with weak comps and a difficult retail sales scenario for the last few quarters. The company’s strategic initiative, ‘Greatness Agenda’, which was designed to increase transactions per store and sales, is also failing to deliver positive results. Though the plan, which commenced in the first quarter of 2014, has helped the company to deliver positive comps in all the four quarters of fiscal 2015, the quarterly growth rates moderated gradually but then started declining since the first quarter of fiscal 2016, posing a concern. We note that comps plummeted consecutively in the last five quarters. The company is also witnessing lower spending on apparel and accessories, dwindling store traffic, margin pressure and competition from discount retailers, which are hurting sales at department stores.Nevertheless, Kohl’s has been making continuous efforts to improve its base business. Lately, the company has started offering more outside famous brands and cutting down on the number of in-house clothing brands it sells. The addition of Under Armour workout tights, sneakers and other gear in March was a great success and was very well-accepted among customers. It also helped to boost sales of the entire active apparel department in the first quarter despite decline in women's, children's and accessories units. Kohl's plans to start selling Clarks shoes for the back-to-school shopping season and is looking for other brands to add to store aisles. The company also plans to continue selling the best-selling of its private-label brands, such as Sonoma, Croft & Barrow and Apt. 9, in order to drive traffic.Kohl’s has also undertaken several initiatives to reduce its inventory to boost profits. During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the company made additional progress on its initiatives and as a result, inventory per store decreased 1%, while units per store were 5% lower. Lower inventory levels thus boost its earnings. The company continues to expect inventory to be down low to mid-single digits for the fiscal year 2017.We believe these efforts are well reflected in the share prices of the company. Notably, in the last three months, the stock has moved up 7.3% in comparison to the industry and the broader sector. While the industry declined 4.7% in the last three months, the sector increased 3.0% in the said time frame.Stocks with Favorable CombinationStocks in the broader retail sector carrying both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank, and therefore worth considering include:Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.93% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.

The company has a spectacular positive earnings surprise record of over four years now. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement. Home Depot, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise   Home Depot, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Home Depot, Inc. (The) QuoteWhat to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at $2.21, reflecting year-over-year growth of over 12%. We noted that our earnings estimate has remained stable over the last 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $27.8 billion, up about 4.9% from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayHome Depot’s splendid past performance reflects its focus on solid strategic initiatives. The company remains keen on building its interconnected capabilities, in response to the evolving retail environment – where digital and physical stores go hand in hand. In this direction, the company has made great strides in the past, by redesigning its website with enhanced features. Further, Home Depot’s interconnected strategy goes beyond the dot.com as it continues to invest in fulfillment options to meet customers demand through launches like customer order management system (COM) and the Buy Online Deliver From Store (BODFS) capability. Well, Home Depot continues to reap benefits from these initiatives, as evident from online sales growth of nearly 23% in first-quarter fiscal 2017. Also, we believe that these efforts are likely to drive the company’s top and bottom lines in future. Apart from this, Home Depot is also gaining from housing market recovery and favorable customer demand.All these factors, which had encouraged management to raise its earnings view for fiscal 2017, also usher in confidence about the company’s upcoming release. However, intense competition remains a threat. Also, significant exposure to international markets makes Home Depot vulnerable to currency headwinds. Nonetheless, we note that shares of Home Depot have gained about 2.5% over the last six trading sessions, which clearly underscores investors’ positive sentiment in the company. Moreover, Home Depot’s shares have jumped 14.3% so far this year outperforming the industry’s 11.3% growth. Well, it looks like Home Depot is most likely to maintain its robust trend this time too.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Home Depot is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

937,DG,"The retail industry has gone through an immense amount of change over the last few years, as many publicly traded brick-and-mortar stores now fight to stay in business through the online shopping revolution Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) helped start.In 2017, more than 8,600 stores are expected to close their doors, according to Credit Suisse analysts. This number tops the number of brick-and-mortar locations that closed during the 2008 recession.In these turbulent times for the retail industry, many investors have stayed away. But the potential for a GOP tax code overall, which would cut the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, could help the industry immensely.A recent National Retail Federation post titled “Why Passing Tax Reform Is Good For Retail,” highlighted why a Republican tax bill could greatly benefit the retail industry. The post noted that both the Senate and House bills benefit retailers for three major reasons: “They address retail’s high, unequal tax burden; They enable reinvestment; They provide tax relief to consumers.”Still, if the GOP bill isn’t passed, one retail sector—the discount segment—is already experiencing a boom in a more traditional brick-and-mortar manner. Discount retailers have capitalized on their core customers and started to expand their footprints.With all of this said, let’s take a look at three discount retail stocks that investors might consider right now.1.       Ross Stores, Inc. (ROST  -  Free Report)Shares of the discount retailer with the tagline “Dress for Less” jumped 31.62% in the last 12-weeks and rest near their 52-week high. Ross Stores is also currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports an overall “B” VGM grade.In November, Ross reported Q3 net earnings of  $274 million, up from $245 million in the year-ago period. On top of that, the off-priced clothing retailer’s third-quarter sales climbed 8%.For the current quarter, based on our Zacks Consensus Estimates, Ross’ revenues are projected to surge 12.56% to hit $3.95 billion. The company’s earnings are expected to climb 19.48%.What’s more, within the last 60 days, Ross has received 11 positive full-year earnings estimate revisions against zero downgrades. The discount retail power has also beat or matched earnings estimates for 14 straight quarters.2.       Dollar Tree, Inc (DLTR  -  Free Report) This retail chain is one of the only true “dollar stores,” where everything is sold for a dollar or less. Dollar Tree is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). With the integration of Family Dollar, Dollar Tree has opened more stores and focused on strategic initiatives, which led to the company raising its full-year expectations after posting solid Q3 earnings.Shares of Dollar Tree have climbed nearly 38% in 2017, which almost quadruples the “Retail - Discount Stores” industry average and has helped push the company’s stock price to a new all-time high.Dollar Tree is currently trading at 22.12x earnings, matching its industry’s average. The stock also sports a solid 1.17 P/S ratio. What’s more, our Zacks Consensus Estimates currently call for Dollar Tree’s Q4 earnings to climb 33.29% and its sales to pop 13.47%.3.       Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report)Dollar General is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and rocks an overall “A” VGM grade. This discount retailer is continuously expanding, and 2016 marked the 27th consecutive year of sales growth at established stores.Shares of Dollar General have gained 22.55% this year, which tops the S&P 500 average by more than 5%. The discount giant is currently trading at 20.16x earnings, which marks a discount compared to its industry’s average.Based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates, Dollar General’s Q3 EPS are expected to hit $0.94, which would mark a 5.24% year-over-year jump. Along with this bottom line growth, Dollar General sales are projected to hit $5.80 billion, which would mark a 9.07% year-over-year improvement.Dollar General is expected to post its third-quart results on Thursday, Dec. 7.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

938,DG,"Fomento Economico Mexicano, S.A.B. de C.V. (FMX  -  Free Report), or FEMSA is slated to release second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 25. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this major beverage company will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The company witnessed a negative earnings surprise of roughly 21% in the last reported quarter, and has been missing our estimates for three straight quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement. Fomento Economico Mexicano S.A.B. de C.V. Price and EPS Surprise   Fomento Economico Mexicano S.A.B. de C.V. Price and EPS Surprise | Fomento Economico Mexicano S.A.B. de C.V. QuoteWhat to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 83 cents, reflecting year-over-year improvement of over 12%. Also, we note that our earnings estimate has trended upward in the last 30 days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $6.4 billion, representing growth of more than 22% from the year-ago quarter.FEMSA forms part of the Consumer Staples sector. As of Jul 15 Earnings Trends, the Consumer Staples sector’s earnings are expected to rise 4%, with 1.5% revenues growth.Factors at PlayFEMSA’s dismal earnings surprise history reflects that the company continues to struggle with adverse currency fluctuations, which have been weighing on Coca-Cola FEMSA's results for a while now. Additionally, it has been witnessing pressurized margins owing to growth and incorporation of lower-margin businesses in FEMSA Comercio’s Health and Fuel divisions.While these factors pose concern about the company’s upcoming performance, we remain impressed with FEMSA’s focus on strategic measures such as increasing store count, diversifying business portfolio and focusing on core business activities. FEMSA’S concentration on portfolio diversification is well-evident from its series of acquisitions. Additionally, the company is well positioned to gain from its venture in the drugstore business, which displays significant potential.Notably, FEMSA’s shares have gained 6.5% in the last seven days. This impressive momentum ahead of earnings clearly reflects investors’ positive sentiments about the upcoming release. Also, this has helped this Mexican company to surge 35.4% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming the Zacks categorized Beverages – Soft Drinks industry’s growth of 12.8%. So, let’s see if FEMSA’s quarterly performance can help it break the murky surprise trend, and help it sustain the robust momentum.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that FEMSA is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.FEMSA currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company has an Earnings ESP of -8.43% as the Most Accurate estimate of 76 cents is pegged below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 83 cents. The combination of FEMSA’s Zacks Rank #2 and a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.94% and a Zacks Rank #2.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Amazon.com, Inc.

939,DG,"Off-price retailer of apparel and home accessories, Ross Stores Inc. (ROST  -  Free Report) is leaving no loose ends in its efforts to retain investor faith. The company has time and again showcased its ability to deliver on targets. That said, Ross Stores has completed its target of inaugurating 28 new stores in second-quarter fiscal 2017, with the opening of 21 Ross Dress for Less (“Ross”) and seven dd’s DISCOUNTS outlets.These store openings that happened in June and so far in July marked the company’s expansion in 15 different states, including both new and existing markets. In this set of store openings, the company opened Ross outlets in the newest Midwest market, while also expanding presence in the existing California, Texas and Florida markets. Further, the company opened its 200th dd’s DISCOUNTS store in June and also expanded in the newest Pennsylvania market.Notably, these store openings represent a significant progress on its plans to open 90 stores in fiscal 2017, including 70 Ross and 20 dd’s DISCOUNTS outlets. As a first step toward achieving this goal, the company had opened 28 new stores in first-quarter fiscal 2017, including 23 Ross Dress for Less and five dd’s DISCOUNTS stores. With the recent store openings, the company has achieved more than 60% of store expansion plans for the current fiscal.Including the aforementioned store openings, Ross Stores operated 1,384 Ross Dress for Less stores across 37 states, the District of Columbia and Guam as well as 205 dd’s DISCOUNTS outlets across 16 states as of Jul 17, 2017.Going forward, the company remains optimistic about expansion plans and views immense opportunity to grow in new as well as existing markets. Consequently, the company reiterated long-term goal of expanding store count to 2,500, comprising 2,000 Ross and 500 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores.We remain confident of the company’s growth potential and its ability to successfully attain long-term store growth target. Additionally, we believe the company is underpenetrated in the 37 states it serves and holds promise to substantially expand store base in these markets.Ross Stores has outperformed the Zacks categorized Retail – Discount Stores industry in the past one year. Though this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has dropped 7.5%, the decline is narrower than the industry’s fall of 15.1%.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the Discount Stores space are Burlington Stores Inc. (BURL  -  Free Report), Target Corp. (TGT  -  Free Report) and Dollar General Corp. (DG  -  Free Report). All the three stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Burlington Stores’ long-term EPS growth rate of 15.9% and a share price growth of 7.1% in the last six months help it to stand strong in the industry.

Moreover, the stock has seen positive estimate revisions in the last seven days and has to its credit an average positive surprise of 16.5% in the trailing four quarters.Dollar General, with long-term EPS growth rate of 10.6%, has grown 4.1% in the last three months.5 Trades Could Profit """"Big-League"""" from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.

940,DG,"V.F. Corporation (VFC  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 24. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this designer, manufacturer and marketer of branded apparel and related products will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The company posted in-line earnings in the last two quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement. V.F. Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   V.F. Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | V.F. Corporation QuoteWhat to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 28 cents, reflecting year-over-year decline of over 20%. We noted that our earnings estimate has remained stable over the last 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $2.3 billion, down about 6.4% from the year-ago quarter.V.F. Corp. forms part of the Retail – Wholesale sector. Per the latest Earnings Trends as of Jul 15, the Retail – Wholesale sector’s earnings are expected to inch up 0.1%, with 3.8% revenues growth.Factors at PlayV.F. Corp.’s shares have gained 10.1% in the last six months, outperforming the Zacks categorized Textile – Apparel industry’s decline of 2.2%. This could be largely attributable to its five-year strategic growth plan (2021 growth strategy) that was announced this March. The plan focuses on rapidly responding to the changing marketplace as well as targeting shareholder returns. Further, the company’s four-point strategy focuses on redesigning portfolio and empowering its key brands, adopting a consumer and retail-centric model, enriching direct-to-consumer and digital businesses, and directing investment to Asia, particularly China. Well, these plans underscore the company’s growth prospects. In fact, we believe that the company is progressing well on these lines, as revenues in the first quarter mainly gained strength from international and direct-to-customer platforms, along with the Outdoor & Action Sports coalition.However, both earnings and sales declined year over year, as a challenging retail environment and currency headwinds played foul. Currency has long been a hurdle for the company’s top line which has suffered four consecutive quarters of year-over-year decline. Also, adverse currency fluctuations are expected to persist and hurt results. Evidently, management expects foreign currency woes to hurt 2017 revenues by about two percentage points. Also, the gross and operating margins are likely to bear respective 70 and 60 bps negative impacts from currency, in 2017. Finally, the company expects earnings per share to decline at a low-single digit percentage rate on a year-over-year basis, whereas the same is likely to rise in the mid-single digit rate on a currency neutral basis.Considering the pros and cons, we prefer to wait and see if V.F. Corp.’s growth strategies can help it sail through these headwinds this earnings season.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that V.F. Corp. is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

941,DG,"Michael Kors Holdings Limited (KORS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Aug 8. In the last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.3%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?Michael Kors has a remarkable history, at least in terms of the bottom line. The company continued with its positive earnings surprise streak for the seventh straight quarter, as it reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results. In the trailing four quarters, the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 8.1%. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is 62 cents, reflecting a year-over-year decline of over 29%. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $918 million, down over 4% from the year-ago quarter.Well the obvious question that comes to mind, will Michael Kors be able to sustain its positive earnings surprise streak in the fourth quarter. Well past trends do indicate toward that direction but it will not be wise to jump to a conclusion without analyzing the factors at play.Factors at PlayWe remained concerned about Michael Kors’ wholesale segment performance, which has witnessed a sharp decline in the previous few quarters. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, wholesale segment sales declined 22.8% to $456.1 million primarily due to dismal performance of Americas and European regions, while on a constant currency basis, it fell 22.3%. In the third, second and first quarters of fiscal 2017, wholesale segment sales declined 17.8%, 18.4% and 7%, respectively. In fiscal 2018, the company expects wholesale segment to decrease in the low-teens range.Stiff competition, waning comps, aggressive promotional environment and sluggish mall traffic are making things tough for Michael Kors. We noted that comparable sales had fallen 14.1% in the final quarter of fiscal 2017, following declines of 6.9%, 5.4% and 7.4% in the third, second and first quarters, respectively. The company is also struggling with its top-line performance. After registering a meager growth of 0.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, it had declined 3.7%, 3.2% and 11.2% in the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017.For the first quarter, Michael Kors forecasts total revenue between $910 million and $930 million, and expects comparable sales to decline in the high-single digit range. Operating margin is anticipated to be approximately 13%. Management projects earnings in the range of 60–64 cents per share for the first quarter.However, the company has been constantly deploying resources to expand product offerings, open new stores, and build shop-in-shops along with upgrading information system and distribution infrastructure. Management intends to upgrade eCommerce platform and expects the channel to be a significant contributor in the long run. We note that despite the possibility of heavy investments weighing upon the margins in the short term, management continues to take up strategic endeavors.Michael Kors Holdings Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Michael Kors Holdings Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Michael Kors Holdings Limited QuoteWhat the Zacks Model Unveils? Well our proven model does not conclusively show that Michael Kors is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

942,DG,"Companhia Brasileira de Distribuicao (CBD  -  Free Report) has seen its shares rally 50.4% over a year, in comparison with the industry’s surge of 32.4%. While the company has been gaining from continued market share gains at its Assai and Multivarejo segments, we believe that Assai remains its major growth driver. So, let’s delve deeper into these factors and see if they can continue to drive Companhia Brasileira amid a tough Brazilian environment. Assai: A Major Growth DriverCompanhia Brasileira’s Assai segment, which has long been the company’s major growth driver, remained the highlight of its third-quarter 2017 performance as well. Notably this quarter marked Assai’s strongest quarter of combined volume and traffic growth in the recent times. In the third quarter, sales at this segment surged 25.2%, adjusted for the calendar effect. The sturdy growth was driven by higher comps and contributions from new stores.Despite major food deflation in some key categories, Assai’s comps grew 7.7%, on the back of improved customer traffic and sales volume. Further, Assai contributed about 43% to the company’s total food sales, marking 600 bps growth from the year-ago period. Also, the segment witnessed market share gains of 330 bps year over year. Notably, management remains committed toward converting Extra Hiper stores into Assai stores, to optimize its portfolio. This clearly reflects robust prospects from this segment.  Apart from Assai, the company has also been gaining from improved volumes of Pao de Acucar and consistent recovery at Extra Hiper, which have been driving its Multivarejo segment. Evidently, the company’s third-quarter sales jumped 8.1% (adjusted for calendar effect), with comps rising at both segments. Also, adjusted EBITDA jumped 11.4%, with the EBITDA margin expanding 20 bps to 5%, fueled by improvements at both Multivarejo and Assai. For 2017 too, management envisions Food segment EBITDA margin of approximately 5.5%, backed by greater profitability at both divisions.Further, the company remains focused on enhancing its food business, by making investments in Assai and Pao de Acucar, which are yielding solid returns. All said, the company anticipates continued market share gains at both its segments.While macroeconomic headwinds in the Brazilian retail space and stiff competition in the appliances business may act as deterrents, we believe that strength in Assai is likely to help this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock sustain its momentum.Looking for More Promising Stocks?

943,DG,"lululemon athletica inc. (LULU  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Dec 6. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this yoga-inspired athletic apparel retailer will be able to deliver positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter.In the trailing four quarters, the company has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 8.5%. Also, it has pulled off positive earnings surprise of 11.4% in the previous quarter. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 52 cents, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 10.3%. However, the estimate has been stable in the last 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $611.4 million, up about 12.3% from the year-ago quarter.So far this year, lululemon’s share price has increased 3.6% compared with the Consumer Discretionary sector’s growth of 13.5%.Factors Influencing the Quarterlululemon is not immune to the challenges in the retail sector, which include stiff competition and volatile consumer spending patterns. In fact, the rise in competition has been a threat to the company’s margins lately. Management had earlier projected fiscal third-quarter gross margin to remain in line with the year-ago period level. While gross margin improved in second-quarter fiscal 2017, it was somewhat negated by higher markdowns stemming from the online warehouse sale.Further, the company anticipates SG&A expense to deleverage about 50 basis points in the fiscal third quarter, mainly related to the ongoing endeavors being undertaken to expand e-commerce business. However, third-quarter revenues are forecasted in the range of $605-$615 million, with constant dollar comps expected to improve in mid-single digits. Also, lululemon envisions normalized earnings (excluding the impact from iviva’s restructuring) for the quarter to lie in a band of 50-52 cents per share.We note that lululemon is well on track with its strategy for 2020. Through this plan the company aims to double its revenues to about $4 billion and more than double its earnings. Therefore, management had outlined four distinct growth strategies including product innovation, building store fleet in North America, expanding digital business and international expansion. Meanwhile, lululemon’s e-commerce growth initiatives and ivivva remodeling seem to bode well.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not show that lululemon is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

945,DG,"We expect American Eagle Outfitters Inc. (AEO  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Dec 6. In the last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 18.8%.In fact, this apparel retail chain surpassed estimates in the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 3.9%.American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. QuoteWhat to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether American Eagle will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 39 cents per share, reflecting a decline of 5.9% from the year-ago quarter. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter has been stable in the last 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues of $964.8 million, up 2.6% from the year-ago quarter.Moreover, we note that the stock has outperformed the industry in the last three months. The company’s shares have increased 21.4%, while the industry grew 16%.Factors at PlayAmerican Eagle’s upsurge in recent months can be attributed to its much deserved triumph in second-quarter fiscal 2017. While the fiscal second-quarter marked the company's second straight quarter of sales beat, earnings topped estimates after a miss in the last quarter. The company also posted 10th straight quarter of positive comps on the back of strong online sales at both brands driven by efficient use of omni-channel capabilities to enhance customer experience.Further, the company is striving to develop omni-channel platform to reach customers in every possible way. Backed by these efforts and efficient digital marketing endeavors, American Eagle’s e-commerce sales contributed about 23% to total revenues in second-quarter fiscal 2017. Further, its new loyalty program, AEO Connect is likely to enhance customer experience.We commend American Eagle's focus on expansion, as evident from its plans to enter the Indian market. Moreover, the company remains committed toward enhancing store sales by rationalizing its brick-and-mortar store fleet that includes closing underperforming stores and expanding the profitable ones.Looking ahead, it remains optimistic about the second half of fiscal 2017, especially the fall season. American Eagle anticipates comps for the fiscal third quarter to range from flat to low-single digit increase.However, the company’s margins continue to be under pressure due to increased promotional activities to counter sluggish mall traffic, which is likely to persist in the quarter ahead. For the fiscal third quarter, the company projects soft merchandise margins due to intense promotional activities. Moreover, it anticipates SG&A expenses to increase in low-single digits.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that American Eagle is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

946,DG,"Ralph Lauren Corporation (RL  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Aug 8. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this designer, marketer and distributor of premium lifestyle products will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The company has delivered positive earnings surprises consistently in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 14.2%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement. Ralph Lauren Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Ralph Lauren Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Ralph Lauren Corporation QuoteWhat to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 97 cents, reflecting year-over-year decline of 8.5%. Further, we noted that our earnings estimate has dipped by a notch over the last 30 days. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.4 billion, down about 13.1% from the year-ago quarter.Ralph Laurenforms part of the Consumer Discretionarysector. Per the latest Earnings Trends, the Consumer Discretionary sector’s earnings are expected to climb 2.3% year over year while revenues are projected to grow 8.1%.Factors at PlayDespite a solid earnings surprise history, Ralph Lauren’s shares have lost 15.8% year to date, underperforming the industry’s 0.5% growth. The company continues to battle foreign currency headwinds, which is expected to hurt margins and sales in the first quarter and fiscal 2018. Moreover, Ralph Lauren is reeling under soft traffic trends, which weighed upon its top line in the last reported quarter and remains a deterrent for the upcoming quarter as well. All these factors have caused management to issue a drab sales view for the first quarter and fiscal 2018, when it reported its last quarterly outcome.Evidently, the company expects fiscal first-quarter reported revenues to be down low-double digits, excluding currency impact. Operating margin for the fiscal first quarter is expected to be 9.5–10%. The company expects currency headwinds to reduce revenues growth by nearly 225 bps and operating margin rate by about 75 bps. For fiscal 2018, the company expects revenue to decline 8–9%, excluding currency. Operating margin is estimated to be 9–10.5% on a currency-neutral basis. Foreign currency is anticipated to pull down revenues by 150 bps and operating margins by 50–75 bps in fiscal 2018.Moreover, the company announced plans to adopt the Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2016-09 for the accounting of employee share-based payments (in fiscal 2018), which was recently issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). This is likely to impact effective tax rate, with the first and the second quarter bearing the maximum brunt. Consequently, effective tax rate for fiscal first-quarter is anticipated to be 33%. All these factors make us apprehensive about Ralph Lauren’s upcoming results.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Ralph Laurenis likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

Further, the company currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. The combination of Ralph Lauren’s unfavorable Zacks Rank and a negative Earnings ESP indicates that the stock is unlikely to beat estimates.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.93% and a Zacks Rank #2.

947,DG,"Jack in the Box Inc. (JACK  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 29, after market close.The company’s business initiatives including refranchising its company-owned restaurants and constant menu innovation have helped it gain traction in the highly competitive hamburger segment of the quick-serve restaurants industry. However, a challenging restaurant space in the United States has been hurting revenues.Last quarter, this leading hamburger chain missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings by 5.71%. However, its earnings surpassed estimates in two of the trailing four quarters, with average earnings beat of 3.85%.Revenue ScenarioPer the consensus estimate, Jack in the Box is expected to record revenues of $342.5 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 14%. Declining comps in the company-owned Jack in the Box stores and Qdoba restaurants have significantly affected the top line.In the first nine months of fiscal 2017, comps at the Jack in the Box company-owned restaurants declined 0.9% as compared with a 0.2% decline in the year-ago level. The trend is expected to continue in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 with the company expecting comps to be flat to down 1% as against the year-ago comps growth of 2%. The consensus estimate also projects comps decline of 1.8% in the to-be-reported quarter.In the first nine months of fiscal 2017, comps at the company-owned Qdoba restaurants declined 2.7% as against a 1.8% increase in the first nine months of 2016. This quarter is also expected to maintain the trend. In fact, the company expects comps for the company-owned Qdoba brand to be flat to down 2% versus the year-ago quarter comps growth of 1.2%. Moreover, the consensus estimate calls for comps decline of 0.9% for the fiscal fourth quarter.Earnings ExpectationsIn order to drive margins, the company’s Jack in the Box brand has been refranchising company-owned restaurants for quite some time now. Jack in the Box restaurants are currently 85% franchised and the company plans to increase it to around 90% by 2018. At the end of third-quarter fiscal 2017, the company operated 340 company-owned restaurants. For the to-be-reported quarter, the consensus estimate for company-owned restaurants is 304.The refranchising will considerably lower the company’s general and administrative expenses and in turn boost earnings. Moreover, over the long term, such measures will generate a higher return on equity by lowering capital requirements. This will also boost free cash flow, thereby enhancing shareholders’ return. Notably, the company believes that majority of Jack in the Box new unit growth will be through franchise restaurants.However, although refranchising has a considerable potential to boost the company’s margins, sales deleverage from negative comps, rise in labor wages and commodity inflation can affect the same.In fact, the consensus estimate for earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter is pegged at 90 cents, reflecting a 12.2% year-over-year decline.Estimates for the current quarter and year have also moved down 2.2% and 0.2%, respectively, raising doubts over the stock’s upside potential.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Jack in the Box this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Jack in the Box has an Earnings ESP of -1.61%.

We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter has been stable ahead of the earnings release. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.64 billion, up 2.6% from the year-ago quarter.However, we note that the stock has underperformed the industry in the last one month. The company’s shares have declined 0.7%, while the industry grew 2.9%.Factors at PlayClorox’s potential is visible in its robust outlook, progress on 2020 Strategy, diversified brand portfolio and disciplined capital strategy. The company’s solid brand portfolio places it well in the challenging environment. Further, it remains keen on the execution of 2020 Strategy, which is aimed at boosting growth and overall market share.While Clorox expects the macroeconomic headwinds to persist going forward, it is all set to counter the hurdles with prudent strategies. The company plans to offset stiff competition with increased brand investments. Further, it is on track with the Go Lean strategy to fight slowing global economies. Moreover, the company aims to keep cost-savings and pricing in place, to battle the expected inflation and increasing commodity pricing.Further, the company anticipates boosting sales and volumes in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 backed by the intense advertising and promotion investments to enhance brand value that were incurred in the fiscal third quarter.  It also envisions EBIT margin to improve in the fourth quarter on the back of lower selling and administrative costs. That said, management remains confident of delivering another year of top-line and bottom-line growth.However, management expects trade promotional investments, along with inflationary pressure and foreign currency headwinds to lead to gross margin deceleration in fiscal 2017.Nonetheless, we believe that Clorox’s growth drivers far outweigh the obstacles and will help the company sustain its impressive momentum.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that Clorox is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

950,DG,"We expect beauty and cosmetic goods company, Avon Products Inc. (AVP  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 3. In the last quarter, the company delivered a loss per share of 7 cents against our expectations of break-even results.The company has recorded negative earnings surprise in three of the trailing four quarters. However, it has an average positive surprise of 3.7% in the last four quarters.Avon Products, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Avon Products, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Avon Products, Inc. QuoteWhat to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Avon will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 5 cents per share, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 21.4%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been going down ahead of the earnings release. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.44 billion, up 0.6% from the year-ago quarter.We note that the stock has underperformed the industry in the last one month. The company’s shares have declined 4%, while the industry grew 3.7%.Factors at PlayThough Avon’s surprise trend is yet to recover, we remain encouraged by the company’s Transformation Plan that was announced in Jan 2016.With its Transformation Plan, the company targets bringing down costs over the long term and investing the savings back into growth initiatives like media, IT systems and social selling. It is on track to generate targeted savings of $230 million in 2017. Additionally, Avon is confident of achieving long-term goals of low-double digit operating margin growth, Active Representatives growth of 1–2% and constant-dollar revenue growth in the mid-single digits.Moreover, the company is undertaking strategic endeavors to boost top-line growth, trimming costs and improving working capital. Further, Avon has made significant progress in improving balance sheet through refinancing activities, along with cutting costs by slashing jobs and exiting operations in the underperforming markets. We believe these actions will help Avon to streamline operations by focusing more on high-priority markets and activities as well as enhancing efficiency.However, the company’s persistent dismal performances due to soft Active Representatives growth and currency headwinds cannot be ignored. The beauty products retailer’s recent records reveal that it has lagged both earnings and sales estimates for three straight quarters now. Despite its efforts to revive Active Representatives, the same declined 3% in first-quarter 2017 compared with the prior-year quarter. Furthermore, Ending Representatives dipped 1%.Further, it anticipates the increase in bad debts (in Brazil) to linger in the second quarter, which is expected to remain challenging. That said, let’s wait and see if Avon’s transformation efforts can aid in reviving near-term performance.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that Avon Products is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

951,DG,"Haverty Furniture Companies, Inc. (HVT  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results after the market closes on Jul 31. The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this retailer of full-service home furnishings will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. It should be noted that the company has posted positive earnings surprises in eight out the last 10 quarters, with a trailing four-quarter average of 17.4%.A look into Haverty Furniture’s stock performance, reveals that its shares have been underperforming the industry for the last six months. In the said time frame, the stock has increased 3.9%, compared with the industry’s growth of 23.4%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.Factors at Play On Jul 10, the company reported second-quarter sales figures, wherein it recorded improved sales of 1.1% year over year. Though growth was backed by higher average ticket and custom upholstery and accessories sales along with increased internet traffic, it was offset by the sluggish consumer traffic. However, second-quarter sales growth was also much weaker than the preceding quarter’s recorded figure of 3%.Comparable store sales were down 0.2% for the second quarter, weaker than the comparable store sales growth of 1.6% in the first quarter. The company believes that the quarter’s sales were hurt due to a delay in Easter. Haverty Furniture stores remained closed for Easter, which was in April this year versus March last year.Post the adjustment in Easter shift, written comparable store sales for the second quarter were down 0.7%, lower than the 4.5% growth reported last year for full second-quarter 2016. Written sales for the second quarter were up 0.6%, compared with preceding quarter’s written sales growth of 1.0%.Despite sluggish written comparable sales, the company remains encouraged by new merchandises that are expected to flourish stores over the coming weeks through summer. The company believes that business will benefit as housing strengthens in the region and the general economy improves. We also remain encouraged by the solid fundamentals of the company and its solid store expansion plans to strengthen its presence in key markets with additional or repositioned stores. Moreover, the company is making innovations with respect to its technology developments. Also, its shareholder-friendly moves are noteworthy.Which Way Are Estimates Trending?Let’s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before the earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter and 2017 has been declining for the last 30 days. However, the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of 19 cents per share and $1.23 for the second quarter and full-year 2017 reflect a year-over-year decline of 20.8% and 5.8%, respectively.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $191.8 million for the said quarter, down 1.5% from the year-ago period. For 2017, Zacks consensus revenue is pegged at $843.2 million, reflecting a 2.6% year-over-year increase.Haverty Furniture Companies, Inc.

952,DG,"The earnings season is in full swing with results from 350 S&P 500 members already out. But Retail-Wholesale sector earnings are yet to gain steam and will take center stage as the reporting cycle nears its last leg. The sector has gained 16.6% so far in the year and has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 index that advanced 10.7%.Per the most recent Earnings Outlook, about 39% of the total S&P 500 companies in the sector have reported results, wherein 62.5% beat earnings estimates and 68.8% surpassed revenue expectations. The report also suggests that the sector is expected to record top-line growth of 4% but is likely to witness earnings decline of 1.6% this season.Thus, though investors are cautious, they are still looking to replenish their portfolio in a favorable economic scenario, with the GDP breezing past the $19 trillion mark. We believe that the encouraging economic data and friendlier fiscal and regulatory policies from the current regime bode well for the sector.Sector’s Correlation with the EconomyThe U.S. economy rebounded in the second quarter and more than doubled from the first quarter. A pick-up in consumer spending and an uptick in business investment in software, research and equipment boosted economic growth. Consumer outlays in particular improved on a steady job market and healthier household finances.Per the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the real gross domestic product (GDP) “advance” estimate for the second quarter of 2017 improved at an annual rate of 2.6% compared with a 1.2% rise witnessed in the preceding quarter. This indicated that the sluggish start to the year was primarily due to seasonal factors such as adverse weather conditions and delay in tax refunds.Consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of the U.S. economic activity, increased 2.8% in in the second quarter buoyed by the strongest labor market in years. As per reports, the U.S. economy has created over 16 million new jobs since 2010 that has helped lower unemployment rate to 4.4%. In fact, the U.S. job market roared back to life in June, with a better-than-expected 222,000 job additions in the month.The rebound in oil prices from all-time lows, improving labor market and gradual recovery in the housing market signal that the economy is on a recovery mode. These factors are favorable for retailers and definitely play a crucial role in improving consumer confidence, which rose to 121.1 in July from June’s reading of 117.3.Changing Retail DynamicsThe retail landscape has been witnessing a sea change with the focus gradually shifting to online shopping. This transition in consumer shopping pattern is compelling retailers to fast adapt to the changes in the ecosystem. Retailers now have no option left but to keep pace with the changing retail scenario or get eliminated. They are now focusing more on enhancing their omni-channel capabilities, optimizing store fleet and restructuring activities. We note that U.S. retail sales fell for the second straight month in June (down 0.2%). But sales at non-store retailers inched up 0.4% sequentially and increased 9.2% from the prior-year period.Likely Winners this SeasonThe Retail-Wholesale sector has not been an outstanding performer and identifying the winners is definitely a herculean task. Given the numerous stocks in the sector that almost always muddle one’s stock-picking prowess, the Zacks methodology could offer some relief. Our research shows that for stocks with the combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%.

953,DG,"Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 10. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this fashion specialty retailer will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.Nordstrom, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Nordstrom, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Nordstrom, Inc. QuoteThe company has delivered positive earnings surprises consistently in the last four quarters, with an average beat of about 41%. The robust earnings history has also helped shares of the company to jump 10.7% in the last one year, outperforming the industry’s slump of 25.2%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 61 cents compared with 67 cents delivered in the year-ago quarter. However, we noted that our earnings estimate has remained stable over the last 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3.7 billion, up almost 2% from the year-ago quarter.Nordstrom forms part of the Retail – Wholesale sector. Per the latest Earnings Trends, the sector’s earnings are expected to dip 1.6% year over year while revenues are projected to grow 4%.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that Nordstrom may beat earnings because it has the right combination of the two key components.Zacks ESP: Nordstrom currently has an Earnings ESP of +3.28%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is 63 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at 61 cents. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Nordstrom currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Nordstrom’s Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP make us reasonably confident of a positive earnings beat.Factors Driving the Better-than-Expected EarningsNordstrom’s solid past performance reflects the company’s robust brand image, cost-savings initiatives and impressive omnichannel efforts. The company is undertaking several initiatives to keep pace with customers’ shift to online shopping. Evidently, Nordstrom has been focused on technological advancement, through development of e-commerce and digital networks, and improvement of supply-chain channels and marketing efforts. Backed by these endeavors, the company’s online business crossed $3 billion in fiscal 2016, thus resulting in annualized growth of nearly 30% since 2010. Further, Nordstrom’s online sales formed nearly 24% of the company’s business in first-quarter fiscal 2017.Clearly, Nordstrom is making significant progress with respect to its customer-based strategy and it seems to be well on track with its long-term sales target of $20 billion by 2020.  With regard to cost savings, the company plans to strike a balance between its sales and expense growth. We believe that these factors are likely to drive Nordstrom’s growth. Thus, it seems like the company is set to maintain its splendid earnings surprise trend this time as well. Let’s wait and see.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.93% and a Zacks Rank #2.

954,DG,"Herbalife Ltd. (HLF  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 1, after the market closes.The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this leading nutrition company will be able to maintain its positive earnings streak in the to-be-reported quarter. Notably, its earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in 10 straight quarters now, with a trailing four-quarter average of 18.4%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Herbalife this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Herbalife LTD. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Herbalife LTD. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Herbalife LTD. QuoteHerbalife has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.10. Although the company’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP but we need a positive Earnings ESP in order to be confident about an earnings surprise.Estimate RevisionsLet’s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.10 and $4.50 for the second quarter and 2017 has remained stable in the last 30 days and this reflects a year-over-year decline of 14.7% and 7.2%, respectively.Furthermore, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.14 billion for the second quarter, down 5% from the year-ago period. However, revenues of $4.59 billion are anticipated for the full year, which is up 2.2% from 2016.Factors at PlayHerbalife has recently come under the scanner after some law firms like Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP and Lundin Law PC declared investigation related to possible violations of federal securities laws against the company. It should also be noted that on Jun 4, this California-based company, slashed its sales guidance, which was raised during first-quarter 2017 conference call. This was due to the new tougher Federal Trade Commission rules in the U.S. that are expected to hurt company’s business more than anticipated. Also, softness in its Mexico operations and distributors adopting the latest protocols are expected to dent sales in the to-be-reported quarter.The company now expects sales to decline in the range of 2–6% from 0.5–4.5%, guided earlier. Also, volumes are anticipated to decrease 4–8% compared with previous range of 1–5% for the second quarter. Management too expects the quarter to be a challenging one in 2017 compared with the year-ago quarter. Currency is also likely to hurt its results.Notably, Herbalife has been battling with billionaire investor Bill Ackman since Dec 2012, when Ackman made a $1 billion bet against the nutrition company, accusing it of being a pyramid scheme i.e. it employs deceptive marketing practices for improving business. Also, it received a civil investigative demand in 2014 from the FTC related to its marketing practices.Though the company resolved the probe with the FTC and paid $200 million through fines and settlements without being named a pyramid scheme, it was forced to prove that 80% of its annual sales come from documented consumer purchases. Interestingly, the company outpaced the key threshold of 80% under its agreement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. It announced that 90% of the U.S. sales in May were documented purchases, which consisted of over three million receipted retail transactions.In fact, Herbalife has remained upbeat about its prospects, which is evitable in its impressive earnings history and stock price performance. Shares of Herbalife have surged 41.3% on a year-to-date basis against its industry’s decline of 5.9%. Also, the stock has outperformed the broader Retail-Wholesale sector that has gained 17.1%.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.94% and a Zacks Rank #2.

955,DG,"Adidas AG (ADDYY  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 3. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this sporting goods behemoth will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The company delivered a positive earnings surprise in the preceding quarter. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement. Adidas AG Price and EPS Surprise   Adidas AG Price and EPS Surprise | Adidas AG QuoteWhat to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 67 cents, reflecting year-over-year decline of roughly 18%. We noted that our earnings estimate has remained stable over the last 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $5.6 billion, up about 11.1% from the year-ago quarter.Adidasforms part of the Consumer Discretionarysector. Per the latest Earnings Trends, the Consumer Discretionary sector’s earnings are expected to remain flat year over year, while revenues are projected to grow 8.1%.Factors at PlayAdidas’ shares have gained 37.8% in the last one year, outperforming the industry’s growth of 4.8%. The company has been buoyed by continued revenues growth at its Adidas brand, particularly in North America. In the last quarter, revenues at Adidas grew 36%, driven by strength noted across the training and running categories. Also, the company has been gaining from its impressive women’s business. Together, these growth drivers along with the company’s constant product launches and strong marketing initiatives make us hopeful about the company’s prospects. However, management remained dissatisfied with its performance in Russia in the last quarter, which was hurt by unfavorable pricing. Apart from this, the company continues to fight a tough macroeconomic landscape in Brazil and Argentina.Nevertheless, Adidas recently posted its preliminary results for the second quarter, wherein revenues from continuing operations surged 19% on a currency neutral basis. Moreover, net income from continuing operations rose 16%, driven by solid revenues, enhanced gross margin and operating expense leverage. Encouraged by a strong first-half 2017, management raised its outlook for the full year. The company now anticipates currency neutral revenues to grow 17–19%, compared with the old guidance of 12–14%. Net income from continuing operations is now envisioned to increase 26–28% to roughly €1.36–€1.39 billion. Earlier, the company had forecasted the same to grow 13–15% to approximately €1.2–€1.23 billion. All said, let’s wait and see if Adidas can manage to put up another impressive show this time.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Adidas is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

956,DG,"The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX  -  Free Report) is one of those retailers that is performing well even amid a tough retail landscape. This can be mainly attributable to the company’s robust initiatives to boost sales and its off-price business model. Both these factors have helped TJX companies attract solid consumer traffic, which has been aiding its performance for a while now.However, the company has been incurring high wage costs for quite some time now and also expects it hurt bottom-line growth in fiscal 2018. It looks like these headwinds have dented the company’s stock performance. Evidently, shares of this leading off-price retailer have lost 4.6% so far this year, as against the industry’s growth of 6%.  So, let’s analyze both sides of the story and see if the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s growth drivers can combat these hurdles and continue to fuel results.Strategic Initiatives to Boost SalesTJX Companies’ aggressive marketing and advertising campaigns through multiple mediums (TV, radio and social media) have been boosting traffic at stores. Its gift-giving initiatives, unique among off-price retailers and loyalty card program (which offers consumers a non-credit card choice and soft benefits such as early shopping hours) also help the company to improve customer engagement. Further, the company remains focused on innovation and has been introducing new products to drive sales. Incidentally, the company’s newly launched U.S. home concept, HomeSense, will offer consumers a different mix of home fashions from HomeGoods at good value.Focus on E-Commerce & Stores ExpansionWith consumers’ changing shopping patterns, TJX Companies has undertaken several initiatives to boost online sales by recruiting an experienced internet management team. The company’s official website tjmaxx.com, accessible from tablets and smartphones, appeals to the young generation — the company’s main target consumers. TJX plans to add more categories to the online shopping site and invest categorically in it to differentiate it from brick-and-mortar stores. However, TJX Companies also remains committed to its solid store opening strategy. During the third quarter, the company opened 139 stores, taking its total count to 4,052 stores as of Oct 28, 2017. Notably, TJX plans to take the store count to 5,600 over the long term, with plans to open approximately 260 stores in fiscal 2018.While many retailers are struggling with soft traffic, TJX Companies’ off-price model and aforementioned sales driving efforts help it draw considerable traffic. Another retailer which is benefiting from an off-price model is Ross Stores (ROST  -  Free Report), which boasts a solid top-line growth trend.Q3 Retails Solid TrendComing back to TJX Companies, the company has been witnessing year-over-year growth in both top and bottom lines for over a year now. Notably, this trend was retained in third-quarter fiscal 2018 despite the adverse impact from hurricanes. The top-line growth can be largely attributable to solid customer traffic, which is backed by the company’s impressive merchandise mix, along with the other sales-driving efforts. Further, strong merchandise margins reflect the company’s disciplined inventory management and strength of its off-price business model. Further, management stated that it began the fourth quarter on a strong note, with its solid inventory position and other sales-driving efforts keeping it well placed for the holiday season.TJX Companies, Inc. (The) Price and Consensus  TJX Companies, Inc. (The) Price and Consensus | TJX Companies, Inc. (The) QuoteWhat’s Weighing on TJX Companies?TJX Companies has been reeling under high wage costs for a while now. In third-quarter fiscal 2018 higher wages dented the company’s bottom line growth by 1%, with its pre-tax margin going down by 10 basis points. Also, selling, general and administrative costs, as a percentage of sales, inched up 0.5 pp to 18.1% due to increase in wages and costs associated with hurricanes. Unfortunately, wage increases are expected to negatively impact earnings growth by 2% in fiscal 2018.The company also posted flat comparable store sales in the quarter, with results being affected by hurricanes, with demand for apparel at the Marmaxx division also being hurt by warm temperatures in the United States. Nonetheless, trends at the division improved eventually as weather normalized, keeping it well placed for the fourth quarter.Thus, we believe that TJX Companies strategic initiatives are most likely to offset the barriers and continue the growth story of this company with long-term EPS growth rate of 10.6%.Looking for More?

957,DG,"Kirkland's, Inc. (KIRK  -  Free Report) posted third-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein the company reported a wider-than-anticipated loss that also compared unfavorably with the year-ago period. Moreover, management narrowed its earnings outlook for fiscal 2017. Nonetheless, sales remained strong, backed by the company’s e-commerce and merchandise enhancement initiatives, also making management optimistic about the holiday season performance.Shares of the company gained 2.1% on Nov 21. However, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company, which has been reporting a loss for three straight quarters now, has slumped 15.6% year to date as against the industry’s growth of 4.3%.Quarter in DetailThis Brentwood, TN-based company reported adjusted loss of 10 cents per share which was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 9 cents. Also, the reported figure was wider than the adjusted loss of 5 cents in the prior-year quarter. Including the impact of hurricanes Harvey and Irma, Kirkland’s loss came in at 15 cents per share.Kirkland's, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Kirkland's, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Kirkland's, Inc. Quote Kirkland's recorded net sales of about $145 million that increased 4.9% year over year, courtesy of strong contributions from new stores, robust e-commerce growth and effective marketing initiatives. Sales also exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $143 million.Including e-commerce sales, comparable store sales (comps) inched up 0.7%, as against a 2.3% drop witnessed in the prior-year quarter. However, comps were also hurt by the impact of hurricanes, excluding which, it jumped 2%.  Comps in the third quarter were backed by improvements in conversion and average ticket.We also note that Kirkland’s merchandise enhancements have been yielding positive results, despite persistent decline in traffic amid a tough retail environment. In fact, the company had a positive conversion rate for the fifth consecutive quarter, which along with higher average ticket helped to offset the mid-single digit drop in store traffic.Further, e-commerce sales remained robust, surging 40% year over year on the back of the company’s constant focus on enhancing omni-channel business, online product range and fulfilment operations. E-commerce revenues contributed $15.3 million to total sales in the quarter, thus representing 11% of the top line. This was backed by robust improvements in website traffic and average order value. Further, sales from third-party drop-ship strategy boosted e-commerce revenues.The home decor retailer’s gross profit remained nearly flat year over year at $50.5 million. However, gross margin declined 160 basis points to 34.9%. While merchandise margins improved 25 bps, it was countered by unfavorable mix of third-party drop-ship revenues. Also, we believe that the gross margin continued to be impacted by a promotional environment.Also, the company recorded operating loss of $3.8 million, wider than the prior-year loss of $1.6 million. This could be accountable to higher depreciation and operating expenses, which resulted from escalated labor and advertising costs. Additionally, the company incurred greater store occupancy expenses, as a percentage of sales. Also, the company witnessed higher outbound freight costs (including e-commerce shipping) and elevated central distribution expenses, which were impacted by supply chain hurdles.Store UpdatesThe company introduced 10 stores and shuttered one in the quarter, taking the total store count to 415.For fiscal 2017, management intends to open 31 new stores and close 16 stores, with a goal of attaining square footage improvement of 5%.Other Financial DetailsKirkland's exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $27.9 million and deferred rent and other long-term liabilities of $64.1 million.

959,DG,"Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) has been taking numerous initiatives to augment its online presence and fend off competition from the e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report). Among its various strategies, it is worth noting that Walmart has been proactive in expanding in the fast-growing online grocery space. Notably, this business is likely to account for nearly 20% of total grocery sales by 2025.Progressing on these lines, the supermarket giant recently extended its alliance with last mile logistics entity, Deliv, to support same-day delivery for groceries in San Jose and much of Silicon Valley — as reported by various sources. Customers at Walmart can buy online and schedule deliveries anytime between 8 am-8 pm on all days, which will be concluded by a Deliv driver.Notably, Walmart’s splendid e-commerce endeavors (including expansion in the online grocery space) have been fueling results for quite some time now. This, in turn has helped this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock surge 44.4% over a year, outperforming the industry’s growth of 33.9%. So, we believe that strategies like the aforementioned one is most likely to drive the stock higher. Walmart’s Expansion in Online Grocery Likely to be Fruitful Walmart, which competes with Amazon Fresh, has been testing same-day deliveries with Deliv for quite some time now. Evidently, both companies partnered with smart lock door maker, August Homes this September to test in-home and direct-to-fridge delivery. Per this deal that was being tested in Silicon Valley, users of August Home devices like door bells or security cameras could opt for deliveries by Deliv and monitor the whole delivery process on their smart phones.Other than this, Deliv also served as one of Walmart’s partners when the latter was testing last-mile grocery deliveries with Uber and Lyft. These initiatives highlight the solid ties between Walmart and the last-mile logistics company, with both focusing on enriching consumers’ convenience. Notably, Deliv has a strong presence in the United States, with operations spread over cities like Atlanta, Austin, Boston, Chicago, Miami, Las Vegas, and Washington, DC among others.Apart from entering into deals with third-party delivery services, Walmart also acquired delivery start-up company, Parcel Inc. to extend same-day deliveries in New York. Given consumers’ rising preference for online shopping, we believe that the extended partnership with Deliv is likely to strengthen Walmart’s online grocery category.Online grocery sales played a vital role in boosting Walmart’s e-commerce sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Incidentally, U.S. comps (excluding fuel) rose 2.7% in the quarter, largely driven by 1.5% improvement in comp traffic. Moreover, e-commerce sales positively impacted comp sales at Walmart U.S. by 80 bps. Walmart’s U.S. e-commerce sales increased 50%, owing to Walmart.com’s performance. Notably, this includes significant contributions from Walmart’s online grocery service, which has now expanded to over 1,100 locations and is expected to have 1,000 additions next year.Apart from this, management stated that its food categories performed exceptionally well and recorded the highest comps in about six years. Walmart’s international sales also delivered growth, mainly fueled by strength in food and staples categories.E-Commerce Initiatives Remain a Growth DriverAmazon’s rising dominance and expansion in the grocery space has made most retailers trepidatious, thus compelling them to take efforts to combat the intense competition. In order to keep pace with the evolving consumer demand and stand strong amid a tough environment, Walmart’s has been taking several e-commerce initiatives, including buyouts, alliances, and improved delivery and payment systems.Evidently, Walmart’s buyouts of ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, ModCloth and Jet.com underscore its quest to build an impressive digital brand portfolio. The company’s Walmart Pay mobile payment system, and Mobile Express Returns program further highlight its focus on accelerating online business and making shopping easier and faster.Looking for More?

960,DG,"Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (BGFV  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 1. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this sporting goods company will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The company boasts a spectacular earnings surprise history, as it has outperformed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 94.5%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement. Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation QuoteWhat to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 19 cents, reflecting year-over-year increase of a whopping 72.7%. We note that our earnings estimate has remained stable in the last 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $251.8 billion, up over 4% from the year-ago quarter.Big 5 Sportingforms part of the Retail–Wholesale sector. Per the latest Earnings Trends, the sector’s earnings are expected to dip 0.2%, while revenues are expected to climb 3.9%.Factors at PlayBig 5 Sporting marked its fourth straight earnings beat in the last reported quarter, wherein the company gained from competitive rationalization in the industry due to the liquidation of rivals Sports Authority and Sport Chalet. This aided comparable store sales (comps) performance and merchandise margins in the first quarter and is also expected to continue driving results. For second-quarter 2017, the company projected comps to increase in the mid-single digit range, while earnings per share is envisioned in the range of 14 – 20 cents, as compared with 10 cents recorded in the prior-year quarter.However, management had earlier informed that calendar shift of Easter and July 4 holidays into the second quarter are likely to hurt results. It looks like this has hurt investors’ sentiment, as shares of this California-based retailer have tumbled 7.6% over the last five trading sessions. Moreover, this has caused the company to plunge 35.9% so far this year, underperforming the industry’s decline of 12.1%. Given this bearish stance, we prefer to wait and see if Big 5 Sporting can manage to maintain its solid earnings trend this time.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Big 5 Sporting is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Big 5 Sporting currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as, both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 19 cents. The combination of Big 5 Sporting’s Zacks Rank #3 and ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.94% and a Zacks Rank #2.

961,DG,"Thanksgiving is just round the corner, marking the start of a busy period for retail stocks. While Thanksgiving is the unofficial start of the holiday shopping season, Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, is one of the busiest shopping days of the year.According to a survey released by the National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights & Analytics last week, about 164 million people or 69% of Americans plan to shop over the weekend which includes Thanksgiving Day, Black Friday, Small Business Saturday and Sunday as well as Cyber Monday. Both online and brick-and-mortar stores provide competitive offers and discounts during this period to attract customers.Black Friday is expected to be the busiest day this weekend with about 115 million people planning to shop this day. While 71 million people plan to shop on Saturday, Cyber Monday is expected to see about 78 million shoppers. With just 2% of consumers having completed their holiday shopping, Black Friday will be a very important day for e-commerce stocks and retailers with many companies reporting their highest profits on this day. The holiday season gives retailers the opportunity to improve traffic and bring in the numbers through promotions, early-store openings, heavy discounts, as well as free shipping on online purchases. People queuing up outside stores from the wee hours to take advantage of attractive deals and offers including early bird discounts is not an uncommon sight during this period.Retailers are gearing up for the holiday season with companies like Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) announcing the hiring of additional team members for the peak holiday season. Target has introduced Weekend Deals this year featuring marquee prices on new items every weekend based on what customers are looking for at different times throughout the season. The company also said it would be offering some of its lowest prices of the year during big events like Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Companies like Kohl’s Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) and Amazon have also announced their Black Friday deals.Low household debt burdens, growing consumer confidence, lower personal savings and higher income generation bode well for the upcoming holiday season. In fact, spending in U.S. households ramped up in October with retail sales (excluding autos, gas and restaurants) growing 0.1% over September and 4.3% from the year-ago period (NRF data).Stock PicksWith the holiday season round the corner, here is a look at four retail stocks that boast of a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of A or B.

962,DG,"Hertz Global Holdings Inc. (HTZ  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 8. Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 61%.In fact, Hertz has missed our estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 24.9%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Hertz Global Holdings, Inc Price and EPS Surprise  Hertz Global Holdings, Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Hertz Global Holdings, Inc QuoteWhat to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Hertz will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is a loss of 10 cents per share, compared with earnings of 41 cents per share reported in the year-ago quarter. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable ahead of the earnings release. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $2.21 billion, down 2.7% from the year-ago quarter.Furthermore, we note that the stock has underperformed the broader industry in the last three months. The company’s shares have declined 15.6%, while the industry grew 3.1%.Factors at PlayHertz’ bearish run can mainly be attributable to its disappointing past performance, as the company has lagged bottom-line estimates for three consecutive quarters now.In first-quarter 2017, Hertz suffered a loss and also recorded soft revenues. Earnings were hurt by weak sales, increased fleet investments along with higher spending on tech and brand development, while fall in revenues was due to soft domestic and international sales.Though performance remained disappointing, the company remains focused on turnaround plan, which keeps customers at centre stage. Further, the company remains keen on solving issues related to fleet and services, which were the main deterrents. In this regard, management remains on track to make investments in fleet, services, brand development and technology in 2017, which should help it regain solid market position.Nonetheless, the aforementioned negative factors and unfavorable currency movements make us cautious about the upcoming results.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Hertz is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Hertz has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 10 cents per share.

963,DG,"Dean Foods Company (DF  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 8. Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 23.5%.In fact, Dean Foods has missed our estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 8.4%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Dean Foods Company Price and EPS Surprise  Dean Foods Company Price and EPS Surprise | Dean Foods Company QuoteWhat to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Dean Foods will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 30 cents per share, reflecting a 20% year-over-year decline. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has been stable ahead of the earnings release. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.96 billion, up 6% from the year-ago quarter.Furthermore, we note that the stock has underperformed the broader sector in the last one month. The company’s shares have declined 12.5%, while the Consumer Staples sector grew 2.3%.Factors at PlayDean Foods’ performance remains challenged by rising competition and escalated raw milk costs. The company’s business is heavily dependent on commodities such as raw milk, soybeans, diesel fuel and others, the prices of which often fluctuate. Hence, any rise in their prices will hurt margins.Though raw milk prices started declining from Dec 2014, the company witnessed escalated raw milk costs again in first-quarter 2017, both on a year-over-year and sequential basis. During the quarter, raw milk costs rose about 6% from fourth-quarter 2016 and jumped 18% from first-quarter 2016.Moreover, the company is facing severe competition from other dairy products suppliers due consolidations in the retail grocery industry.However, contributions from Friendly’s acquisition have been providing a boost to ice cream sales volumes. This is in turn aiding top-line growth. We also applaud the company’s efforts to grow in the organic space, which is evident from its recent deals with Good Karma and Organic Valley as well as the acquisition of Uncle Matt's juices. Further, its focus on cost productivity and growth plans bode well.Additionally, the company remains on schedule with growth and productivity plans, and expects it to ramp up throughout 2017. Management remains committed toward taking strategic steps to optimize capital allocation and concentrate on core business activities. With such strategic initiatives in place, we can hope that Dean Foods would be able to lift its performance.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Dean Foods is likely to beat estimates this quarter.
