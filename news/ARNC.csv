0,ARNC,"Positive trade data out of China should help provide the market some support today, at least in the early going, though the overall focus remains on earnings season. The weekly Jobless Claims data on the home front and the no-change interest rate decision by the European Central Bank are unlikely to have much traction in today’s trading activity.
"
1,ARNC,"China’s better-than-expected export growth numbers for December provides another data point indicating that the country’s economy may be on the mend. The 14.1% jump in December exports was the highest growth pace since May 2012 and significantly higher than what economists were expecting. This corroborates other indicators like industrial production and electricity that have also started showing momentum in recent months.
"
2,ARNC,"While this data will likely perk up the outlook for commodities like industrial metals and energy, we should be cautious in reading too much into one month’s trade data. The caution is particularly warranted given the uncertain outlook for the U.S. and European economies, China’s main export destinations. With the U.S. on track to embark on its own austerity measures this year and Europe unlikely to get out of a recession in 2013, China’s export-centric growth machine is hardly in the clear.
"
3,ARNC,"On the home front, the focus remains on the fourth quarter earnings season which gets into higher gear next week. Notwithstanding the negative pre-announcement from Tiffany (TIF  -  Free Report), the early run of reports have been moderately on the positive side. Results for a number of the 26 S&P 500 companies that have reported already like Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), Alcoa (AA) and Monsanto (MON) have been better than what they did in the third quarter. But that may not be saying much given how underwhelming the third quarter results actually were.
"
4,ARNC,"We will get a better sense of this earnings season in the coming days, but the final earnings growth picture will likely be not much different from the preceding quarter’s flat finish.
"
5,ARNC,"There wasn’t much newsy content to this morning’s weekly Jobless Claims data. It went up by 4K to 371K, while the expectation was for the numbers to drop to around 365K. But taking into account the revision to the prior week’s number, this morning’s increase was even smaller. The four-week average, which smooths out the week-to-week volatility, increased by 6.8K to 365.8K. The labor market has been fairly stable lately, and this data is in-line with that view.RELATED ARTICLESClaims Steady But Spending Pressure MountsCharts Argue for New S&P Highs (VIDEO)Construction on a Tear
"
6,ARNC,"The fourth quarter earnings season has started on a positive note, as this morning’s report from Constellation Brands (STZ  -  Free Report) and Tuesday’s results from Alcoa (AA) and Monsanto (MON) show. This is a more reassuring start than what we saw at this stage in the preceding quarter, perhaps indicating that expectations may have come down enough to make positive surprises easier to reach this reporting season. But it’s way too early to make even that modest prediction at this stage, as the bulk of the earnings season is ahead of us.
"
7,ARNC,"Total earnings are expected to be up +0.5% in the fourth quarter from the same period last year. This is a sharp drop from the +7.9% growth expected in the quarter in late September, just before the third quarter earnings season was getting underway. As was the case in the third quarter (and practically every quarter before that), the actual growth rate will most likely be better than these pre-season expectations, given management teams’ mastery of under-promising and over-delivering.
"
8,ARNC,"Ahead of the third quarter reporting season, the expectation was for earnings in that quarter to be down -3.4%. While the actual earnings drop turned out to be ‘only’ -0.1%, it was nevertheless the weakest earnings growth rate in almost 12 quarters. And if the magnitude of outperformance in the fourth quarter is comparable to the last four quarters, then the final growth tally should be in the +2% vicinity. This would mean that corporate earnings were essentially flat in the second half of 2012.
"
9,ARNC,"But this sub-par earnings growth trend is not expected to last long, or at least that’s what current consensus expectations mean. After another quarter of weak results in the first quarter of 2013, earnings growth resumes in the following quarter and ramps up materially in the back half of 2013. I have been skeptical of those growth expectations for a while now, but that’s exactly what the market is pricing at present.
"
10,ARNC,"Management guidance on the earnings conference calls is always very important, but it will be far more critical this earnings season. Guidance from management teams would frame expectations for the coming quarters. Whether those expectations will hold or come down will depend to a large extent on how management teams describe business conditions on the fourth quarter earnings calls in the coming days.RELATED ARTICLESQ4 Earnings Season Gets UnderwaySector RelativityRoundtable Top Picks for the Week of Jan. 7th (VIDEO)
"
11,ARNC,"Alcoa (AA) ‘unofficially’ kicks off the fourth quarter earnings season after the close today, and it promises to be a less-than-inspiring reporting cycle. Total earnings for companies in the S&P 500 are expected to be flat this quarter from the same period last year, roughly similar to the flat growth finish in the third quarter.
"
12,ARNC,"But with macro issues -- ranging from the ‘Fiscal Cliff’ and the Fed to the outlook for Europe and China -- occupying investors’ attention, it isn’t clear at this stage if the deteriorating earnings picture will finally get the spotlight that it deserves.
"
13,ARNC,"Expectations have come down significantly enough for the fourth quarter that actual results are unlikely to be worse than what we experienced in the third quarter. Even the flat earnings growth expected this quarter is better than the negative earnings growth that was expected for the third quarter at the start of that earnings season.
"
14,ARNC,"In the end, third quarter earnings were a lot less negative (down only -0.1%), but that was a sharp contrast to the positive earnings growth performance quarter after quarter since 2009. Importantly, as the third quarter reporting season was getting underway, consensus estimates for the fourth quarter looked for earnings growth in excess of +7%.
"
15,ARNC,"The drumbeat of negative guidance on the third quarter earnings calls brought down that growth expectation from +7% to the current +0.4%. As is typically the case each quarter, most companies will likely come ahead of these lowered expectations.
"
16,ARNC,"Guidance from management teams on the earnings conference calls is always very important, but it will be even more critical this earnings season. In the current post-Reg FD environment, company guidance has become the primary tool through which managements anchor the market’s expectations. And earnings expectations for the coming quarters appear unusually optimistic relative to what we have seen lately.
"
17,ARNC,"Consensus estimates peg earnings growth to ramp up from the flat-lined performance of the second half of 2012 to a roughly +10% gain in 2013. Whether those expectations will hold or come down will depend to a large extent on how management teams describe business conditions on the fourth quarter earnings calls in the coming days.
"
18,ARNC,"We will know more in the coming days as the earnings picture evolves. But all indications are that estimates need to come down given the unsteady and weak state of the global economy. Revenue growth and margin expansion are the primary avenues through which earnings could grow. And both of those avenues have already played out. The market hasn’t been particularly concerned about this issue thus far, but it is difficult to envision investors shrugging lack of earnings growth for long.RELATED ARTICLESEarnings Season Starts This WeekIs this Rally Sustainable?

"
19,ARNC,"With nothing much on the economic calendar this week, the market’s attention will likely shift to the fourth quarter earnings season which gets under way with Alcoa’s (AA) report after the close on Tuesday. The reporting season gets into high gear next week as the big banks report results, but a number of major companies, including Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) and Monsanto (MON), will come out with fourth quarter results this week.
"
20,ARNC,"All indicators are pointing towards another underwhelming earnings season, not much different from what we saw in the third-quarter reporting cycle. But while expectations for fourth quarter earnings have been steadily coming down in recent weeks, investors appear unwilling to bring down estimates for 2013 as they hold on to hopes of a ramp in corporate profitability in the coming quarters. Guidance from management teams on earnings calls is always very important, but it is particularly important this reporting season given the lofty-looking earnings expectations for 2013.
"
21,ARNC,"Total earnings in the fourth quarter are expected to be up +0.4% from the same period last year. This is a sharp drop from the +7% earnings growth rate that consensus expected just three months ago.
"
22,ARNC,"Overall, ten of the 16 Zacks sectors will have negative earnings growth, with even the Tech sector experiencing earnings decline of -3.5% (Tech sector earnings were barely in the positive column in the preceding quarter). The Construction sector has the best earnings growth profile off all sectors, a function of the positive momentum in the housing sector. Total earnings in the Construction sector are expected to up +33.3% in the fourth quarter. The only other sector with double-digit earnings growth this quarter is Business Services.
"
23,ARNC,"The key question at this stage is whether the stock market momentum can be sustained in the face of negative momentum on the estimate revisions front. The bulls point towards the attractiveness of equities relative to other asset classes and pin their hopes on an expanding market multiple and declining risk premiums. Maybe the bulls have a point, but it will still pay to stay focused on the evolving earnings picture in the coming days.RELATED ARTICLES4 Best ETF Strategies for 2013Just Another Bull Trap?

"
24,ARNC,"‘Fiscal Cliff’ negotiators have reportedly made meaningful progress over the weekend as the last full week of trading before the Christmas holidays get underway. While we are a bit light on the data front today, but the rest of this week brings a number of top-tier economic and earnings reports. But the focus will remain on the ‘Fiscal Cliff’ question.
"
25,ARNC,"Housing is a major component of this week’s data, with Tuesday bringing the December homebuilder sentiment index, Wednesday the November Housing Starts numbers, and Existing Home sales data on Thursday. The expectation is for Housing Starts to pullback modestly from the prior month’s level, while the homebuilder sentiment index is expected to be essentially unchanged from the month earlier level.
"
26,ARNC,"Other major reports this week include the November Personal Income & Outlays and Durable Goods reports on Friday and the final read on third quarter GDP on Thursday. Expectations for GDP growth in the fourth quarter have been steadily coming down in recent weeks and currently stand a little under 1.5%, with the growth pace not much better in the first quarter of 2013 either.
"
27,ARNC,"Expectations for the back half of 2013 are for much higher growth pace, though it’s hard to envision how the momentum will shift. A Wall Street Journal report today quoting a Dow Jones Newswires survey shows major Wall Street firms expecting treasury bond yields to rise in 2013. Most prominent among these major brokerage firms are the 21 primary dealers, who underwrite treasury bond sales and deal directly with the Fed.
"
28,ARNC,"The median 10-year Treasury bond yield forecast for the primary dealers is for a roughly 50 basis point rise by the end of 2013 – from the roughly 1.71% as of Friday’s close 2.25% by the end of the year. Yield on the same security was at 1.88% at the end of 2011.
"
29,ARNC,"This makes perfect sense, for two reasons. First, yields have been so low for so long that the only direction they should be moving going forward is – higher. Second, if anyone in the market has a good understanding of the Treasury bond market, it is most likely the firms that underwrite the securities – meaning the primary dealers.
"
30,ARNC,"The only problem is that the primary dealers had come out with similar forecasts in 2011 and 2010, but unfortunately things turned out differently. Maybe the third time is the charm. But it’s not easy for anyone, even the primary dealers, to ‘fight the Fed.’ With the Fed committed to adding more than a $1 trillion worth of treasury and mortgage bonds to its balance sheet in 2013, it is perhaps reasonable to be skeptical of Wall Street’s treasury yield forecast for 2013 as well.
"
31,ARNC,"These economic growth questions have a direct bearing on the corporate earnings outlook for 2013 as well. The fourth quarter earnings season gets underway this week with Oracle’s (ORCL  -  Free Report) quarterly report after the close on Tuesday, though we are still a few weeks away from the ‘unofficial’ start of the earnings cycle with Alcoa’s (AA) release on January 8th. Other major reports this week include FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report), Discover Financial (DFS  -  Free Report) and Nike (NKE  -  Free Report).
"
32,ARNC,"Earnings expectations for the fourth quarter have been steadily coming down over the last three months, with total earnings expected to be up 1.2% from the same period last year. This is a sharp drop from the roughly 7% earnings growth expected just three months ago. But even as expectations for the fourth quarter have come down, we haven’t seen much downward adjustment to expectations for 2013, which still shows earnings growth rate of more than 10%.
"
33,ARNC,"The same thinking that is looking for the economy and Treasury yields to start rising in the second half of 2013 appear to also at play in looking for 10%-plus earnings growth. Maybe it’s just me, but I find it hard to buy into these expectations.RELATED ARTICLESWill December Mirror November Sales?Defensive Sector ETFs for the Fiscal Cliff4 Best New ETFs of 2012
"
34,ARNC,"A surprisingly strong Jobless Claims report and growing optimism about Spain will likely be the key drivers of today's market action, distracting market participants from earnings-related worries.
"
35,ARNC,"The market appears to be seeing a silver lining to the debt rating downgrade of Spain to one notch above the junk category in the hope that the move will force the Spanish government’s hand in asking for a bailout. It is far from clear at this stage whether this expectation will pan out, but it is nevertheless adding to market optimism on the European front. 
"
36,ARNC,"Europe aside, we got an unusually sharp drop in weekly Jobless Claims data this morning, which will likely add to the growing optimism on the U.S. labor market front. The jobless claims report showed the big drop in initial claims to 339K, taking this key measure of unemployment to its lowest level in almost four years. The four-week average, which tends to reduce volatility in the weekly measure, dropped by 11.6K to 364K, the lowest level in six months. The Jobless Claims report adds to the strong gains in the unemployment rate in last week’s September non-farm payroll report that brought the jobless rate to less than 8% for the first time since 2009. 
"
37,ARNC,"Offsetting these favorable reports about the domestic and European scene is the uncertain corporate earnings picture coming out of the third quarter reporting season. While the reporting season has gotten off to a weaker start relative to the previous quarter, the final tally of companies beating third quarter earnings expectations will likely be not much different from what we have been seeing in recent quarters. This is a testament to management teams’ impressive track record of under-promising and over-delivering.
"
38,ARNC,"But more important than what proportion of companies beat third quarter expectations will be the quality of guidance of fourth quarter and beyond, as this will determine how much earnings estimates for the coming quarters need to come down. Given what we have heard from Alcoa (AA), FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) and Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) on their earnings calls thus far and pre-announcements from the likes of Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and Cummins (CMI  -  Free Report), the overall trend on the guidance front will likely be to the downside. We will know more in the coming days as the earnings season unfolds.RELATED ARTICLESWhat's More Important, Earnings Beats or Good Guidance?Is Housing Recovery Finally Gaining Momentum?Banking ETFs 101
"
39,ARNC,"The Metals & Mining industry encompasses the extraction (mining) as well as primary and secondary processing of metals and minerals. The industry is oligarchic in structure, with a few producers accounting for a lion’s share of the output.
"
40,ARNC,"Iron and steel commands a major chunk of the global metals market -- more than half the metals industry in terms of volume, followed by aluminum. The iron and steel industry includes metal ore exploration and mining services, as well as iron and steel foundries for smelting, rolling, forging, spinning, recycling, stamping, polishing and plating of iron and steel products.
"
41,ARNC,"The precious metal and minerals industry consists of companies engaged in the extraction and primary processing of gold, silver, platinum, diamond, semi-precious stones, uranium and other rare minerals and ores, along with the cultivation of pearls.
"
42,ARNC,"The industry is highly cyclical and competitive. Historically, it has suffered from overcapacity (excess of supply over demand). Metal producers are subject to cyclical fluctuations in prices, general economic conditions and end-user markets. The weakening outlook for global economic growth has emerged as a major headwind for the global metal industry. These near-term challenges aside, the group’s long-term dynamics appear attractive.A Detailed Look into Metals: Performance and OutlookSteel
"
43,ARNC,"As the major stakeholder in the metals market, the steel industry was severely hurt by the global economic downturn. Recovery, however, was swift and forceful. According to the World Steel Association, world crude steel production was a record 1,527 Mt in 2011, a 6.8% annual jump. In the first quarter of the current fiscal, world crude steel production was 377.3 Mt, and improved further to 388.4 Mt in the second quarter. Moreover, recent data shows that crude steel production for July and August was at 252.5 Mt, trending 0.4% higher than the comparable period last year.
"
44,ARNC,"China retained its leadership position among the steel producing countries, yielding almost half of the global output at 48%, growing 2% year over year so far in the third quarter. Japan, the second largest producer, posted a 2% increase. The United States held the third position, producing 14.8 Mt of crude steel, flat annually and constituted 6% of the total global output. Asia improved 2.3% to 166.8 Mt, while production in Europe was a dampener, declining 4.5%.
"
45,ARNC,"The automotive and construction markets have historically been the largest consumers of steel. The automotive sector has shown significant promise. Auto sales in the U.S. surged 13% to 1.19 million vehicles for the month of September 2012. The seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) went up 13.7% to 14.9 million vehicles from September last year, the highest sales rate in the last four years.
"
46,ARNC,"Auto sales for the first nine months of 2012 averaged 14.5 million SAAR and grew a promising 15%. The robust growth rate in the sector has been fueled by strong pent-up demand, cheap financing, launch of several redesigned and fuel-efficient vehicles, rebound in consumer confidence, thanks to a growing belief that the housing market is recovering.
"
47,ARNC,"The construction sector had been a drag on the steel companies’ earnings. However, recent figures suggest a turnaround in the non-residential as well as residential construction sector. According to the American Institute of Architects, the architecture billings index (ABI), an economic indicator that provides an approximate nine- to twelve-month glimpse into the future of non-residential construction spending activity, stood at 48.7, up considerably from 45.9 registered in June.
"
48,ARNC,"Even though in the negative territory (since any score above 50 indicates an increase in billings), the index level pointed toward a moderation in the downturn. The momentum picked up in August with ABI climbing back into the positive territory with a score of 50.2 for the first time in five months.
"
49,ARNC,"The American Institute of Architects projects a 4.4% increase in spending this year for non-residential construction projects, on the back of increase in demand for industrial facilities so far this year along with sustained demand for hotels and retail projects. The spending is expected to accelerate further to 6.2% in 2013.
"
50,ARNC,"As per the U.S. Department of Commerce, housing starts increased 29% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 750,000 in August 2012 compared with August 2011. Building permits in August were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 803,000, 24.5% higher than the year-ago figure. It is worth mentioning that building permits in July this year had touched the highest level in four years at 811,000.
"
51,ARNC,"In a nutshell, record-low mortgage rates, rising rents and reduced prices of properties are luring buyers. These figures provide a glimmer of hope that U.S. residential construction is finally stabilizing and is on the road to a much awaited recovery.
"
52,ARNC,"Reflecting on the second quarter results of the steel companies in our coverage -- ArcelorMittal (MT  -  Free Report), United States Steel Corp. (X  -  Free Report), Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report) and AK Steel Holding Corporation (AKS  -  Free Report) -- we see revenues were constrained due to drop in average steel prices. This does not come as a surprise, however, as oversupply in the U.S. steel industry and increased steel imports in the domestic market affected steel prices, hurting margins and profits of steel players in the process.
"
53,ARNC,"Looking forward to the third quarter, the steelmakers expect profits to be lower than the second quarter due to continued increase in steel imports, decline in average realized prices along with macroeconomic uncertainty and sluggish growth in emerging markets.
"
54,ARNC,"For 2012, the World Steel Association provides a muted outlook, projecting a 3.6% increase in global steel usage, a sharp deceleration from 5.6% growth in 2011. This reflects a continuing slowdown in Chinese steel demand and Eurozone debt crisis uncertainties. Furthermore, questions about the U.S. growth outlook also loom large.
"
55,ARNC,"After recording a 6.2% growth in 2011, China’s steel usage in 2012 is estimated to grow 4% to 648.8 Mt as the economy is entering a less steel-intensive growth phase as a result of the government’s efforts to rebalance the economy and restrain the real estate bubble. After a weak performance in 2011, India is expected to grow by 6.9% to 72.5 Mt. Japan’s steel usage is expected to drop 0.6% to 63.7 Mt in 2012, due to the impact of exchange rate appreciation despite the reconstruction activities after the March 2011 earthquake.
"
56,ARNC,"In 2013, world steel demand is expected to increase 4.5% to approximately 1,486 Mt. China’s steel usage is expected to grow 4% to 674.8 Mt from the 2012 projections. India is expected to pick up pace and grow 9.4%, triggered by urbanization and surging infrastructure investment. In 2013, the steel use in the U.S. is envisioned at 99.5 Mt, recording 5.6% growth. Brazil is expected to grow 6.7% to reach 52.5 Mt in 2013. Japan is expected to decline further by 2.2% to 62.3 Mt, comprising 77% of the 2007 level. Europe is, however, expected to record a modest recovery of 3.3% to 155.8 Mt in 2013.
"
57,ARNC,"Given the scenario in Europe, ArcelorMittal, the world's largest steelmaker in terms of volume and Europe's largest steelmaker, had earlier decided to idle five of its 25 blast furnaces in Europe and announced the extended idling of a number of facilities. The company will continue to align its steel growth projects to match demand situations. To reduce its exposure to Europe, the company recently sold its 24% share in European energy company, Enovos International.
"
58,ARNC,"Steelmakers are increasing their consolidation efforts, particularly in China and India, in order to derive economies of scale and other synergies to remain competitive. A major development in this sector was the recent merger of Japan's largest and world's sixth-largest steel maker Nippon Steel Corporation with 27th-ranked Sumitomo Metal Industries to form the world's second biggest steel firm - Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corporation (NSSMY). With a combined capacity of 46.1 million tons, it is set to replace China's Hebei Group in the second position, which has a production of 44.4 million tons. The merger is targeted to generate savings in the face of increasingly intense global competition.
"
59,ARNC,"To sum up, despite plagued by overcapacity and softening prices, the outlook for the sector is not that bad. The outlook for key end-markets in the automotive, transportation, energy, industrial and agricultural sectors remains favorable. The faltering construction sector is showing signs of a turnaround.
"
60,ARNC,"China’s recent attempt to bolster its economy by approving 60 infrastructure projects worth more than $150 billion will help lift up the steel sector. Prices could potentially stabilize on the back of a rebound in construction activity in the developing countries, in particular China, India and South Korea.
"
61,ARNC,"Furthermore, the sector will also benefit from the Federal Reserve’s move to boost the U.S economy. However, the European debt crisis and its potential global impact remain an overhang on the industry.Gold
"
62,ARNC,"As per the World Gold Council, 2011 was a milestone year for gold as global demand for the yellow metal grew 0.4% to 4,067.1 tons at an estimated value of $205.5 billion -- the highest tonnage level with a value exceeding $200 billion since 1997. The increase was mainly propelled by the investment sector, particularly in India, China and Europe.
"
63,ARNC,"In the second quarter of fiscal 2012, gold demand was at 990 tons, down 7% year over year. Increase in demand from central banks was offset by declines in demand for jewelry, investment and in the technology sectors, due to higher prices. Central banks continued to be the primary purchasers of gold, accounting for around 16% of total gold demand, at 157.5 tons. This was a record quarter for central bank, buying more than twice the purchases in the second quarter last year.
"
64,ARNC,"In absolute terms, gold demand in the quarter was valued at $51.2 billion, a 1% decline from the second quarter of fiscal 2011. Average gold price in the first quarter stood at $1,609.49, 7% above the prior fiscal’s quarter.
"
65,ARNC,"Investment demand declined 23% to 302 tons, due to lower demand for ETFs and physical bars, particularly in India and China. Gold demand in the technology sector was 1,112.2 tons, a 5% decline year-over-year due to higher gold prices, weak consumer demand, uncertainty in Europe and substitution to more affordable alternatives.
"
66,ARNC,"Jewelry demand dipped 15% to 418.3 tons due to higher price levels. Jewelry demand in India, a major consumer of gold, was down 30%, mainly due to a deprecation in the Indian rupee against the US dollar, which led to record high local prices. Furthermore, slowing GDP growth, domestic inflation, high interest rates and below average monsoon rain also contributed to the decline. Gold in India is currently at an all-time high in rupee terms.
"
67,ARNC,"In China, another major market, demand for gold decreased 9% to 93.8 tons as consumers were discouraged by the slowing GDP growth and the lack of clear trend in gold price. However, China is expected to resume its pace as economic growth is expected to pick up as a result of the monetary easing implemented in the second quarter.
"
68,ARNC,"Mine production inched up 3 tons to 706.4 tons, up 3% year over year. Adverse weather conditions, interruptions at few operations and slower ramp up of production at few mines affected the production numbers during the quarter. Recycling activity decreased 12% to 363.7 tons, bringing the total supply to 1,059.1 tons, down 6% year over year.
"
69,ARNC,"Russia is becoming an important player in the global gold market. The Central Bank of Russia remains a significant purchaser of gold. A healthy domestic economy is driving the demand for gold jewelry in the region, catapulting it to the position of the world’s fourth largest gold jewelry consumer. The region accounts for 8% of the total global gold output.
"
70,ARNC,"Gold prices in 2011 ranged from a low of $1,310 per ounce to a high of $1,895 per ounce, with an average gold price of $1,572 per ounce in 2011. The record gold price of $1,895 per ounce was attained in September, 33% higher than the 2010 peak of $1,421 per ounce recorded in November 2010. So far in 2012, gold has ranged from $1,540 per ounce to $1,791.75 per ounce, with an average of $1,656.18 per ounce.
"
71,ARNC,"Continuing concerns about Europe's financial problems and China’s reduced economic growth forecast led to the climb. Furthermore, the announcement of a third round of quantitative easing led to a surge in the price of gold. Given the performance in 2011, and thus far in 2012, we expect this year to be stellar for gold.
"
72,ARNC,"This climb in gold prices has not translated into increased revenues at all of the gold miners. In the second quarter, while revenues at Kinross Gold Corporation (KGC  -  Free Report) and Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd. (AEM  -  Free Report) benefited from higher average realized price of gold, Barrick Gold Corporation (ABX), Goldcorp Inc. (GG  -  Free Report) and Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM  -  Free Report) could not capitalize from them due to increased cash costs. Moreover, Goldcorp was riddled with production issues at its Red Lake mine.
"
73,ARNC,"As prices for gold rise further, gold giants such as Barrick Gold and Goldcorp being unhedged producers of gold will enjoy significant leverage to gold prices. The cost increases need to be controlled in order to rake in profits. On the other hand, gold producers like Newmont and Kinross are slated to suffer from lower ore grades that subdue production levels, increase mining costs and negate the benefits of rising gold prices.
"
74,ARNC,"Ironically, rallying gold prices have not had the same effect on the share prices of the gold companies. Investors prefer alternative financial products that allow them to invest in gold, rather than investment in gold companies per se. These companies may be entangled in labor issues, escalating cost and other risks.
"
75,ARNC,"Gold remains a coveted asset, given its long-term supply and demand dynamics and influenced by macro-economic factors. The value and wealth preservation attributes of gold continue to attract investors and consumers, and is considered a safe-haven investment. Concerns regarding economic growth in developed countries have made gold an attractive and safe investment option.
"
76,ARNC,"The European sovereign debt crisis promoted gold as a currency hedge for European investors.
"
77,ARNC,"Lingering economic concerns, higher inflation expectations in many countries, including India and China, and the relentless Euro-zone debt crisis will continue to drive gold prices this year, as well. India, which alone consumes nearly 45%−50% of the world’s gold, should drive demand for gold along with China. China will likely emerge as the largest gold market in the world in 2012 and Chinese gold demand is expected to double in 10 years.Aluminum
"
78,ARNC,"The aluminum industry is highly cyclical, with prices subject to worldwide supply and demand.Alcoa, Inc. (AA), the world leader in the production of primary aluminum, kicked off the third quarter earnings season with a revenue decline of 9% due to a 17% and 20% year-over-year decline in the realized metal price and realized alumina price, respectively. On an adjusted basis, the company reported earnings per share of 3 cents compared with 6 cents per share earned in the second quarter.
"
79,ARNC,"Results were down sequentially due to lower metal prices, seasonal factors and weakness in Europe. Alcoa’s results in the past two quarters have suffered because of the decline in realized aluminum prices.
"
80,ARNC,"The company has trimmed its 2012 outlook expecting global aluminum demand to go up by 6% this year from the earlier expectation of 7%, due to the slowdown in China. Alcoa believes that the long-term prospects for aluminum remain bright and envisions that global demand for aluminum will double by 2020.
"
81,ARNC,"Alcoa’s positive long-term outlook notwithstanding, prices have been under pressure, prompting companies to cut back on production. Rio Tinto plc (RIO) plans to sell its aluminium assets and close its smelter in order to cut costs. In line with this, Rio recently sold its U.S.-based wire and cable business Alcan Cable for $185 million. BHP Billiton Limited (BHP) is also mulling the sale of its aluminum and nickel operations to exit from its non-profitable projects.
"
82,ARNC,"Alcoa is aggressively slashing costs and pursuing strategies to move down its cost curves in its upstream businesses. The company remains committed to achieving its target of moving down the cost curve 10 percentage points in smelting and 7 percentage points in refining by 2015. The company is curtailing 390,000 metric tons of its system smelting capacity to improve its competitive position. Alcoa permanently closed its smelter at Alcoa, Tennessee, and two lines at Rockdale, Texas. Alcoa has completed partial curtailments at La Coruña and Avilés, Spain. The curtailment at its Portovesme, Italy smelter is underway.
"
83,ARNC,"This trend will continue until aluminum prices recover. Energy prices and other input costs are expected to pose challenges for the aluminum industry, though oil prices have been trending down lately. In addition to the curtailments, the company will step up activities to reduce the escalating cost of raw materials.
"
84,ARNC,"In the medium to long term, aluminum consumption is expected to improve globally. The revival is palpable in the automotive and packaging industries, one of the key consumer markets. The automobile market is also becoming increasingly aluminum-intensive, benefiting from the recyclability and its light-weight properties. The global push to improve fuel efficiency in vehicles is expected to more than double demand for aluminum in the auto industry by 2025.
"
85,ARNC,"Further, the surge in copper prices observed earlier this year is triggering a switch among manufacturers to aluminum. Automobiles, air conditioners and industrial components manufacturers are now shifting their focus on more economical metal. In response to the spurt in automotive demand, Alcoa has invested $300 million in expansion projects at its Davenport, Iowa rolled products plant.
"
86,ARNC,"We expect aluminum demand to increase over the next three years, outstripping supply growth. As a result, the aluminum market is likely to witness deficits for a prolonged period. This provides a backdrop supportive of high alumina and aluminum prices. China and India are undergoing rapid industrialization.
"
87,ARNC,"The China stimulus plan and QE3 announcement will also work as positives for underlying aluminum demand. Leading aluminum producers such as Alcoa and Aluminum Corporation of China Limited, or Chalco  should also benefit from the improving demand outlook.Copper
"
88,ARNC,"Copper is a major industrial metal, with its price strongly correlated with the outlook for economic growth. The metal’s strong cyclical leverage accounts for its nickname “Dr. Copper.”
"
89,ARNC,"The metal’s popularity in industrial usage reflects its high ductility, malleability and thermal and electrical conductivity, and its resistance to corrosion. In terms of consumption, copper holds the third place after iron and aluminum. Construction is the single largest market for copper, followed by electronics and electronic products, transportation, industrial machinery, and consumer and general products.
"
90,ARNC,"Copper prices were at high levels from 2006 through most of 2008 as limited supplies, growing demand from China and other emerging economies led to the surge in copper prices and low level of inventories. In December 2008, copper prices dipped to a low of $1.26 per pound, due to reduced consumption, turbulence in the U.S. financial markets and concerns about the global economy.
"
91,ARNC,"However, copper prices have since improved, thanks to strong demand from emerging markets and limited supply. In 2011, London Metal Exchange (LME) spot-copper prices ranged from $3.08 per pound to a record high of $4.60 per pound, with an average of $4.00 per pound. In the first quarter of 2012, LME spot copper prices ranged from $3.39 per pound to $3.93 per pound, averaging $3.77.
"
92,ARNC,"However, during the second quarter of 2012, LME spot copper prices declined ranging from $3.29 per pound to $3.89 per pound, averaging $3.57 per pound. This drop reflected concerns regarding a slowdown in the Chinese economy, Europe’s sovereign debt crisis, and a slowing U.S. economy. The drop in price has affected the results of copper producers like Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX  -  Free Report) and Southern Copper Corp. (SCCO  -  Free Report) and Newmont.
"
93,ARNC,"Notwithstanding the current volatility in prices, we have a long-term bullish stance on copper. Prices will be influenced by demand from China and emerging markets, economic activity in the U.S. and other industrialized countries, the timing of new supplies of copper and production levels of mines and copper smelters.
"
94,ARNC,"Despite the near-term challenges, the long-term outlook for the copper remains positive, supported by its widespread use, limited supplies from existing mines and the absence of significant new development projects. Companies that have a high leverage to copper prices will benefit immensely from the potential demand for the metal in the developing markets.Overall Industry Outlook
"
95,ARNC,"Growth in emerging markets, particularly China and India, was a major driver of metals demand over the last few years. However, of late, demand in China has slowed down as the government cut its 2012 target growth rate to 7.5%, the lowest year-on-year growth projection in eight years. China’s recent $150 billion infrastructure has helped improve sentiment and holds promise for the metals and mining industry.
"
96,ARNC,"In the developed world, persistent recessionary conditions in Europe will have residual effects elsewhere. The U.S. economy, which looked very promising earlier this year, no longer offers a robust picture. The U.S. Federal Reserve also appears to be actively engaged in sustaining the economy’s momentum and its recent announcement of another round of quantitative easing, will hopefully jumpstart growth once again.
"
97,ARNC,"This synchronized global economic slowdown is the biggest headwind for the metals space overall at present. That said, the long-term picture remains a lot more promising as the emerging market economies are expected to get back in shape with the help of expected fiscal and monetary stimuli.
"
98,ARNC,"The third quarter earnings season has gotten underway and we are off to a decent enough start, with both Alcoa (AA) and Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report) coming ahead of expectations after the close on Tuesday. This morning’s result from Costco (COST  -  Free Report) is also along the same lines.
"
99,ARNC,"But as important as beating consensus earnings expectations for the third quarter are, it is even more important to provide reassuring enough guidance for the fourth quarter and beyond. And on the outlook front, we saw Alcoa lower its aluminum demand outlook. And while Yum guided higher, the growth trend in its all-important Chinese operation appears to be slowing, though the company seems to be doing a good job on the home front.
"
100,ARNC,"The overall earnings scorecard for the third quarter is that we have 28 companies from the S&P 500 already report results as of this morning (October 10), with total earnings down 4.9% from the same period last year and fewer than half of the companies beating earnings expectations. It is admittedly very early going at this stage, but the performance so far is weaker than what these same 28 companies did in the previous quarter.
"
101,ARNC,"That said, given how low expectations are at present, I would expect the final scorecard for the third quarter to be not materially different from what we saw in the second quarter. And while overall earnings growth and guidance were on the weak side in the second quarter reporting season, we still saw roughly two-thirds of the companies beat earnings expectations.
"
102,ARNC,"But if the quality of guidance remains weak, then estimates for the fourth quarter will have to come down from current expectations of a strong ramp up in the final quarter of the year. The same is true for full-year 2013 when current expectations are for earnings growth of about 12%, roughly double the pace of 2012. The key ‘known unknown’ at this stage is what this process of downward earnings adjustment will mean for the recent stock market rally that has pushed stocks close to all-time highs. I am of the view that the market will lose its momentum as this trend unfolds, but we will find out in the coming days as the reporting season gets into high gear.RELATED ARTICLESStocks Over $100: Love 'Em or Hate 'Em?Global Growth and Earnings Concerns (VIDEO)The Apple Effect and Nasdaq ETFs
"
103,ARNC,"The downgrade of global economic growth by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) this morning provides a fitting backdrop for today's start of third quarter earnings season.
"
104,ARNC,"This raises the prospect that most companies will cite the weak economic environment to provide a subdued outlook for the fourth quarter and beyond. And we should keep in mind that unlike for the third quarter, when consensus expectations are for earnings to decline, current expectations are for earnings to stage a robust recovery in the fourth quarter and beyond.
"
105,ARNC,"The key question at this stage is whether the expected downward revisions to forward earnings estimates will have any bearing on the market’s recent momentum, which has pushed stocks to new highs for the year and within striking distance of the all-time highs reached in the fall of 2007.
"
106,ARNC,"Both companies reporting results today -- aluminum producer Alcoa (AA) and fast-food restaurant operator Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report) -- are exposed to the slowdown in the global economy. Aluminum’s demand comes from the automotive, homebuilding and food processing end markets, among others. It will be interesting to see how Alcoa management characterizes the aluminum demand outlook in the face of a weakening global economy and favorable domestic trends in the homebuilding and auto sectors.
"
107,ARNC,"Yum! Brands owes a lot of its ‘growthy’ reputation to its Chinese operations, which is in the spotlight due to that country’s well-known growth problems.
"
108,ARNC,"The point is that irrespective of how Alcoa and Yum! do relative to third quarter expectations, what will drive these two stocks tomorrow will be how they guide on the core questions relevant to their businesses for the coming periods. And what is true for these two companies will be true across the board this earnings season.
"
109,ARNC,"Expectations for third quarter earnings have come down enough that most companies will likely beat them, as roughly two-thirds of the companies do every quarter anyway. But expectations for the fourth quarter  and beyond remain quite high, with earnings in the fourth quarter expected to reverse the third quarter’s decline (the first in 11 quarters) and bring in a roughly 8% growth.
"
110,ARNC,"For full year 2013, total earnings are expected to increase in the low double digits from the 2012 level. But it’s unlikely that companies will be able to achieve earnings growth as the global economy is slowing down, like this morning’s IMF forecast shows.
"
111,ARNC,"My sense is that we will see a majority of the companies come out with subdued earnings outlooks for the fourth quarter. And this will cause earnings estimates for the fourth quarter and beyond to come down. And this brings us to the key question of what this expected earnings revisions trend will mean for the market.
"
112,ARNC,"Will the market continue to ignore this deterioration in the earnings picture by hiding behind the Fed, as it has been doing thus far, or start taking note? I am of the view that it wouldn’t be able to ignore the weakening earnings trend, but we will find out soon enough.RELATED ARTICLESGoldman Sticks to S&P 1250 CallCan the U.S. Economy Lead the World Economy in 2013?Can the Euro Save the Quarter?

186,ARNC,"The earnings report from FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) this morning puts the spotlight back on the global growth worries that were drowned out by the hoopla surrounding the QE3 announcement.
"
187,ARNC,"Investors seem to think of QE3 as the panacea that Bernanke was at pains to point out it was not. The Fed’s new program hasn’t had much chance to do its magic on the economy yet, but one can reasonably assume that it is largely irrelevant to the type of issues facing global bellwether operators like FedEx.
"
188,ARNC,"FedEx came ahead of the lowered guidance it provided two weeks back. But whatever that positive surprise is worth, it is more than offset by lowered guidance for the current quarter and full fiscal year. The company’s eCommerce-centric package delivery business seems to be doing fine and would likely get a further lift in the current period from strong demand for Apple’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) iPhone 5.
"
189,ARNC,"It is the international air freight business, accounting for more than 60% of the firm’s revenue, which is facing weakening demand as a result of the worldwide economic slowdown.
"
190,ARNC,"We will likely hear more about this theme of weak economic backdrop weighing on corporate profitability as the third quarter earnings season gets underway. Estimates are for earnings to drop 3.9% in the third quarter from the same period last year, which reflects a roughly equivalent drop in revenues and flat margins.
"
191,ARNC,"This is the weakest earnings growth outlook at the start of a reporting season that we have seen since late 2009. Expectations are for a turnaround in the fourth quarter, with earnings expected to increase a solid 7.9%. For next year, the consensus expectation is for growth of about 10%, on top of the high single digits growth this year.
"
192,ARNC,"Count me as skeptical of these forecasts. With growth a problem all over the world, these growth expectations may not be much different than ‘hoping for the best.'
"
193,ARNC,"Technically speaking, the third quarter reporting season started today with the FedEx report, though the market starts paying attention only after Alcoa’s (AA) results next month. We still have some time to go before then. But I would be surprised if the market can build on its recent gains in this time period.
"
194,ARNC,"And hardly anyone would find the key take-away from the actual reporting season to be reassuring enough to sustain the gains made in recent days. Bottom line, this fall may not be that kind to the stock market.RELATED ARTICLESShaky Fundamentals for the BullWeighing In On QE3 (VIDEO)Dow 30 Shakeup: Did They Make the Right Pick?
"
195,ARNC,"Today’s trading action will reflect the modestly improved sentiment on Spain following decisions by Euro-zone finance officials on Monday that are perceived favorable to the country. There is no substantive change on the ground, but these day-to-day sentiment swings do have a bearing on the market, and today’s trend is relatively on the favorable side.
"
196,ARNC,"The market may also like some aspects of Alcoa’s (AA) quarterly report after the close on Monday and try to project that to the coming earnings season. It may be premature -- if not altogether erroneous -- to draw any firm conclusions about the health and quality of corporate profitability from Alcoa’s results, but some optimism may nevertheless be warranted.  
"
197,ARNC,"If Alcoa’s results are a sign of things to come in the second quarter reporting season, then we can probably afford to be a little less anxious. I am not referring to the aluminum giant’s in-line ‘adjusted’ earnings, but rather to management’s positive outlook for the coming quarters.  The company sees aluminum prices rebounding in the back half of the year, driven by what they see as supply deficit and demand momentum in the key automotive and aerospace end-markets.
"
198,ARNC,"The price of aluminum has been hit hard by concerns about global growth -- the same force that has been pushing down the prices of all other commodities. Alcoa and the aluminum space has some unique attributes that differentiate them from the broader commodity producing space. But overall, what’s good for aluminum is also good for a number of other industrial commodities. And it is in that context that Alcoa’s results Monday could be considered a modest positive for the broader basic materials sector.
"
199,ARNC,"Earnings expectations have been coming down steadily in recent weeks (Alcoa met expectations that had come down by 50% in the past month) for all sectors, including basic materials. It may be premature to say that perhaps expectations have come down more than they needed to, as was the case in the first quarter, but Alcoa’s report does improve the odds of that possibility.
"
200,ARNC,"We will know more about the quality of this earnings season in the coming days. But given how far expectations have fallen in the run up to the reporting season, it will not take much to come out ahead of them.  
"
201,ARNC,"In corporate news, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) pre-announced a lowered outlook, citing difficult conditions in Europe and China. Negative pre-announcements and weaker guidance have been a prominent attribute of this earnings season, with a number of major companies citing Europe and China for their woes. Wolverine Worldwide (WWW  -  Free Report), the apparel and footwear maker, came out with weaker-than-expected results this morning.

"
203,ARNC,"The domestic economic calendar is on the thin side this week, though the second quarter earnings season gets into the spotlight with Alcoa’s (AA) release later this afternoon. Early signs indicate that the earnings cycle may have run its course, with revenue gains hard to come by in a slowing global economy and margins already topped out.
"
204,ARNC,"We will know for sure in the coming days as the earnings season gets into high gear, but the initial reports and pre-announcements seem to indicate that earnings growth may not be available as a reliable prop for the market anymore. The softening earnings picture will likely get added to the market’s existing worry list of Europe, China and the questionable domestic economic scene.
"
205,ARNC,"With respect to Europe, finance officials are meeting today to hammer out details of the agreement announced in the last Euro-zone summit a few days back. The market is getting nervous on lack of follow-through progress, particularly with respect to the agreement’s banking sector provisions.
"
206,ARNC,"Moving towards joint banking supervision is the stated Euro-zone goal, but hardly anyone expects the path leading there to be without twists and turns. And the related anxieties have started showing up in the region’s government bond yields, with Spain and Italy’s yields inching back up in the wrong direction.?
"
207,ARNC,"Europe is not the sole global issue weighing on the equity markets; the evolving outlook for the Chinese economy is equally if not more significant. The Chinese prime minister’s statement about the economy over the weekend seems to confirm some of the concerns raised by last week’s surprise rate cut by the central bank, the second in less than a month. The decline in inflationary pressures, as confirmed by this morning’s inflation reading, indicates that the Chinese central bank could afford to get more aggressive in its easing efforts.
"
208,ARNC,"We will know the extent of Chinese slowdown later this week -- the second quarter GDP report comes out on Friday. The current consensus expectation of 7.6% growth in the second quarter will be its weakest reading since early 2009. It is perhaps not unreasonable to see downside risks to Friday’s growth number in light of last week’s interest rate cut and the weekend comment from the prime minister.
"
209,ARNC,"On the home front, the market will be keeping a close eye on the Fed to handicap the odds for further QE following the latest run of  weak economic reports. Minutes of the Fed’s June meeting coming out Wednesday afternoon will be of particular interest in that respect. The earnings season will get into high gear from next week onwards, but results from Google (GOOG) after the close on Thursday and J.P. Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) Friday morning will give us some flavor of things to come.(This article was originally published as Ahead of Wall Street - July 9, 2012.)RELATED ARTICLESIs the European Problem Unsolvable?What Happened to Health Care Provider Stocks?Will Jobs Disappointment Trigger More Fed QE?

"
214,ARNC,"Steel
"
215,ARNC,"As the major stakeholder (about 60%) of the metals market, the steel industry was severely bruised by the global economic downturn. Recovery, however, has been swift and forceful. According to the World Steel Association, world crude steel production reached a record level of 1,527 million tons (Mt) in 2011, outperforming the 2010 record of 1,414 Mt, a 6.8% jump. This trend has largely remained in place this year, though the emerging growth worries will likely force some producers to take production off-line.
"
216,ARNC,"China remains the largest steel-producing country, accounting for roughly half of all global production at 46%, though its first quarter 2012 volumes were barely up from the year-earlier level. Japan, the second largest producer, posted a 4.1% decline.  The U.S. is in the third position, though its first quarter production was 9.2% higher year over year. North American crude steel production was up 7.7% in the first quarter, Asia was flat, while Europe dipped 3.8%. In April 2012, world crude steel production was down 3% from March, but up 1% from the April 2011 levels.
"
217,ARNC,"As we look into the first quarter results of the steel companies in our coverage -- ArcelorMittal (MT  -  Free Report), United States Steel Corp. (X  -  Free Report), Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report) and AK Steel Holding Corporation (AKS  -  Free Report) -- we find revenues benefitted from higher average steel prices. On the volume front, ArcelorMittal and U.S. Steel saw a rise, while Nucor and AK Steel suffered declines. Revenues increased at all the companies except AK Steel. However, we note margin compression across the board.
"
218,ARNC,"The automotive and construction markets have historically been the largest consumers of steel. The automotive sector has shown significant promise. In February 2012, total motor vehicle sales reached their highest level since February 2008 at 15.1 million SAAR (Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rate). For the first five months of 2012, sales have averaged 14.4 million SAAR. Many auto manufacturers made their best Memorial Day sales in over five years. Motor vehicle sales were at 13.8 million in May, declining from 14.4 million in April. Even though sales slid to the lowest level so far in 2012, it is still better than consensus expectations from the beginning of the year. On a year-over-year basis, sales increased 26% in May.
"
219,ARNC,"The construction sector has been a drag on steel companies’ earnings. According to the American Institute of Architects, the architecture billings index, an economic indicator that provides an approximately nine- to twelve-month glimpse into the future of non-residential construction spending activity, was 48.4 in April 2012. This followed a 50.4 reading in March, and of significance since any score above 50 indicates an increase in billings. After remaining at a level over 50 for five consecutive months, the index has slipped into negative territory. Given the continued uncertainty in the market, we do not expect any immediate recovery in this sector.
"
220,ARNC,"The residential construction market has improved in recent months, but the pace of improvement has been very slow and halting. This means that this end market is unlikely to emerge as a key growth driver for steel producers any time soon.
"
221,ARNC,"The World Steel Association projects global steel usage to rise 3.6% in 2012, a sharp deceleration from 2011’s 5.6% growth. This reflects continuing slowdown of Chinese steel demand and Eurozone debt crisis uncertainties. Questions about the U.S. growth outlook make another cloud on the horizon.
"
222,ARNC,"China’s steel use in 2012 is estimated to grow 4% to 648.8 million tons, following 6.2% growth in 2011. The slackening is due to the economy entering a less steel-intensive growth phase as a result of the government’s efforts to rebalance the economy and restrain the real estate bubble. After a weak performance in 2011, India is expected to grow by 6.9% to reach 72.5 Mt.
"
223,ARNC,"Apparent steel use in the U.S. is forecast to grow 5.7% in 2012. In Central and South America, apparent steel use will attain a historical high of 49.1 Mt, up 6.8% in 2012. Brazil is expected to return to positive growth. Japan’s steel use is expected to drop 0.6% to 63.7 Mt in 2012 due to the impact of exchange rate appreciation, despite the reconstruction efforts following the March 2011 earthquake.
"
224,ARNC,"Steel usage in the European Union is expected to decline by 1.2% to 150.9 Mt in 2012 as  sovereign debt problems persist. Given the scenario in Europe, ArcelorMittal, the world's largest steelmaker by volume and Europe's largest steelmaker, had earlier decided to idle five of its 25 blast furnaces in Europe and announced the extended idling of a number of facilities. The company will continue to align its steel growth projects to match demand situations.
"
225,ARNC,"Furthermore, the company’s focus on its mining business given its more attractive returns has resulted in some planned steel investments being deferred. To reduce its exposure to Europe, the company recently sold its 24% share in European energy company Enovos International.
"
226,ARNC,"To sum it up, despite relatively over-supplied conditions and softening prices, the outlook for the sector is not that bad. Prices could potentially stabilize, as visibility on the economic growth questions of countries like China, India and South Korea improves. The outlook for key end-markets in the automotive, transportation, energy, industrial and agricultural sectors remains favorable. However, the European debt crisis and its potential global impact remain an overhang on the industry.
"
227,ARNC," Gold
"
228,ARNC,"As per the World Gold Council, last year was a milestone year for gold as global demand for the yellow metal grew 0.4% to 4,067.1 tons at an estimated value of $205.5 billion -- the highest tonnage level with a value exceeding $200 billion since 1997. The increase was mainly propelled by the investment sector, particularly in India, China and Europe.
"
229,ARNC,"In the first quarter of fiscal 2012, gold demand was at 1097.6 tons, a 5% year over year decline. Increase in investment demand was offset by declines in demand for jewelry and in the technology sectors, due to higher prices. Central banks continued to be purchasers of gold, accounting for around 7% of total gold demand, at 80.8 tons.
"
230,ARNC,"However, in absolute terms, gold demand in the quarter was valued at $59.7 billion, a 16% jump compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Average gold price in the first quarter stood at $1,690.57. This was 22% above the prior fiscal’s quarter. In value terms, all the sectors of gold demand posted growth, barring physical bars and the official sector.
"
231,ARNC,"Investment demand posted robust growth in the quarter, particularly led by ETFs and similar products. Gold demand in the technology sector was at 107.7 tons, a 7% decline year-over-year due to higher gold prices, weak consumer demand, higher inventories and the uncertainty in Europe.
"
232,ARNC,"Jewelry demand dipped 6% to 519.8 tons due to higher price levels. The 22% higher quarterly average price suggests that jewelry demand is not directly related to price. Value of jewelry demand grew 14% to a record $28.3 billion. China, Russia and Egypt recorded growth, while weakness was witnessed in India, a number of Middle Eastern markets and in Europe.
"
233,ARNC,"Jewelry demand in India, otherwise a major consumer of gold, was down 19% and investment demand declined 46%. This was mainly due to a sharp decline in the rupee, which led to higher local prices, rise in import taxes on gold and imposition of excise duty on jewelry in that country. However the excise duty was later withdrawn by the government. Gold in India is currently at an all-time high in rupee terms.
"
234,ARNC,"In China, demand for gold increased 10% to a record high of 255.5 tons. China remained the largest jewelry market for the third consecutive quarter. Boosted by the local New Year holiday earlier this year, jewelry demand was at 156.6 tons, up 8% year over year, and accounting for 30% of global jewelry demand. Even though the pace of growth is slowing, gold demand remains high due to rising income levels, urbanization, economic growth and inflation.
"
235,ARNC,"Mine production increased to 673.8 tons, up 3% year over year. The additional supply came from new projects coming on stream and the continued ramping up of projects that entered into production two to three years ago across the globe. Recycling activity increased 11% to 391.5 tons, bringing the total supply to 1,070.3 tons, up 5% year over year.
"
236,ARNC,"Gold prices in 2011 ranged from a low of $1,310 per ounce to a high of $1,895 per ounce, with an average gold price of $1,572 per ounce in 2011. The record gold price of $1,895 per ounce was attained in September, 33% higher than the 2010 peak of $1,421 per ounce recorded in November 2010. So far in 2012, gold has ranged from $1,540 per ounce to $1,781 per ounce, with an average of $1,657 per ounce. Continuing concerns about Europe's financial problems and China’s reduced economic growth forecast led to the climb. Given the performance in 2011, and thus far in 2012, we expect this year to be stellar for gold.
"
237,ARNC,"It also remains a coveted asset, given its long-term supply and demand dynamics and influenced by macro-economic factors. Concerns regarding economic growth in developed countries have made gold an attractive and safe investment option. The European sovereign debt crisis promoted gold as a currency hedge for European investors. Lingering economic concerns, higher inflation expectations in many countries, including India and China, the relentless Euro-zone debt crisis and a still-high American unemployment rate will continue to support gold prices this year, as well.
"
238,ARNC,"The value and wealth preservation attributes of gold continue to attract investors and consumers, and is considered a safe-haven investment. Jewelry and investment demand in non-western markets continue to rebound, while industrial demand has started to recover in response to an improvement in economic conditions. India, which alone consumes nearly 45%−50% of the world’s gold, should drive demand for gold along with China. China will likely emerge as the largest gold market in the world in 2012 and Chinese gold demand is expected to double in 10 years.
"
239,ARNC,"Analyzing the results of the gold companies in our coverage -- Barrick Gold Corporation (ABX), Kinross Gold Corporation (KGC  -  Free Report), Goldcorp Inc. (GG  -  Free Report) and Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd. (AEM  -  Free Report) -- we find that first-quarter profits were driven by higher average realized gold prices. As prices for gold rise further, gold giants such as these will benefit. On the other hand, gold producers like Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM  -  Free Report) and Kinross are slated to suffer from lower ore grades that subdue production levels, increase mining costs and negate the benefits of rising gold prices.
"
240,ARNC,"Ironically, rallying gold prices have not had the same effect on the share prices of the gold companies. This is reflected in our overall long-term Neutral view on the space. Investors prefer alternative financial products that allow them to invest in gold, rather than investment in gold companies per se. These companies may have labor issues, escalating cost and other risks.Aluminum
"
241,ARNC,"The aluminum industry is highly cyclical, with prices subject to worldwide supply and demand.
"
242,ARNC,"In the first quarter of fiscal 2012, Alcoa, Inc. (AA), the world leader in the production of primary aluminum, reported better-than-expected results on the back of growth in the aerospace and automobile sectors.
"
243,ARNC,"The company anticipates that global aluminum demand will go up by 7% this year. It also expects that burgeoning demand for aluminum along with market-related production cutbacks will lead to a global aluminum industry deficit of 600,000 metric tons in 2012. Region-wise, in 2012, China and India are expected to lead with double-digit growth. Russia and Brazil are projected to have 4% to 5% increases in aluminum consumption rates. Overall, Alcoa believes that the long-term prospects for aluminum remain bright and envisions that global demand for aluminum will double by 2020.
"
244,ARNC,"Alcoa’s positive outlook notwithstanding, prices have been under pressure, prompting companies to cut back on production. Rio Tinto (RIO) plans to sell its aluminium assets and close its smelter in order to cut costs. Alcoa plans to close or curtail 390,000 metric tons, or approximately 12% of its global smelting capacity, in 2012. This will lower the company’s cost position by 10 percentage points in smelting and 7 percentage points in refining, by 2015 and improve its competitiveness.
"
245,ARNC,"This trend will continue until aluminum prices recover.  Energy prices and other input costs are expected to pose challenges for the aluminum industry, though oil prices have been trending down lately. In addition to the curtailments, the company will step up action to reduce the escalating cost of raw materials.
"
246,ARNC,"In the medium to long term, aluminum consumption is expected to improve globally. The revival is palpable in the automotive and packaging industries, one of the key consumer markets.
"
247,ARNC,"The automobile market is also becoming increasingly aluminum-intensive, benefiting from the recyclability and its light-weight properties. The global push to improve fuel efficiency in vehicles is expected to more than double demand for aluminum in the auto industry by 2025.
"
248,ARNC,"Further, the surge in copper prices this year is triggering a switch among manufacturers to aluminum. Automobiles, air conditioners and industrial components manufacturers are now shifting their focus on the more economical metal. In response to the spurt in automotive demand, Alcoa has invested $300 million in expansion projects at its Davenport, Iowa rolled products plant.
"
249,ARNC,"We expect aluminum demand to increase over the next three years, outstripping supply growth. As a result, the aluminum market is likely to witness deficits for a prolonged period. This provides a backdrop supportive of high alumina and aluminum prices. China and India are undergoing rapid industrialization.
"
250,ARNC,"Both these factors are positive for underlying aluminum demand. Leading aluminum producers such as Alcoa and Aluminum Corporation of China Limited, or Chalco  should benefit from the improving demand outlook.Copper
"
251,ARNC,"Copper is a major industrial metal, with its price strongly correlated with the outlook for economic growth. The metal’s strong cyclical leverage accounts for its nickname “Dr. Copper.”
"
252,ARNC,"The metal’s popularity in industrial usage reflects its high ductility, malleability and thermal and electrical conductivity, and its resistance to corrosion. In terms of consumption, copper ranks third after iron and aluminum. Construction is the single largest market for copper, followed by electronics and electronic products, transportation, industrial machinery, and consumer and general products.
"
253,ARNC,"Copper prices were at high levels from 2006 through most of 2008 as limited supplies, growing demand from China and other emerging economies resulted in high copper prices and low level of inventories. In December 2008 copper prices dipped to a low of $1.26 per pound, due to reduced consumption, turbulence in the U.S. financial markets and concerns about the global economy.
"
254,ARNC,"However, copper prices have since improved, thanks to strong demand from emerging markets and limited supply. During 2011, London Metal Exchange (LME) spot-copper prices ranged from $3.08 per pound to a record high of $4.60 per pound, with an average of $4.00 per pound. In the first quarter of 2012, LME spot copper prices ranged from $3.39 per pound to $3.93 per pound, averaging $3.77. This rising trend has benefited copper producers like Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX  -  Free Report) and Southern Copper Corp. (SCCO  -  Free Report).
"
255,ARNC,"Notwithstanding the volatility in prices, we have a long-term bullish stance on copper prices. Prices will be influenced by demand from China, economic activity in the U.S. and other industrialized countries, the timing of new supplies of copper and production levels of mines and copper smelters.
"
256,ARNC,"Despite near-term challenges, the outlook for the copper remains positive, supported by widespread use of copper, limited supplies from existing mines and the absence of significant new development projects. Companies that have a high leverage to copper prices will benefit immensely from the potential demand for the metal in the developing markets.
"
257,ARNC," Overall Industry Outlook
"
258,ARNC,"Growth in the emerging markets, particularly China and India, was a major driver of metals demand over the last few years. In the developed world, Europe’s problems have likely pushed it into a recession already, which will have residual effects elsewhere in the world. The U.S. economy, which looked very promising earlier this year, no longer offers a robust picture.
"
259,ARNC,"This synchronized global economic slowdown is the biggest headwind for the metals space overall at present. That said, the long-term picture remains a lot more promising as the emerging market economies are expected to get back in shape with the help of expected fiscal and monetary stimuli.
"
260,ARNC,"The U.S. Federal Reserve also appears to be actively engaged in sustaining the economy’s momentum. But the Fed’s ability to make a meaningful change may be limited in the absence of fiscal measures that are unlikely to come through in this election year.
"
261,ARNC,"In the choice between ‘bad’ and ‘worse’ available to the Greeks in Sunday’s election, they made the ‘right’ call and opted for the ‘bad’ option. This is a big sigh of relief for Europe and the global financial system.
"
262,ARNC,"But don’t look for a relief rally today as the market’s attention shifts promptly from Greece to Spain, where yields on government bonds are rising and reaching unsustainable levels, requiring some sort of intervention. As such, the positive aspect of today’s trading action is that we were able to avoid a major or catastrophic negative.
"
263,ARNC,"Spanish government bond yields are up above the dangerous 7% level today, which effectively means a very restrictive capital market access for the government. Greece, Ireland, and Portugal needed outside intervention when they reached these levels. Spain’s banking bailout a few days back obviously wasn’t enough and the G-20 summit getting underway in Mexico today has limited room for doing anything good.
"
264,ARNC,"A major intervention from the European Central Bank (ECB) in the form of another round of long-term refinancing operation (LTRO) will most certainly break the negative momentum in Spanish (and Italian) government bond markets. But the ECB believes that doing more LTRO will relieve the pressure on Euro-zone political leaders to take the tough decisions needed to ‘fix’ the problem, such as moving towards a banking or fiscal union. The question is whether Spain has the ability to sustain these above-7% yields while it waits for Euro-zone leaders to make the right decisions in the summit meeting later this month.
"
265,ARNC,"The ECB is not the only central bank in the spotlight this week. The Federal Reserve is in focus as we get the official post-meeting statement from the FOMC on Wednesday followed by Bernanke’s press conference that afternoon. Market participants are looking for the Fed to do ‘something’ on Wednesday.
"
266,ARNC,"But what and how effective that ‘something’ will be is up in the air at this stage. They could extend ‘Operation Twist,’ which ends at the end of this month, extend their interest rate ‘guidance,’ or announce a new round of quantitative easing or bond purchases. I don’t think ‘doing nothing’ is one of the options, given how high expectations are some sort of new Fed action. But we will have to wait till Wednesday to find out.
"
267,ARNC,"Europe and the Fed aside, we have a number of major housing industry reports coming out this week, including the homebuilder sentiment index this morning, Housing Starts on Tuesday, and Existing Home sales on Thursday. We will also start keeping tabs on second quarter earnings reports this week, with results from companies like FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) coming out.
"
268,ARNC,"The financial press typically associates the start of the earnings season with Alcoa’s (AA) report  each quarter. But in reality, the earnings season gets underway before that, as many companies have fiscal quarters that end at different months than the end of the calendar quarter. For example, Alcoa will release its second quarter 2012 results in July, while a number of major companies whose fiscal quarters end in May will report before that. We will be counting results from all the companies with May quarter ends, like Oracle and FedEx, as part of the second quarter of 2012.
"
269,ARNC,"Current expectations are for second quarter 2012 earnings to be up 2.1% from the same period last year, reflecting a modest 0.6% revenue increase and a 13 basis point expansion in margins. This compares to earnings growth of 7.9% in the first quarter, which reflected gains of 4.7% on the top-line and margin expansion of 21 basis points.
"
270,ARNC,"Pretty much all of the second quarter earnings growth is coming from the Finance sector. Excluding Finance, total earnings in the second quarter will be down 4% from the same period last year. We will be getting ‘second quarter’ results from 12 companies in the S&P 500 this week.RELATED ARTICLESBernanke to Follow Eurozone VoteGaming GrexitSpain's Bailout Pessimism vs. S&P Chart Optimism
"
271,ARNC,"Alcoa’s (AA) positive results may not have much relevance beyond the basic materials and commodity sectors, but it nevertheless provides further evidence that it may not take much to reassure investors on the earnings front given how low expectations have dropped.
"
272,ARNC,"It is perhaps premature to expect the earnings season to put a stop to the stock market slide of the last few days. But given the subdued expectations, earnings reports are unlikely to produce more pain for the market, either.
"
273,ARNC,"While the pullback was not unexpected following uninterrupted gains of the last six months, some have started calling it a repeat performance of last year when the market lost momentum around this time after a strong start. I am hesitant to say that ‘this time is different,’ but the similarities are only surface-deep. For starters, the U.S. economy is on a lot stronger footing this year than was the case last year, with multiple areas of fundamental support. Momentum in the labor market, despite the March jobs miss, appears to be a lot more sustainable and entrenched, helping improve the prospects for consumer spending.
"
274,ARNC,"And while Europe has re-emerged as a cloud in recent days, centered this time on Spain, the threat it poses to the U.S. and global economy are magnitudes lower than the existential concerns about the common currency union last year. Bottom line, the stock market slide of the last days may actually be the pullback that many had been looking for, but it is unlikely to prove as enduring as what the market faced last year.
"
275,ARNC,"As mentioned at the top, Alcoa provided a good start to the first quarter earnings season after the close on Tuesday by coming out with better-than-expected results and guiding towards strong demand outlook for aluminum. It is still early going in the reporting cycle, but we got two major pre-announcements this morning – a negative one from Nokia (NOK  -  Free Report) and a positive one from Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report).  We also have a solid earnings report this morning from Titan Machinery (TITN  -  Free Report), the farming and construction equipment maker.RELATED ARTICLESM&A Has Returned, Will It Last?Invest Like the 1%Market Looks Ahead to Earnings
"
276,ARNC,"With nothing major on the economic front, market action today will likely reflect the loss of momentum following Friday’s jobs surprise. But the overall tone should be a lot less negative than what we encountered on Monday as market participants look ahead to the start of the first quarter reporting season with Alcoa’s (AA) after the close today.
"
277,ARNC,"The economic docket is relatively on the lighter side this week, with the Fed’s Beige Book on Wednesday, Trade Deficit on Thursday, and CPI on Friday as the only major reports. Thursday’s Jobless Claims data could be important, as it will be the  first labor market reading after Friday’s non-farm payroll miss.
"
278,ARNC,"I don’t envision any sharp moves in the market in the coming days, though an air of tentativeness will likely prevail as the market sizes up the underlying momentum in the labor market and the odds of further Fed action.
"
279,ARNC,"Worries about Spain’s ability to control its deficit situation have revived following last week’s poor bond auction. This has helped reverse the downtrend in the country’s market interest rates, with benchmark government bond yields reaching their highest level of the year. Italian bond yields have started moving up in solidarity with Spain in recent days as well, though we must concede that interest rates for both countries remain below late last year’s dangerous levels. The situation in Spain may not have reached the Greek levels yet, but it is nevertheless a reminder to investors that Europe remains far from settled.
"
280,ARNC,"Alcoa’s results later today may not give us a good preview of first quarter results for the corporate sector as a whole. But we will see Google’s (GOOG) results on Thursday and J.P.Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report)  and Wells Fargo’s (WFC  -  Free Report) on Friday. It will be interesting to see continuation of last quarter’s trend of positive trend in banks’ loan portfolios. These specific reports aside, I don’t envision any major negative surprises coming out of this reporting season given the fairly subdued expectations.
"
281,ARNC,"More so than growth rates and beats, the focus will be on guidance and outlook, as expectations for the coming quarters have not come down as much as they have for the first quarter. In fact, expectations for the first quarter are the lowest of any quarter this year, with growth expected to improve in the back half of the year.
"
282,ARNC,"While the domestic economic scene appears promising enough, it is far from clear at  this stage if it will prove to be enough to offset the unfavorable developments in Europe and China.
"
283,ARNC,"Bottom line: while I don’t expect any major negative surprises from the reporting season, it may help in better anchoring expectations for the remainder of the year. And those estimate revisions will most likely be to the downside.RELATED ARTICLESM&A Has Returned, Will It Last?Jobs Report Far Below ExpectationsJobs & the Market: Weather or Not?
"
284,ARNC,"Stocks will be struggling with a key question in today’s trading action – was Friday’s jobs miss a weather-related payback or a recurrence of a fundamental weakness along the lines what we encountered around this time in 2011 and 2010? I would say it’s all weather, with the boost from the warm winter months getting reversed in March, but the overall positive trend line remaining in place. That said, the market’s first reaction to the sub-par payroll reading will most likely be negative.
"
285,ARNC,"In the run-up to the March jobs report, a number of economic forecasters had started wondering about the extent of temporary contribution from this year’s unusually warm winter. Even Ben Bernanke found the labor market strength of the last few months difficult to reconcile with the relatively slow pace of underlying economic improvement. We will know for sure only after we get the April jobs numbers in about three week, but weather seems to be the most plausible explanation for March’s unexpected under-200K labor market reading.
"
286,ARNC,"The government’s monthly household survey (the unemployment rate comes out of this report) lists the number of people not at work because of weather. The non-seasonally adjusted March reading showed an 82K drop on this count, significantly below the historical level for this month. The same number for the preceding three months was above trend compared to history, meaning that the weather gains of the pre-March months likely got reversed in March. The persistent downtrend in weekly jobless claims and other labor market indicators over the last many months would argue against a fundamental weakness in underlying momentum.  
"
287,ARNC,"In corporate news, the first quarter earnings season gets underway unofficially on Tuesday with Alcoa’s (AA) report, with aggregate earnings growth expectations at their lowest level since the start of earnings recovery in 2009. Barring unusual negative surprises, I would expect this earnings season to be largely uneventful. Given the low hurdle rates as a result of subdued expectations, the focus will be management guidance for the coming quarter, particularly with how they see the Chinese and European situation impacting their profitability.

289,ARNC,"About the Industry
"
290,ARNC,"The Metals & Mining industry encompasses the extraction (mining) as well as the primary and secondary processing of metals and minerals such as aluminum, gold, precious metals, coal and steel. The industry is oligarchic in structure, with a few producers accounting for the lion’s share of the output.
"
291,ARNC,"The largest segment of the global metals market is iron and steel, followed by aluminum. The iron and steel segment comprises more than half the industry in terms of volume. This industry includes metal ore exploration and mining services, as well as iron and steel foundries for smelting, rolling, forging, spinning, recycling, stamping, polishing and plating of iron and steel products such as pipes, tubes, wire, spring, rolls and bars.
"
292,ARNC,"The precious metal and mineral industry consists of companies engaged in the extraction and primary processing of gold, silver, platinum, diamond, semi-precious stones, uranium and other rare minerals and ores, along with the cultivation of pearls.Overall Industry Outlook
"
293,ARNC,"The global metal industry is cyclical, highly competitive and has historically been characterized by overcapacity (excess of supply over demand). Metal producers are subject to cyclical fluctuations in London Metal Exchange (LME) prices, general economic conditions and end-use markets.
"
294,ARNC,"Profitability at the individual company level depends on volume and operating efficiency. Large producers with huge resources are able to discover and develop new deposits, thereby boosting reserves, while the smaller ones own fewer mines.
"
295,ARNC,"Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) have historically been a critically important growth strategy for mining companies. The year 2009 experienced a lull in M&A activity under the impact of the global economic downturn and the focus shifted from business growth to business survival, as companies looked to safeguard their teetering balance sheets rather than seeking expansion.
"
296,ARNC,"However, reversing the trend, 2010 witnessed a surge in mining deals as the rise in commodity prices, economic recovery, demand in developing markets, growing scarcity of resources and refreshed balance sheets spurred merger activity.
"
297,ARNC,"2011 was a busy year in terms of M&A activity despite the European debt crisis, earthquake in Japan, social unrest in the Middle East, and downgrade of the U.S. government’s debt rating. We expect the momentum in M&A to sustain in 2012 as well. Armed with healthy balance sheets, reduced economic uncertainty and a pent-up demand for new projects, we expect the companies in the industry to accelerate deal activity with a re-focus on consolidation.
"
298,ARNC,"In an industry plagued with rising energy and raw material costs, increasing productivity and reducing costs are the keys to success. Given the cyclical nature of the metals industry, low-volume, high-cost producers need to generate sufficient cash or ensure a strong borrowing position during market peaks to survive the market troughs.
"
299,ARNC,"Continuing consolidation supports the sector’s ability to influence the price of input costs and companies can also obtain synergies and economies of scale through the operation of vertically integrated raw materials sources. Expansion in low-cost countries will ensure lower labor costs and also help tap their growth potential.
"
300,ARNC,"The Glencore-Xstrata merger currently in the offing is one of the biggest ever in the mining sector. If it materializes, it would result in a combined new business of $90 billion and will be the world's biggest exporter of coal for power plants and the largest producer of zinc. This will be the largest mining transaction in history, dwarfing the earlier major deals like Rio Tinto-Alcan in 2007 and Vale-Inco in 2006.
"
301,ARNC,"Demand in the metals and mining industry has benefitted from the strong growth in emerging markets. China and India in particular, are witnessing higher production and consumption of metals. Per capita consumption levels in both these countries are calibrating to U.S levels, which could, theoretically at least, double metal demand in the longer term.
"
302,ARNC,"China is the world’s largest consumer of metals and is expected to remain so in the future. Overall, we expect global metal demand to improve in the long term with the recovery of user industries.
"
303,ARNC,"Demand as well as production for industrial metals in Japan had been recently affected, as factories were shut down in the aftermath of the country’s strongest earthquake and tsunami. Japan is the biggest buyer of aluminum and the second largest buyer of copper ore.
"
304,ARNC,"We believe the industry will continue to benefit from the metal demand generated from the country’s rebuilding activity. Sovereign debt issues and sluggish growth in Europe however remain lingering concerns.A Detailed Look into Metals

306,ARNC,"As the major shareholder (about 60%) of the metals market, the steel industry was severely bruised by the global economic downturn. But the recovery has been swift and forceful. According to the World Steel Association, world crude steel production was a record 1,527 million tons (Mt) in 2011, outperforming the 2010 record of 1,414 Mt, a 6.8% jump.
"
307,ARNC,"China continues to retain its status as the largest steel producing country, yielding almost half of the global output at 46%, and growing 8.9% year over year. Japan, the second largest producer country, however posted a 1.8% decline due to the earthquake.  The United States remained in the third position, producing 86.2 Mt of crude steel, 7.1% higher than 2010 and comprising 6% of the total global output.
"
308,ARNC,"North America’s crude steel production was 118.9 Mt, an increase of 6.8% on 2010.  In Asia, overall growth was noted at 7.9% and Europe rose 4.6%. As per January figures, in the current fiscal, world crude steel production was 117 Mt, a 7.8% dip from January 2011 but flat with  December 2011 levels.
"
309,ARNC,"Reflecting on the 2011 results of the steel companies in our coverage - ArcelorMittal (MT  -  Free Report), AK Steel Holding Corporation (AKS  -  Free Report) and Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report) -- revenues increased across the board due to higher average steel prices and increase in shipments.
"
310,ARNC,"ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steel producing company, produced 91.9 million tons in fiscal 2011, representing 6% of the world's steel output. ArcelorMittal’s 2011 sales increased 10% to $94 billion and for AK Steel sales climbed 8% to $6.5 billion. Nucor recorded sales increase of 21% to reach $20 billion.
"
311,ARNC,"In terms of profitability, Nucor stood tall with its fiscal 2011 EPS of $2.45, almost six fold the 42 cents earned in 2010. ArcelorMittal’s EPS in fiscal 2011 plummeted 31% to $1.19. AK Steel reversed its year-ago loss to earn 9 cents (excluding special items) in 2011. U.S. Steel Corp (X  -  Free Report), though still in red, narrowed its fiscal 2011 loss per share to 47 cents from the year-ago loss of $3.36.
"
312,ARNC,"Currently, Nucor, United Steel and AK Steel retain a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) for the short term (1 to 3 months) that corresponds with our Neutral recommendations in the long term. ArcelorMittal retains a Zacks #4 Rank (Sell) and we have recently downgraded our long-term recommendation from Neutral to Underperform.
"
313,ARNC,"The steel industry had been severely affected by the global economic crisis. However, there were signs of a turnaround from the second half of 2009 which continued into 2010 and 2011 at tandem with global economic activity. Demand for steel products nonetheless remains below pre-recession levels. We expect the recovery to be slow and steady in 2012.
"
314,ARNC,"The steel companies expect volumes to improve in 2012 on recovering demand from improving end-markets, backed by a recuperating global economy. They expect operating results to significantly improve from 2011 levels mainly driven by improved average realized prices and higher shipments. Steel consumption is expected to grow in the automotive, transportation, energy, industrial, and the agricultural sectors.
"
315,ARNC,"The automotive and construction markets have historically been the largest consumers of steel. The automotive sector is showing significant promise. In February 2012, total motor vehicle sales reached the highest level since February 2008 at 15.1 million SAAR (Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rate). For the first two months of 2012, sales have averaged 14.6 million SAAR, outperforming the Street expectations.
"
316,ARNC,"The construction sector has been a drag on the steel companies’ earnings. However, we see some early signs of recovery in non-residential construction.
"
317,ARNC,"According to the American Institute of Architects, the architecture billings index, an economic indicator that provides an approximately nine to twelve month glimpse into the future of non-residential construction spending activity, was 50.9 in January 2012. The index has remained over 50 for the third consecutive month, a sure indicator of an overall rise in demand.
"
318,ARNC,"The optimism is seen across most regions of the country and the major construction sectors. However, given the continued uncertainty in the market, we expect soft to very moderate near-term growth in demand in this sector.
"
319,ARNC,"According to the data released by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, housing starts increased 1.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 699,000 in January 2012 from December 2011 and 9.9% above January 2011.
"
320,ARNC,"Building permits in January were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 676,000, 0.7% above the December figure of 671,000 and 19% above the January 2011 number. These figures provide a glimmer of hope that U.S. residential construction is finally on a road to recovery.
"
321,ARNC,"Based on expected economic growth from developing countries like China, India and South Korea, steel prices will be pushed up higher in the future. However, the European debt crisis and its potential global impact remain an overhang on the steel industry.
"
322,ARNC,"Given the scenario in Europe, ArcelorMittal has idled 5 of its 25 blast furnaces in Europe. The company will continue to align its steel growth projects to match demand situations. Furthermore, the company’s focus on its mining business given its more attractive returns has resulted in some planned steel investments being deferred.Gold
"
323,ARNC,"As per the World Gold Council reports, 2011 was a milestone year for gold as global demand for the yellow metal grew 0.4% to 4,067.1 tons at an estimated value of $205.5 billion -- the highest tonnage level with a value exceeding $200 billion since 1997. The increase was mainly propelled by the investment sector, particularly in India, China and Europe.
"
324,ARNC,"Mine production increased 4% year over year to a record level of 2809.5 tons. However, there was a decline noted in recycling activity as consumers held on to their gold in the expectation of even higher prices. Central banks purchases rose significantly to 440 tons from 77 tons in the prior year reflecting the need to diversify assets, reduce reliance on one or two foreign currencies and rebalance reserves. Central banks have been net buyers for three straight years, the longest stretch since 1973.
"
325,ARNC,"Demand for gold bars and coins were robust due to the concerns raging in Europe, inflation in some countries and the unsatisfactory performance of a range of alternative instruments. The ongoing crisis in Europe has positively affected the demand for gold given the need for asset protection.
"
326,ARNC,"Jewelry demand was particularly strong in the first half of 2011 driven by the two major markets, China and India, due to the timing of local festivals. China and India remain the major consumers of gold, generating 55% of global jewelry demand and 49% of global demand. However, record prices in September combined with price volatility deviated customers towards other investment products.
"
327,ARNC,"On the whole, a 28% increase in average annual price led to an annual decline of 3% in tonnage demand in fiscal 2011. Notwithstanding this, annual demand was a record $99.2 billion.
"
328,ARNC,"Gold demand in the technology sector was at 463.5 tons worth $23.4 billion, a 28% increase year over year. Particular strength was noted in automotive electronics, industrial electronics and wireless equipment segments. However, the memory sector weakened considerably and is expected to remain so in 2012 as well. Severe flooding in Thailand which affected hard disk drive shipments, ongoing turmoil in Europe, and shift toward other non-precious metals also contributed to the weakness.
"
329,ARNC,"Gold prices in 2011 ranged from a low of $1,310 per ounce to a high of $1,895 per ounce. The record gold price of $1,895 per ounce was attained in September, 33% higher than the 2010 peak of $1,421 per ounce recorded in November 2010. Average gold price was $1,572 per ounce in 2011 compared with the prior year average of $1,223 per ounce.  
"
330,ARNC,"So far in 2012, gold has ranged from $1,598 per ounce to $1,781 per ounce, with an average of $1,698 per ounce. Continuing concerns about Europe's financial problems and China’s reduced economic growth forecast led to the climb. Given the performance in 2011, and thus far in 2012, we expect his year to be stellar for the yellow metal.
"
331,ARNC,"Gold remains a coveted asset given its long-term supply and demand dynamics and influenced by macro-economic factors. Concerns regarding economic growth in developed countries made gold an attractive and safe investment option. The European sovereign debt crisis made European investors use gold as a currency hedge. Pressure on the US dollar against various currencies coupled with higher inflation expectations in many countries, including India and China, pushed up gold prices.
"
332,ARNC,"The value and wealth preservation attributes of gold continue to attract investors and consumers. Jewelry and investment demand in non-western markets continues to rebound while industrial demand has started to recover in response to an improvement in economic conditions. India, which alone consumes nearly 45%−50% of the world gold production, should drive demand for gold along with China. China will likely emerge as the largest gold market in the world in 2012 and Chinese gold demand is expected to double in 10 years.
"
333,ARNC,"Higher prices bode well for gold producers, which should benefit giants such as Barrick Gold Corporation (ABX), Agnico-Eagle (AEM  -  Free Report) and Goldcorp Inc. (GG  -  Free Report). However, gold producers like Newmont Mining (NEM  -  Free Report) and Kinross Gold Corporation (KGC  -  Free Report) suffer from lower ore grades that subdue production levels, increase mining costs and negate the benefits of rising gold prices.
"
334,ARNC,"Ironically, rallying gold prices are not having the same effect on the share prices of the gold companies. This is reflected in our overall long-term neutral view on the space. Investors prefer alternative financial products that allow them to invest in gold rather than investing in gold companies per se that are grappling with labor issues, escalating cost and other risks.
"
335,ARNC,"As the major economies continue to recover, investor confidence in the stock markets will be restored, causing gold prices to fall. In reality this is not going to happen anytime soon. The stocks of Barrick Gold, Newmont Mining, Goldcorp and Kinross Gold Corporation retain a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold). However, Agnico Eagle holds a Zacks #5 Rank (Strong Sell).Aluminum
"
336,ARNC,"The aluminum industry is highly cyclical, with prices subject to worldwide supply and demand forces along with other influences. The global economic downturn had a drastically negative impact on the aluminum industry, leading to an unprecedented decline in LME-based aluminum prices, weak end markets, fall in demand, increased global inventories, and higher costs of borrowing and diminished credit availability. The sector has however recovered from recessionary lows.Alcoa Inc. (AA), the world leader in the production and management of primary aluminum, in response to the global economic downturn implemented a number of operational and financial actions to improve its cost structure and liquidity, including curtailing production, halting non-critical capital expenditures, accelerating new sourcing strategies for raw materials, divesting non-core assets, reducing global headcount, suspending its share repurchase program, reducing its quarterly common stock dividend and resorting to other liquidity enhancements.
"
337,ARNC,"For fiscal 2011, Alcoa reported adjusted earnings of 72 cents per share, reversing the year-ago loss of 3 cents per share. The company anticipates that global aluminum demand will go up 7% and burgeoning demand for aluminum along with market-related production cutbacks will lead to a global aluminum industry deficit of 600,000 metric tons in 2012.
"
338,ARNC,"Aluminium demand started on a strong note in 2011 but weakened in the second half. Overall, aluminium demand grew 10% in the year after 13% growth witnessed in 2010. Overall, Alcoa believes that the long-term prospects for aluminum remain bright and envisions that global demand for aluminum will double by 2020.
"
339,ARNC,"Market conditions for aluminum products are expected to improve globally, particularly in aerospace (10–11%), driven by rising demand for large commercial aircraft. The strong performance at the automotive sector in the fourth quarter is expected to sustain in 2012, growing at en estimated clip of 3–5%. Commercial transportation is expected to grow 2–5%, packaging in the range of 2–3% and building and construction markets in the band of 4–5%.
"
340,ARNC,"Region-wise, in 2012, China is expected to lead the pack with a growth of 12% followed shortly by India with a 10% rise. Asia (excluding China) is expected to record a growth of 9% and North America 3%. Russia and Brazil are expected to increase 4% and 3%, respectively. Europe, besieged by sovereign debt problems, is expected to remain flat year over year.
"
341,ARNC,"Since the sudden decline from peak prices in mid-2008, aluminum prices have subsequently increased. In 2010, global aluminum prices rose 13%. However, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, aluminum prices plunged 27% from peak levels in April 2011. This was perpetrated by market concerns that the eurozone debt crisis could affect the global manufacturing industry and would lead to a huge downside in metals demand.
"
342,ARNC,"Consequently, profits for the mining companies took a blow compelling them to cut back on production. Rio Tinto announced plans to sell its aluminium assets and close its smelter in order to cut costs.
"
343,ARNC,"Alcoa plans to close or curtail 531,000 metric tons, or approximately 12% of its global smelting capacity, in the first half of 2012. This will lower the company’s cost position by 10 percentage points and improve its competitiveness. Energy prices and other input costs are expected to pose challenges for the aluminum industry. In addition to the curtailments, the company will step up actions to reduce the escalating cost of raw materials.
"
344,ARNC,"In the medium to long term, aluminum consumption will improve globally with revival palpable in the automotive and packaging industries, one of the key consumer markets. Aluminum is widely used for packaging, beverage cans, food containers and foil products.
"
345,ARNC,"The automobile market is also becoming increasingly aluminum intensive, benefiting from the recyclability and the light weight of the metal. Further, the surge in copper price this year is triggering a switch among manufacturers to aluminum. Automobiles, air conditioners and industrial components manufacturers are now shifting their focus on the more economical aluminum.
"
346,ARNC,"We expect aluminum demand to increase over the next three years, outstripping supply growth. As a result, the aluminum market is likely to see deficits for a prolonged period. This provides a backdrop supportive of high alumina and aluminum prices. China and India are undergoing rapid industrialization.
"
347,ARNC,"Both these factors are positive for underlying aluminum demand. Leading aluminum producers such as Alcoa and Aluminum Corporation of China  should benefit from the improving demand outlook.
"
348,ARNC,"Currently, both Alcoa and Aluminum Corporation of China hold a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) supported by our long-term Neutral recommendation.Copper
"
349,ARNC,"Copper has become a major industrial metal given its properties of high ductility, malleability, and thermal and electrical conductivity, and its resistance to corrosion. In terms of consumption, it ranks third after iron and aluminum. Construction is the single largest market, followed by electronics and electronic products, transportation, industrial machinery, and consumer and general products.
"
350,ARNC,"Copper is an internationally traded commodity, and its prices are determined by the major metals exchanges – the London Metal Exchange (LME), New York Mercantile Exchange (COMEX) and Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE). Prices on these exchanges reflect the global balance of copper supply and demand, which can be volatile and cyclical.
"
351,ARNC,"Copper prices were at high levels from 2006 through most of 2008 as limited supplies, combined with growing demand from China and other emerging economies, resulted in high copper prices and low levels of inventories.
"
352,ARNC,"In December 2008 copper prices dipped to a low of $1.26 per pound due to reduced consumption, turbulence in the U.S. financial markets and concerns about the global economy. However, copper prices have since improved from the 2008 lows, thanks to strong demand from emerging markets and limited supply.
"
353,ARNC,"During the past three years, copper prices have fluctuated with LME spot copper prices ranging from $1.38 to $4.60 per pound. During 2011, LME spot copper prices ranged from $3.08 per pound to a record high of $4.60 per pound, with an average of $4.00 per pound. This rising trend has benefited copper producers like Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX  -  Free Report) and Southern Copper Corporation (SCCO  -  Free Report).
"
354,ARNC,"Not denying volatility in prices, which would always be there, we have a bullish stance on copper prices, long term. Prices will be influenced by demand from China, economic activity in the U.S. and other industrialized countries, the timing of new supplies of copper and production levels of mines and copper smelters.
"
355,ARNC,"The outlook for the copper business remains positive, supported by widespread use of copper, limited supplies from existing mines and the absence of significant new development projects. Companies that have a high leverage to copper prices will benefit immensely from the potential demand for the metal in the developing markets.
"
356,ARNC,"Freeport and Southern Copper retain a Zacks #3 Rank in agreement with our Neutral recommendation on the shares.                    
"
357,ARNC,"With nothing major on the economic calendar and the earnings season still some days off despite Alcoa’s (AA) report after the close on Monday, stocks will likely sustain the soft upward bias of the last few trading sessions. Alcoa’s results had a reassuring aspect in that they were less bad relative to their guidance some time back. The relatively less-dire demand outlook for aluminum will likely rub off on other commodity producers in today’s trading session.
"
358,ARNC,"Beyond the U.S. shores, we have Chinese international trade data for December showing a softening domestic demand environment, improving the odds of further monetary easing measures. The December exports numbers came inline with expectations, while imports came in weaker than expected. The full-year 2011 trade surplus figure was the lowest in the last seven years. When viewed in combination with the rebound in December PMI, it appears that the economy is stabilizing and will likely get a soft landing.
"
359,ARNC,"Among corporate pre-announcements, Juniper Networks (JNPR  -  Free Report) and Liz Claiborne (LIZ) lowered guidance, while Cirrus Logic (CRUS  -  Free Report) raised its outlook for the quarter. Emulex (EMLX) also raised guidance citing its ability to get back to full capacity after being affected by the Thai floods.RELATED ARTICLESQ4 Earnings Could Be LightA Slow Week to Bring Back Euro Concerns?Small Caps Lag, For Now
"
360,ARNC,"Stocks were a lot less enthusiastic to last week’s labor market reports than would otherwise have been expected, likely reflecting lingering concerns about Europe. The going is expected to be even tougher this week as the economic calendar is relatively thin and the fourth quarter reporting season just gets underway. This means that Europe will remain in the spotlight, with headlines from the region moving the market.
"
361,ARNC,"The only notable economic report this week is the December Retail Sales reading on Thursday. Other than that, we will have International Trade data on Friday and the Jobless Claims numbers on Thursday. The fourth quarter reporting season gets underway with Alcoa’s (AA) results after the close today. But the only other notable earnings report the rest of this week is from J.P. Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report) on Friday.
"
362,ARNC,"Earnings expectations remain quite low at this stage, reflecting the maturity of the earnings cycle, developments in Europe and the slowdown in China and other emerging markets. With aggregate margins reaching prior cyclical peak levels and top-line gains getting difficult to come by given the tougher nominal global growth backdrop, the growth numbers for the fourth quarter are expected to be much lower than what we have been seeing thus far in this earnings cycle. 
"
363,ARNC,"In corporate news, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report) is acquiring Inhibitex (INHX), the developer of hepatitis-C, for $2.5 billion in cash. The all-cash offer works out to a very generous 163% premium to Inhibitex’s Friday closing price. Shares of Idenix Pharmaceuticals (IDIX) are also expected to be in the spotlight after the company announced positive results from its hepatitis C clinical trial.RELATED ARTICLESDo Alcoa's Earnings Even Matter?Small Caps Lag, For NowIs the Breakout Official?
"
364,ARNC,"Earnings Preview 1/6/12
"
365,ARNC,"There will only be a handful of firms reporting this week, even though it is considered the kickoff of the earnings season when Alcoa reports. A total of just 27 firms are scheduled to report, including 4 of the S&P 500. While few in number, some of the reports come from firms that are highly significant in that they will give clues to the overall direction of earnings in the fourth quarter.
"
366,ARNC,"The firms reporting next week include: Alcoa (AA), J.P. Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Lennar (LEN  -  Free Report) and Supervalu (SVU  -  Free Report).
"
367,ARNC,"It will also be a fairly light week for economic data, particularly early in the week. We get Consumer Credit on Monday and the Fed releases its Beige Book on Wednesday. Thursday brings the Initial Jobless Claims data as well as Retail Sales. We learn about the Budget Deficit on Thursday and the Trade Deficit on Friday.
"
368,ARNC,"Monday
"
369,ARNC,"Consumer Credit, not including real estate backed loans like mortgages is expected to have risen by $7.0 billion in November, down slightly from the $7.6 billion rise in October. Since the onset of the Great Recession growth of consumer credit has been very low, but is starting to show signs of picking up again.Tuesday
"
370,ARNC,"Nothing of significance as far as data is concerned. All eyes will turn towards the Granite State as New Hampshire holds the first primary of the election season.Wednesday
"
371,ARNC,"The Fed releases its January Beige Book, a compilation of mostly anecdotal evidence on the state of the economy from the twelve Fed districts. It will probably indicate slow but steady expansion in the economy and very little in the way of inflation pressure.Thursday
"
372,ARNC,"Weekly Initial Claims for Unemployment Insurance have been plunging. Last week they dropped by 15,000 to 372,000. That is comfortably below the key 400,000 level (that they were above two weeks ago). The consensus is looking for them to bounce back to 385,000 this week. A rebound after such a big drop is reasonable to expect as this does not tend to move in a straight line. Even that big a rebound would not be terrible news, as it would indicate that the last two weeks of declines were not a fluke. The 400,000 level is important in that it has historically been the inflection point, below which we tend to create enough jobs to bring down the unemployment rate. The week-to-week numbers can be very volatile, so the four-week average is the thing to focus on (372,250 last week). Keep an eye on the prior week’s revision as well as the change from the revised number.
"
373,ARNC,"Continuing Jobless Claims have been in a downtrend of late, but the road down has been bumpy. Last week they fell by 22,000 to 3.595 million. That is down 532,000, or 12.9% from a year ago. The consensus is looking for a further decline to 3.588 million. Some (most?) of the longer-term decline is due to people simply exhausting their regular state benefits which run out after 26 weeks. Those, however, don’t last forever either. Federally paid extended claims rose by 5,000 to 3.503 million last week but are down 1.033 million, or 22.8% over the last year. Looking at just the regular continuing claims numbers is a serious mistake. They only include a little over half of the unemployed now, given the unprecedentedly high duration of unemployment figures. A better measure is the total number of people getting unemployment benefits -- currently at 7.223 million. The total number of people getting benefits is now 1.565 million below year-ago levels. What is not known is how many people have left the extended claims via the road to prosperity -- finding a new job -- and how many have left on the road to poverty, having simply exhausted even the extended benefits. Unless the program is renewed, all extended benefits will end in January. Make sure to look at both sets of numbers! Many of the press reports will not, but we will here at Zacks.
"
374,ARNC,"Retail Sales are expected to rise by 0.4% in December, up from a 0.2% rise in November. If Auto sales are stripped out the rise is also expected to be 0.4% up from 0.2%. This data is adjusted for seasonal variations like the number of shopping days, but not for price changes. Thus if the rise is due to increased sales at gas stations it is not really good news.
"
375,ARNC,"The Budget Deficit for December will be announced. The deficit is highly seasonal but the data is not seasonally adjusted, so it is best to look at it relative to the year-ago level. The month-to-month change can be highly misleading. So far in fiscal 2012 (started in October) the budget deficit is down 18.9% from the first two months of fiscal 2011. Given the absolute hysteria about the budget deficit earlier in the year, one might have expected that news to have been mentioned somewhere. Last December, the Federal Government spilled $78.1 billion of red ink. I suspect the number this year will be closer to $70 billion.Friday
"
376,ARNC,"The Trade Deficit is expected to rise to $44.3 billion in November from $43.5 billion in October. In general, the country has been doing a good job of increasing its exports, but imports also continue to rise. Over half of our trade deficit is due to our addiction to imported oil. The Trade deficit is what is responsible for our being in debt to the rest of the world, not the budget deficit. An increasing trade deficit directly lowers economic growth. As such I consider the trade deficit to be a much more important economic problem than the budget deficit is.
"
377,ARNC,"The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment index for January is expected to rise to 71.0 from 69.9. That is up off the lows of the summer, but still very depressed by any historical standard. Personally I think this is one of the most over rated economic statistics around, since what consumers say in the survey is often very different that what they actually do. Still, better seeing it go up than down.Potential Positive or Negative Surprises
"
378,ARNC,"The best indicators of firms likely to report positive surprises are a recent history of positive surprises and rising estimates going into the report. The Zacks Rank is also a good indicator of potential surprises. Similarly, a recent history of earnings disappointments, cuts in the average estimate for the quarter in the month before the report is due and a poor Zacks Rank (#4 or #5) are often red flags pointing to a potential disappointing earnings report.

"
380,ARNC,"Overview
"
381,ARNC,"The Metals & Mining industry encompasses the extraction (mining) as well as the primary and secondary processing of metals and minerals such as aluminum, gold, precious metals, coal and steel. The industry is oligarchic in structure, with a few producers accounting for the lion's share of the output.
"
382,ARNC,"The largest segment of the global metals market is iron and steel followed by aluminum. The iron and steel segment comprises more than half the industry in terms of volume. This industry includes metal ore exploration and mining services, as well as iron and steel foundries for smelting, rolling, forging, spinning, recycling, stamping, polishing and plating of iron and steel products, such as pipes, tubes, wire, spring, rolls and bars.
"
383,ARNC,"The precious metal and mineral industry consists of companies engaged in the extraction and primary processing of gold, silver, platinum, diamond, semi-precious stones, uranium and other rare minerals and ores.
"
384,ARNC,"Historically, the automotive and construction markets have been the largest consumers of metals, accounting for more than 50% of total demand. Other metal consumers include energy, electrical equipment, agricultural, domestic and commercial equipment and industrial machinery. Large automakers such as General Motors Company (GM), Ford Motor Co. (F), Toyota Motor Corp (TM) and Honda Motor Co. Ltd (HMC) are large consumers of metals, especially steel and aluminum.Overall Outlook
"
385,ARNC,"The global metal industry is cyclical, highly competitive and has historically been characterized by overcapacity (excess of supply over-demand). Metal producers are subject to cyclical fluctuations in London Metal Exchange prices, general economic conditions and end-use markets. Individual company profitability depends on volume and operating efficiency. Large producers with huge resources are able to discover and develop new deposits, thereby boosting reserves, while the smaller ones devote their attention to fewer mines.
"
386,ARNC,"Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) have historically been a critically important growth strategy for mining companies. The year 2009 experienced a lull in M&A activity under the impact of the global economic downturn, with a deal value almost half that of 2008. The focus of M&A activity shifted from being a driver of growth to that of defense, as companies looked to safeguard their teetering balance sheets rather than seeking expansion.
"
387,ARNC,"In 2010, fairly unpredictable financial markets dictated metals prices, despite strong underlying fundamentals. In addition, several notable mining accidents have made mine safety a major factor for the industry and regulators. Despite the volatility, gold prices rose 400% over the past ten years and made a record run in 2010, increasing 26% and hitting a high of $1,432 an ounce.
"
388,ARNC,"The year 2011 has been unstable for metals so far, with double-digit gold sell-offs and rallies during the first quarter. However, investors remain cautiously optimistic regarding the sector. Many analysts predict metal prices will end the year with double-digit growth considering demand is still outstripping supply.
"
389,ARNC,"Unrest in the Middle East is also driving metal prices. On the down side, the end of the Fed's QE2 program and overall atmosphere of greater focus on fiscal restraint may limit significant gains.
"
390,ARNC,"In an industry plagued with rising energy and raw material costs, increasing productivity and reducing costs are the keys to success. Given the cyclical nature of the metals industry, low-volume, and high-cost producers need to generate sufficient cash or ensure a strong borrowing position during market peaks to survive the market troughs.
"
391,ARNC,"Continuing consolidation supports the sector's ability to influence the cost of inputs and companies can also obtain synergies and economies of scale through the operation of vertically integrated raw materials sources. Expansion in low-cost countries will ensure lower labor costs and also help tap their growth potential.
"
392,ARNC,"Geographically, the Asia-Pacific region -- in particular China and India -- is witnessing higher production and consumption of metals. Per capita consumption levels in both these countries are calibrating to U.S./European levels, which could, theoretically at least, double metal demand in the longer term. China is the world's largest consumer of metals and is expected to remain so.
"
393,ARNC,"Further, developed regions such as the US and Europe are showing signs of recovery, albeit at a moderate pace. Overall, we expect global metal demand to improve in the long term with the recovery of user industries.
"
394,ARNC,"Demand as well as production for industrial metals in Japan has been recently affected as factories have been shut in the aftermath of the country's earthquake and Tsunami. Japan is the biggest buyer of aluminum and the second largest buyer of copper ore. We, however, believe that metal demand will be boosted by the construction industry triggered by the country's reconstruction efforts.Detailed Look into Metals
"
395,ARNC,"Steel
"
396,ARNC,"As the major shareholder (about 60%) of the metals market, the steel industry was severely bruised by the global economic downturn. However, according to the World Steel Association, world crude steel production in 2010 reached a record 1,414 million metric tons (mmt), an increase of 15% compared with 2009. All the major steel-producing countries and regions showed double-digit growth in 2010. In September 2011, the world crude steel production was 124 mmt, an increase of 9.7% from September 2010.
"
397,ARNC,"China's crude steel production in September 2011 was 56.7 mmt, up 16.5% from September 2010.
"
398,ARNC,"Elsewhere in Asia, Japan produced 8.9 mmt of crude steel in September 2011, down 3.8% year over year. South Korea's crude steel production in September 2011 was 5.5 mmt, up 17.7% from September 2010.
"
399,ARNC,"In the EU (European Union), Germany's crude steel production in September 2011 was 3.7 mmt, up 10.3% from September 2010. Italy produced 2.6 mmt of crude steel, up 11.5%. France produced 1.3 mmt of crude steel, up 4.2%.
"
400,ARNC,"Turkey produced 3.0 mmt of crude steel in September 2011, 16.9% higher than September 2010.
"
401,ARNC,"The US produced 7.2 mmt of crude steel in September 2011, up 8.9% from September 2010.
"
402,ARNC,"Brazilian crude steel production for September 2011 was 2.8 mmt, 3.8% higher than September 2010.
"
403,ARNC,"The World Steel Association provided its Short Range Outlook (SRO) for 2011 and 2012. World Steel forecasts that apparent steel use will increase by 6.5% to 1,398 mmt in 2011, following a growth rate of 15.1% in 2010. In 2012, it is forecast that world steel demand will grow further by 5.4%.
"
404,ARNC,"China's apparent steel use in 2011 is expected to increase by 7.5% to 643.2 mmt following an 8.5% growth rate in 2010. In 2012, steel demand is expected to maintain a 6.0% growth rate, which will bring China's apparent steel use to 681.6 mmt.
"
405,ARNC,"In 2011, India's steel use is forecast to grow by 4.3% to reach 67.7 mmt. In 2012, the growth rate is forecast to accelerate to 7.9%.
"
406,ARNC,"Apparent steel use in the US is forecast to rebound strongly by 11.6% in 2011. In 2012, steel use in the US is expected to grow by 5.2% to 93.8 mmt, bringing it back to 87% of the 2007 level. For NAFTA as a whole, apparent steel use will grow by 9.0% and 4.9% in 2011 and 2012 respectively.
"
407,ARNC,"In Central and South America, apparent steel use is forecast to grow by 4.7 % in 2011 to reach a historical high of 47.8 mmt. In 2012, the region's apparent steel use is forecast to grow by 9.8% to reach 52.4 mmt, almost 28% higher than the 2007 level.
"
408,ARNC,"European countries continued to show divergent recovery paths in 2011. While steel demand in Germany and Poland are expected to grow at impressive rates, steel demand in Spain, by contrast, is expected to record a sluggish 1.7% recovery.
"
409,ARNC,"Overall, apparent steel use in the EU is projected to increase by 7.0% in 2011 to 155.0 mmt. In 2012, the growth of steel demand is expected to stall in most of the European countries with the notable exception of Poland which is forecast to post an impressive 9.5% growth. Overall, apparent steel use in the EU is forecast to grow by 2.5% to around 158.9 mmt in 2012, bringing it back to only 80% of the 2007 peak.
"
410,ARNC,"Japan's steel use is expected to decline by 2.7% to 61.8 mmt in 2011 due mainly to the disruptions caused by the earthquake. In 2012 apparent steel use in Japan is forecast to show a growth of 0.8% to reach 62.3 mmt, 77% of the 2007 level.
"
411,ARNC,"In the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS, consisting of Russia and 10 other former Soviet Union republics), apparent steel use is forecast to grow by a strong 14.4% in 2011 and then by 7.5% in 2012. These projections will bring the region's apparent steel use in 2012 to almost 60 mmt, a new high for the region.
"
412,ARNC,"Steel demand in Middle East-North Africa (MENA) region is expected to fall by 0.9% in 2011, mainly due to downward revisions from North African countries. However, boosted by high oil prices, steel use in the region is forecast to resume growth in 2012 at a rate of 8.7%. Given that the political situation in the region is far from settled, considerable uncertainties hold out a threat to the current forecasts for this region.
"
413,ARNC,"In the third quarter 2011, sales of ArcelorMittal (MT  -  Free Report), the world's largest steel-producing company, increased 22.6% year over year to $24.2 billion from $19.7 billion in the year-ago quarter but decreased 3.6% sequentially from $25.1 billion. Sales were down sequentially primarily due to lower average steel selling prices (-1.7%) and lower volume of shipments (-4.9%). Total steel shipments in the third quarter of 2011 were 21.1 million metric tons compared with 20.5 million metric tons in the year-ago quarter.
"
414,ARNC,"Similarly, sales for U.S. Steel Corp. (X  -  Free Report) improved 13% year over year to $5.1 billion from $4.5 billion, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.1 billion. Shipments totaled 5.5 million tons, and were down by 0.8% year over year.Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report) sales surged 27% year over year to $5.25 billion beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.86 billion. The growth was attributable to an increase of 24% in average price per ton and a rise of 3% in shipments (to 5.8 million tons) to outside customers. Steel mill shipments grew 9% to 4.2 million tons during the quarter.
"
415,ARNC,"Currently, Nucor has a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) for the short-term (1 to 3 months) while U.S. Steel holds a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold). ArcelorMittal currently retains a Zacks Rank #5 Rank (Strong Sell). We maintain our Outperform recommendation in the long term for ArcelorMittal and U.S. Steel, while we maintain a long-term Neutral recommendation on Nucor.Gold
"
416,ARNC,"As per the World Gold Council, gold prices rose for the tenth consecutive year in 2010, reflecting recovery in key sectors of demand and continued global economic uncertainty. In 2010, gold prices jumped 29%, reaching $1,405 per ounce as of the end of December.
"
417,ARNC,"During 2010, the price of gold rose to record levels on several occasions, trading as high as $1,432 per ounce. Gold's performance was strong and volatility remained low. The World Gold Council suggests that the increase was not only driven by inflationary forces but was also inflated as both the private and public sectors of India and China rushed into the gold market.
"
418,ARNC,"Gold demand went up 9% over 2009, showcasing a 10-year high of 3,912.2 tons, driven by the rise in jewelry demand, the revival of the Indian market and strong momentum in Chinese gold demand. Moreover, central banks became net purchasers of gold for the first time in 21 years, hiking the demand for the yellow metal.
"
419,ARNC,"Major demand came from India and China. India bought 746 tons, a 69% increase over 2009, and China bought 400 tons of gold jewelry. China bought 179.9 tons of gold in the form of bars and coin, a 70% increase over 2009.
"
420,ARNC,"Global gold demand in the second quarter of 2011 totaled 919.8 tons, down 17% from the remarkably strong levels of 1,107 tons in the second quarter of 2010. Gold demand in value terms grew by 5% year-on-year reaching $44.5 billion up from $42.6 billion in the second quarter of 2010. This is the second highest quarterly value on record, only fractionally below the $44.7 billion record that occurred in the fourth quarter in 2010.
"
421,ARNC,"The quarterly average gold price rose by 26%, reaching a record high of $1,506.13 (as per the London PM fix).
"
422,ARNC,"Second quarter 2011 global investment demand was 359.4 tons, 37% down year-on-year from 574.2 tons in the second quarter in 2010, which was the second highest quarter ever.
"
423,ARNC,"Demand for gold bars and coins totaled 307.7 tons during the second quarter of 2011, a gain of 9% over year-earlier levels of 282.6 tons. In value terms, bar and coin demand was worth $14.9 billion, an increase of 37% from $10.9 billion in the second quarter of 2010.
"
424,ARNC,"Jewelry demand in the second quarter of 2011 was 442.5 tons, 6% higher than the year-earlier levels of 416.7 tons. In value terms, this represented a 34% increase to $21.4 billion from $16.0 billion in the same quarter last year. India, China and Turkey together accounted for 59% of global jewelry demand at 260.1 tons in the second quarter of 2011 and registered a combined growth of 36.1 tons on year-earlier levels.
"
425,ARNC,"Gold supply was 1,058.7 tons in the second quarter of 2011, which was a 4% decline from 1,108.3 tons in the same period in 2010, as a result of an increase in net purchasing by central banks. Mine production rose by 7% to 708.8 tons from year-earlier levels of 659.4 tons in 2010.
"
426,ARNC,"Gold remains a coveted asset given its long-term supply and demand dynamics and influenced by macro-economic factors. Concerns regarding economic growth in developed countries made gold an attractive and safe investment option. The European sovereign debt crisis made European investors use gold as a currency hedge. Pressure on the US dollar against various currencies coupled with higher inflation expectations in many countries, including India and China, also pushed up gold prices.
"
427,ARNC,"The value and wealth preservation attributes of gold continue to attract investors and consumers. Jewelry and investment demand in non-Western markets continues to rebound while industrial demand has started to recover in response to an improvement in economic conditions. India, which alone consumes nearly 45-50% of the world gold production, should drive demand for gold along with China. Chinese gold demand is expected to double in 10 years. As China and India continue to grow
"
428,ARNC,"rapidly, their demand for gold will also rise in tandem.
"
429,ARNC,"Higher prices bode well for gold producers, which should benefit giants such as Barrick Gold Corporation (ABX), Agnico-Eagle (AEM  -  Free Report) and Goldcorp Inc. (GG  -  Free Report). However, gold producers like Newmont Mining Corporation (NEM  -  Free Report) and Kinross Gold Corporation (KGC  -  Free Report) suffer from lower ore grades that subdue production levels, increase mining costs and offset the benefits of rising gold prices.
"
430,ARNC,"Overall, the stock prices of gold producers are not expected to benefit much from this favorable commodity-price backdrop. This is reflected in our overall long-term neutral views on the stocks. As major economies continue to recover, investors' confidence will be restored to invest in stock markets, which could cause gold prices to fall. However this is not going to happen in the near future. We have a Zacks #2 Rank (Buy) on Barrick Gold, Goldcorp and Kinross Gold Corporation and a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) on Agnico-Eagle and Newmont Mining.Aluminum
"
431,ARNC,"The aluminum industry is highly cyclical, relating to prices subject to worldwide supply and demand forces along with other influences. The global economic downturn had a historic, negative impact on the aluminum industry, leading to an unprecedented decline in LME-based aluminum prices, weak end markets, fall in demand, increased global inventories, higher costs of borrowing and diminished credit availability. The economy has, however, recovered from the crisis of the economic downturn.Alcoa Inc. (AA) is the world leader in the production and management of primary aluminum. In response to the global economic downturn, the company implemented a number of operational and financial actions to improve its cost structure and liquidity, including curtailing production, halting non-critical capital expenditures, accelerating new sourcing strategies for raw materials, divesting non-core assets, reducing global headcount, suspending its share repurchase program, reducing its quarterly common stock dividend and resorting to other liquidity enhancements.
"
432,ARNC,"In 2011, Alcoa plans to restart certain idled potlines at three smelters. These restarts are expected to increase Alcoa's aluminum production by 137 kmt during 2011 and by 200 kmt on an annual basis thereafter. Such measures are sure to meet anticipated growth in aluminum demand.
"
433,ARNC,"On September 15, 2011, Alcoa announced it will expand its Davenport, Iowa rolled products plant to meet rising demand from the automotive market. More and more automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are switching from steel to aluminum as they seek to increase the fuel efficiency, safety, durability and performance of the cars they produce.
"
434,ARNC,"The expansion will entail an investment of approximately $300 million. The growth project will create an additional 150 full time jobs in Davenport once completed, bringing total employment to more than 2,300 high-value jobs. In addition, during construction, an incremental 150 jobs will be created at the plant. The expansion is expected to be completed by the end of 2013.
"
435,ARNC,"Alcoa is expected to benefit from the improving outlook of aluminum and alumina prices. Alcoa continues to project that aluminum demand will grow 12% in 2011 versus 13% growth in 2010, well ahead of the 6.5% compound annual growth rate needed to double aluminum demand by 2020.
"
436,ARNC,"Increasing demand in China, where the company has raised its 2011 growth projection two-percentage points to 17%, will mostly offset declines in Europe and other regions. China and India are undergoing rapid industrialization.
"
437,ARNC,"Both these factors are positives for underlying aluminum demand. We expect aluminum demand to increase over the next three years, outstripping supply growth. As a result, the aluminum market is likely to see deficits for a prolonged period. This provides a backdrop supportive of high alumina and aluminum prices.
"
438,ARNC,"We are also optimistic about Alcoa's long-term growth projects in China, Australia, Jamaica, Suriname and Brazil. Demand from these countries is expected to increase its alumina and aluminum production capacity while lowering its operating costs. The company recently expanded its Alumar Refinery, north of Brazil, and doubled its annual capacity from 1.5 million tons to 3.6 million tons of alumina. Recently, Alcoa started production at its Aviles smelter in Spain under the Primary Metal segment. We expect such expansions to drive Alcoa's top line.
"
439,ARNC,"Alcoa reported adjusted earnings per share of 15 cents per share in the third quarter 2011, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 22 cents per share. Adjusted earnings more than doubled from 6 cents per share reported in the year ago quarter, but were 46.4% lower from the sequential quarter earnings of 28 cents per share due to lower metal prices, seasonal factors and weakness in Europe.
"
440,ARNC,"Revenues for the quarter were up 21% year over year to $6.419 billion, and were down from $6.585 billion in the sequential quarter. Alcoa's end-markets demonstrated strong revenue growth, on a year-over-year basis whereas sequentially they experienced mixed market conditions. Revenue was lower for both alumina and aluminum, down 5% and 1%, respectively, driven by lower alumina shipments and lower realized pricing in both businesses.
"
441,ARNC,"In the end-markets, revenue increased in commercial transportation (6%) and aerospace (2%), while declines were seen in automotive (7%), industrial products (6%), building and construction (5%), and packaging (4%).
"
442,ARNC,"Since the sudden decline from the peak prices in mid-2008, aluminum prices have increased over the last 2 years. In 2010, global aluminum prices increased 13%. Alcoa increased its fiscal 2010 profit on the back of higher prices and continued strengthening in most end markets. Aluminum Corporation of China, or Chalco  swung back to profit in 2010 after posting a loss in 2009, attributable to increased global aluminum prices.
"
443,ARNC,"In the medium-to-long term, aluminum consumption will improve globally with improving automotive and packaging industries, one of the key consumer markets. Aluminum is widely used for packaging, beverage cans, food containers and foil products. The automobile market is also becoming increasingly aluminum intensive, benefiting from the recyclability and the light weight of the metal.
"
444,ARNC,"Further, the surge in copper price this year is pushing manufacturers to switch to aluminum. Automobiles, air conditioners and industrial components manufacturers for example, are now shifting toward aluminum, which is more economical.
"
445,ARNC,"We expect aluminum demand to increase in the long term, outstripping supply growth with the improving end-markets. China and India are undergoing rapid industrialization. Both these factors are positive for underlying aluminum demand. Leading aluminum producers such as Alcoa, Paramount Gold and Silver Corporation (PZG  -  Free Report) and Aluminum Corporation of China should benefit from the improving demand outlook.
"
446,ARNC,"Currently, Alcoa holds a Zacks #5 Rank (Strong Sell) supported by our long-term Underperform recommendation, while Paramount Gold and Silver has a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold).Copper
"
447,ARNC,"Copper prices have shown a rising trend since 2010 benefiting copper producers like Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX  -  Free Report) and Southern Copper Corporation (SCCO  -  Free Report). Although copper demand was down 10% year over year in 2009, global copper demand has since been witnessing growth.
"
448,ARNC,"The Chinese demand for copper was still robust and imports of the metal were rebounding, which was supported by steady construction and infrastructure activity in the country. The improvement in copper prices would be supported by limited supply and increased demand from China.
"
449,ARNC,"Even though copper prices are close to their all-time highs, the outlook for copper prices remains favorable. Not denying the volatility in prices that are bound to remain, we have a bullish stance on copper prices, in the long term. However, as discussed earlier, manufacturers might now resort to aluminum as a substitute.
"
450,ARNC,"Market conditions are expected to be positive for copper in the next couple of years due to higher consumption of the metal in the developing nations. The companies that have a high leverage to copper prices will benefit immensely from the potential demand for the metal in the developing markets.
"
451,ARNC,"We currently have a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) and long-term Neutral recommendation on Freeport and a Zacks #5 Rank (Strong Sell) on Southern Copper.
"
452,ARNC,"With nothing major on the economic calendar today, the market will likely repeat Tuesday's performance and remain in a wait-and-see mode for the earnings season to unfold. We had a fairly disappointing start to this reporting cycle on Tuesday, but no one is reading too much into Alcoa's (AA) results. We have a handful of reports today, but it is still early-going on the earnings front. By the end of next week, we should have a good idea of how this season is unfolding. 
"
453,ARNC,"It is heartening to see that the market is able to see through the Slovak parliamentary failure and wait instead for the release of bank recapitalization rules from Germany and France later this month. A successful plan for ring-fencing the European banking sector will go a long way towards bringing down the heightened contagion fears. 
"
454,ARNC,"These fears, combined with a host of other issues, have been weighing on the financial services sector's fortunes for some time. And as if the going wasn't tough enough for the industry already, the announcement yesterday by U.S. regulators of the details of the long-awaited restrictions on proprietary trading, known as the Volcker Rule, adds to its woes. The new restrictions don't come into effect till July 2012, but are aimed at reducing the industry's risk profile. It will nevertheless have a material impact on the profitability of firms like J.P. Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) and Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report). 
"
455,ARNC,"Estimates for the profitability impact of the new rule vary, but could be in excess of $2 billion in revenue loss for the major firms. That is a non-trivial amount given all profitability headwinds the industry is faced with at present. We are seeing evidence of those headwinds in earnings expectations for the financial services industry, which have come down the most of any other sector the last month or so. 
"
456,ARNC,"As would be expected, the industry is against the Volcker Rule and trying hard to soften it up. My personal disdain for excessive regulation notwithstanding, I am not opposed to the Volcker Rule. It is better to be safe than sorry, and we all remember how sorry things had become in the fall of 2008.   
"
457,ARNC,"On the earnings front, Alcoa dropped the ball once again, coming short of expectations. This is not an encouraging start to the third quarter reporting cycle, but Alcoa's results practically tell us nothing about what to expect from the rest of the pack. In other earnings releases this morning, Pepsi (PEP  -  Free Report) came ahead of EPS expectations by a penny on a solid revenue beat. The company did not provide firm guidance for 2012, but reiterated to the keep snacks and beverages firm integrated.Host Hotels (HST  -  Free Report), formerly known as Host Marriott, the largest hotel REIT in the country, modestly came short of expectations. But results improved from the year-earlier level given improved occupancy and room rates.
"
458,ARNC,"We have seen quite a few strategic flip-flops from corporate America in recent days. Netflix's (NFLX  -  Free Report) recent moves are tailor made for business school case studies of what not to do. There is also word that tech titan Hewlett-Packard (HPQ  -  Free Report) is having second thoughts about shedding its PC business, as well.  RELATED ARTICLESWaiting for Earnings SeasonRecession Fears RecedingWhat to Expect from 3Q Earnings
"
459,ARNC,"The five-day old market rally appears to be stalling today on Europe-related news, this time concerning the legislative approval for expansion of the lending capacity of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF). In the latest of the national Euro-zone legislative approvals, parliament of the Slovak Republic is scheduled to vote on the EFSF, and the outcome of the vote is reportedly far from certain. 
"
460,ARNC,"But the suspense surrounding the Slovak vote is perhaps just an excuse for the market to take a breather. After all, the market has gained almost 9% in the last 5 trading sessions and no one would begrudge the market a pause after such a sprint. This is particularly so given the paucity of hard economic news today.
"
461,ARNC,"Except for the release of the minutes of the last Fed meeting later today, there isn't anything notable on the economic calendar. There is some interest in the Fed minutes, particularly the discussion surrounding the launch of Operation Twist, which may provide clues by the Fed's future course of action. 
"
462,ARNC,"The biggest event of the day is the start of the third quarter reporting cycle with the release of Alcoa's (AA) results after the market close. Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) will also be providing a quarterly update after the close today. Later this week, we get results from Pepsi (PEP  -  Free Report), Google (GOOG) and J.P. Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report). Estimates for Alcoa's quarterly earnings have been steadily coming down in recent weeks and currently remain roughly 26% below the level of just two months ago. Alcoa has produced a negative surprise in each of the last three quarters, but it may be able to reverse that trend today given the low expectations.
"
463,ARNC,"Alcoa's results may not tell us much about the health of overall corporate profitability, but a lot is riding on the quality of this earnings season. Of particular significance is the lack of conviction around current earnings expectations for the next four to six quarters. This is affecting investors' ability to arrive at a fair value for the market. The hope is that comments from management teams in this reporting cycle will lift the uncertainty surrounding earnings expectations, which would be a major positive for the market. RELATED ARTICLESRecession Fears RecedingWhat to Expect from 3Q EarningsRecapping Key Data Points
"
464,ARNC,"With the economic calendar on the thin side on Monday, stocks will likely reflect the positive momentum from last week's favorable run of economic data. The Europeans also appear to be making the right noises, with German and French leaders committing over the weekend to announce a bank recapitalization plan before the end of October. 
"
465,ARNC,"Relative to last week's busy economic schedule, we have few reports on the docket this week. Friday's Retail Sales report and Wednesday's Fed Minutes are the important ones. I would be looking for some momentum in the Retail Sales report given the recent positive showing on the chain-store sales front. In the Fed Minutes, discussions surrounding the launch of Operation Twist will be interesting and may provide clues for further easing measures. 
"
466,ARNC,"But irrespective of further monetary actions, the tone of recent economic readings has been positive, easing fears of a double-dip recession. These include Friday's jobs report, the positive construction data, the better-than-expected chain-store and light vehicle sales reports, and the two ISM readings. 
"
467,ARNC,"On the labor market front, not only did Friday's September non-farm payroll reading come ahead of expectations, but the prior two months' numbers were revised upwards, indicating that the situation may not have been as grim as initially feared. When looked at from the perspective of the need for bringing down the nation's huge numbers of unemployed, the Friday report was neither helpful nor encouraging. The report's value comes from its ability to help us assess the odds of a fresh recession for the U.S. economy. 
"
468,ARNC,"Viewed from that perspective, the Friday jobs report -- as well as the other recent economic readings -- was very positive. In an absolute sense, all recent economic readings have been soft and weak. But relative to fears of a recession, they are pointing towards a non-recessionary outlook. Bottom line: the U.S. economy remains weak, but it does not appear to be double dipping.    
"
469,ARNC,"Some early evidence of this non-recessionary tone of recent economic reports has started showing up in estimates for third quarter GDP growth rates. On Friday, Macroeconomic Advisors raised their estimate for third quarter GDP growth from 2% to 2.5%, citing the positive economic reports, particularly the construction data, retail sales and payrolls data. I would expect this trend in positive estimate revisions to gain pace in the coming days.  
"
470,ARNC,"In corporate news, Superior Energy Services (SPN  -  Free Report) is acquiring Complete Production Services (CPX) in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $2.7 billion. We also have word from AT&T (T  -  Free Report) indicating very strong demand for Apple's (AAPL  -  Free Report) new iPhone 4S. And we get the unofficial kick-off to the third quarter reporting season on Tuesday as Alcoa (AA) releases results after the market's close.

471,ARNC,"Earnings Preview 10/10/11
"
472,ARNC,"The third quarter earnings season “officially kicks off this week when Alcoa (AA) reports. It will be a slow start, with a total of just 38 companies reporting. Nine of those, however, are members of the S&P 500 and include some very significant companies, which should provide important clues as to how the overall earnings season will go.
"
473,ARNC,"In addition to Alcoa, the firms reporting during the week include: Google (GOOG), Host Hotels  (HST), JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), Mattel (MAT), PepsiCo (PEP) and Safeway (SWY). One relatively obscure company, Fastenal (FAST  -  Free Report), is also reporting. It is worth watching, since it is the biggest producer of fasteners -- literally the nuts and bolts of the economy. As such, it is a very important indicator of the overall health of the manufacturing economy.   
"
474,ARNC,"It will be a relatively light week for economic data. We start out with the minutes of the most recent Fed meeting. We also get news on both deficits -- Trade and Budget -- as well as Retail Sales.
"
475,ARNC,"MondayThe country celebrates the sailing of the Ocean Blue of Columbus in 1492. The stock market is open, but the bond market is closed. No major economic numbers due out.TuesdayThe minutes to the last (9/21) FOMC meeting are released. The Fed is deeply divided, as evident by three dissents in each of the last two meetings, which is highly unusual. The minutes should provide clues as to the thinking behind Operation Twist, and the likelihood to the Fed doing still more to get the economy moving again.WednesdayThe Job Openings and Labor Turnover, or JOLTs report, is released. It will show the actual number of Jobs created and lost in August, rather than the net number, which was released for September on Friday. It will also show the number of job openings in August. The will reveal the extent to which the very low net job creation in August (57,000 after Friday's revision) was due to people being laid off, or a lack of people being hired. For the last 18 months or so, the problem has been a lack of hiring.Thursday Weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance come out. They had a very nice decline early in the year, but have been recently in a trading range above 400,000. Last week they bounced back to 401,000 after a huge decline the week before. While the rise was not what we wanted to see, it was relatively small and showed that the week before had not been a fluke. Another small increase is anticipated this week, with initial claims expected to hit 406,000. The 400,000 level is important psychologically in that it has historically been the inflection point below which we tend to create enough jobs to bring down the unemployment rate. The four-week moving average will stay above the 400,000 level. The week-to-week numbers can be very volatile, so the four-week average is the thing to focus on. Keep an eye on the prior week’s revision as well as the change from the revised number. Continuing claims have in a downtrend of late, but the road down has been bumpy. Last week they fell by 52,000 to 3.700 million. That is down 752,000 from a year ago. I would expect a small decline this week. The consensus is looking for 3.700 million, or no change. Some (most?) of the longer-term decline due to people simply exhausting their regular state benefits, which run out after 26 weeks. Those, however, don’t last forever either. Federally paid extended claims fell by 28,000 last week to 3.552 million, and are down 1.584 million over the last year. Looking at just the regular continuing claims numbers is a serious mistake. They only include a little over half of the unemployed now, given the unprecedentedly high duration of unemployment figures. A better measure is the total number of people getting unemployment benefits, currently at 6.862 million, which is down 123,000 from last week (there are some timing issues, so the change in continuing and existing claims does not match the change in the total). The total number of people getting benefits is now 2.204 million below year-ago levels. What is not known is how many people have left the extended claims via the road to prosperity -- finding a new job -- and how many have left on the road to poverty -- having simply exhausted even their extended benefits. Unless the program is renewed (unlikely given the current Congress) then all extended benefits will end in January. Make sure to look at both sets of numbers! Many of the press reports will not, but we will here at Zacks.The trade deficit is expected to rise to $48.1 billion in August from $44.8 billion in July. While there is some lag in the numbers between quoted prices for oil and the price of imported oil, oil prices were generally lower in August than July. Since oil is responsible for over half of the overall trade deficit (including the surplus we tend to run in Services), that implies a big increase in our non-oil trade deficit. An increasing trade deficit is a direct drag on GDP growth, and the level of the trade deficit is an ongoing disaster. It's not the budget deficit that is directly responsible for our increasing indebtedness to the rest of the world. As such I consider it a far bigger economic problem, particularly in the short to medium term, than the budget deficit.The budget deficit for September and for the full 2011 fiscal year is released. The consensus is looking for $67 billion worth of red ink, up from $34.6 billion in September 2010. The budget deficit numbers are highly seasonal, but not seasonally adjusted, hence the month-to-month changes are highly misleading. Provided the September consensus is accurate, the budget deficit for fiscal 2011 should come in at $1.031 trillion, up slightly from 1.294 trillion in fiscal 2010.FridayRetail sales are expected to have risen by 0.6% in September after having been unchanged in August. This is a very broad-based measure of retail sales, including not just spending at the mall, but also at auto dealers and at restaurants as well. September was a strong month for auto sales as the supply constraints due to the Japanese disaster eased. Excluding autos, retail sales are expected to have risen by 0.3% after a rise of 0.1% in July.The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment index is expected to show a slight rise to 60.0 in October from 59.4 in September. That is still a very low level; in a healthy economy it would be over 90. However, while consumer confidence is theoretically very important -- consumer spending makes up 71% of the economy -- what people say in these surveys and what they actually do is often very different. As such, I find this to be an overrated economic indicator.

Top down estimates, $95.92 for 2011 and $103.98 for 2012.Second Quarter off to Strong Start
"
479,ARNC,"Second quarter earnings season ""officially"" got underway this week when Alcoa (AA) reported, followed by a handful of other big firms like J.P. Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report) and Google (GOOG).  However, last week's trickle will turn into a flood this week.
"
480,ARNC,"We now have 36 S&P 500 firms that have already reported their second quarter results.  We are off to a very strong start.  Those 36 firms posted total net income growth of 20.9% over a year ago.  That is down from the 33.6% growth that those same 36 firms posted in the first quarter.  The results were also much better than expected, with a median surprise of 5.18% and a 3.57 surprise ratio for earnings.  Top line results are also off to a very strong start, with 11.4% year over year growth for the 36, actually up from the 7.61% growth they posted in the first quarter.  If anything the top line surprises have been even better than the bottom line surprises, with a median surprise of 1.88% and a massive 6.20 surprise ratio.  In the early going though, the medians and surprise ratios can see very sharp fluctuations, so it is still a bit early to read too much into the results.
"
481,ARNC,"Financial to Blame for Slower Growth
"
482,ARNC,"For the vast majority (464) still to report, the rate of growth is expected to continue to slow dramatically in the second quarter, with total growth of 3.24%.  That is down very sharply from two weeks ago.  The blame for the decline is mostly due to the Financials, and specifically Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report).  BAC is taking a big hit for a settlement of some of its mortgage problems. Growth of 11.2% is expected if the financials are excluded, down from 19.9% in the first quarter.  I suspect that the actual growth will be somewhat higher than is now expected.  Normally about three times as many firms will report positive surprises as disappointments, and that in turn makes the initial growth projections very conservative.
"
483,ARNC,"Revenue growth for the remaining firms is also expected to slow, to 5.28% among those yet to report, down from 8.88% they reported in the first quarter.  Excluding the financials, growth is expected to slow to 8.84% from 11.93% in the first quarter.  Much of the strong revenue growth is coming from the commodity oriented Energy and Materials sectors.
"
484,ARNC,"Net Margins Still Expected to Expand
"
485,ARNC,"Net margins have been one of the keys to earnings growth, but we are starting to see some cracks in that story.  The 36 that have reported have net margins of 11.35%, up from 10.45% a year ago.  However, the remainder are expected to post net margins of 8.81% down from last year's 8.98.  Once again, the reason is the financials.  Excluding financials, the reported net margins are 9.27%, up from 8.57% last year.  For the firms yet to report, if the Financials are excluded, net margins are still expected to expand, to 8.90% from last years 8.66%.
"
486,ARNC,"On an annual basis, net margins continue to march northward.  In 2008, overall net margins were just 5.88%, rising to 6.40% in 2009.  They hit 8.64% in 2010 and are expected to continue climbing to 9.45% in 2011 and 10.14% in 2012.  The pattern is a bit different, particularly during the recession, if the Financials are excluded, as margins fell from 7.78% in 2008 to 7.07% in 2009, but have started a robust recovery and rose to 8.27% in 2010.  They are expected to rise to 8.81% in 2011 and 9.30% in 2012.
"
487,ARNC,"Valuation Still Attractive
"
488,ARNC,"The expectations for the full year are very healthy, with total net income for 2010 rising to $794.5 billion in 2010, up from $544.3 billion in 2009.  In 2011, the total net income for the S&P 500 should be $931.3 billion, or increases of 45.4% and 17.1%, respectively.  The expectation is for 2012 to have total net income passing the $1 trillion mark to $1.056 trillion.  That will also put the ""EPS"" for the S&P 500 over the $100 ""per share"" level for the first time at $110.53.  That is up from $57.20 for 2009, $83.20 for 2010, and $97.51 for 2011.  In an environment where the 10 year T-note is yielding 2.91%, a P/E of 15.73x based on 2010 and 13.42x based on 2011 earnings looks attractive.  The P/E based on 2012 earnings is 11.84x.
"
489,ARNC,"Estimate revisions activity is starting to pick up again, and the analysts will really get busy over the next few weeks.  During the seasonal decline in revisions activity, the ratio of increases to cuts also declined sharply, from over 2.0 at the height of the last earnings season, to slightly below 1.0 for both this year and next.  Now as activity is ticking up, so are the revisions ratios, but only slightly and at 0.98 for 2011 and 1.00 for 2012 are about as neutral as they can get.
"
490,ARNC,"The fundamental backing for the market continues to be solid.  It is important to keep your eyes on the prize.  There is lots of news out there, and much of it is more dramatic than earnings results, but rarely does it have more significance for your portfolio.  Earning are, and are going to remain, the single most important thing for the stock market.  Interest rates are an important, but distant second.   There are other positive factors as well.  The fact we are in the third year of the presidential cycle (almost always the best of the four, and by a big margin).  We have a Democrat in the White House, which has historically meant good things for the stock market, with an average annualized return over the last 50 years more than triple that when the GOP holds the Oval Office.  While counting points on the S&P 500 is suspect over long periods of time, the fact remains that on balance, every single point of increase in the S&P 500 over the last 50 years has come with a Democrat in the White House.  Those factors should combine to make this a good year for the market.
"
491,ARNC,"Things at the micro level, earnings and valuations, provide plenty of reason to be bullish.  This is particularly true when one looks at the prevailing level of interest rates.  Currently 99 S&P 500 (19.8%) firms have dividend yields higher than the yield on the 10 year t-note, and more than half (260, or 52.0%) yield more than the five year note.  One thing is absolutely certain, the coupon payment on those notes will never go up, while companies have been raising their dividends at a rapid pace of late.  Nearly one quarter of the firms in the S&P 500 have raised their dividend at more than a 10% per year rate over the last five years, and those five years include the worst economic downturn since the 1930's. However, the macro level provides plenty of reason for concern, and only some of those concerns seem to be priced into the markets.
"
492,ARNC,"Sovereign Debt Crises Far from Over
"
493,ARNC,"In Europe, the debt cancer continues to metastasize.  Just after it looked like the Greek problem had been kicked down the road for another year or so (don't kid yourself into thinking the problem is even close to being solved there, there will eventually be a default or a restructuring in which private sector investors have to take substantial haircuts) all of a sudden Italy moved into the spotlight.  Italy is both too big to fail, and also too big to bail out, as the third largest economy in the Euro zone, and the fourth largest in the E.U.  Even with the ""progress"" in Greece, Fitch downgraded the country to CCC from B+.  Meanwhile Moody's moved Ireland into below investment grade status at Ba1.  It joins Greece and Portugal in having Junk grade debt.  The worries on the far side of the pond do seem to be priced into the market.
"
494,ARNC,"The markets do not seem to have priced in the possibility that it will be the U.S., not any of the PIIGS that is the first to actually default.  OK, interest payments will have first call on the existing cash flow the government has, so China and the other holders of U.S. debt will probably get paid, everyone else though should be very worried if the debt ceiling is not raised.  There is a very real possibility that Social Security checks will not go out in August, and doctors will not be paid for Medicare/Medicaid work.  I suspect that the paychecks troops in combat would have second call on the current revenues, but the troops stateside might see their paychecks delayed.  There is no official protocol on which of the 80 million checks the government cuts each month will have precedence.
"
495,ARNC,"The difference between Greece and the U.S. is that Greece is unable to pay its debts.  The U.S. if the debt ceiling is not raised will simply be unwilling to do so.  That would be entirely an unforced error.  The Government of the United States defaulting on its debt is likely to have a much larger impact on the markets and the economy than the impact of Lehman Brothers defaulting on its debts.  Greece is a rounding error in the world economy relative to the U.S.  America would be shoved right back into recession, and one deeper than the one that followed the Lehman collapse.  If that happens, then corporate profits would also collapse.  However, when push comes to shove, I find it hard to believe that even Congress could be so stupid as to let that happen.  While not the most likely case, the chance of no increase by the time the ceiling is hit is a very real possibility.  The GOP is determined to extract everything it can from Obama to allow the increase in the debt ceiling to happen.
"
496,ARNC,"A Game of Chicken
"
497,ARNC,"When Obama makes a concession, they simply move the goalposts.  The latest movement of the goalposts is the new demand that Congress actually approve a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution.  The proposed amendment would require that the Federal government spend no more than 18% of the prior year's GDP, and would make increasing taxes almost impossible, by requiring a two thirds majority in both houses.  I would note that the last time that Federal spending was less than 18% of the GDP four quarters earlier was in the third quarter of 1965, and has averaged 20.94% since 1948 (and 22.77% since Reagan took office).  It will also happen at a time when the Baby Boomers are retiring, and thus will be using Medicare and drawing Social Security benefits.  It would also remove all flexibility the government has to deal with future crises, be they military or financial. This is a dangerous and decidedly not serious proposal.  However, it appears to be their price for not shooting the economy in the head on August 3rd.  If the debt ceiling is not raised, just go ahead and throw out all the earnings forecasts for both this year and next.  The economic devastation will take down nearly every firms results.  Total net income for the S&P 500 would be hard pressed to get above $500 billion in 2012, not be over $1 trillion as is currently forecast.
"
498,ARNC,"The budget cuts that the GOP have already forced are slowing the recovery, and the massive cuts they are demanding will slow the economy further.  We only grew at 1.9% in the first quarter, which is not fast enough to bring down unemployment.  Given weak numbers this past week (Trade Deficit, Industrial Production, Retail Sales were all on the weak/bad side) it looks to me as if the growth rate in the second quarter will be below the first quarter pace, probably around 1.5%.  Over the long term we need to close the budget gap, but we need a balanced approach to it.  There is zero economic justification for the view that any tax increase slows the economy, and that cuts to spending do no economic harm, or even as some talking heads on CNBC claim, actually help the economy.  In theory, both tax increases and spending cuts will tend to slow the economy, but by how much varies a great deal depending on the nature of the tax increases and the nature of the spending cuts.  Cutting tax subsidies for say ethanol, is likely to be far less damaging than say cutting spending on infrastructure.  Requiring a hedge fund manager earning over $100 million a year to pay a marginal tax rate greater than or equal to that paid by a school teacher will harm the economy less than laying off the school teacher.  The most recent plan being discussed is a package of 87% spending cuts and 13% revenue increases, almost all of the revenue increases are from cutting spending that is embedded in the tax code, and which mostly benefits the wealthy.  I think that is way out of balance already, but the insistence on 100% spending cuts is simply extreme and will do significant damage to the economy, both short term and long term.
"
499,ARNC,"There is a good argument that what Obama should do is simply ignore the debt ceiling and issue debt anyways.  There are substantial grounds that the debt ceiling is unconstitutional in Section Four to the 14th Amendment, but an equally strong argument based on Article One, Section Eight that doing so would have the Executive branch stepping on the Legislative Branch's turf.  It could well provoke a Constitutional crisis.  However, if given the choice between certain economic Armageddon in the form of a default, and opening himself up for continuous blackmail and a slow bleed of an economy, the third option looks like a good way to go.
"
500,ARNC,"Raising the option would also restore his leverage in the negotiations.  In the end, I find it almost impossible to imagine the debt ceiling not being either raised or ignored.  Is it possible that our elected leaders could be that stupid and quite frankly unpatriotic as to let the U.S. Government default, and to do so at a time of near record low interest rates?  The most likely scenario, and the one that the markets are clearly betting on, is that there will be a last minute settlement, most likely with Obama folding like a lawn chair.
"
501,ARNC,"Buy Insurance, Just in Case
"
502,ARNC,"The chance of this game of chicken having a tragic ending is no longer trivial.  That tragic ending would result in a huge market crash.  Taking out some insurance would make a lot of sense in here.  My preferred way of doing so would be to buy some out of the money September puts.  On the SPY (SPY) (the S&P 500 ETF) the September 120 puts (in the money if the S&P 500 falls below 1200) are only trading for $1.19.  Obviously I hope that they would expire worthless, just as I hope that my life insurance policy does not pay off anytime soon.  Still it is insurance that would be well worth having.
"
503,ARNC,"On balance I remain bullish, and I think we will end the year with the S&P 500 north of 1400, but that does not mean we will have a smooth ride between here and there.  Strong earnings should trump a dicey international situation, and the drama in DC (provided it turns out to be just drama, and the game of chicken does not end in tragedy).  Valuations on stocks look very compelling, with the S&P trading from just 13.42x 2011, and 11.84x 2012 earnings.  That is extremely competitive with the 2.91% yield on the 10 year treasury note.    However, be prepared to move to the exits (or have some put protection in place) if it looks like the debt ceiling will not be raised.  I suspect we are in for a bumpy ride over the next month or so.
"

"
505,ARNC,"Historically, a ""normal earnings season"" will have a surprise ratio of about 3:1 and a median surprise of about 3.0%.  Thus in the early going we are doing much better than average on the median front, and about average on the ratio front.  Early on the ratios and medians can be very volatile, but it looks like an ok start to things.  Pay attention to the percent reporting in evaluating the significance of the sector numbers.

512,ARNC,"The first table below shows the S&P 500 firms with the biggest increases in their FY1 (mostly 2010) mean estimate over the last 4 weeks.  The second shows the largest declines.  To qualify there must be more than 3 estimates for FY1, and have a mean estimate of more than $0.50.  In addition to the change in the mean estimate, the net percentage of estimates being raised is shown for both FY1 and FY2, as well as the P/E ratios based on each years earnings is shown.
"
513,ARNC,"Note that estimate momentum and value are not mutually exclusive.  The most interesting of these firms will be where the net revisions percentage (#up-#dn/Tot) is more than 0.50 but less than 1.00.  Big mean estimate changes based on a handful of individual revisions are suspect, but could prove to be the most interesting if other analysts follow suit.  On the other hand if all the analysts have raised their estimates already, the mean estimate is less likely to rise again over the next month.

518,ARNC,"Overview
"
519,ARNC,"The Metals & Mining industry encompasses the extraction (mining) as well as the primary and secondary processing of metals and minerals such as aluminum, gold, precious metals, coal and steel. The industry is oligarchic in structure, with a few producers accounting for the lion’s share of the output.
"
520,ARNC,"The largest segment of the global metals market is iron and steel followed by aluminum. The iron and steel segment comprises more than half the industry in terms of volume. This industry includes metal ore exploration and mining services, as well as iron and steel foundries for smelting, rolling, forging, spinning, recycling, stamping, polishing and plating of iron and steel products, such as pipes, tubes, wire, spring, rolls and bars.
"
521,ARNC,"The precious metal and mineral industry consists of companies engaged in the extraction and primary processing of gold, silver, platinum, diamond, semi-precious stones, uranium and other rare minerals and ores.
"
522,ARNC,"Historically, the automotive and construction markets have been the largest consumers of metals, accounting for more than 50% of total demand. Other metal consumers include energy, electrical equipment, agricultural, domestic and commercial equipment and industrial machinery. Large automakers such as General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report), Ford Motor Co. (F  -  Free Report), Toyota Motor Corp (TM  -  Free Report) and Honda Motor Co. Ltd (HMC  -  Free Report) are large consumers of metals, especially steel and aluminum.
"
523,ARNC,"Overall Outlook
"
524,ARNC,"The global metal industry is cyclical, highly competitive and has historically been characterized by overcapacity (excess of supply over-demand). Metal producers are subject to cyclical fluctuations in London Metal Exchange prices, general economic conditions and end-use markets. Individual company profitability depends on volume and operating efficiency. Large producers with huge resources are able to discover and develop new deposits, thereby boosting reserves, while the smaller ones devote their attention to fewer mines.
"
525,ARNC,"Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) have historically been a critically important growth strategy for mining companies. The year 2009 experienced a lull in M&A activity under the impact of the global economic downturn, with a deal value almost half of 2008. The focus for M&A activity shifted from business growth to business survival, as companies looked to safeguard their teetering balance sheets rather than seeking expansion.
"
526,ARNC,"In 2010, fairly unpredictable financial markets dictated metals prices, despite strong underlying fundamentals. In addition, several notable mining accidents have made mine safety a major factor for the industry and regulators. Despite the volatility, gold prices rose 400% over the past ten years and made a record run in 2010, increasing 26% and hitting a high of $1,432 an ounce.
"
527,ARNC,"The year 2011 has been unstable for metals so far with double-digit gold sell-offs and rallies during the first quarter. However, investors remain cautiously optimistic regarding the sector. Many analysts predict metal prices will end the year with double-digit growth considering demand is still outstripping supply. Unrest in the Middle East is also driving metal prices. On the down side, the end of the Fed’s QE2 program and overall atmosphere of greater focus on fiscal restraint may limit significant gains. 
"
528,ARNC,"In an industry plagued with rising energy and raw material costs, increasing productivity and reducing costs are the keys to success. Given the cyclical nature of the metals industry, low-volume, and high-cost producers need to generate sufficient cash or ensure a strong borrowing position during market peaks to survive the market troughs.
"
529,ARNC,"Continuing consolidation supports the sector’s ability to influence the price of input costs and companies can also obtain synergies and economies of scale through the operation of vertically integrated raw materials sources. Expansion in low-cost countries will ensure lower labor costs and also help tap their growth potential.
"
530,ARNC,"Geographically, the Asia-Pacific region -- in particular China and India -- is witnessing higher production and consumption of metals. Per capita consumption levels in both these countries are calibrating to U.S./European levels, which could, theoretically at least, double metal demand in the longer term. China is the world’s largest consumer of metals and is expected to remain so.
"
531,ARNC,"Further, developed regions such as the US and Europe are showing signs of recovery, albeit at a moderate pace. Overall, we expect global metal demand to improve in the long term with the recovery of user industries.
"
532,ARNC,"Demand as well as production for industrial metals in Japan has been recently affected as factories have been shut in the aftermath of the country’s earthquake and Tsunami. Japan is the biggest buyer of aluminum and the second largest buyer of copper ore. We, however, believe that metal demand will be boosted by the construction industry triggered by the country’s reconstruction efforts.Detailed Look into Metals
"
533,ARNC,"Steel
"
534,ARNC,"As the major shareholder (about 60%) of the metals market, the steel industry was severely bruised by the global economic downturn. However, according to the World Steel Association, world crude steel production in 2010 reached a record 1,414 million metric tons (mmt), an increase of 15% compared with 2009. All the major steel-producing countries and regions showed double-digit growth in 2010. In April 2011, the world crude steel production was 127 million metric tons (mmt), an increase of 5.0% from April 2010.
"
535,ARNC,"The U.S. produced 80.6 mmt of crude steel, 38.5% higher than 2009. Of the world’s steel production, US’s share increased to 5.7% from 4.7% in 2009, pushing the country to the third position in 2010 from fifth position in 2009.
"
536,ARNC,"The growth trend continued in 2011, with world crude steel production increasing 5.3% in January to 119 mmt from January 2010 levels. United States crude steel production rose smartly by 9.4% to 6.8 mmt compared with January 2010. The US produced 7.1 mmt of crude steel in April 2011, an increase of 2.1% year over year.
"
537,ARNC,"Reflecting on 2010 data, we see a sharp increase in revenues and shipments across most companies. Sales of ArcelorMittal (MT  -  Free Report), the world’s largest steel-producing company, increased 27.3% year over year to $22 billion in the first quarter of 2011. Steel shipments also increased to 22.0 million metric tons compared with 21.0 million metric tons in the year-ago quarter.
"
538,ARNC,"Similarly, sales for U.S. Steel Corp. (X  -  Free Report) soared 24.8% to $4.9 billion and steel shipments went up to 5.8 million tons. Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report) recorded a sales increase of 32% to reach $4.83 billion with shipments increasing 9%. Steel Dynamics Inc. (STLD  -  Free Report) reported a 29.6% increase in revenues to generate $2.01 billion with shipments rising 4% to 1.5 million tons.
"
539,ARNC,"The steel industry is emerging from the gloom of the global recession as is evident from the above figures. However, given its economic sensitivity, we expect global steel demand to improve only gradually, in line with the recovery in the user industries, especially automotive and residential construction.
"
540,ARNC,"Although steel prices have been stabilizing since the latter part of 2009, they remain significantly below the pre-crisis levels. We believe that a sustained recovery in steel prices remains uncertain in the backdrop of sluggish economic activity.
"
541,ARNC,"Currently, Steel Dynamics has a Zacks #4 Rank (Sell) for the short-term (1 to 3 months) while U.S. Steel holds a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold). ArcelorMittal currently retains a Zacks Rank #3 Rank (Hold). We maintain our Outperform recommendation in the long term for ArcelorMittal and U.S. Steel, while we maintain a long-term Neutral recommendation on Nucor.Gold
"
542,ARNC,"As per the World Gold Council, gold prices rose for the tenth consecutive year in 2010, reflecting recovery in key sectors of demand and continued global economic uncertainty. In 2010, gold prices jumped 29%, reaching $1,405 per ounce as of the end of December.
"
543,ARNC,"During 2010, the price of gold rose to record levels on several occasions, trading as high as $1,432 per ounce. Gold’s performance was strong and volatility remained low. The World Gold Council suggests that the increase was not only driven by inflationary forces but was also inflated as both the private and public sectors of India and China rushed into the gold market.
"
544,ARNC,"Gold demand went up 9% over 2009, showcasing a 10-year high of 3,912.2 tons, driven by the rise in jewelry demand, the revival of the Indian market and strong momentum in Chinese gold demand. Moreover, central banks became net purchasers of gold for the first time in 21 years, hiking the demand for the yellow metal.
"
545,ARNC,"Major demand came from India and China. India bought 746 tons, a 69% increase over 2009, and China bought 400 tons of gold jewelry. China bought 179.9 tons of gold in the form of bars and coin, a 70% increase over 2009.
"
546,ARNC,"Global gold demand in the first quarter of 2011 totaled 981.3 tons, up 11% year over year from 881.0 tons in the first quarter of 2010. This was largely attributable to the widespread rise in demand for bars and coins, supported by an improvement in jewelry demand in key markets.
"
547,ARNC,"The quarterly average gold price hit a new record of $1,386.27/oz (London PM Fix), its eighth consecutive year-over-year increase. Despite a period of price consolidation in the early part of the quarter, it climbed to record highs throughout March and has continued to achieve new highs in April and May.
"
548,ARNC,"Gold remained a coveted asset given its long-term supply and demand dynamics and influenced by macro-economic factors. Concerns regarding economic growth in developed countries made gold an attractive and safe investment option. The European sovereign debt crisis made European investors use gold as a currency hedge. Pressure on the US dollar against various currencies coupled with higher inflation expectations in many countries, including India and China, also pushed up gold prices.
"
549,ARNC,"The value and wealth preservation attributes of gold continue to attract investors and consumers. Jewelry and investment demand in non-Western markets continues to rebound while industrial demand has started to recover in response to an improvement in economic conditions. India, which alone consumes nearly 45%−50% of the world gold production, should drive demand for gold along with China. The Chinese gold demand is expected to double in 10 years.
"
550,ARNC,"Even though gold price dropped 7% in January this year, it again recorded a rise in February. We believe gold demand and prices will strengthen in 2011. As China and India continue to grow rapidly, their demand for gold will also rise in tandem.
"
551,ARNC,"Higher prices bode well for gold producers, which should benefit giants such as Barrick Gold Corporation (ABX  -  Free Report), Agnico-Eagle (AEM  -  Free Report) and Goldcorp Inc. (GG). However, gold producers like Newmont Mining Corporation (NEM) and Kinross Gold Corporation (KGC  -  Free Report) suffer from lower ore grades that subdue production levels, increase mining costs and offset the benefits of rising gold prices.
"
552,ARNC,"Overall, the stock prices of gold producers are not expected to benefit much from this favorable commodity-price backdrop. This is reflected in our overall long-term neutral views on the stocks. As major economies continue to recover, investors’ confidence will be restored to invest in stock markets, which could cause gold prices to fall. However this is not going to happen in the near future. We have a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) on Barrick Gold, Agnico-Eagle, Goldcorp, Kinross Gold Corporation and Newmont Mining.
"
553,ARNC,"Aluminum
"
554,ARNC,"The aluminum industry is highly cyclical, relating to prices subject to worldwide supply and demand forces along with other influences. The global economic downturn had a historic, negative impact on the aluminum industry, leading to an unprecedented decline in LME-based aluminum prices, weak end markets, fall in demand, increased global inventories, and higher costs of borrowing and diminished credit availability. The economy has however recovered from the crisis of the economic downturn.Alcoa Inc. (AA) is the world leader in the production and management of primary aluminum. In response to the global economic downturn, the company implemented a number of operational and financial actions to improve its cost structure and liquidity, including curtailing production, halting non-critical capital expenditures, accelerating new sourcing strategies for raw materials, divesting non-core assets, reducing global headcount, suspending its share repurchase program, reducing its quarterly common stock dividend and resorting to other liquidity enhancements.
"
555,ARNC,"In 2011, Alcoa plans to restart certain idled potlines at three smelters. These restarts are expected to increase Alcoa’s aluminum production by 137 kmt during 2011 and by 204 kmt on an annual basis thereafter. Such measures are sure to meet anticipated growth in aluminum demand.
"
556,ARNC,"Alcoa expects demand for aluminum to grow 12% this year. China, India, Brazil and Russia are all expected to register double-digit increases in aluminum demand. Market conditions for aluminum products in all global markets are expected to improve, particularly in aerospace, automotive and industrial gas turbine.
"
557,ARNC,"On the cost side, however, energy prices and currency movements are expected to keep posting challenges. Overall, Alcoa believes that the long-term prospects for aluminum remain bright and envisions that global demand for aluminum will double by 2020.
"
558,ARNC,"Since the sudden decline from peak prices in mid-2008, aluminum prices have increased over the last 2 years. In 2010, global aluminum prices increased 13%. Alcoa increased its fiscal 2010 profit on the back of higher prices and continued strengthening in most end markets. Aluminum Corporation of China, or Chalco (ACH) swung back to profit in 2010 after posting a loss in 2009, attributable to increased global aluminum prices.
"
559,ARNC,"In the medium-to-long term, aluminum consumption will improve globally with improving automotive and packaging industries, one of the key consumer markets. Aluminum is widely used for packaging, beverage cans, food containers and foil products. The automobile market is also becoming increasingly aluminum intensive, benefiting from the recyclability and the light weight of the metal.
"
560,ARNC,"Further, the surge in copper price this year is triggering a switch among manufacturers to aluminum. Automobiles, air conditioners and industrial components manufacturers are now shifting toward aluminum, which is more economical.
"
561,ARNC,"We expect aluminum demand to increase in the long term, outstripping supply growth with the improving end-markets. China and India are undergoing rapid industrialization. Both these factors are positive for underlying aluminum demand. Leading aluminum producers such as Alcoa, Paramount Gold and Silver Corporation (PZG) and Aluminum Corporation of China should benefit from the improving demand outlook.
"
562,ARNC,"Currently, Alcoa holds a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) supported by our long-term Neutral recommendation, while Paramount Gold and Silver has a Zacks #4 Rank (Sell).
"
563,ARNC,"Copper
"
564,ARNC,"Copper prices have shown a rising trend in 2010 benefiting copper producers like Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) and Southern Copper Corporation (SCCO). Although copper demand was down 10% year over year in 2009, global copper demand has since been witnessing growth.
"
565,ARNC,"The Chinese demand for copper was still robust and imports of the metal were rebounding, which was supported by steady construction and infrastructure activity in the country. The improvement in copper prices would be supported by limited supply and increased demand from China.
"
566,ARNC,"Even though copper prices are at near all-time highs, the outlook for copper prices remains favorable. Not denying the volatility in prices that are bound to remain, we have a bullish stance on copper prices, in the long term. However, as discussed earlier, manufacturers might now resort to aluminum as a substitute.
"
567,ARNC,"Market conditions are expected to be positive for copper in the next couple of years due to higher consumption of the metal in the developing nations. The companies that have a high leverage to copper prices will benefit immensely from the potential demand for the metal in the developing markets.
"
568,ARNC,"We currently have a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) and long-term Neutral recommendation on both Freeport and Southern Copper.                    
"
569,ARNC,"While the first quarter earnings season “officially kicked off last week when Alcoa (AA) reported, it was a slow start. We have just 32 (6.4%) first quarter reports in. It will pick up steam this week, when 111 members of the S&P 500 are due to report.
"
570,ARNC,"This week’s reporters are a virtual who’s who of American business, from Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) to Verizon (VZ  -  Free Report) and from Ford (F  -  Free Report) to McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report). While far too early to draw any conclusions, it looks like we are off to a good start in the first quarter, with reported net income growth of 33.4%, actually up slightly from the 32.4% growth those same 32 firms reported in the fourth quarter.
"
571,ARNC,"This Week Will Tell A Lot
"
572,ARNC,"By next week we should have a good idea of how the season as a whole will go. The expectations for the remaining firms have been rising, but the hurdle is not particularly high. The consensus is looking for a significant slowdown in growth for the remaining firms, with total net income rising just 16.8%.
"
573,ARNC,"Financial firms setting aside much less than a year ago for bad debts were a big part of the earnings story for the fourth quarter, and the story so far in the first quarter. Excluding the Financials, total net income is up 16.5%, down from growth of 24.2$ in the fourth quarter. 
"
574,ARNC,"A big part of the deceleration in year-over-year growth has to do with a much higher base, particularly in the Financials in the first quarter of 2010 than in the fourth quarter of 2009. If the Financial sector is excluded, the expected net income growth for the remaining firms is solid at 20.9%, actually up from the 19.5% growth those same firms posted in the fourth quarter. 
"
575,ARNC,"Revenue growth in the fourth quarter was healthy at 8.28%. Looking ahead to the first quarter, though, those firms yet to report are expected to post year-over-year revenue growth of 3.66%, down from 8.19% growth in the fourth quarter. Financials are the key reason for the slowdown in revenue growth, if they are excluded, reported revenue growth is expected to be 7.46%, while that is down from the 8.22% growth posted last quarter, it is not nearly as dramatic. Tougher year-over-year comparisons are a big part of the story.  Net Margin Expansion Slowing
"
576,ARNC,"Net margin expansion has been a driver of earnings growth, but that expansion is slowing down, particularly if one excludes the Financials. Net margins for those yet to report are expected to come in at 9.77% in the first quarter, up from 8.67% a year ago, and from 8.80% in the fourth quarter. However, excluding the Financials, net margins are expected to rise to 9.25% from 8.22% a year ago, and up from 8.78% in the fourth quarter.
"
577,ARNC,"Among the handful that have already reported for the first quarter, overall net margins are 10.54%, up sharply from 8.40% a year ago and from 9.73% in the fourth quarter. Strip away the Financials that have already reported and the picture is different, rising to 8.30% from 7.82% a year ago and from the 7.88% reported in the fourth quarter.Look to Cyclicals
"
578,ARNC,"It looks like the more cyclical parts of the economy will be leading the growth charge this quarter. The highest expected growth (among those yet to report) comes from the Construction sector, where earnings are expected to be more than double what they were  last year, but in that case, so what, two times nothing is still nothing. The Industrials, on the other hand, had decent earnings a year ago, but are expected to report total net income that is 77.2% higher than in the first quarter of 2010.
"
579,ARNC,"Unlike the construction firms, analysts have been raising the expectations for the Industrials, for both 2011 and 2012, while they continue to slash the estimates for the construction firms. The Transports are also expected to see robust growth of 62.9% over last year. They are an interesting case in terms of estimate revisions, with cuts for this year, but lots of increases for next year. I suspect that what analysts are saying is that the underlying business is very strong, but that they face a stiff headwind in the near term from higher energy costs.
"
580,ARNC,"The Energy sector is also expected to have very strong growth, which is not a shocker if you have filled up your tank lately. Total net income for the quarter is expected to rise 45.2%, and the revisions are strong for both years.
"
581,ARNC,"The weakest sector by far is expected to be the Conglomerates, with earnings falling 45.5%. Utilities are also expected to have a weak performance, with total income down 9.0% from last year.
"
582,ARNC,"The Financials are expected to post positive growth, but only of 0.6%. They are a bit of a wild card, in that how good a quarter they have will largely depend on how much the banks can release reserves. Some will have major releases, and others very little at all. The level of releases can be very hard to forecast at any given bank. The quality of earnings growth coming from reserve releases is very low.
"
583,ARNC,"On an annual basis, net margins continue to march northward. In 2008, overall net margins were just 5.88%, rising to 6.40% in 2009. They hit 8.59% in 2010 and are expected to continue climbing to 9.50% in 2011 and 10.18% in 2012. The pattern is a bit different, particularly during the recession, if the Financials are excluded, as margins fell from 7.78% in 2008 to 7.08% in 2009, but have started a robust recovery and rose to 8.22% in 2010.  They are expected to rise to 8.82% in 2011 and 9.29% in 2012.
"
584,ARNC,"Expectations for 2011
"
585,ARNC,"The expectations for the full year are very healthy, with total net income for 2010 rising to $792.1 billion in 2010, up from $545.1 billion in 2009. In 2011, the total net income for the S&P 500 should be $913.5 billion, or increases of 45.4% and 15.3%, respectively. The expectation is for 2012 to have total net income passing the $1 Trillion mark to $1.037 Trillion.
"
586,ARNC,"That will also put the “EPS for the S&P 500 over the $100 “per share level for the first time at $108.72. That is up from $57.13 for 2009, $83.09 for 2010, and $95.81 for 2011.  In an environment where the 10 year T-note is yielding 3.50%, a P/E of 15.8x based on 2010 and 13.7x based on 2011 earnings looks attractive. The P/E based on 2012 earnings is 12.1x.
"
587,ARNC,"With far more estimates being raised than being cut (revisions ratio of 1.40), one has to feel confident that the current expectations for 2011 will be hit, and more likely exceeded. Analysts are raising their 2012 projections at an even higher rate, with a revisions ratio of 1.86, or almost two increases for every cut. While a lot can happen between now and the time the 2012 earnings are all in, upward estimate momentum means that the current 2012 earnings are more likely to be exceeded than for them to fall short.The Economy & Politics
"
588,ARNC,"This provides a strong fundamental backing for the market to continue to move higher. The fact we are in the third year of the presidential cycle (almost always the best of the four, and by a big margin). We have a Democrat in the White House, which has historically meant good things for the stock market, with an average annualized return over the last 50 years more than triple than when the GOP holds the Oval Office.
"
589,ARNC,"While counting points on the S&P 500 is suspect over long periods of time, the fact remains that on balance, every single point of increase in the S&P 500 over the last 50 years has come with a Democrat in the White House. Those factors should combine to make this a good year for the market.Not All Smooth Sailing
"
590,ARNC,"That does not mean that all is smooth sailing ahead. We managed to avoid a government shutdown, but only at the cost of large spending cuts that will slow the economy. Those should probably shave at least a half point off of the growth we would have had in 2011, and probably result in hundreds of thousands fewer jobs being created. Fortunately, the economy has some upward momentum, so the cuts will simply slow the economy down, not throw it into reverse.
"
591,ARNC,"The lower growth will result in lower tax collections, so the impact on the budget deficit will be much less than the amount advertised. Job creation remains sluggish, but is starting to show signs of picking up. We created 230,000 jobs in the private sector in March, down from 240,000 in February, but that is after a big upward revision to the February numbers. However, State and Local governments laid off a total of 15,000 people for the month, on top of 46,000 pink slips the month before.
"
592,ARNC,"The idea that one can reduce unemployment by cutting jobs is positively Orwellian, and it is hard to believe the advocates of doing so are taken seriously. The household survey has been much more upbeat, showing growth of 291,000 jobs in March, on top of 250,000 gained the month before. The unemployment rate fell to 8.8%, and it was as high as 9.8% as recently as November.
"
593,ARNC,"The international situation clearly has the potential to abort the recovery as well. The disaster in Japan will clearly slow its economy dramatically in the first quarter, although much of that growth will be made up later in the year as the reconstruction process gets under way. Many U.S. made products have parts which are made in Japan and that is likely to disrupt production here. Still, there appeared to be no impact on Industrial Production in March as manufacturing output climbed 0.7%.
"
594,ARNC,"The turmoil in the Middle East is not going away, and that is likely to keep oil prices both high and volatile. High oil prices will also act as a depressing force on the economy. The Debt crisis in Europe is not going away with Portugal now also getting bailed out, even as the ECB makes life tougher on the PIIGS by raising rates.
"
595,ARNC,"On the plus side, the dollar has been weak, and that should improve the trade deficit, and that will be a significant positive for the economy. The foreign operations of U.S. companies will be much more profitable when the results are measured in dollars.  Inflation, other than in food and energy, is well contained, up only 0.1% in March and 1.2% year over year. That should let the Fed stay on Easy Street as far as monetary policy is concerned.
"
596,ARNC,"Key Points:4Q earnings season off to good start, but still very early, with just 31 firms having reported. Median surprise of 6.56% and surprise ratio of 3.00 for EPS, 0.773% and 2.50 for revenues.Reported (31 firms) fourth quarter earnings growth of 37.5%, expected (469 firms) year over year growth of 21.4% for the vast majority of firms yet to report. On Revenue side, 8.96% reported, but just 4.6% expected for those yet to report -- a slowdown from the 24.6% earnings and 9.15% revenue growth those firms reported in the Third Quarter.Net margins expected to expand to 8.73% (among those yet to report) from 7.28% a year ago, but down from 8.96% in third quarter. Excluding Financials, margins expected to rise to 8.20% from 7.95% a year ago, but down from 8.75% in the third quarter.Full-year total earnings for the S&P 500 expected to jump 43.0% in 2010, 14.3% further in 2011. Growth to continue in 2012 with total net income expected to rise 11.9%.Total revenues for the S&P 500 expected to rise 4.39% in 2010, 5.72% in 2011, and 4.98% in 2012.  Excluding Financials revenues expected to be up 8.62% in 2010, 6.26% in 2011 and 5.25% in 2012.Twelve sectors expected to post double digit earnings growth in 2011, 11 double-digit growers in 2012.  Cyclical Construction, Industrial and Materials sectors all expected to post growth of over 30% in 2011.Net Margins marching higher, from 5.88% in 2008 to 6.42% in 2009 to 8.78% expected for 2010, 9.48% expected for 2011 and 10.11% in 2012. Major source of earnings growth. Net margins ex-financials 7.79% in 2008, 7.11% in 2009, 8.22% expected for 2010, 8.85% in 2011, and 9.30% in 2012.Revisions ratio for full S&P 500 at 1.80 for 2011, at 1.64 for 2012 -- both bullish readings. Ratio of firms with rising to falling mean estimates at 1.72 for 2011, 1.47 for 2012, also positive readings. Total revisions activity past seasonal lows and will expand dramatically over the next few weeks. Current sample size is still thin.S&P 500 earned $544.3 billion in 2009, expected to earn $779.1 billion in 2010, $890.3 billion in 2011. In 2012 the 500 are collectively expected to earn $996.5 billion.S&P 500 earned $57.57 in 2009: $82.29 in 2010 and $93.71 in 2011 expected bottom up. For 2012, $105.23 expected in early read. Puts P/Es at 15.6x for 2010, and 13.7x for 2011 and 12.2x for 2012. ""Gentlemen, Start Your Numbers""
"
597,ARNC,"The Fourth quarter earnings season is now officially underway. Alcoa (AA), Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) got things rolling last week, and all three of those Dow components posted better-than-expected earnings.  Still, we have had just a handful (31) of S&P 500 firms report, mostly firms with November fiscal period ends, with a high proportion of retailers in the mix. Thus it is not exactly a representative sample yet.
"
598,ARNC,"The early reports are encouraging, with total net income for those firms rising 37.5% over a year ago. The early median surprise of 6.56% is also quite strong, although the ratio of positive to negative surprises is about normal at just 3.00.  However, those numbers are always extremely volatile in the early going and it is far to early to draw any real conclusions about the quarter.  
"
599,ARNC,"Most of the focus should be on the expectations for those who have yet to report. There the expectations are also positive, particularly on the earnings front. Total net income is expected to rise 21.4% over year-ago levels. While that is a slowdown from the year-over-year growth of the third quarter (24.6%) it is well above the growth that was expected for the third quarter just before the third quarter reporting season really got underway (15.5%).
"
600,ARNC,"Given that positive earnings surprises almost always outnumber disappointments, one does not need an overly active imagination to envision that growth will be close to 25% again when all is said and done for the quarter. Revenue growth though is expected to slow down significantly to 1.22% from positive growth of 8.27% in the third quarter.
"
601,ARNC,"On the other hand, revenue growth among the handful that have reported is very healthy at 8.96%. The financials are a big part of the overall revenue growth slowdown, but not the entire story. Excluding them, revenue growth is expected to slow to 4.55% year over year from 9.15%. Tougher year-over-year comparisons are a bigger part of the story.
"
602,ARNC,"Thus, the stellar earnings growth is mostly due to the continued expansion of net margins. Much of the year-over-year margin expansion is due to the Financials, were the whole concept of revenues is a bit different from most companies, and thus the concept of net margins is also a bit different. However, even if the Financials are excluded, net margins continue to march northward, at least year over year.
"
603,ARNC,"For the S&P 500 as a whole, net margins are expected to be 8.73% in the fourth quarter, up from “just 7.28% a year ago, but down from 8.96% in the third quarter. If the Financials are excluded, margins are expected to rise to 8.20% from 7.95% a year ago but down from 8.75% in the third quarter. Those numbers are for the vast majority that have yet to report.
"
604,ARNC,"The reported net margins among the 31 early birds are 5.16%, up from 4.10% a year ago and from 5.04% in the third quarter. Excluding the Financials that have reported, net margins are 3.46%, up from 2.89% a year ago, but down slightly from the 3.50% those firms reported in the third quarter. Low-margin Retailers are over represented in the early non-financial sample.2011 Expectations
"
605,ARNC,"The expectations for the full year are very healthy, with total net income for 2010 expected to rise to $779.1 billion in 2010, up from $544.3 billion in 2009. In 2011, the total net income for the S&P 500 should be $80.3 billion, or increases of 43.0% and 14.3%, respectively.
"
606,ARNC,"The early expectation is for 2012 to have total net income of $996.5 billion, or to be within spitting distance of the $1 Trillion mark. That will also put the “EPS for the S&P 500 over the $100 “per share level for the first time at $106.15. That is up from $57.57 for 2009, $82.29 for 2010, and $93.71 for 2011. In an environment where the 10-year T-note is yielding just 3.32%, a P/E of 15.6x based on 2010 and 13.7x based on 2011 earnings looks attractive.
"
607,ARNC,"Much of the $600 billion in newly created money from QE2 is likely to eventually find its way into the equity market (not directly, but eventually). Historically, the year after mid-term elections has almost always been a good one for the stock market. The extension of unemployment benefits and the one-year cut in the payroll tax should be stimulative to the economy (the extension of the high end tax cuts is only slightly stimulative relative to letting them expire, and certainly does not provide any fresh stimulus to the economy). A stronger economy should allow earnings to continue to rise.
"
608,ARNC,"On the other hand, there is a very real prospect of total political gridlock, which would greatly raise uncertainty about governmental policy and the strength of the economy that could undermine confidence. As Shakespeare said, “Beware the Ides of March. That is approximately when the U.S. will hit its current debt ceiling. If it is not raised, the U.S. Government would go into at least a technical default on its debt, and the government would probably have to shut down.
"
609,ARNC,"That is hardly something that will inspire confidence in the markets. While it is inconceivable that it will not eventually be passed, there is a chance that there will be a delay between the debt ceiling being hit and when it gets raised.
"
610,ARNC,"The economy does seem to have made a slow turn towards recovery. However, job creation remains very sluggish. Most of the real growth in the economy has come from higher productivity, not more hours being worked. Those productivity gains are accruing to capital, not labor and are a major reason behind the strong earnings growth.
"
611,ARNC,"Still, companies are expected to continue growing their earnings nicely, and the 14.3% expected growth for 2011, if achieved, means that the total earnings for the S&P 500 should hit a new record by the middle of next year. The fact that analysts are, on balance, still raising estimates for 2011, increases the odds that that growth will be achieved.
"
612,ARNC,"Growth of 14.3% is not exactly awful. Even on the revenue side the expected growth in 2011 of 5.72%, or 6.26% if one excludes the Financial sector is still pretty solid. Clearly the analytical community is not expecting the economy to turn south again.Scorecard & Earnings SurpriseOnly 31 firms (6.2%) have reported, and many of those have November fiscal period ends.Off to a good start with a median surprise of 6.56%, and a 3.00 surprise ratio (21 beats, 7 misses), 67.7% of all firms beat expectations.Positive year over year growth for 25, falling EPS for 6 firms, 4.33 ratio, 80.6% of all firms reporting have higher EPS than last year.Total net income up 37.52% among those that have reported.Six sectors have yet to have any firms report, four more have only a single report in.Sector medians not that significant yet, but for what it’s worth, it looks like the cyclical sectors are leading in the surprise counts.
"
613,ARNC,"Historically, a “normal earnings season will have a surprise ratio of about 3:1 and a median surprise of about 3.0%. Thus in the early going we are doing much better than average on the median front, and about average on the ratio front.
"
614,ARNC,"Early on the ratios and medians can be very volatile, but it looks like an OK start to things. Pay attention to the percent reporting in evaluating the significance of the sector numbers.Scorecard & Earnings Surprise 4Q Reported Income Surprises Yr/YrGrowth %Reported SurpriseMedian EPSSurpPos EPSSurpNeg #GrowPos #GrowNegConstruction 169.57% 9.09% 466.67 1 0 1 0Basic Materials 5925.00% 8.70% 55.26 2 0 2 0Consumer Discretionary 18.44% 9.09% 12.87 2 1 3 0Finance 53.41% 3.85% 12.00 3 0 3 0Computer and Tech 44.15% 10.00% 10.64 5 1 7 0Industrial Products -6.67% 5.00% 8.11 1 0 0 1Business Service 6.35% 5.26% 5.71 1 0 1 0Retail/Wholesale 10.26% 20.00% 2.90 5 3 7 2Consumer Staples -2.98% 7.89% 0.00 1 1 1 2Transportation -17.97% 11.11% -11.45 0 1 0 1Medical Na 0.00% na Na Na na NaAuto Na 0.00% na Na Na na NaConglomerates Na 0.00% na Na Na na NaAerospace Na 0.00% na Na Na na NaOils and Energy Na 0.00% na Na Na na NaUtilities Na 0.00% na Na Na na NaS&P 37.52% 6.20% 6.56 21 7 25 6Sales SurprisesSales Surprise ratio at 2.50, median surprise 0.773%, 64.5% of all firms do better than expected on top line. Growing Revenues outnumber falling revenues by ratio of 3.43, 77.4% of firms have higher revenues than a year ago.Revenue growth very healthy at 8.96% but still greatly lags earnings growth pointing to net margin expansion (see net margin tables below).

Significant slowdown from the 8.27% growth posted in the third quarter.Five sectors expected to post lower revenues than a year ago, eleven higher. Revenue for the Financials is a major source of the revenue slowdown. Low interest rates depress interest income, which is a major part of financials revenue, but also reduce interest expense.

"
617,ARNC,"The Table below shows the S&P 500 firms with the biggest increases in their FY1 (mostly 2010) mean estimate over the last 4 weeks. To qualify there must be more than 3 estimates for FY1, and have a mean estimate of more than $0.50. In addition to the change in the mean estimate, the net percentage of estimates being raised is shown for both FY1 and FY2, as well as the P/E ratios based on each year’s earnings is shown.
"
618,ARNC,"Note that estimate momentum and value are not mutually exclusive. The most interesting of these firms will be where the net revisions percentage (#up-#dn/Tot) is more than 0.50 but less than 1.00. Big mean estimate changes based on a handful of individual revisions are suspect, but could prove to be the most interesting if other analysts follow suit. On the other hand, if all the analysts have raised their estimates already, the mean estimate is less likely to rise again over the next month.

619,ARNC,"We use the convention of referring to the next full fiscal year to be completed as 2010, not all firms are on December fiscal years, this can cause discontinuities in the data, particularly around this time of year. The data is based on FY1, not based on 2011, even though I may call it 2011 in the report. All numbers, including historical ones, reflect the current composition of the S&P 500, thus some historical numbers may differ from those reported by S&P which are based on the composition of the index at the time of the reports.

620,ARNC,"Key Points:4Q earnings season off to good start, but it's still very early. Median surprise of 6.07% and surprise ratio of 2.50 for EPS, 0.625% and 2.29 for revenues.Strong earnings season for third quarter -- a median EPS surprise of 5.00%, and a 3.78 surprise ratio. While those numbers are down from earlier in the reporting season, they are still very good. Total of 359 positive surprises and just 95 disappointments. Positive year-over-year growth for 379, falling EPS for 117 firms, 3.24 ratio. 71.8% of all reporting firms do better than expected, 75.8% report positive year over year growth. Total net income reported up 25.3%.Third quarter Sales Surprise ratio at 1.50, median surprise 0.79%; 56.6% of all firms do better than expected on top line. Revenue growth healthy at 8.12%.Reported fourth quarter earnings growth of 25.4%, expected year-over-year growth of 19.8% for the vast majority of firms yet to report. On the Revenue side, 10.1% reported, but just 3.0% expected for those yet to report.Net margins expected to expand to 8.85% (among yet to report) from 7.38% a year ago, but down from 9.11% in third quarter. Excluding Financials margins expected to rise to 8.20% from 7.97% a year ago, but down from 8.80% in the third quarter.Full-year total earnings for the S&P 500 expected to jump 42.9% in 2010, 15.1% further in 2011. Growth to continue in 2012 with total net income expected to rise 12.0%Total revenues for the S&P 500 expected to rise 4.03% in 2010, 5.38% in 2011 and 5.58% in 2012. Excluding financials, revenues expected to be up 8.18% in 2010, 5.88% in 2011 and 5.54% in 2012.Twelve sectors expected to post double-digit earnings growth in 2011, 11 double-digit growers in 2012. Cyclical Construction, Industrial and Materials sectors all expected to post growth of over 30% in 2011.Net Margins marching higher, from 5.88% in 2008 to 6.39% in 2009 to 8.72% expected for 2010, 9.18% expected for 2011 and 10.19% in 2012. A major source of earnings growth. Net margins ex-financials 7.79% in 2008, 7.11% in 2009, 8.25% expected for 2010, 8.83% in 2011, and 9.31% in 2012.Revisions ratio for full S&P 500 at 1.71 for 2011, at 1.58 for 2012, both bullish readings. Ratio of firms with rising to falling mean estimates at 1.62 for 2011, 1.61 for 2012, also positive readings. Total revisions activity near seasonal lows and will expand dramatically over the next few weeks.  Current sample size is very thin.S&P500 earned $544.3 billion in 2009, expected to earn $778.5 billion in 2010, $896.4 billion in 2011. Major milestone expected for 2012 as the total earnings for the S&P 500 are expected to top the $1 Trillion mark of the first time at 1.003 Trillion.S&P 500 earned $57.64 in 2009: $82.18 in 2010 and $95.06 in 2011 expected bottom up.

"
621,ARNC,"With the strong third quarter earnings season now well behind us, the focus turns to the fourth quarter season which kicks off this week when Alcoa (AA), Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and J.P. Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report) report. We have already had a handful (24) of S&P 500 firms report, but they were mostly firms with November fiscal period ends, with a high proportion of retailers in the mix.
"
622,ARNC,"While far from a representative sample, the early reports are encouraging, with total net income for those firms rising 25.4% over a year ago. The early median surprise of 6.07% is also quite strong, although the ratio of positive to negative surprises is a bit weaker than normal at just 2.50%. However, those numbers are always extremely volatile in the early going and it is far too early to draw any real conclusions about the quarter.Positive Expectations
"
623,ARNC,"Most of the focus should be on the expectations for those who have yet to report. There the expectations are also positive, particularly on the earnings front. Total net income is expected to rise 19.8% over year-ago levels. While that is a slowdown from the year-over-year growth of the third quarter (25.1%), it is well above the growth that was expected for the third quarter just before the third quarter reporting season really got underway (15.5%).
"
624,ARNC,"Given that positive earnings surprises almost always outnumber disappointments, one does not need an overly active imagination to envision that growth will be close to 25% again when all is said and done for the quarter. Revenue growth, though, is expected to slow down significantly to an actual slight decline of 0.09% from positive growth of 8.01% in the third quarter. On the other hand, revenue growth among the handful that have reported is very healthy at 10.1%.
"
625,ARNC,"The financials are a big part of the overall revenue growth slowdown, but not the entire story. Excluding them, revenue growth is expected to slow to 3.02% year over year from 9.12%. Tougher year-over-year comparisons are a bigger part of the story.Net Margin Expansion
"
626,ARNC,"Thus, the stellar earnings growth is mostly due to the continued expansion of net margins. Much of the year-over-year margin expansion is due to the financials, were the whole concept of revenues is a bit different from most companies, and thus the concept of net margins is also a bit different.
"
627,ARNC,"However, even if the financials are excluded, net margins continue to march northward, at least year over year. For the S&P 500 as a whole, net margins are expected to be 8.85% in the fourth quarter, up from “just 7.38% a year ago, but down from 9.11% in the third quarter. If the financials are excluded, margins are expected to rise to 8.20% from 7.97% a year ago but down from 8.80% a year ago. Those numbers are for the vast majority that have yet to report.
"
628,ARNC,"The reported net margins among the 24 early birds are 3.56%, up from 3.14% a year ago but down from 3.76% in the third quarter. Fully one third of all the companies that have reported are retailers, however, and retailers tend to have low margins.Forecasts for 2010 & 2011
"
629,ARNC,"The expectations for the full year are very healthy, with total net income for 2010 expected to rise to $778.5 billion in 2010, up from $544.3 billion in 2009. In 2011, the total net income for the S&P 500 should be $896.4 billion, or increases of 42.9% and 15.1%, respectively.
"
630,ARNC,"If the early expectations for 2012 prove to be correct, that year will mark two significant milestones. Total net income is expected to reach $1.0036 Trillion, marching passed the $1 Trillion level for the first time ever. That will also put the “EPS for the S&P 500 over the $100 “per share level for the first time at $106.15. That is up from $57.64 for 2009, $82.18 for 2010, and $95.06 for 2011.
"
631,ARNC,"In an environment where the 10-year T-note is yielding just 3.32%, a P/E of 15.5x based on 2010 and 13.4x based on 2011 earnings looks attractive. Much of the $600 billion in newly created money from QE2 is likely to eventually find its way into the equity market (not directly, but eventually).
"
632,ARNC,"Historically, the year after mid-term elections has almost always been a good one for the stock market. The extension of unemployment benefits and the one-year cut in the payroll tax should be stimulative to the economy (the extension of the high-end tax cuts is only slightly stimulative relative to letting them expire, and certainly does not provide any fresh stimulus to the economy). A stronger economy should allow earnings to continue to rise.A Few Caveats
"
633,ARNC,"On the other hand, there is a very real prospect of total political gridlock, which would greatly raise uncertainty about governmental policy and the strength of the economy that could undermine confidence. As Shakespeare said: “Beware the ides of March. That is approximately when the U.S. will hit its current debt ceiling. If it is not raised, the U.S. Government would go into at least a technical default on its debt, and the government would probably have to shut down.
"
634,ARNC,"That is hardly something that will inspire confidence in the markets. While it is inconceivable that it will not eventually be passed, it is an opportunity for major political theater, and there is a chance that there will be a delay between the debt ceiling being hit and when it gets raised.
"
635,ARNC,"The economy does seem to have made a slow turn towards recovery. However, job creation remains very sluggish. Most of the real growth in the economy has come from higher productivity, not more hours being worked. Those productivity gains are accruing to capital, not labor, and are a major reason behind the strong earnings growth.Earnings Growth to Power Forward
"
636,ARNC,"Still, companies are expected to continue growing their earnings nicely, and the 15.1% expected growth for 2011, if achieved, means that the total earnings for the S&P 500 should hit a new record by the middle of next year. The fact that analysts are, on balance, still raising estimates for 2011, increases the odds that that growth will be achieved. Growth of 15.1% is not exactly awful.
"
637,ARNC,"Even on the revenue side the expected growth in 2011 of 5.38%, or 5.88% if one excludes the financial sector, is still pretty solid. Clearly the analytical community is not expecting the economy to turn south again.Scorecard & Earnings SurpriseOnly 24 firms (4.8%) have reported, and most of those have November fiscal period ends.Off to a good start with a median surprise of 6.07%, and a 2.50 surprise ratio (15 beats, 6 misses), 62.3% of all firms beat expectations.Positive year-over-year growth for 19, falling EPS for 5 firms, 3.80 ratio, 79.2% of all firms reporting have higher EPS than last year.Total net income up 25.43% among those that have reported.Seven sectors have yet to have any firms report -- five more have only a single report in.
"
638,ARNC,"Historically, a “normal earnings season will have a surprise ratio of about 3:1 and a median surprise of about 3.0%. Thus in the early going we are doing much better than average on the median front, and about average on the ratio front. Early on the ratios and medians can be very volatile, but it looks like an OK start to things. Pay attention to the percent reporting in evaluating the significance of the sector numbers.Scorecard & Earnings Surprise 4Q Reported Income Surprises Yr/YrGrowth %Reported SurpriseMedian EPSSurpPos EPSSurpNeg #GrowPos #GrowNegBasica Materials 176.92% 4.35% 100.00 1 0 1 0Finance 306.98% 1.28% 52.38 1 0 1 0Computer and Tech 39.90% 8.57% 8.45 4 1 6 0Industrial Products -6.67% 5.00% 8.11 1 0 0 1Consumer Discretionary 24.12% 6.06% 6.25 1 1 2 0Business Service 6.35% 5.26% 5.71 1 0 1 0Retail/Wholesale 15.00% 17.78% 4.39 5 2 7 1Consumer Staples -2.98% 7.89% 0.00 1 1 1 2Transportation -17.97% 11.11% -11.45 0 1 0 1Medical na 0.00% na Na Na na NaAuto na 0.00% na Na Na na NaConstruction na 0.00% na Na Na na NaConglomerates na 0.00% na Na Na na NaAerospace na 0.00% na Na Na na NaOils and Energy na 0.00% na Na Na na NaUtilities na 0.00% na Na Na na NaS&P 25.43 4.80% 6.07 15 6 19 5Sales SurprisesSales Surprise ratio at 2.29, median surprise 0.652%, 66.6% of all firms do better than expected on top line.Growing Revenues outnumber falling revenues by ratio of 3.80, 79.2% of firms have higher revenues than a year ago.Revenue growth very healthy at 10.1% but still greatly lags earnings growth pointing to net margin expansion (see net margin tables below).

I would pencil in year-over-year earnings growth of closer to 25% by the time all is said and done.Quarterly Growth: Total Net Income Expected Income Growth ""SequentialQ1/Q4 E"" ""SequentialQ4/Q3 E"" Year over Year 4Q 10 E Year over Year 1Q 11 E Year over Year 3Q 10 AFinance -0.58% 0.77% 187.43% -5.85% 28.72%Industrial Products 11.93% -15.52% 44.51% 41.70% 53.07%Transportation -12.72% -3.59% 33.08% 28.25% 60.83%Oils and Energy 5.77% 4.47% 28.29% 14.11% 36.66%Basic Materials 37.87% -7.94% 19.97% 33.48% 44.11%Auto 8.18% -8.20% 13.64% 8.55% 90.75%Construction -3.90% -27.28% 9.59% 4.60% 1148.57%Computer and Tech -11.95% 3.15% 8.88% 8.94% 43.85%Business Service 5.34% 3.77% 8.31% 19.85% 15.95%Consumer Staples -2.59% -9.74% 2.92% 4.92% 5.83%Medical 10.47% -8.65% 2.17% 1.09% 10.96%Consumer Discretionary -7.68% 1.20% 2.06% 0.80% 16.06%Utilities 25.50% -29.47% 0.76% 0.47% 6.37%Conglomerates 2.22% -11.45% -6.68% 18.59% 6.20%Aerospace -5.80% -0.56% -11.53% 8.13% 144.50%Retail/Wholesale 25.99% 2.52% -19.26% 31.56% 8.72%S&P 3.43% -3.98% 19.83% 7.55% 25.07%Quarterly Growth: Total Revenues ReportedEarly Revenue growth very strong at 10.1%, but that is down from the 11.2% growth the same firms posted in the third quarter.Sequentially revenues 3.1% lower than in the third quarter.Still a very thin sample, especially at the individual sector level.Quarterly Growth: Total Revenues Reported Sales Growth ""SequentialQ1/Q4 E"" ""SequentialQ4/Q3 A"" Year over Year 4Q 10 A Year over Year4Q 10 E Year over Year 3Q 09 AComputer and Tech 10.77% 6.93% 38.12% 26.60% 49.52%Transportation 6.14% 1.85% 12.05% 10.87% 18.08%Consumer Discretionary 7.60% -13.14% 9.55% 8.19% 7.43%Basic Materials 84.10% -6.30% 7.84% 4.06% 3.94%Retail/Wholesale 1.32% -7.49% 7.09% 5.67% 7.05%Industrial Products 1.39% 1.41% 5.88% 5.10% 3.59%Business Service 0.98% -1.16% 3.02% 3.74% 3.60%Consumer Staples -6.37% 13.58% -0.55% 1.75% -1.94%Finance -48.60% 28.24% -23.31% -42.11% -16.69%Medical na na na na naAuto na na na na naConstruction na na na na naConglomerates na na na na naAerospace na na na na naOils and Energy na na na na naUtilities na na na na naS&P 6.96% -3.13% 10.10% 7.70% 11.21%Quarterly Growth: Total Revenues ExpectedTotal revenue for the remaining S&P 500 firms expected be essentially flat in the fourth quarter relative to a year ago. That marks a very significant slowdown from the 8.0% growth posted by these firms in the third quarter.Five sectors expected to post lower revenues than a year ago, eleven higher. Revenue for the financials is the principal source of the revenue slowdown. Low interest rates depress interest income, which is a major part of financials revenue, but also reduce interest expense. As a result, revenues at financials are notoriously flakey.Excluding financials, total revenues expected to grow 3.02%, down from 9.12% in the third quarter.Three sectors expected to post double-digit revenue growth in the third quarter. All of which also posted double-digit growth in the second quarter and are expected be among the leaders again in the first quarter.Quarterly Growth: Total Revenues Expected Sales Growth ""SequentialQ1/Q4 E"" Sequential Q4/Q3 E Year over Year4Q 10 E Year over Year1Q 11 E Year over Year3Q 10 AIndustrial Products -3.09% 1.23% 20.77% 11.75% 23.60%Transportation -3.48% 0.00% 12.33% 9.29% 16.29%Computer and Tech -6.79% -0.22% 10.08% 7.86% 18.37%Basic Materials 4.85% 0.00% 9.46% 10.39% 17.80%Oils and Energy 3.28% 0.00% 7.74% 9.07% 16.11%Utilities 0.59% 0.00% 7.39% 1.06% 5.59%Business Service -3.29% 0.63% 5.92% 6.49% 7.34%Consumer Discretionary -9.85% -0.78% 3.76% 2.27% 2.49%Medical -0.10% -0.03% 2.40% 3.19% 8.56%Conglomerates -10.48% 0.00% 1.37% 0.15% -0.11%Aerospace -7.59% 0.00% 1.23% 3.57% 2.36%Consumer Staples -7.33% 0.16% -3.92% -4.35% 3.99%Construction -4.13% 0.00% -3.95% 3.91% 3.06%Retail/Wholesale 8.28% -9.84% -6.32% 12.51% 3.16%Auto 0.24% 0.00% -6.86% 2.20% 5.02%Finance 0.16% 0.00% -18.40% -22.33% 1.93%S&P 500 -0.44% -1.54% -0.09% 1.57% 8.01%Excl Financials -0.52% 1.99% 3.02% 5.98% 9.12%Quarterly Net Margins ReportedSector and S&P net margins are calculated as total net income for the sector divided by total revenues for the sector.Net margins for S&P 500 expand to 3.56% from 3.14% a year ago, but down from 3.76% in the third quarter.

"
641,ARNC,"The table below shows the S&P 500 firms with the biggest increases in their FY1 (mostly 2010) mean estimate over the last 4 weeks. To qualify there must be more than 3 estimates for FY1, and have a mean estimate of more than $0.50. In addition, to the change in the mean estimate, the net percentage of estimates being raised is shown for both FY1 and FY2, as well as the P/E ratios based on each year’s earnings is shown.
"
642,ARNC,"Note that estimate momentum and value are not mutually exclusive. The most interesting of these firms will be where the net revisions percentage (#up-#dn/Tot) is more than 0.50 but less than 1.00. Big mean estimate changes based on a handful of individual revisions are suspect, but could prove to be the most interesting if other analysts follow suit. On the other hand, if all the analysts have raised their estimates already, the mean estimate is less likely to rise again over the next month.Biggest FY1 Revisions Company Ticker %ChCurr Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  %ChNext Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  # Up-Dn/Tot%ChCurr Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  # Up-Dn/Tot%ChNext Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  P/E usingCurr FY Est P/E usingNext FY EstJabil Circuit JBL 14.49% 12.75% 1.00 0.88 10.76 9.26Ak Steel Hldg AKS 12.52% 3.40% 0.27 0.17 27.65 12.11Utd States Stl X 10.38% 3.35% 0.36 0.13 20.37 11.65Newmont Mining NEM 8.15% 14.12% 0.29 0.15 11.85 11.85Adobe Systems ADBE 7.94% 8.30% 1.00 0.50 16.51 14.45Hcp Inc HCP 7.90% 17.59% 0.63 0.83 14.90 13.23Murphy Oil MUR 7.47% 2.01% 0.43 0.25 11.71 10.46Pall Corp PLL 6.80% 6.25% 1.00 0.90 19.04 16.77Hess Corp HES 6.46% 7.06% 0.24 0.00 12.85 11.64Tesoro Corp TSO 6.33% -0.76% 0.35 0.25 12.61 9.16Oracle Corp ORCL 5.72% 5.41% 0.94 0.93 15.46 13.89Discover Fin Sv DFS 5.62% 7.30% 0.38 0.25 9.81 8.79Motorola Solutn MSI 5.30% -14.40% 0.17 0.00 12.88 10.96First Solar Inc FSLR 5.19% 4.32% 0.55 0.29 14.91 11.97Freept Mc Cop-B FCX 5.18% 1.92% 0.29 0.09 11.14 11.45Data in this report, unless stated otherwise, is through the close on Thursday 1/06/2011.

"
645,ARNC,"Earnings Preview 1/07/11
"
646,ARNC,"Next week marks the semi-official start of fourth-quarter earnings season. Things will be getting off to a slow start, with only 37 firms due to report, but 6 of those will be S&P 500 firms. We define any fiscal period ending in November, December and January to be the fourth quarter, and many of those reporting have November fiscal period ends.
"
647,ARNC,"While there are a not a lot of reports, the reports we get will provide some early clues on the fourth quarter. The firms reporting next week include Alcoa (AA), Apollo Group (APOL), Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), Lennar (LEN  -  Free Report) and Supervalu (SVU  -  Free Report). That is an interesting cross-section of the market that may provide clues to the overall direction of the economy.
"
648,ARNC,"While things will be quiet on the earnings side, the same is not true of the economic data front. We will get the reads on the two deficits, Budget and Trade, as well as inflation at both the producer and consumer levels. In addition, data on Retail Sales and Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization is due out. All of those data points have the potential to move the markets.MondayNothing of significance.TuesdayWholesale inventories are expected to have risen by 1.3% in November. That is a fairly large increase, especially coming on top of a 1.9% rise in October.WednesdayThe Budget deficit has been trending down over the last year, but the recent deal to extend the Bush tax cuts for everyone, as well as extending unemployment benefits and cutting the payroll tax by 2% will reverse that, but probably not by too much in December. The Budget deficit is extremely seasonal, but the data is not seasonally adjusted, thus the month-to-month comparisons are worse than useless. The budget deficit for December 2010 is likely to be close to the $91.4 billion of red ink the Federal Government spilled a year ago. If I had to bet on the direction, it is more likely to be lower than higher than it was last year as the economy has been recovering and that should aid revenue collection, but a minor move in either direction relative to last year would not surprise me. For fiscal 2011 as a whole the budget deficit is likely to be higher than for fiscal 2010 ($1.3 trillion) thanks to the Obama-GOP deal.The Fed will release its Beige Book, which is a collection of mostly anecdotal evidence from around the country. The tone of the books has generally been improving over the last year and I would expect that trend to continue.ThursdayThe Producer Price Index (PPI) is expected to have increased by 0.7% in December, down slightly from the 0.8% increase it posted in November. Most of the increases are likely to come from higher food and especially energy prices. Strip out those volatile components and the increase is expected to be only 0.2%, down from 0.3% last month. Those numbers are for finished goods. The report also includes data on prices further up the production chain. Most likely the increases at the intermediate and crude levels of production will be higher, indicating potential price pressures down the road.Initial Claims for Unemployment Insurance have finally broken out of the trading range they were in for most of 2010, and have done so to the downside (that’s good). There was a massive drop over the Christmas week, but that was partially reversed last week. Last week they rose to 409,000 an increase of 18,000. The Christmas week number was the first drop below the 400,000 level in this cycle, but it proved to be too good to be true. The consensus is looking for the reversal to continue with a rise to 420,000. We probably need to see them fall below 400,000 and stay there to signal the economy is adding enough jobs to finally bring down the unemployment rate. We are getting closer, but are not there yet.Continuing claims have also in a downtrend of late, but the path has been erratic. Last week they fell by 47,000 to 4.103 million. That is down 897,000 from a year ago. Some of the longer term decline due to people simply exhausting their regular state benefits, which run out after 26 weeks, but even extended claims have started to decline (erratically) as well. Federally paid extended claims fell by 23,000 to 4.507 million, and down 950,000 from a year ago. Looking at just the regular continuing claims numbers is a serious mistake. Make sure to look at both sets of numbers!  Many of the press reports will not, but we will here at Zacks.The Trade Deficit is expected to rise to $40.6 billion for November from $38.7 billion in October. That would reverse a two-month trend of lower trade deficits and would be bad news. The change in the trade deficit directly impacts GDP growth, and the recent improvement has been one of the more positive things going on in the economy. The level of the deficit is a disaster, even at the October level. The reason we are so far in debt to the rest of the world is the trade deficit, not the budget deficit. The current levels are simply unsustainable over the long term. A weaker dollar would help the cause of bringing it down significantly, but can’t do the trick all by itself. About half the trade deficit is due to our addiction to imported oil, and as the dollar weakens, the price of oil tends to rise, offsetting any potential improvement from the weaker dollar (at least on the oil import side). Until we solve our addiction to imported oil, we are unlikely to eliminate the trade deficit. If we don’t eventually eliminate the trade deficit (and hopefully run trade surpluses), the country will go bankrupt. Moving to using more Natural Gas (lots of Domestic Supply) as a transportation fuel would be a great help in the medium term, but we need to start working on it soon, and it will need leadership from the Federal Government to make it happen.FridayThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) is expected to rise by 0.4% in December after being up only 0.1% in November. Inflation has been very tame over the last year. Most of the acceleration is expected to come from the volatile food and energy components of the index. Stripping them out to get to the core CPI, the increase is expected to be only 0.1%, matching the November increase. Rent and Owners Equivalent Rent together make up over 30% of the overall CPI, and more than 40% of core CPI and are likely to be either unchanged or up just 0.1% as they have been for the last year or so, thus keeping the overall increase in inflation very low.Retail Sales are expected to have increased by 0.7% in December on top of a 0.8% increase in November. While this is a very broad measure of Consumer Spending, not just what goes on at the malls, based on the relatively week results posted by some of the major retail chains this week, I would have to take the under on this number. The East Coast snow storm probably didn’t help matters either. Excluding autos, sales are expected to have risen 0.6% down from a 1.2% increase in November. The sales reports from the auto companies earlier this week were better than expected, so I wouldn’t be surprised if the ex-autos number is weaker than expected, even if the headline number does manage to meet or even exceed expectations.The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment index is expected to rise to 75.0 from 74.5 last month. I think that this is a vastly over rated economic indicator, but it can occasionally move markets. While how the consumer feels is theoretically very important, what consumers actually do, and what they say in these surveys are often very different. Still, better to see it move up than down. The level is still well below what is seen in a healthy economy.Finally, we get what I think is one of the most important reports of the week, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization. Industrial Production is expected to have increased by 0.4% in December matching its November rise. The headline number can sometimes be distorted by the weather, as it includes the output of Utilities. Given the relatively cold (relative to normal, not just getting colder because it is December, not November) weather in December, we might get a bit of an “artificial boost to the overall number. It is thus best to look at what is happening in just manufacturing output as well as the overall number. Capacity Utilization can suffer from the same weather related problems that Industrial Production can. Still, it is a very good gauge of the economy, particularly if one just looks at factory utilization. Since the end of the recession, capacity utilization has staged a dramatic comeback, but that is from disastrously low levels. The expected 75.5% level (overall, factory only consistently runs slightly below the overall number) is about as low as we got at the bottoms of most recessions prior to the Great Recession. It indicates that there is still very significant slack in the economy and provides the green light to the Fed to keep the Fed Funds rate pegged at zero and to implement the $600 billion QE2 program.Potential Positive or Negative Surprises
"
649,ARNC,"Historically the best indicators of firms which are likely to report positive surprises are a recent history of positive surprises and rising estimates going into the report. The Zacks Rank is also a good indicator of potential surprises. While normally firms that report better-than-expected earnings rise in reaction, that has not been the case so far this quarter.

651,ARNC,"Next week is the “official start of the third quarter earnings season. However, Alcoa (AA), the place kicker that gets the game started will not report until Thursday. Thus, we still have a pretty light earnings release schedule, with a total of only 33 firms, but that includes 8 from the S&P 500.

652,ARNC,"We define any fiscal period ending in August, September and October to be the third quarter. So we have already been getting some “pre-season games of firms with fiscal periods that end in August, but those have just been a trickle. The following week will bring the flood. However, the eight from the S&P 500, provide an interesting cross section of the market, including Costco (COST  -  Free Report), Marriott (MAR  -  Free Report), Monsanto (MO), Micron Tech (MU) and Pepsico (PEP  -  Free Report). Together they should give some interesting clues on the overall economy.
"
653,ARNC,"The focus of the week is going to be much more on jobs than on earnings. The most important report of the week will be the employment report on Friday. Before then, the market will be looking at the appetizers for that report like the ADP payroll numbers, and as always the weekly initial unemployment claims report.
"
654,ARNC,"We are likely to see an increase in both the number of people working, and in the unemployment rate. The rise in the unemployment rate will likely mostly come from an increase in the participation rate in the labor force. Changes in the unemployment rate are likely to have significant political implications as well with the midterm elections rapidly approaching.MondayNo major reports.TuesdayThe ISM Services Index is expected to come in at 52.2 for August, up from 51.5 in August, indicating that the non-manufacturing side of the economy is expanding at a very slow rate, but doing a little bit better than it was in August.WednesdayWe get the appetizer for the employment report in the form of the ADP employment survey. This is expected to show an increase of 18,000 private sector jobs in September, a nice improvement from the 10,000 jobs lost in August according to ADP. However, relative to the number of people looking for work, it is insignificant. As the firm that actually cuts the checks of most companies payrolls, ADP is in an excellent position to gauge the strength of the job market. But its numbers are often quite different, and usually lower, than the private sector jobs numbers that are reported by the BLS on Friday.Thursday Weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance come out. They fell by 16,000 in the last week, to 453,000. They have fallen in five of the last six weeks. After a huge downtrend from mid-April through the end of 2009, initial claims have been locked in a tight “trading range. Look for them to fall modestly next week, but stay within the trading range. We probably need for weekly claims (and the four week moving average of them) to get down to closer to 400,000 to signal that the economy is adding enough jobs to make a dent in the unemployment rate. A rate of over 500,000 signals that the unemployment rate is probably headed back up and a high probability of a double dip.Continuing claims have also in a downtrend of late. Last week they fell by 83,000 to 4.457 million. That is down 1.5538 million from a year ago. Some of the longer-term decline due to people simply exhausting their regular state benefits which run out after 26 weeks. Federally paid extended claims fell by 293,000 to 4.879 million. Looking at just the regular continuing claims numbers is a serious mistake. They only include a little over half of the unemployed now given the unprecedentedly high duration of unemployment figures. A better measure is the total number of people getting unemployment benefits, currently at 9.336 million, which is down 376,000 from last week. The total number of people getting benefits is now 262,000 below year-ago levels. Make sure to look at both sets of numbers! Many of the press reports will not, but we will here at Zacks.Consumer Credit outstanding (excluding mortgages) is expected to decline by $1.1 billion, after a $3.6 billion decline in July. Instead of spending, people are trying to pay down their credit card balances, and weak auto sales mean that people are on balance paying down their car loans more than new car loans are being made. The weakness in consumer credit has been going on for over a year, and that is highly unusual. Over the long term it is good that people are getting their personal balance sheets, well, a little more balanced. In the short term it is a major reason why the recovery has been so anemic.FridayThe most important report of the week is the employment report. Total payrolls are expected to fall by 15,000 after a decline of 54,000 in July. Census workers will continue to be laid off, but not as many as in August (there are not that many of them left). Private payrolls are expected to have increased by 50,000, down from 67,000 in July. That is not going to put much of a dent in the vast army of the unemployed. Revisions to prior months numbers will also be important. The unemployment rate is expected to tick up to 9.7%. Much of the change in the unemployment rate will depend on the civilian participation rate. If it continues to decline, the unemployment rate might stay where it is, but if the participation rate stops falling the unemployment rate will likely shoot upwards. The report is also expected to show that average hourly earnings increased 0.1% in September, down from a 0.3% gain in August. The average workweek is expected to be unchanged at 34.2 hours. Overall, that adds up to very weak report. Keep an eye on the duration of unemployment numbers. The median duration of unemployment fell in August to a still sky high level of 19.9 weeks. We need to see that continue downwards.Potential Positive or Negative Surprises

659,ARNC,">>
"
660,ARNC,"Overview
"
661,ARNC,"The Metals & Mining Industry encompasses the extraction (mining), as well as the primary and secondary processing of metals and minerals such as aluminum, gold, precious metals, coal and steel. The industry is oligarchic in structure, with a few producers accounting for the lion’s share of the output. The largest segment of the global metals market is iron and steel, followed by aluminum.
"
662,ARNC,"The iron and steel segment comprises more than half the industry in terms of volume. This industry includes metal ore exploration and mining services, iron and steel foundries for smelting, rolling, forging, spinning, recycling, stamping, polishing and plating of iron and steel products such as pipes, tubes, wire, spring, rolls and bars. Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal (MT  -  Free Report), the world’s largest steel producing company, produced 73.2 million tons in 2009, representing 6% of the world's steel output.
"
663,ARNC,"The precious metal and mineral industry consists of companies engaged in the extraction and primary processing of gold, silver, platinum, diamond, semi-precious stones, uranium and other rare minerals and ores, along with the cultivation of pearls. Anglo American Plc., the largest gold producer by market capitalization, dominates the gold industry.
"
664,ARNC,"Historically, the automotive and construction markets have been the largest consumers of metals, accounting for more than 50% of total demand. Other metal consumers include energy, electrical equipment, agricultural, domestic and commercial equipment and industrial machinery. Large automakers such as General Motors Corporation (GM), Ford Motor Company (F), Toyota Motor Corporation (TM  -  Free Report) and Honda Motor Company (HMC  -  Free Report) are big consumers of metals, chiefly steel and aluminum.Outlook
"
665,ARNC,"The global metal industry is cyclical, highly competitive and has historically been characterized by overcapacity (excess of supply over demand). Metal producers are subject to cyclical fluctuations in London Metal Exchange prices, general economic conditions and end-use markets. Individual company profitability depends on volume and operating efficiency. Large producers with huge resources are able to discover, develop new deposits and boost reserves, while smaller ones own few mines and concentrate on them.
"
666,ARNC,"Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) has historically been a critically important growth strategy for metal companies. While the slow economic recovery is a significant factor in short-term decisions regarding M&A activity, mining companies expect to make acquisitions over the next three years. The M&A activity is also supported by higher metal prices that have strengthened the financial positions of many mining giants.
"
667,ARNC,"Geographically, the Asia-Pacific region is witnessing higher production and consumption of metals, especially China and India. Per capita consumption levels in both these countries are calibrating to U.S./European levels, which could -- theoretically, at least -- double metal demand in the longer term. In recent years, capacity growth in China has significantly exceeded the growth in market demand. A continuation of this unbalanced growth trend or a significant decrease in China’s rate of economic expansion could result in the country increasing its metal exports.
"
668,ARNC,"Yet, we expect global metal demand to improve in the long term with the recovery of user industries. Developed regions such as the US and Europe are showing signs of recovery. Despite some concerns about its sustainability, China is expected to remain the largest consumer of metals in the future.Metals in Detail:Steel
"
669,ARNC,"As the major shareholder (about 60%) in the metals market, the steel industry was strongly affected by the global economic downturn. Massive over-capacity is one of the major headwinds for steel, which continues to weigh on prices. Moreover, the industry has witnessed a number of trade disputes involving the U.S., in particular, the imposition of tariffs of up to 30% on imported steel. Rising raw material prices -- iron ore and coal (metallurgical) -- are also a major concern for the steel industry. AK Steel Holding Corporation (AKS), for instance, expects a 65% rise in benchmark iron ore prices in the near term.
"
670,ARNC,"Demand in key metal consuming industries such as autos, shipbuilding and construction, continues to remain weak, forcing global metal producers to slacken output levels. While utilization levels have improved recently, steel makers were operating at less than 50% capacity last year. U.S. Steel Corporation (X  -  Free Report) -- the eighth largest steel producer in the world, the largest integrated steel producer headquartered in North America and one of the largest integrated flat-rolled producers in Central Europe -- slashed production by almost 37% in 2009, while Korean steel maker POSCO  had to scale down output by about 10.9%.
"
671,ARNC,"Steel demand is reviving slowly, with improving end-markets on the back of a recovering global economy. Steel giant ArcelorMittal and U.S. Steel are restarting furnaces or are planning to in the near future. Industry steel mill utilization rates have increased to above 70%. The current high in steel demand helped reverse losses for the third largest steel maker Steel Dynamics Inc. (STLD  -  Free Report) and the largest recycler of steel scrap in the U.S., Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report).
"
672,ARNC,"Steel Dynamics’ second-quarter earnings of 22 cents reversed losses of 8 cents recorded in the year-ago quarter. Similarly, Nucor reported a profit of 29 cents per share in the second quarter of 2010, in contrast to a net loss of 43 cents per share in the same quarter of 2009. The World Steel Association expects a 10.7% increase in global steel demand this year and a further 5.3% gain in 2011 compared to 2010 level. The impetus is mostly expected from a surge in Chinese steel demand, which is likely to grow 6.7% to 579 million tons in 2010.
"
673,ARNC,"But despite these improving trends, average selling prices are still struggling, as the pace of recovery in the U.S. and global markets is slow at best. The ongoing slowdown has marred prospects in the housing and construction sectors in the near term. AK Steel Holding Corporation (AKS), Nucor and Steel Dynamics have provided a bleak overall near-term price outlook, although they expect end-markets to stabilize.
"
674,ARNC,"Collectively, AK Steel, Nucor and ArcelorMittal have a Zacks #4 Rank (Sell) for the short-term (1 to 3 months), while we maintain our Neutral recommendation in the long term for all three, given the outlook for steel. However, Steel Dynamics holds a Zacks #5 Rank (Strong Sell) and has a long-term Underperform recommendation driven by a very weak earnings outlook.Gold
"
675,ARNC,"The outlook for investment is positive overall, with absolute levels of demand likely to remain well supported by continued economic and currency uncertainty, inflation concerns and the search for diversification. In 2009, global gold supply exceeded demand by 15%, reflecting favorable gold prices. However, based on the marginal improvement in the economic environment in 2010, the World Gold Council expects an increase in demand for jewelry, which in turn will help global gold demand. A potential shot in the arm for the precious metal is the expected increase in central bank gold holdings, primarily as a diversification play.
"
676,ARNC,"The value and wealth preservation attributes of gold continue to attract investors and consumers. Jewelry and investment demand in non-western markets continues to rebound from the low levels in 2009, while industrial demand has started to recover in response to an improvement in economic conditions. India, which alone consumes nearly 45%−50% of the world gold production, should drive demand for gold along with China in the next half of 2010. Chinese gold demand is expected to double in 10 years. Concerns over the recent European debt crisis have also led to strong buying of gold coins, bars and gold exchange traded funds in particular.
"
677,ARNC,"We saw gold demand and prices strengthen in the first six months of 2010, a trend that is likely to remain in place in the rest of the year. Higher prices bode well for gold producers, which should benefit giants such as Barrick Gold (ABX), Agnico-Eagle (AEM) and Goldcorp Inc. (GG  -  Free Report). However, gold producers Newmont Mining (NEM  -  Free Report) and Kinross Gold Corporation (KGC  -  Free Report) suffer from lower ore grades that subdue production levels, increase mining costs and offset the benefits of rising gold prices. Overall, the stock prices of gold producers are not expected to benefit much from this overall favorable commodity-price backdrop. This is reflected in our overall neutral view on the space.Aluminum
"
678,ARNC,"The aluminum industry is highly cyclical, with prices subject to worldwide supply and demand forces along with other influences. Aluminum prices at the LME have plunged around 20% from their April highs to $1,969 per ton. The greatest risk for aluminum producers would be a further decline in aluminum prices.
"
679,ARNC,"However, we expect aluminum demand to increase in the long term, outstripping supply growth with the improving end-markets. Leading aluminum producers such as Alcoa Inc. (AA), Paramount Gold and Silver Corporation (PZG  -  Free Report) and Aluminum Corporation of China (ACH) should benefit from the improving demand outlook.
"
680,ARNC,"In the medium to long term, Alcoa expects aluminum consumption to improve globally with improving automotive and packaging industries, one of the key consumer markets. Aluminum is widely used for packaging, beverage cans, food containers and foil products. The automobile market is also becoming increasingly aluminum intensive, benefiting from the recyclability and the light weight of the metal.
"
681,ARNC,"Alcoa now expects demand to grow about 10% to 12% in 2010. The aluminum giant predicts Chinese aluminum consumption to jump 21% and about 6.5% globally (excluding China) in 2010. Currently, Alcoa, Paramount Gold and Silver and Aluminum Corporation of China hold a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) supported by a long-term Neutral recommendation.Copper
"
682,ARNC,"Copper prices started on a downtrend in early July 2010 and are expected to remain volatile in the near term, which could be a major headwind for copper companies. Revenues and margins for copper producers like Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) and Southern Copper Corporation (SCCO  -  Free Report) were affected by the recent fall in copper prices and volumes, primarily driven by the slowing economic activities in China.
"
683,ARNC,"However, the long-term view is favorable. Market conditions are expected to be positive for copper in the next couple of years due to higher consumption of the metal in the developing nations. Copper companies that have a high leverage to copper prices will benefit immensely from the potential demand in copper in the developing markets.
"
684,ARNC,"The near-term headwinds led to the short-term Zacks #4 Rank (Sell) and Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) on Freeport and Southern Copper, respectively. However, both companies have a Neutral recommendation on a positive long-term outlook.                    
"
685,ARNC,"Key Points:Second quarter early indications positive. Only 5.2% of firms reporting, all with May fiscal period ends. Surprise ratio 3.40 with a 5.67% median surprise. The medians and ratios will swing dramatically in the early going and one must keep an eye on the percentage reporting when evaluating sector data. Total net income grows 37.3%.Sales Surprise ratio at 2.13, median surprise 0.25%; 68.0% of all firms do better than expected on top line.Total net income for the vast majority that have yet to report is expected to be 21.6% above second quarter of 2009 levels. Significant slowdown from the 48.0% growth those same firms had in the first quarter. A further slowdown to 18.2% growth expected in the third quarter.Total revenue growth for those yet to report expected to be 6.6%, down from the 12.1% the same firms reported in the first quarter. Still a very healthy level of revenue growth. Revenue growth expected to accelerate to 7.6% in the third quarter.Total earnings for the S&P 500 expected to jump 36.4% in 2010, 19.2% further in 2011.Autos, Finance, Basic Materials, and Energy expected to be earnings growth leaders in 2010. Construction expected to move from the red to the black. No sector expected to see earnings decline in 2010.Total revenues for the S&P 500 expected to rise 4.64% in 2010, 6.39% in 2011.Given 12.1% revenue growth in first quarter, and 6.6% and 7.6% expectations for second quarter and third quarters, implies slowdown in the fourth quarter (or increases in full-year estimates).Huge net margin expansion in 1Q expected to continue in 2010 and 2011.Revisions ratio for full S&P 500 at 0.73 for 2010, at 0.71 for 2011, both bearish readings. Ratio of firms with rising-to-falling mean estimates at 0.64 for 2010, 0.57 for 2011, both also bearish.S&P 500 firms earned a total of $544.8 billion in 2009, expected to earn $743.0 billion in 2010, $885.4 billion in 2011.S&P 500 earned $57.54 in 2009, $78.69 in 2010 and $93.88 in 2011 expected, bottom up.Top Down estimates: $80.32 for 2010, $90.95 for 2011.
"
686,ARNC,"The second quarter earnings season will be getting underway as this is published. Traditionally, Alcoa (AA) reporting is seen as the kickoff of the earnings season, but there are actually a few “pregame festivities.
"
687,ARNC,"We define the second quarter as any fiscal period ending in May, June or July, so there are actually a total of 26 (5.2%) of the S&P 500 firms with May fiscal periods that have already reported. This is hardly a representative sample since seven sectors have not had any firms report, and an additional five have had only a single firm report.
"
688,ARNC,"That being said, we seem to be off to a fairly solid start. The median surprise so far is 5.67%, and there have been 17 positive surprises and only 5 disappointments (surprise ratio of 3.40) as far as EPS is concerned. As for growth, the total net income of those 26 firms is 37.3% higher than it was a year ago. For those firms, that actually represents acceleration from the 25.5% growth they posted in the first quarter.
"
689,ARNC,"As far as the top line is concerned, the story is pretty similar. Positive surprises lead disappointments by 17 to 8, or a surprise ratio of 2.13 and a median surprise of 0.25%. Total revenue is 11.9% higher, acceleration from the 8.7% growth those same firms saw in the first quarter. In the early going, just a handful of firms being added to the mix can drastically change the ratios and the medians, so expect some volatility in the numbers over the next few weeks, and it is still too early to draw any firm conclusions, but the early indications look promising.Heading into Earnings Season Proper
"
690,ARNC,"Still, the focus has to be on the vast majority of firms that have yet to report and the expectations for them. For the 474 S&P 500 firms that are still to come, the total net income is expected to rise 21.6% from a year ago. That is pretty solid growth, even if it does represent a big slowdown from the 48.0% growth in the first quarter. The first quarter was in turn a big slowdown from the 120% growth in the fourth quarter.
"
691,ARNC,"However, the slowdown in growth really says much more about what was happening a year ago than what is happening now. Quite simply, there has probably never been as easy a comparison as the fourth quarter of 2008, and corporate earnings were not exactly shooting the lights out in the first quarter of 2009. Looking ahead to the third quarter, the comparisons continue to get tougher, and growth is expected to drop to 18.2%.
"
692,ARNC,"As for the top line, second quarter growth is expected to be 6.6%, a sharp slowdown from the 12.1% registered in the first quarter. A partial rebound to 7.6% growth is forecast for the third quarter. It should be noted that the revenue estimates, particularly for the quarters, is “thinner than it is for earnings.
"
693,ARNC,"Still, when you think about it, 6.6% revenue growth for the S&P 500 is a very healthy level. The 500 firms account for a very large percentage of economic activity in the country, and it is rather doubtful that nominal GDP will grow anything like 6.6% in the second quarter, especially with inflation all but non-existent.Upward Revisions, Big Misses or Slowdown?
"
694,ARNC,"The strong revenue growth numbers for the quarters are a bit at odds with the revenue growth forecasts for the full year, which are looking for growth of just 4.6% for all of 2010, and 6.4% in 2011. Either we are going to have a very big fall-off in revenue growth in the fourth quarter, or there are going to be a lot of revenue disappointments in the second and third quarters. Another possibility is that the full-year revenue growth estimates will rise significantly from here.
"
695,ARNC,"There is less of a discrepancy between the quarterly earnings forecasts and the annual outlook. For the full year, earnings are expected to grow 36.4% in 2010, with further growth of 19.2% in 2011. That is a big improvement over the 7.3% decline we saw in 2009, and a very big improvement over the 27.2% plunge in 2008. It means that earnings will have fully recovered by mid-2011, and that full-year 2011 earnings will be 9.7% above full-year 2007 earnings (before the Great Recession started). This is years before we are likely to see a full recovery in the job market.
"
696,ARNC,"Collectively, the 500 firms in the S&P 500 earned $544.8 billion in 2009, and that is going to grow to $743.0 billion this year and $885.4 billion in 2011. Translated into “EPS for the index, earnings are expected to rise from $57.54 in 2009 to $78.69 in 2010 and $93.88 in 2011.
"
697,ARNC,"In other words then, the S&P 500 is selling for 18.6x 2009 earnings, but just 13.6x 2010 and 11.4x 2011 earnings. By historical standards that is quite cheap. Normally, when interest rates and inflation are low, P/E ratios are higher than average. Well, we currently have some of the lowest rates of inflation in decades and interest rates are at near record lows.
"
698,ARNC,"It only costs the government 3.02% to borrow for 10 years. It is not hard to find good, solid blue-chip companies that are providing dividend yields of more than that, and not just a bunch of electric utilities either. Based on this year's earnings, the earnings yield is 7.35% and based on next year it is 8.77%.
"
699,ARNC,"Despite rapidly growing earnings, record low interest rates and very reasonable P/E ratios, surveys of investor sentiment are showing almost as much bearishness as back in the fall of 2008. The time to buy is when others are despondently selling, and the time to sell is when others are greedily buying. This is particularly true when the actual fundamentals are solid and when the market is simply depressed.
"
700,ARNC,"There is nothing more fundamental than earnings (OK, perhaps the balance sheets, but those look better than they have in decades as well, with about $1.8 trillion in cash sitting on them) and earnings look pretty good, or at least the expectations for them do.  Over the next few weeks we will see if those expectations are rational or not.Scorecard & Earnings SurpriseSecond quarter early indications positive. Only 5.2% of firms reporting, all with May fiscal period ends. Surprise ratio 3.40 with a 5.67% median surprise. The medians and ratios will swing dramatically in the early going, and one must keep an eye on the percentage reporting when evaluating sector data. Total net income to grow 37.3%.Ratio of positive to negative growth reports 2.71:1. Positive earnings growth in 73.1% of all firms reporting.
"
701,ARNC,"The first quarter was a great earnings season both relative to expectations and to the year-ago earnings levels, even somewhat better than the very strong fourth quarter, on balance. The second quarter is starting out strong, but it is still very early and the firms that have reported are far from a representative sample.Scorecard & Earnings Surprise Income Surprises Yr/YrGrowth %Reported SurpriseMedian EPSSurpPos EPSSurpNeg #GrowPos #GrowNegConstruction 322.22% 9.09% 2200.00 1 0 1 0Finance 315.12% 1.30% 200.00 1 0 1 0Computer and Tech 81.02% 8.33% 8.61 5 0 6 0Consumer Discretionary 9.25% 8.82% 6.67 2 0 2 1Consumer Staples 0.33% 10.81% 4.28 2 1 2 2Business Service 1.75% 5.26% 3.23 1 0 1 0Basic Materials -36.02% 4.35% 1.25 1 0 0 1Transportation 109.50% 11.11% 0.00 0 0 1 0Retail/Wholesale 11.32% 18.18% -0.04 4 4 5 3Medical na na na 0 0 0 0Auto na na na 0 0 0 0Industrial Products na na na 0 0 0 0Conglomerates na na na 0 0 0 0Aerospace na na na 0 0 0 0Oils and Energy na na na 0 0 0 0Utilities na na na 0 0 0 0S&P 37.34% 5.20% 5.67 17 5 19 7Sales SurprisesSales Surprise ratio at 2.13, median surprise 0.25%, 68.0% of all firms do better than expected on top line.More firms report growing than shrinking revenues, ratio 2.57:1, 72.0% of all firms report higher revenues than a year ago.Revenue growth healthy at 5.2%, but still greatly lags earnings growth pointing to net margin expansion.Tech appears to be early leader in revenue surprises.As with the income surprise data, it is still very early, and the results will change significantly over the coming weeks.

"
709,ARNC,"The table below shows the S&P 500 firms with the biggest increases in their FY1 (mostly 2010) mean estimate over the last 4 weeks. To qualify, the current mean estimate has to be greater than $0.50 and there must be more than 3 estimates for FY1. In addition to the change in the mean estimate, the net percentage of estimates being raised is shown for both FY1 and FY2, as well as the P/E ratios based on each year’s earnings is shown.
"
710,ARNC,"Note that estimate momentum and value are not mutually exclusive, and that two of the firms with the biggest positive estimate momentum have single digit P/Es based on FY1 earnings. The most interesting of these firms will be where the net revisions percentage (#up-#dn/Tot) is more than 0.50 but less than 1.00. Big mean estimate changes based on a handful of individual revisions are suspect, but could prove to be the most interesting if other analysts follow suit. On the other hand, if all the analysts have raised their estimates already, the mean estimate is less likely to rise again over the next month.Biggest FY1 Revisions Company Ticker %ChCurr Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  %ChNext Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  # Up-Dn/Tot%ChCurr Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  # Up-Dn/Tot%ChNext Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  P/E usingCurr FY Est P/E usingNext FY EstDiscover Fin Sv DFS 100.45% 9.41% 1.00 0.74 20.13 9.38Micron Tech MU 25.88% 15.02% 0.53 0.62 4.61 4.71Carmax Gp (Cc) KMX 14.13% 10.33% 1.00 0.86 13.42 12.65Natl Semicon NSM 12.96% 5.56% 0.81 0.47 10.45 9.96Jabil Circuit JBL 12.50% 28.28% 1.00 1.00 12.27 8.03Coventry Hlthcr CVH 9.77% 0.05% 0.75 0.06 7.47 7.52Sunoco Inc SUN 8.90% 4.82% 0.43 0.59 26.38 14.38Data in this report, unless stated otherwise, is through the close on Thursday 7/08/2010.

711,ARNC,"We use the convention of referring to the next full fiscal year to be completed as 2010; though not all firms are on December fiscal years, this can cause discontinuities in the data, particularly around this time of year. The data is based on FY1, not based on 2010, even though I may call it 2010 in the report. All numbers, including historical ones, reflect the current composition of the S&P 500, thus some historical numbers may differ from those reported by S&P which are based on the composition of the index at the time of the reports.

717,ARNC,"Earnings Preview 7/09/10
"
718,ARNC,"Next week is the official kick off for second quarter earnings. There will be just 77 firms reporting next week, but that includes 23 S&P 500 firms. What is lacking in quantity of firms reporting is more than made up by quality. The firms reporting are some of the biggest and most important bellwethers of the economy and slice across a wide spectrum of industries.
"
719,ARNC,"As always, leading off will be Alcoa (AA), but the lineup includes heavy hitters like Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), CSX Corp (CSX), Google (GOOG), General Electric (GE  -  Free Report), Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), J.P. Morgan (JPM) and Yum! Brands (YUM). While it will not be definitive, by the end of the week we should have a pretty good idea about how the second quarter earnings season is going to shape up.
"
720,ARNC,"In addition to the start of earnings season, there will be a fairly heavy dose of economic data, starting with the twin deficits on Tuesday and including important reports on inflation and industrial production. We also get a glimpse into the thinking at the Federal Reserve when the minutes of their last meeting are released.MondayNo reports of significance.TuesdayThe trade deficit is expected to be unchanged in May at $40.3 billion relative to April. It is the trade deficit, not the budget deficit, that drives how indebted we are to the rest of the world. About half of our trade deficit is due to our oil import bill.The Budget Deficit for June is expected to come in at $72.0 billion.WednesdayRetail sales are expected to have declined by 0.3% om June, on top of a 1.2% decline in May. This is a very broad measure of sales, and includes auto dealerships as well as the malls. Excluding autos sales are expected to have declined by 0.1% after a 0.8% decline in May.The Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee meeting minutes become available, which provides a look at the thinking behind the Fed’s decision to keep rates unchanged. It includes the economic forecasts of the Fed staff as well. No hard number to forecast, but it makes for some very interesting reading.Thursday Weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance come out. They fell 21,000 in the last week, to 454,000. After a huge downtrend from mid-April through the end of 2009, initial claims have become very erratic so far in 2010. Look for them to rise again next week, as we are now near the bottom of the range they have been in for several months. Longer term, we have made good progress, but not good enough. We probably need for weekly claims (and the four-week moving average of them) to get down to closer to 400,000 to signal that the economy is adding enough jobs to make a dent in the unemployment rate. We are a lot closer now than we were last spring when they were running north of 640,000 on a consistent basis, but still have a ways to go.Continuing claims have also been in a steep downtrend of late. Last week they fell by 224,000 to 4.413 million, and down 2.514 million from a year ago. Part of the longer term decline is due to people simply exhausting their regular state benefits, which run out after 26 weeks. Federally paid extended claims fell by 344,000 to 4.577 million. However that is due to even the extended claims running out as a bill to further extend benefits has been stalled in the Senate. Looking at just the regular continuing claims numbers is a serious mistake. They only include a little over half of the unemployed now given the unprecedentedly high duration of unemployment figures. A better measure is the total number of people getting unemployment benefits, currently at 8.990 million, which is down 568,000 from last week. The total number of people getting benefits is now, for the first time, below year-ago levels with a drop of 866,000. Make sure to look at both sets of numbers! Many of the press reports will not, but we will here at Zacks.The Producer Price Index (PPI) is expected to have risen by 0.1%, partially reversing a 0.3% decline in May. Inflation is extremely well contained, and indeed the bigger threat the economy faces right now is deflation. Stripping out food and energy prices to get to the core PPI, it is expected to have also risen by 0.1% after a rise of 0.2% in May.The Empire State Manufacturing index, one of the regional variations on the ISM type data is, expected to have fallen to 18.5 in Ju7ne from 19.57. That would indicate that manufacturing activity in New York State is still increasing (and positive reading indicates expansion) but at a slower rate than in May. In contrast, the Philadelphia Fed index is expected to rise to 8.6 from 8.0. The level of growth is lower in the mid Atlantic states than in New York, but it is expected to show a slight acceleration from May.Industrial Production growth is expected to have slowed to 0.2% in June from a robust 1.3% growth in May. However be careful to also look at the growth in Manufacturing output as well. The total Industrial production numbers include Utility output, which is often as much a function of the weather as it is of economic activity.Capacity Utilization is expected to have edged up to 74.2% from 74.1%. As with the Industrial Production numbers, be sure to look at the utilization in Manufacturing, as the overall number can be skewed by Utilities and the weather. The overall level of utilization is much improved from a year ago, but still at very depressed levels. Low levels of capacity utilization probably have far more to do with why businesses are not spending than any uncertainty about taxes and regulation. Why buy new machines when your existing machines are sitting idle? Why put up a new office building when the one across the street is half vacant?FridayInflation at the Consumer level is also expected to be very well contained. The Headline Consumer Price index (CPI) is expected to be unchanged in June after falling 0.2% in May. If food and energy costs are stripped out to get core inflation the index is expected to have risen 0.1%, matching its rise in May. Housing makes up more than 30% of the overall index and about 40^ of the core index and is a key reason that inflation is very well contained. Indeed the bigger risk to the economy at this point is deflation. The low inflation numbers give the Fed plenty of leeway to keep interest rates low for a very long time. Indeed they argue that the Fed should be even more aggressively handle monetary policy though quantitative easing.The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment index is expected to fall in June to a reading of 72.0 from 76.0. In theory the consumer sentiment and confidence indexes should be important since the consumer comprises 71% of the economy. However there is often a disconnect between what people say on these surveys and their actual behavior. Generally lower gasoline prices and higher stock prices drive the number higher, and higher gasoline and a lower stick market drive it down.

724,ARNC,">>
"
725,ARNC,"The Metals & Mining Industry encompasses the extraction (mining), as well as the primary and secondary processing of metals and minerals. The industry is oligarchic in structure, with a few producers accounting for the lion’s share of production.
"
726,ARNC,"Geographically, the Asia-Pacific region is witnessing higher production and consumption of metals, especially China and India. Their per capita consumption levels are graduating to U.S./European levels, which could -- theoretically, at least -- double metal demand in the longer term.
"
727,ARNC,"Historically, the automotive and construction markets have been the largest drivers of metal consumption, accounting for more than 50% of the total demand. Other metal consuming industries include energy, electrical equipment, agricultural, domestic and commercial equipment and industrial machinery. Large automakers such as General Motors, Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report), Toyota Motor Corporation (TM  -  Free Report) and Honda Motor Company (HMC  -  Free Report) are big consumers of metals, including steel and aluminum.
"
728,ARNC,"The steel industry, with companies engaged in the extraction of iron ore and coke coal for the processing of iron and steel, is a case in point. This industry includes metal ore exploration and mining services, iron and steel foundries for smelting, rolling, forging, spinning, recycling, stamping, polishing and plating of iron and steel products such as pipes, tubes, wire, spring, rolls and bars. ArcelorMittal (MT  -  Free Report), world’s largest steel producing company, produced 73.2 million tons in 2009, representing 6% of the world steel output.
"
729,ARNC,"The precious metal and mineral industry consists of companies engaged in the extraction and primary processing of gold, silver, platinum, diamond, semiprecious stones, uranium and other rare minerals and ores, along with the cultivation of pearls. The gold industry is dominated by Anglo American Plc., the largest gold producer by market capitalization.
"
730,ARNC,"In 2009, global gold supply exceeded global demand based on the rising gold prices. Supply surpassed demand by 15%. However, based on the marginal improvement in the economic environment in 2010, World Gold Council expects an increase in demand for jewelry, which in turn will help global gold demand to rise. Moreover, Chinese gold demand is expected to double in 10 years.OPPORTUNITIES
"
731,ARNC,"We expect the global metal demand to improve in the long term with the recovery of user industries. Despite some concerns about the sustainability of China’s growth profile, that country is expected to remain the largest consumer of metals in the future.
"
732,ARNC,"Despite the current slowdown in consolidation within the global metal industry, mergers and acquisitions (M&A) remain a critically important growth strategy for companies. While the economic downturn is a significant factor in short-term decisions regarding M&A activity, mining companies expect to make acquisitions over the next three years.
"
733,ARNC,"There was an upward movement in copper prices in recent months, primarily due to stockpiling in China . Market conditions are expected to be favorable for copper in the next couple of years due to higher consumption of the metal in the developing nations. Companies like Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX  -  Free Report), which have a high leverage to copper prices, will benefit immensely from the potential demand for copper in the developing markets.
"
734,ARNC,"We also expect aluminum demand to increase over the next three years, outstripping supply growth. As a result, the aluminum market is likely to see deficits for a prolonged period. This provides a backdrop supportive of high alumina and aluminum prices. Leading aluminum producers such as Alcoa Inc. (AA) should benefit from the improving outlook for aluminum and alumina prices.
"
735,ARNC,"The World Steel Association has forecasted a 10.7% increase in global steel demand in 2010 and 5.2% increase in 2011 compared to 2010 level. The increase will be driven by strong growth in Chinese steel demand. China's steel use is expected to increase by 6.7% to 579 million tons in 2010.
"
736,ARNC,"With steel demand picking up, steel producers are restarting facilities. Recently, U.S. Steel Corp. (X  -  Free Report) -- the eighth largest steel producer in the world, the largest integrated steel producer headquartered in North America and one of the largest integrated flat-rolled producers in Central Europe -- has restarted its blast furnace at its Hamilton, Ontario plant after a nine-month shutdown.
"
737,ARNC,"The current surge in steel demand will narrow losses for the third largest steel maker Steel Dynamics Inc. (STLD  -  Free Report) and the largest recycler of steel scrap in the U.S., Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report).
"
738,ARNC,"Gold’s value and wealth preservation attributes continue to attract investors and consumers. According to the World Gold Council, total demand for the metal is expected to rise in 2010. Jewelry and investment demand in non-western markets has rebounded from the low levels in 2009, while industrial demand has started to recover in response to an improvement in economic conditions.
"
739,ARNC,"The outlook for investment is positive overall, with absolute levels of demand likely to remain well supported by continued economic and currency uncertainty, inflation concerns and the search for diversification. We expect to see a continuing trend among central banks diversifying away from their dollar exposure in their reserves in favor of the proven store of value represented by gold. Barrick Gold Corporation (ABX) and Newmont Mining (NEM  -  Free Report) are showing strong levels of production.WEAKNESSES
"
740,ARNC,"The global metal industry is cyclical, highly competitive and has historically been characterized by overcapacity (excess of supply over demand). Overcapacity in the industry could increase the level of metal imports and squeeze metal prices. In recent years, capacity growth in China has significantly exceeded the growth in Chinese market demand. A continuation of this unbalanced growth trend or a significant decrease in China’s rate of economic expansion could result in China increasing metal exports.
"
741,ARNC,"Key metal consuming industries such as auto, shipbuilding and construction have experienced weak demand in the last year, forcing global metal producers to slacken production levels. U.S. Steel slashed production by almost 37% in 2009, while Korean steel maker POSCO  had to scale down output by about 10.9%.
"
742,ARNC,"As a whole, the steel industry posted weak results in fiscal 2009. U.S. Steel Corp. recorded a net loss of $1.4 billion, or $10.42 per share in 2009, in contrast to a net income of $2.1 billion or $17.96 per share in 2008. In 2009, commercial metals company AK Steel (AKS) posted a net loss of $74.6 million compared to a net income of $4.0 million in 2008.
"
743,ARNC,"Despite its relatively higher growth rate compared to the developed world, the outlook for the Indian economy suggests lower growth rates compared to the last few years. Nearly 45−50% of the world gold production is consumed in India. Gold is a luxury item in this economy, and the demand downtrend is most visible in large cities where gold is consumed. A slow-growth, low inflation and low interest-rate environment is a nightmare for the gold market.
"
744,ARNC,"Foreign currency is one of the major risks for gold producers, as they usually have their mining operations outside their countries. Revenues and costs for gold producers are primarily incurred in foreign currency. Kinross Gold (KGC  -  Free Report) is one of the top 10 gold producers, which has facilities in the U.S., Canada, Brazil, Chile, Russia and Africa. Although it has a diversified clientele, the operations are vulnerable to foreign currency risks. Hence, any adverse movement will affect cash flows and the profitability of the gold producer.
"
745,ARNC,"Despite a sharp rise in recent metal prices, future pricing remains uncertain, and we believe continued demand weakness, production resumption by some mills and lower iron ore and coking coal prices as in 2009 may drive prices down again.
"
746,ARNC,"Earnings Preview 4/9/10
"
747,ARNC,"Next week is the “kick-off for the first quarter earnings season. Of course, there are a few firms that have already reported, but all of them have February fiscal period ends, and should be considered part of the pre-game festivities.Alcoa (AA) will report on Monday after the bell and really get the game started. There are not a lot of companies reporting next week, only 61 in total, but what reports lack in quantity they will make up for in importance.
"
748,ARNC,"In addition to Alcoa, 20 more S&P 500 firms will report, including such important bellwethers as CSX (CSX  -  Free Report) in Transportation, JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) and Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) in Banking, Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and Google (GOOG) in Technology, and General Electric (GE  -  Free Report), which is probably the best one company proxy around for the overall U.S. economy.
"
749,ARNC,"The economic data calendar will also be potentially market-moving. We start out the week with the monthly Treasury budget numbers to see how big the deficit is, then get data on the Trade Deficit on Tuesday. On Wednesday, the focus shifts to Inflation as the CPI is released. Wednesday will also see the Retail sales numbers and the Fed Beige Book.
"
750,ARNC,"On Thursday, as always, we get the initial and continuing unemployment claims data. More importantly on Thursday will be the report on Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization. Finally, we finish out the week with Housing Starts and Building Permits, and well as the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment survey. Any one of those results has the potential to significantly move the markets.  Monday
"
751,ARNC,"•    The Treasury Budget is released. The headline number will be the size of the monthly deficit. However, it will be interesting to see how much of it comes from falling revenues vs. how much from increased spending, and where the spending is increasing. This data is highly seasonal, but is not seasonally adjusted. Thus, ignore the month-over-month comparisons, and focus on the year-over-year changes. In March of 2009, the Federal Government bled $191.6 billion in red ink, and will probably hemorrhage more this year.Tuesday
"
752,ARNC,"•    The Trade Deficit will be reported. In February it was $37.3 billion, an improvement over the $39.9 billion of January, but the improvement came for the wrong reasons -- both imports and exports fell. Look for the March deficit to be in the same neighborhood as the February shortfall, but with both imports and exports rising. Rising oil prices will be a major cause of the rise in imports.Wednesday
"
753,ARNC,"•    The Consumer Price Index will most likely remain very well controlled, particularly if one strips out food and energy prices. In February, the overall index was unchanged and the core rose just 0.1%. Look for headline to be well above the core in March thanks to higher energy prices. The core index is heavily influenced by housing costs, most notably rent and owners-equivalent rent. Look for those components to be either unchanged or down slightly. A higher-than-expected reading, particularly for the core, would be very bad news for the markets since it would raise expectations that the Fed would tighten sooner than people now expect. However, the current data suggests that Unemployment and slack capacity are still much bigger economic problems than inflation, and thus the Fed is likely to keep the Fed funds rate at its current near-zero level for at least the rest of 2010.  
"
754,ARNC,"•    Retail sales should be very strong in March, as evident by the extremely strong same-store sales reports from the major retail chains. Auto sales were also strong in March. Look for an acceleration from the overall rate of 0.3% growth in February and the 0.8% rate excluding autos.
"
755,ARNC,"•    The Beige Book comes out in the afternoon. It is a collection of mostly anecdotal data collected from the 12 Federal Reserve districts and provides some color on the economy. Look for it to show the economy to be recovering but from a very depressed overall level.Thursday 
"
756,ARNC,"•    Weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance come out. They rose 18,000 in the last week, to 460,000. After a huge downtrend from mid-April through the end of 2009, initial claims have become very erratic so far in 2010. Look for them to fall back modestly next week. Overall we have made good progress, but not good enough. We probably need for weekly claims (and the four-week moving average of them) to get down to closer to 400,000 to signal that the economy is, on balance, adding jobs. We are a lot closer now than we were last spring when they were running north of 640,000 on a consistent basis, but still have a ways to go.
"
757,ARNC,"•    Continuing claims have also been in a steep downtrend of late. However that is in part due to people simply exhausting their regular state benefits, which run out after 26 weeks. If one factors in the extended claims paid by the Federal government as part of the Stimulus program, claims soared last week. Looking at just the regular continuing claims numbers is a serious mistake. They only include a little over half of the unemployed now given the unprecedentedly high duration of unemployment figures. Last week regular continuing claims were 4.550 million, down 131,000 from the previous week. Extended claims (paid from Federal ARRA funds) were 5.808 million, a decrease of 224,000. Make sure to look at both sets of numbers! Many of the press reports will not, but we will here at Zacks.
"
758,ARNC,"•    Industrial Production should continue to rise in March, and at a faster pace than the 0.1% gain in February. Most of February’s gain came from Mining and Utility output, as manufacturing output actually fell 0.2%. Weather is often as much of a factor in Utility output as is the rate of economic activity. Gains should be more on the order of the gains seen in January when both overall industrial output, and manufacturing output climbed by 0.9%.
"
759,ARNC,"•    The same report will also show the rate of Capacity Utilization, which in February rose slightly to 72.7% overall, but slipped in Manufacturing to 69.0%. As with Production, the Utility utilization rate is often as much a function of Weather as economic activity, so see if the overall change is matched by the change for manufacturing. While Utilization rates have been trending upward over the last 8 months, they remain at extremely depressed levels, particularly for Manufacturing. The manufacturing rate would have to rise by 10 full percentage points just to get us back to the long-term average rates of utilization. It is very unlikely that core inflation will take off with utilization rates that depressed. These reports are very important and very under reported and it would be worth your while to pay attention to them.Friday
"
760,ARNC,"•    Housing remains the key thorn in the side of the overall economy. Traditionally residential investment is the key locomotive leading the economy out of recessions, but not this time. Housing starts dropped to an annual rate of just 575,000 in February, virtually unchanged from the year before. With New Home Sales Setting back-to-back record lows in January and February, it is likely that starts will continue to be very slow, as the last thing that builders want to do now is build a lot of speculative inventory. However, we might see some rise on a month-to-month basis since some housing starts might have been put off in February due to the snow storms. Also, most of the February decline in starts was in the very volatile apartment area.
"
761,ARNC,"•    Building Permits are the best leading indicator of housing starts. They were running at an annual rate of 612,000 in February, which would indicate some rise in housing starts in March. Look for a small increase in Permits in March.Potential Positive Surprises
"
762,ARNC,"Historically the best indicators of firms likely to report positive surprises are a recent history of positive surprises and rising estimates going into the report. The Zacks Rank is also a good indicator of potential surprises. While normally firms that report better-than-expected earnings rise in reaction, that has not been the case so far this quarter. While pickings are getting slim, some of the companies that have these characteristics include:Fairchild Semiconductor (FCS) is expected to report EPS of 0.23, up from a loss of $0.32 per share a year ago. Last time out, FCS posted a positive surprise of 35.3%, and over the last month the mean estimate for its fourth quarter earnings is up 2.43%. FCS has a Zacks #1 Rank.Peabody Energy (BTU) is expected to post EPS of $0.42, down from $0.50 a year ago. Last time, BTU beat expectations by 43.3%, and over the last month analysts have raised their estimates for the about to be reported quarter by 0.12%.

"
781,ARNC,"• Top-down estimates: $57.45 for 2009, $74.24 for 2010, 84.33 for 2011Welcome to the new Earnings Trends. We have decided to start focusing our analysis of the S&P 500 based on Zacks' own sector groupings rather than the S&P GICS sectors. There are 16 Zacks sectors and only 10 GICS sectors, so the new groupings will result in better granularity of the data. The old way simply grouped too many very different companies together. In addition, we for the first time are presenting top-line as well as bottom-line expectations and surprise information. We are now going to be focusing on 2010 earnings as being FY1 and 2011 being FY2. Keep that in mind if you are looking at this report and comparing it to previous editions of it. Also keep in mind that while we use the convention of referring to the next full fiscal year to be completed as 2010, not all firms are on December fiscal years, and this can cause discontinuities in the data, particularly around this time of year. The data is based on FY1, not based on 2010, even though I may call it 2010 in the report.While the “official start of earnings season was last week, only a handful of firms have their results for the fourth quarter in, and most of those are firms with November fiscal period endings. Only 6.0% of all S&P 500 firms had reported by the cut-off for this report.This week, things really start to gain momentum as 61 more S&P firms, or 12.2%, will report. Things are off to a solid start, even with the high profile miss by Alcoa (AA). Positive earnings surprises so far are outpacing disappointments by a ratio of 6.25 to 1, and the median surprise is 6.32%. Year-over-year earnings growth so far (total net income) is a massive 167.7%. That, however, says far more about what happened a year ago than what is going on today.The earnings growth number should come down as the earnings season progresses, but will remain the highest in recent memory by a very large margin. If we look at the expectations for the 94% of firms that have yet to report, their earnings are expected to be up 80%. Combined with the ones that have already come in, and the propensity for positive surprises, it means that to total net income for the S&P 500 in the fourth quarter of 2009 was probably roughly double that of the fourth quarter of 2008.Looking at full-year earnings, total net income is still expected to be lower than that of 2008, but just by 9.4%, a much smaller decline than the 22.2% plunge in 2008. Next year will be one of earnings recovery, with growth of 26.7% expected, but note that that will still leave earnings below 2007 levels.While the data is still relatively thin for 2011, and thus should be taken with a grain of salt, further growth of 20.4% is expected for total earnings in 2011. In 2010, the percentage growth numbers will be not really meaningful for the Auto and Construction sectors, since they will be going from negative total earnings to positive total earnings.In 2009, the losses were much lower than the losses in 2008. Among the larger sectors, Basic Materials and the Financials are expected to be the growth leaders for the year (Financials did the negative-to-positive thing in 2009). Energy is also expected to see a large rebound in its total profits. Together, Finance and Energy will account for more than half of all the incremental earnings in both 2010 and 2011, even though together they account for only slightly over 25% of the total market capitalization of the index. However, in the absence of mark-to-market rules, the quality of the earnings in the Financials is suspect.Cost-cutting has been the major force driving earnings and earnings surprises. However, the costs to one company are either the revenues of another company or someone’s paycheck, which is then spent to create revenues for firms. The bottom-up data coming out of all these individual firms seems to confirm what we have been getting from the macro statistics from the government: the economy is growing due to increases in productivity; higher GDP with fewer workers.While clearly companies cannot continue to grow earnings forever based only on cost-cutting, it does mean that when they do start to see revenue growth, earnings growth could be explosive as the greater operating leverage kicks in. That will sure be the case in the fourth quarter, as revenue is expected to increase by just 1.67%, as earnings double -- talk about net margin expansion!The revisions ratios for both 2010 and 2011 are strong, and should give us confidence that those growth rates will actually be achieved, if not exceeded (although it's still very early for 2011). The S&P 500 is selling for 15.1x consensus expectations for 2010, or an earnings yield of 6.62%, or almost twice the yield on the 10-year Treasury note. The S&P is selling for just 12.6x consensus expectations for 2011, although that consensus is still very thin. Stocks look very attractive, at least relative to bonds, at this point.Scorecard & Earnings Surprise

"
787,ARNC,"•    Year-over-year Earnings Growth Ratio (# Positive Growth/# Negative Growth) at 1.00In evaluating the data presented here, keep the percentage reported in mind. For some sectors, the sample size is extremely small. The move to the 16 Zacks sectors means that even when all reports are in, some of the sectors will still have relatively few firms in them. For firms with only a few reports in, the median surprise will be very volatile as new firms are added to the sample. This is particularly true now as only a handful of firms (mostly with November fiscal periods) have reported so far.Among the sectors with more than just a single report in, Tech and Retail are looking very strong -- each with 8 positive surprises and no disappointments. Finance has the highest earnings growth so far, at 322.1%, although only two have reported (JPM came in after the cutoff).Scorecard & Earnings Surprise Income Surprises Yr/YrGrowth %Reported SurpriseMedian EPSSurpPos EPSSurpNeg #GrowPos #GrowNegConstruction 42.50% 10.00% 53.57 1 0 1 0Consumer Discretionary -18.85% 6.45% 10.69 2 0 1 1Computer and Tech 131.72% 10.71% 8.33 8 0 4 5Retail/Wholesale 18.22% 17.02% 7.38 8 0 4 4Consumer Staples -28.92% 11.36% 6.21 4 1 4 1Transportation -30.02% 10.00% 2.80 1 0 0 1Industrial Products -16.67% 4.55% -7.14 0 1 0 1Finance 322.05% 2.60% -8.34 1 1 1 1Basic Materials 104.07% 4.76% -80.00 0 1 0 1Medical na 0.00% na na na na naAuto na 0.00% na na na na naConglomerates na 0.00% na na na na naAerospace na 0.00% na na na na naOils and Energy na 0.00% na na na na naUtilities na 0.00% na na na na naBusiness Service na 0.00% na na na na naS&P  167.71% 6.00% 6.32 25 4 15 15Sales Surprises

"
848,ARNC,"While the fourth-quarter 2009 earnings season goes into high gear this week, the reporting process itself got kicked off last week. But despite a couple of very good earnings announcements from marquee names, the market appeared to be unimpressed.  
"
849,ARNC,"We will try to decipher here this seeming contradiction and use it as our guide for what to expect from the market in the coming days. Shaky Start to the Earnings SeasonAlcoa (AA) grabs a lot of limelight for its earnings announcement each quarter as a reward for being the first out the gate. It is no doubt a major aluminum player and member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, but its overall status as representative of the larger U.S. economy is questionable at best.  
"
850,ARNC,"The company's disappointing results, marred as they were by a number of one-time items, did not help matters. The market found it difficult to get out of the gloomy mood that Alcoa brought, despite some strong efforts toward the end of the week by other Dow members Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and JP Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report). Intel and JP Morgan Come out with Strong Results
"
851,ARNC,"While Alcoa may not have been the only reason (or even a major reason) for last week's market weakness, we nevertheless need to make sense of the market's less-than-enthusiastic response to much better numbers from far more consequential players. 
"
852,ARNC,"After the market close on Thursday, semiconductor giant, Intel reported blowout fourth-quarter results, with both earnings and revenue coming ahead of expectations. Importantly, the company reported record gross margins in the 65% vicinity, reflecting impressive execution by the management team. Intel's outperformance was overshadowed the following day by impressive results from banking giant JP Morgan Chase. While the bank's revenue was on the soft side, earnings handily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. But the Market Was Unimpressed
"
853,ARNC,"The market appeared to be completely unimpressed by these back-to-back solid reports from major companies and finished the week down.   
"
854,ARNC,"A 'buy the rumor, sell the news' type of explanation would be an over-simplification here, in my view. It is the lack of a solid and favorable outlook from these companies that caused the weakness in the market. Managements have gotten used to providing cautious/conservative guidance and then coming ahead of them with their reports. 
"
855,ARNC,"Intel's results were excellent, but management's outlook was less than overwhelming. Intel's fourth-quarter gross margins reached record levels, but management guided towards lower levels in the coming quarters. Also, Intel's operating turnaround was not exactly news to the market either. After all, the stock has been the star performer in the current post-March 2009 market rally. As such, with its gross margins most likely headed in the wrong direction and management hesitant to provide a reassuring outlook, it is only natural for the market to show some doubt, as we saw on Friday.   
"
856,ARNC,"JP Morgan's case is along the same lines. As we touch upon in today's RoundTable Review titled ""It's All About Earnings"", management's inability to provide a visible roadmap going forward, particularly with respect to credit quality, was a major disappointment and more than offset the positive earnings outperformance. We should keep in mind that JP Morgan has been a standout among the money-center banks in the current downturn. As such, their outlook, or lack thereof, is more consequential to the market than some of their peers. What's the Take Away?
"
857,ARNC,"The key take-away is: While we got a good start on the earnings front, managements' habits/needs to control expectations by under-promising are getting in the way. It shouldn't be surprising to see tepid stock price responses to solid earnings announcements in the face of less robust or conservative outlooks.  
"
858,ARNC,"When all is said and done regarding the fourth-quarter earnings releases, we should see a year-over-year earnings growth rate of about 80%. For the full-year 2009, earnings would be down about 9% from the 2008 level. Based on current estimates, we should see a significant recovery in 2010, with an earnings growth rate of about 27%. Portfolio Changes
"
859,ARNC,"We did not make any changes to the Focus List or Growth & Income portfolios last week, though the Timely Buys portfolio had a number of additions/deletions.  
"
860,ARNC,"While our overall investment theme remains unchanged, we are looking for opportunities in the finance and energy sectors. Estimate revisions during and following the fourth-quarter earnings season are expected to provide us attractive entry points in quality names in these two spaces.

875,ARNC,"• Top-down estimates: $57.45 for 2009, $74.24 for 2010, 84.33 for 2011Welcome to the new Earnings Trends. We have decided to start focusing our analysis of the S&P 500 based on Zacks' own sector groupings rather than the S&P GICS sectors. There are 16 Zacks sectors and only 10 GICS sectors, so the new groupings will result in better granularity of the data. The old way simply grouped too many very different companies together. In addition, we for the first time are presenting top-line as well as bottom-line expectations and surprise information. We are now going to be focusing on 2010 earnings as being FY1 and 2011 being FY2. Keep that in mind if you are looking at this report and comparing it to previous editions of it. Also keep in mind that while we use the convention of referring to the next full fiscal year to be completed as 2010, not all firms are on December fiscal years, and this can cause discontinuities in the data, particularly around this time of year. The data is based on FY1, not based on 2010, even though I may call it 2010 in the report.While the “official start of earnings season was last week, only a handful of firms have their results for the fourth quarter in, and most of those are firms with November fiscal period endings. Only 6.0% of all S&P 500 firms had reported by the cut-off for this report.This week, things really start to gain momentum as 61 more S&P firms, or 12.2%, will report. Things are off to a solid start, even with the high profile miss by Alcoa (AA). Positive earnings surprises so far are outpacing disappointments by a ratio of 6.25 to 1, and the median surprise is 6.32%. Year-over-year earnings growth so far (total net income) is a massive 167.7%. That, however, says far more about what happened a year ago than what is going on today.The earnings growth number should come down as the earnings season progresses, but will remain the highest in recent memory by a very large margin. If we look at the expectations for the 94% of firms that have yet to report, their earnings are expected to be up 80%. Combined with the ones that have already come in, and the propensity for positive surprises, it means that to total net income for the S&P 500 in the fourth quarter of 2009 was probably roughly double that of the fourth quarter of 2008.Looking at full-year earnings, total net income is still expected to be lower than that of 2008, but just by 9.4%, a much smaller decline than the 22.2% plunge in 2008. Next year will be one of earnings recovery, with growth of 26.7% expected, but note that that will still leave earnings below 2007 levels.While the data is still relatively thin for 2011, and thus should be taken with a grain of salt, further growth of 20.4% is expected for total earnings in 2011. In 2010, the percentage growth numbers will be not really meaningful for the Auto and Construction sectors, since they will be going from negative total earnings to positive total earnings.In 2009, the losses were much lower than the losses in 2008. Among the larger sectors, Basic Materials and the Financials are expected to be the growth leaders for the year (Financials did the negative-to-positive thing in 2009). Energy is also expected to see a large rebound in its total profits. Together, Finance and Energy will account for more than half of all the incremental earnings in both 2010 and 2011, even though together they account for only slightly over 25% of the total market capitalization of the index. However, in the absence of mark-to-market rules, the quality of the earnings in the Financials is suspect.Cost-cutting has been the major force driving earnings and earnings surprises. However, the costs to one company are either the revenues of another company or someone’s paycheck, which is then spent to create revenues for firms. The bottom-up data coming out of all these individual firms seems to confirm what we have been getting from the macro statistics from the government: the economy is growing due to increases in productivity; higher GDP with fewer workers.While clearly companies cannot continue to grow earnings forever based only on cost-cutting, it does mean that when they do start to see revenue growth, earnings growth could be explosive as the greater operating leverage kicks in. That will sure be the case in the fourth quarter, as revenue is expected to increase by just 1.67%, as earnings double -- talk about net margin expansion!The revisions ratios for both 2010 and 2011 are strong, and should give us confidence that those growth rates will actually be achieved, if not exceeded (although it's still very early for 2011). The S&P 500 is selling for 15.1x consensus expectations for 2010, or an earnings yield of 6.62%, or almost twice the yield on the 10-year Treasury note. The S&P is selling for just 12.6x consensus expectations for 2011, although that consensus is still very thin. Stocks look very attractive, at least relative to bonds, at this point.Scorecard & Earnings Surprise

"
880,ARNC,"•    Median Earnings Surprise 6.32%, a very strong reading
"
881,ARNC,"•    Year-over-year Earnings Growth Ratio (# Positive Growth/# Negative Growth) at 1.00In evaluating the data presented here, keep the percentage reported in mind. For some sectors, the sample size is extremely small. The move to the 16 Zacks sectors means that even when all reports are in, some of the sectors will still have relatively few firms in them. For firms with only a few reports in, the median surprise will be very volatile as new firms are added to the sample. This is particularly true now as only a handful of firms (mostly with November fiscal periods) have reported so far.Among the sectors with more than just a single report in, Tech and Retail are looking very strong -- each with 8 positive surprises and no disappointments. Finance has the highest earnings growth so far, at 322.1%, although only two have reported (JPM came in after the cutoff).Scorecard & Earnings Surprise Income Surprises Yr/YrGrowth %Reported SurpriseMedian EPSSurpPos EPSSurpNeg #GrowPos #GrowNegConstruction 42.50% 10.00% 53.57 1 0 1 0Consumer Discretionary -18.85% 6.45% 10.69 2 0 1 1Computer and Tech 131.72% 10.71% 8.33 8 0 4 5Retail/Wholesale 18.22% 17.02% 7.38 8 0 4 4Consumer Staples -28.92% 11.36% 6.21 4 1 4 1Transportation -30.02% 10.00% 2.80 1 0 0 1Industrial Products -16.67% 4.55% -7.14 0 1 0 1Finance 322.05% 2.60% -8.34 1 1 1 1Basic Materials 104.07% 4.76% -80.00 0 1 0 1Medical na 0.00% na na na na naAuto na 0.00% na na na na naConglomerates na 0.00% na na na na naAerospace na 0.00% na na na na naOils and Energy na 0.00% na na na na naUtilities na 0.00% na na na na naBusiness Service na 0.00% na na na na naS&P  167.71% 6.00% 6.32 25 4 15 15Sales Surprises

"
954,ARNC,"• Top-Down estimates: $57.45 for 2009, $74.24 for 2010, 84.33 for 2011Welcome to the new Earnings Trends. We have decided to start focusing our analysis of the S&P 500 based on Zacks' own sector groupings rather than the S&P GICS sectors. There are 16 Zacks sectors and only 10 GICS sectors, so the new groupings will result in better granularity of the data. The old way simply grouped too many very different companies together. In addition, we for the first time are presenting top-line as well as bottom-line expectations and surprise information. This is very much or a work in progress, and we will be adding additional information, tables and perhaps even some graphs over the next few months.IMPORTANT NOTE: December fiscal years have moved their 2009 earnings from being FY1 to FY0. As a result, we are now going to be focusing on 2010 earnings as being FY1 and 2011 being FY2. Keep this in mind if you are looking at this report and comparing it to previous editions of it. Also keep in mind that while we use the convention of referring to the next full fiscal year to be completed as 2010, not all firms are on December fiscal years, this can cause discontinuities in the data, particularly around this time of year. The data is based on FY1, not based on 2010, even though I may call it 2010 in the report.The fourth quarter earnings season is about to start. While the official kickoff by Alcoa (AA) was disappointing, it is not reflected in the numbers here. However, there are a number of firms that have November fiscal period ends that have already reported. The early indications are quite good, with positive earnings surprises outnumbering disappointments by 7:1, and on revenues positive surprises are leading disappointments by a 1.67:1 ratio. It will be a confusing earnings season due to the year-ago being a near total washout, and one filled with all sorts of extraordinary items (which we try to exclude).Looking at full-year earnings, total net income is still expected to be lower than that of 2008, but just by 9.7% -- a much smaller decline than the 22.2% plunge in 2008. Next year will be one of earnings recovery, with growth of 27.1% expected, but note that that will still leave earnings below 2007 levels.While the data is still relatively thin for 2011, and thus should be taken with a grain of salt, further growth of 19.9% is expected for total earnings in 2011. In 2010, the percentage growth numbers will not be really meaningful for the Auto and Construction sectors, since they will be going from negative total earnings to positive total earnings. In 2009, the losses were much lower than the losses in 2008.Among the larger sectors, Basic Materials and Financials are expected to be the growth leaders for the year (Financials did the negative-to-positive thing in 2009). Energy is also expected to see a large rebound in its total profits. Together, Finance and Energy will account for more than half of all the incremental earnings in 2010, even though together they account for only slightly over 25% of the total market capitalization of the index.Cost cutting has been the major force driving earnings and earnings surprises. However, the costs to one company are either the revenues of another company or someone’s paycheck, which is then spent to create revenues for firms. The bottom-up data coming out of all these individual firms seems to confirm what we have been getting from the macro statistics from the government: the economy is growing due to increases in productivity. Higher GDP with fewer workers. While clearly companies cannot continue to grow earnings forever based only on cost cutting, it does mean that when they do start to see revenue growth, earnings growth could be explosive as the greater operating leverage kicks in.The revisions ratios for both 2010 and 2011 are strong, and should give us confidence that those growth rates will actually be achieved, if not exceeded (although still very early for 2011). The S&P 500 is selling for 15.1x consensus expectations for 2010, or an earnings yield of 6.62% -- almost twice the yield on the 10-year Treasury note. The S&P is selling for just 12.6x consensus expectations for 2011, although that consensus is still very thin. Stocks look very attractive, at least relative to bonds, at this point.Scorecard & Earnings Surprise•    Just a handful of reports in, half of all sectors have none so far

"
959,ARNC,"•    Year-over-year Earnings Growth Ratio (# Positive Growth/# Negative Growth) at 1.08In evaluating the data presented here, keep the percentage reported in mind. For some sectors, the sample size is extremely small. The move to the 16 Zacks sectors means that even when all reports are in, some of the sectors will still have relatively few firms in them. For firms with only a few reports in, the median surprise will be very volatile as new firms are added to the sample. This is particularly true now as only a handful of firms (mostly with November fiscal periods) have reported so far.Among the sectors with more than just a single report in, Tech is looking very strong with six positive surprises and no disappointments. It has the highest earnings growth so far, at 38.5%, although of the seven firms that have reported only three have posted positive growth from a year ago.Retail paints a similar picture with seven positive surprises, no disappointments and 22.2% overall growth, despite only four firms earning more than they did a year ago.Scorecard & Earnings Surprise Income Surprises Yr/YrGrowth %Reported SurpriseMedian EPSSurpPos EPSSurpNeg #GrowPos #GrowNegConstruction -42.50% 10.00% 53.57 1 0 1 0Consumer Discretionary -18.85% 6.45% 10.69 2 0 1 1Retail/Wholesale 22.23% 14.89% 6.42 7 0 4 3Consumer Staples -28.92% 11.36% 6.21 4 1 4 1Computer and Tech 38.54% 8.33% 6.06 6 0 3 4Transportation -30.02% 10.00% 2.80 1 0 0 1Industrial Products -16.67% 4.55% -7.14 0 1 0 1Finance 194.51% 1.30% -40.00 0 1 0 1Medical na 0.00% na na na na naAuto na 0.00% na na na na naBasic Materials na 0.00% na na na na naConglomerates na 0.00% na na na na naAerospace na 0.00% na na na na naOils and Energy na 0.00% na na na na naUtilities na 0.00% na na na na naBusiness Service na 0.00% na na na na naS&P  6.99% 5.00% 6.06 21 3 13 12Sales Surprises

1019,ARNC,"Tuesday's pessimistic sentiment was a response Alcoa's (AA) disappointing report, which showed earnings and revenue that were below expectations, China's move to slow down growth and the possibility that the government will tax banks that received bailouts. 
"
1020,ARNC,"Shares of AA were down 11% after the release the company's report post Monday's closing bell. The market found its results to be a discouraging indicator since, as one of the first big companies to report, it can often be considered a sign of overall corporate earnings. 
"
1021,ARNC,"Also weighing on Alcoa and other raw materials producers, as well as the overall market, was China's tightening of its monetary policy. The country wants to contain growth, which could translate into a slower recovery in other countries and adversely impact companies that sell to China.

1025,ARNC,"Focus List UpdatesRehabcare Group (RHB) pulled back from its recent 52-week high at $33.61 after dropping 2.36% on the day. The surge of the last few days comes in response to shares breaking above a short-term level of resistance just above $31 that had developed over the last few weeks. 
"
1026,ARNC,"Western Digital Corp. (WDC  -  Free Report) also dropped in the weak market, falling 2.57% on the day after hitting a new 52-week high at $47.44 last week. We saw some slight upward movement on estimates this week, with the current year adding 2 cents to $4.68. The next-year estimate is also up 2 cents, pegged at $4.82, a 3% growth projection. 
"
1027,ARNC,"China Green  got pummeled for 9.2%. China's government sent a signal that it will be on the lookout for runaway growth in the economy by selling higher yield bonds and raising reserve requirements for banks. The country has not hidden the fact that it is worried about inflation and speculative bubbles, but today hit home with investors. Today's loss was also exacerbated by profit taking. Estimates remain unchanged and there is no company specific news here. As far as I am concerned, there are still 1 billion mouths to feed and the global community is pushing the green movement.

"
1044,ARNC,"• Top-Down estimates: $57.45 for 2009, $74.24 for 2010, 84.33 for 2011Welcome to the new Earnings Trends. We have decided to start focusing our analysis of the S&P 500 based on Zacks' own sector groupings rather than the S&P GICS sectors. There are 16 Zacks sectors and only 10 GICS sectors, so the new groupings will result in better granularity of the data. The old way simply grouped too many very different companies together. In addition, we for the first time are presenting top-line as well as bottom-line expectations and surprise information. This is very much or a work in progress, and we will be adding additional information, tables and perhaps even some graphs over the next few months.IMPORTANT NOTE: December fiscal years have moved their 2009 earnings from being FY1 to FY0. As a result, we are now going to be focusing on 2010 earnings as being FY1 and 2011 being FY2. Keep this in mind if you are looking at this report and comparing it to previous editions of it. Also keep in mind that while we use the convention of referring to the next full fiscal year to be completed as 2010, not all firms are on December fiscal years, this can cause discontinuities in the data, particularly around this time of year. The data is based on FY1, not based on 2010, even though I may call it 2010 in the report.The fourth quarter earnings season is about to start. While the official kickoff by Alcoa (AA) was disappointing, it is not reflected in the numbers here. However, there are a number of firms that have November fiscal period ends that have already reported. The early indications are quite good, with positive earnings surprises outnumbering disappointments by 7:1, and on revenues positive surprises are leading disappointments by a 1.67:1 ratio. It will be a confusing earnings season due to the year-ago being a near total washout, and one filled with all sorts of extraordinary items (which we try to exclude).Looking at full-year earnings, total net income is still expected to be lower than that of 2008, but just by 9.7% -- a much smaller decline than the 22.2% plunge in 2008. Next year will be one of earnings recovery, with growth of 27.1% expected, but note that that will still leave earnings below 2007 levels.While the data is still relatively thin for 2011, and thus should be taken with a grain of salt, further growth of 19.9% is expected for total earnings in 2011. In 2010, the percentage growth numbers will not be really meaningful for the Auto and Construction sectors, since they will be going from negative total earnings to positive total earnings. In 2009, the losses were much lower than the losses in 2008.Among the larger sectors, Basic Materials and Financials are expected to be the growth leaders for the year (Financials did the negative-to-positive thing in 2009). Energy is also expected to see a large rebound in its total profits. Together, Finance and Energy will account for more than half of all the incremental earnings in 2010, even though together they account for only slightly over 25% of the total market capitalization of the index.Cost cutting has been the major force driving earnings and earnings surprises. However, the costs to one company are either the revenues of another company or someone’s paycheck, which is then spent to create revenues for firms. The bottom-up data coming out of all these individual firms seems to confirm what we have been getting from the macro statistics from the government: the economy is growing due to increases in productivity. Higher GDP with fewer workers. While clearly companies cannot continue to grow earnings forever based only on cost cutting, it does mean that when they do start to see revenue growth, earnings growth could be explosive as the greater operating leverage kicks in.The revisions ratios for both 2010 and 2011 are strong, and should give us confidence that those growth rates will actually be achieved, if not exceeded (although still very early for 2011). The S&P 500 is selling for 15.1x consensus expectations for 2010, or an earnings yield of 6.62% -- almost twice the yield on the 10-year Treasury note. The S&P is selling for just 12.6x consensus expectations for 2011, although that consensus is still very thin. Stocks look very attractive, at least relative to bonds, at this point.Scorecard & Earnings Surprise•    Just a handful of reports in, half of all sectors have none so far

"
1049,ARNC,"•    Year-over-year Earnings Growth Ratio (# Positive Growth/# Negative Growth) at 1.08In evaluating the data presented here, keep the percentage reported in mind. For some sectors, the sample size is extremely small. The move to the 16 Zacks sectors means that even when all reports are in, some of the sectors will still have relatively few firms in them. For firms with only a few reports in, the median surprise will be very volatile as new firms are added to the sample. This is particularly true now as only a handful of firms (mostly with November fiscal periods) have reported so far.Among the sectors with more than just a single report in, Tech is looking very strong with six positive surprises and no disappointments. It has the highest earnings growth so far, at 38.5%, although of the seven firms that have reported only three have posted positive growth from a year ago.Retail paints a similar picture with seven positive surprises, no disappointments and 22.2% overall growth, despite only four firms earning more than they did a year ago.Scorecard & Earnings Surprise Income Surprises Yr/YrGrowth %Reported SurpriseMedian EPSSurpPos EPSSurpNeg #GrowPos #GrowNegConstruction -42.50% 10.00% 53.57 1 0 1 0Consumer Discretionary -18.85% 6.45% 10.69 2 0 1 1Retail/Wholesale 22.23% 14.89% 6.42 7 0 4 3Consumer Staples -28.92% 11.36% 6.21 4 1 4 1Computer and Tech 38.54% 8.33% 6.06 6 0 3 4Transportation -30.02% 10.00% 2.80 1 0 0 1Industrial Products -16.67% 4.55% -7.14 0 1 0 1Finance 194.51% 1.30% -40.00 0 1 0 1Medical na 0.00% na na na na naAuto na 0.00% na na na na naBasic Materials na 0.00% na na na na naConglomerates na 0.00% na na na na naAerospace na 0.00% na na na na naOils and Energy na 0.00% na na na na naUtilities na 0.00% na na na na naBusiness Service na 0.00% na na na na naS&P  6.99% 5.00% 6.06 21 3 13 12Sales Surprises

"
1109,ARNC,"While the market waits for Alcoa's (AA) quarterly report to officially begin earnings season, shares of Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report) have gained approximately 6.3%. 
"
1110,ARNC,"That's enough to put the world's leading maker of construction and mining equipment on the Zacks #1 Rank Top Performers List to start off the week.  
"
1111,ARNC,"Volume has soared to more than 18.8 million shares, compared to the daily average of more than 4.4 million.   
"
1112,ARNC,"While there may be a lot of excitement in the air regarding AA's report (this upcoming earnings season will go a long way in letting us know the strength of the recovery so far), it's probably not the main reason for CAT's performance Monday.  
"
1113,ARNC,"Instead, news that China's exports rose about 18% in December likely had more to do with it. CAT is leaning heavily on China moving forward, along with other emerging economies. In a third quarter that was heavily impacted by the economic malaise, sales to China were up and sales to Asia, in general, slipped less than anywhere else around the globe.  
"
1114,ARNC,"Caterpillar is the world's leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, diesel and natural gas engines, and industrial gas turbines. It is also a leading U.S. exporter, with more than half of its sales outside the U.S. 
"
1115,ARNC,"CAT is, of course, a member of the machinery - construction/mining industry. There are 2 other names from this space on today's Zacks #1 Rank List: Bucyrus International, Inc. (BUCY) and Komatsu Ltd. ADR (KMTUY  -  Free Report).  3 Straight Quarterly Surprises 
"
1116,ARNC,"Caterpillar has certainly felt the impact of the global economic crunch, just as you would expect from a construction/mining equipment company. Nevertheless, as the graph above shows, it is on a nice streak of 3 consecutive quarters with better-than-expected profit.  
"
1117,ARNC,"Most recently, the company reported third-quarter earnings per share of 64 cents, which easily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thanks to higher price realization, lower SG&A and R&D costs and decreasing inventory benefits. Although, the result was well below the year-ago result.  
"
1118,ARNC,"Sales slumped by 44% to $7.3 billion from $13 billion last year.  
"
1119,ARNC,"""We believe the third quarter marked the low point for Caterpillar sales and revenues in what has been the toughest recession since the 1930s,"" said CAT Chairman/CEO Jim Owens. ""We are seeing encouraging signs that indicate a recovery may be underway."" 
"
1120,ARNC,"""However, the world economy is still facing significant challenges. There is uncertainty about the timing and strength of recovery,"" he continued.
"
1121,ARNC,"The company will report its fourth quarter/full year numbers on Jan 26.   
"
1122,ARNC,"Looking toward 2010, CAT expects improvement in its top line from 2009. It sees sales and revenue growth between 10% to 25% from the midpoint of the 2009 range. Earnings Estimates for Caterpillar 
"
1123,ARNC,"The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2009 is at $2.03 per share, which has barely moved in the last 2 months but remains above levels from 3 months ago by about 37.2%. There are 22 covering analysts for this period.  
"
1124,ARNC,"For 2010, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.70 suggests a year-over-year improvement of 33%. Also, that guidance has improved by 43% in 3 months, including enhancements of 11 cents in 2 months and 5 cents in 30 days. 
"
1125,ARNC,"Stocks were up slightly as China reported that exports spiked 18% in December, a wider-than-expected increase that followed 13 consecutive months of decreases. The report raised hopes that the global economy is picking up steam.      
"
1126,ARNC,"As always, Alcoa (AA) kicked off earnings season after the bell, posting a net loss of $277 million. The loss was narrower than the year-prior $1.19 billion. Revenue dipped to $5.43 billion from $5.68 billion.
"
1127,ARNC,"Monday's Dow gained 45.80 points, or 0.4%, closing at 10,663.99. The S&P 500 climbed 2.00 points, or 0.2%, to 1,146.98. The Nasdaq declined by 4.76 points, or 0.2%, to 2,312.41.
"
1128,ARNC,"Crude slipped 23 cents, settling at $82.52 per barrel, while gold advanced to a 5-week high.
"
1129,ARNC,"Focus List UpdatesVisa, Inc. (V  -  Free Report) continues to be mostly range-bound near its 52-week and all-time high at $89.69 after posting big gains in 2009. The forward P/E is currently 23X but the next-year estimate is bullish, projecting 21% earnings growth.
"
1130,ARNC,"China Auto (CAAS  -  Free Report) gained 7.6% in very heavy trading as China's exports increased a better than expected 18%. This bodes well for both the Chinese economy and the global recovery. 
"
1131,ARNC,"Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD) rose 4.1% on heavy volume today. The move was spurred by an analysts upgrade to ""Outperform"" at Morgan Keegan. Shares of BWLD have not done much since being added to the Focus List, but this may help its case to stay in the portfolio.
"
1132,ARNC,"Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX  -  Free Report) was pretty much flat for the day even as gold hit a 5-week high. Analysts remain bullish on earnings, lifting the 2009 Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny to $5.15 per share in just the past week. For 2010, analysts polled by Zacks are pegging earnings at $7.43 per share, up from last week's $7.29. FCX continues to show great strength in the portfolio, outpacing the S&P 500 by about 20% since being added to the Focus List.         
"
1133,ARNC,"Growth and Income UpdatesHerbalife Ltd. (HLF  -  Free Report) finished the day with a marginal loss of .27% in the up market to remain near the 52-week high at $44.43. Shares of HLF had been a bit flat in the month of December before recently rebounding and surging back to the high. In spite of the nice gains of the last 9 months, the forward P/E of 13X is still a discount to the overall market. 
"
1134,ARNC,"Coach (COH) rose 2.82% on no news. The luxury retailer has been hot recently as the economic recovery takes hold, especially in China, where the company has been expanding. Coach is a Zacks #2 Rank (buy) stock.Corning (GLW  -  Free Report) gained 3.02% on huge volume after the company was upgraded by Deutsche Bank to a ""buy"" from a ""hold"".AFLAC Inc. (AFL  -  Free Report) climbed 2.63%, hitting a 52-week high of $50.78 before closing at $50.71. Volume was slightly below average levels and there were no major developments to report. 
"
1135,ARNC,"While last week was all about jobs data, this week brings the earnings season. I expect solid performances on the earnings front, with some evidence of top-line growth and positive pronouncements from management teams helping improve visibility going forward. Economic Backdrop Continuing to Improve
"
1136,ARNC,"It is becoming increasingly clear that the economic turnaround we saw with the positive third-quarter GDP growth is sustainable. We are seeing evidence of that in the manufacturing as well as the all-important non-manufacturing sectors of the economy. While the recovery is fragile and needs fiscal support, at least through this year, I remain convinced of the unlikelihood of the so-called double-dip scenario.  
"
1137,ARNC,"Growth is expected to falter as the fiscal stimulus wanes in the second half of this year, but we see enough resilience in the rest of the economy to shoulder the responsibility going forward.   
"
1138,ARNC,"The much-improved retail sales numbers over the holidays was more evidence, if any was needed, that the consumer is very much alive. The year-over-year comparison was no doubt easy, but expectations had steadily been going up over the preceding months after positive retail sales numbers. The heartening aspect of December retail sales was the fact that the improvement came in the face of continuing jobs losses and credit market issues. Jobs Report Was Not a Disaster 
"
1139,ARNC,"As discussed in my Market Overreacts to BLS Numbers blog post and then again in today's RoundTable Review (Jobs Data & Earnings Season), Friday's jobs report was not all bad news. The headline miss was no doubt a disappointment, but there were enough bits of positive details to take the edge off. 
"
1140,ARNC,"Firstly, a positive revision to the November report resulted in the first job gain since December 2007. Secondly, the growing temporary jobs numbers, a leading indicator of full-time hiring, is indicative of a stabilizing and improving labor market. 
"
1141,ARNC,"I am not trying to put a positive spin on an otherwise very bad labor market. After all, we have lost in excess of 7.5 million jobs since December 2007; and even optimistic projections put a return to pre-crisis levels in the labor market way out in the future. All I am saying is that while it is bad to lose an additional 85,000 jobs in December, as Friday's report indicated, the labor market is getting close to turning the corner. We should start seeing positive monthly payroll numbers in the coming months.   
"
1142,ARNC,"What this all adds up to is consolidating and stabilizing the gains made, thus far, in the economy and in the markets. Coming off of the extreme levels of volatility in the last two years, I expect this year to bring in a lot more stability.  Positive Earnings Not Just Due to Easy Comparisons 
"
1143,ARNC,"Earnings have been coming in ahead of expectations in the last few quarters. In fact, the third-quarter earnings beats were something of a record with almost 80% of the companies coming in ahead of expectations. Better cost controls, particularly on the payroll side, instead of top-line growth, has mostly been driving the earnings out-performance to date.  
"
1144,ARNC,"In addition to some evidence of revenue growth, I would also be very interested in management's pronouncements on visibility and outlook. After all, if growth in the broader economy is to remain on track following the tapering off of the fiscal stimulus from the second-half of 2010 onwards, we would expect corporate managements to get more confident of the future.  
"
1145,ARNC,"All evidence remains supportive of this consolidation/stabilization theme. Fourth-quarter 2009 earnings are expected to be up in excess of 80% from the year-earlier period. But the impressive growth is not solely due to the ugliness of the fourth-quarter 2008 results. The structural improvements that we have been witnessing over the few quarters are very much at play. 2010 to Bring Significant Earnings Growth
"
1146,ARNC,"When all is said and done, earnings of S&P 500 companies for the full-year 2009 would be below the 2008 level by 9.3%. In 2008, earnings fell a whopping 22.2% from the 2007 level, highlighting the full brunt of one of the most severe recessions in recent history.  
"
1147,ARNC,"But that is history. Markets don't look in the rearview mirror. Estimates for 2010 and 2011 are steadily going up, with upward revisions outpacing downward revisions. At present levels, we have earnings for the S&P 500 companies expected to go up in excess of 26% in 2010. Current expectations peg earnings growth in 2011, admittedly a distant item at present, at almost 21%. Portfolio Changes
"
1148,ARNC,"Last week, we made four changes to the Focus list portfolio, while the Growth & Income portfolio remained unchanged. The Timely Buys portfolio also had a number of additions/deletions this week.  
"
1149,ARNC,"We added two and deleted two stocks from the Focus List portfolio.  
"
1150,ARNC,"We added China Auto Systems (CAAS  -  Free Report), a power steering components supplier to the Chinese auto industry. China just overtook the U.S. as the largest auto market in the world and this components supplier provides a perfect vehicle to play this growth market.  
"
1151,ARNC,"We also added W&T Offshore (WTI  -  Free Report), an exploration and production company focused on operating in the Gulf of Mexico region.  
"
1152,ARNC,"We deleted Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) to reflect negative estimate cuts. In the last 30 days, roughly twice as many estimates have been cut as have been raised.  
"
1153,ARNC,"We deleted Schweitzer-Mauduit (SWM  -  Free Report) after the stock's downgrade to a Zacks #4 (""sell"") Rank. While we continue to like this company, the discipline of Zacks Rank forced us to take a solid gain on this name. 
"
1154,ARNC,"Earnings Preview 1/08/10Next week is the kickoff for the 4Q09 earnings season, when Alcoa (AA) announces on Monday. In all, 32 firms will report their results next week, including 6 S&P 500 members. Reporting activity will then pick up speed, and next week’s trickle of earnings data will turn into a flood. In addition to the start of earnings season, it will be a fairly busy week for economic data.Monday
"
1155,ARNC,"• Nothing of significance.Tuesday
"
1156,ARNC,"• The highlight of the day will be the report on the monthly trade deficit for November. In October, our imports exceeded our exports to the tune of $32.9 billion. While it has been creeping back up in recent months, that is a substantial improvement from where we were a year ago. The consensus expectations are for the trade deficit to be $34.8 billion. Given that both the Manufacturing and Service ISM reports showed lots of strength in imports and weakness in exports, combined with a rebound in oil prices, makes me think that the trade deficit will be worse than the consensus expectations.Wednesday
"
1157,ARNC,"• If Tuesday is about the trade deficit, then Wednesday will be about that other deficit, the big budget one. Consensus expectations are that the red ink will be $70.8 billion for December. While that is a big improvement over the $120.3 billion gap in November, the Treasury numbers are very seasonal, so do not read much into the sequential improvement. It is better to look at it relative to December 2008, when the gap was $51.8 billion. In November, the gap was actually below the November 2008 level of $125.2 billion.
"
1158,ARNC,"• The Fed will release its largely anecdotal collection of regional data known as the Beige Book. Very little hard data in it, but it does give a good feel for how the economy is doing. The trend in recent months has for each Beige Book to be somewhat more upbeat than the previous ones, but then again, back in the spring, the books were more depressing than your average suicide note.Thursday• Weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance come out. They rose slightly in each of the last week, but before that were in a very steep downtrend. Last week there were 434,000 initial claims. Look for the decline to resume. Continuing claims have also been in a steep downtrend of late, even if one factors in the extended claims paid by the Federal government as part of the Stimulus program, but that also reversed last week. Looking at just the regular continuing claims numbers is a serious mistake. They only include a little over half of the unemployed now given the unprecedentedly high duration of unemployment figures. Last week regular continuing claims were 4.802 million while extended claims (paid from Federal ARRA funds) were 5.440 million. Make sure to look at both sets of numbers!
"
1159,ARNC,"• Retail sales for the all important month of December are due out. The consensus is for a seasonally adjusted increase of 0.4%, on top of a 1.3% increase in November.
"
1160,ARNC,"• Retail sales excluding autos are expected to be up at a seasonally adjusted rate of 0.3% on top of a 1.2% increase in November. Given what we have seen from many of the major retail chains so far, I think the numbers for December will be better than the consensus expectations.Friday
"
1161,ARNC,"• We get the first inflation numbers of the year with the CPI for December. It is expected to be up 0.2% after a 0.4% increase in November. Stripping out food and energy (especially energy) the CPI is expected to be up 0.1% after being unchanged in November. I think the headline number the consensus has is a bit too low, and the core number is a bit too high. My guess is 0.3 on headline and unchanged again on core. Housing makes up almost 40% of core CPI and rents have been under downward pressure. Energy prices, though, have been on the rise.
"
1162,ARNC,"• Capacity Utilization is expected to have risen to 71.8% in December from 71.3% in November. While this is still an extremely low level, it will mark the sixth straight increase in utilization. Keep an eye not just on the headline number but also the number for manufacturing, since the total includes utilities where weather is often the most important factor. In November, the nation's factories were operating at just 68.4% of capacity.
"
1163,ARNC,"• Industrial Production is expected to have increased by 0.6% in December after a 0.8% increase in December. It still remains well below year-ago levels, however.Potential Positive SurprisesHistorically, the best indicators of firms likely to report positive surprises are a recent history of positive surprises and rising estimates going into the report. The Zacks Rank is also a good indicator of potential surprises. Some of the companies that have these characteristics include:H.B. Fuller (FUL  -  Free Report) is expected to report EPS of $0.42, almost double the year ago level of $0.24. Last time out, they posted a positive surprise of 33.3%, and over the last month the mean estimate for its fourth quarter earnings is up 1.02%. FUL has a Zacks Rank of 2.Sealy Corp (ZZ) should allow its investors to sleep well going into earnings season. This Zacks Rank #2 stock is expected to return to marginal profitability ($0.01) after posting a loss of $0.13 a share last year. While it was right on the mark relative to expectations last time out, the mean estimate for this quarter has increased by 22.1% over the last month.Potential Negative SurprisesIn keeping with the overall very positive tone of last earnings season, the potential negative firms are less clear cut.  However:Supervalu (SVU  -  Free Report) is expected to post earnings of $0.43 a share, down from earnings of $0.62 a share a year ago. Last time they disappointed by 2.78%.

1164,ARNC,"The Metals & Mining Industry encompasses the extraction (mining), as well as the primary and secondary processing, of metals and minerals. The industry is rather concentrated in structure, with a few producers accounting for the lion’s share of sales.Geographically, the Asia-Pacific region is witnessing higher production and consumption of metals, especially China and India. This is due to the per capita consumption in these two counties approaching the U.S./European levels, which could − theoretically at least − double metal demand in the longer term.Historically, the automotive and construction markets have been the largest drivers of metal consumption, more than 50% of the total demand. Other metal consuming industries include energy, electrical equipment, agricultural, domestic and commercial equipment and industrial machinery. Large automakers such as General Motors, Ford Motor Company (F), Toyota Motor Corporation (TM) and Honda Motor Company (HMC) are big consumers of metals including steel and aluminum.The steel industry, with companies engaged in the extraction of iron ore and coke coal for the processing of iron and steel, is a case in point. This industry includes metal ore exploration and mining services, iron and steel foundries for smelting, rolling, forging, spinning, recycling, stamping, polishing and plating of iron and steel products such as pipes, tubes, wire, spring, rolls and bars. ArcelorMittal (MT) is the world’s largest steel company with production of 103.3 million tons in 2008.The precious metals and minerals industry consists of companies engaged in the extraction and primary processing of gold, silver, platinum, diamond, semiprecious stones, uranium and other rare minerals and ores, along with the cultivation of pearls. The gold industry is dominated by Anglo American Plc., the largest gold producer by market capitalization. Demand for gold has been improving sequentially; however, it is significantly lower year over year, distorted by the exceptionally strong demand in 2008.The outlook for jewelry demand continues to remain weak. While the US economy has shown tentative signs of a recovery, a high degree of uncertainty continues to dampen any improvement in discretionary spending. Total supply of gold worldwide contracted slightly in the last three months of 2009. The key factors weighing on the supply were an increase in producer de-hedging and a negative contribution from the official sector, in addition to lower levels of scrap than previous quarters.OPPORTUNITIESWe expect the global metal demand to improve in the long term with the recovery of the user industries. China is expected to remain the largest consumer of metals in the coming years. Despite the current slowdown in consolidation within the global metal industry, mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity remains a critically important growth strategy for companies. While the economic downturn is a significant factor in short-term decisions regarding M&A activity, mining companies expect to make acquisitions over the next three years.There has been an upward movement in copper prices in recent months, primarily due to stockpiling in China. Market conditions are expected to be favorable for copper in the next couple of years due to higher consumption of the metal in the developing nations. Companies like Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX  -  Free Report) which have a high leverage to copper prices will benefit immensely from the potential demand for copper in the developing markets.We also expect aluminum demand to increase over the next three years, outstripping supply growth. As a result, the aluminum market is likely to see deficit for a prolonged period. This provides a backdrop supportive of high alumina and aluminum prices. Leading aluminum producers such as Alcoa Inc. (AA) should benefit from the improving outlook for aluminum and alumina prices.The World Steel Association is forecasting an 8.6% year-over-year decline in steel production, better than the previous forecast of a 14.1% decline, driven by a strong growth in Chinese steel demand. With signs of recovery across the world in the second half of 2009, the association is anticipating global steel demand in 2010 to grow by 9.2% to 1,206 million tons, which is similar to the level in 2008.With steel demand picking up in the last couple of months, steel producers are restarting facilities. Recently, U.S. Steel Corp. (X  -  Free Report) − the eighth largest steel producer in the world, the largest integrated steel producer headquartered in North America and one of the largest integrated flat-rolled producers in Central Europe, has restarted its blast furnace at its Hamilton, Ontario plant after a nine-month shutdown.The current surge in steel demand narrowed losses for the third largest steel maker in the U.S. as well as for Steel Dynamics Inc. (STLD  -  Free Report) and the largest recycler of steel scrap in the U.S. − Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report) − in the third quarter of 2009.Gold’s value and wealth preservation attributes continued to attract investors and consumers. According to the World Gold Council (WGC), total demand for the metal in the third quarter of 2009 reached 800.3 tons, or $24.7 billion -- up 15% from the second quarter. Jewelry and investment demand in non-western markets rebounded from the very low levels seen in the first quarter, while industrial demand started to recover in response to an improvement in economic conditions.The outlook for investment is positive overall, with absolute levels of demand likely to remain well supported by continued economic and currency uncertainty, inflation concerns and the search for diversification. We expect to see a continuing trend among central banks diversifying away from their dollar exposure in their reserves in favor of the proven store of value represented by gold. Barrick Gold Corporation (ABX  -  Free Report) and Newmont Mining (NEM) are showing strong levels of production.WEAKNESSESThe global metal industry is cyclical, highly competitive and has historically been characterized by overcapacity (excess of supply over demand). Overcapacity in the industry could increase the level of metal imports and squeeze metal prices. In the recent years, capacity growth in China has significantly exceeded the growth in Chinese market demand. A continuation of this unbalanced growth trend or a significant decrease in China’s rate of economic expansion could result in China increasing metal exports.Key metal consuming industries such as auto, shipbuilding and construction have been experiencing weak demand in the last few quarters, forcing global metal producers to slacken production levels. U.S. Steel slashed production by almost 62% during the second quarter of 2009, while Korean steel maker POSCO (PKX) had to shrink its output by about 15% in December last year. This was the first time in its history that POSCO was forced to take such a measure, proof of the unhealthy operating environment.As a whole, the steel industry posted weak results in the third quarter of 2009. U.S. Steel recorded its third sequential loss − $3.03 billion, or $2.11 per share − in the third quarter of 2009, in contrast to a net income of $9.19 billion or $7.79 per share in the third quarter of 2008. Commercial metals company AK Steel (AKS) posted a negligible income of $6.2 million compared to $188.3 million in the same quarter of 2008.Despite its relatively higher growth rate compared to the developed world, the outlook for the Indian economy is for lower growth rates compared to the last few years. Nearly 45−50% of the world gold production is consumed in India. Gold is a luxury item in this economy, and the demand downtrend is most visible in large cities where gold is consumed. A slow growth, low inflation and low interest-rate environment is a nightmare for the gold market.Foreign currency is one of the major risks for gold producers, as they usually have their mining operations outside their countries. Revenues and costs for gold producers are primarily incurred in foreign currency. Kinross Gold (KGC  -  Free Report) is one of the top 10 gold producers, which has facilities in the U.S., Canada, Brazil, Chile, Russia and Africa. Although it has a diversified clientele, the operations are vulnerable to foreign currency risks. Hence, any adverse movement will affect cash flows and the profitability of the gold producer.Despite a sharp rise in recent metal prices, future pricing remains uncertain, and we believe continued demand weakness, production resumption by some mills and lower iron ore and coking coal prices in the second half of 2009 may drive monthly prices down again. The recent significant reduction in global metal production in late 2008 and into 2009 has resulted in decreases in many raw material prices. We expect that such prices will rebound only when global metal production returns to more customary levels.

"
1189,ARNC,"Analysts continue to raise more estimates than they are cutting. Unlike recent weeks, the total number of revisions is now rising, meaning that the changes in the revisions ratios are now being driven more by new estimates being made than old estimates falling out.
"
1190,ARNC,"Over the next few weeks the total number of revisions will increase dramatically. The increases are wide spread with only 3 sectors seeing cuts on balance for 2009 and only 2 seeing net cuts for 2010.
"
1191,ARNC,"Total net income growth is in the process of turning around - the decline of 23.8% expected for the third quarter is well below the 30%+ declines we have been seeing in recent quarters, and growth should turn extremely positive in the fourth quarter. We are however talking about year-over-year changes, and the change says more about 2008 than it does about 2009.
"
1192,ARNC,"On a sequential basis, the total net income for the third quarter is expected to be almost identical to the total net income in the second quarter. Almost all to the 4Q turnaround is due to the financials. In the fourth quarter of last year, the S&P 500 as a whole earned $69.7 billion before non-recurring items as the Financial sector lost a total of $64.4 billion.
"
1193,ARNC,"In the fourth quarter of this year the S&P 500 is currently expected to earn $152.6 billion, for a swing of $82.8 billion. The financial sector is now expected to earn $17.1 billion (the quality of the earnings is still lousy), for a swing of $81.4 billion, or 99% of the total improvement.
"
1194,ARNC,"On a sequential basis, total net income is expected to fall for the S&P 500 by just 0.2% in the third quarter over the second quarter and to rise by 12.2% in the fourth quarter over the third quarter. Yes, the fourth-quarter improvement is nice, but it is not as robust as the 119.9% year-over-year gain would seem to indicate.
"
1195,ARNC,"The third quarter is somewhat similar, in that year-over-year earnings growth excluding the financials is much worst than when including them, with a decline of 28.8% rather than 23.8%. The troubles started in the third quarter last year for the sector and then got really bad in the fourth quarter.

1218,ARNC,"While the revision ratios should be taken with a little bit of a grain of salt when total revisions activity is at its seasonal lows, it is still nice to see far more analysts raising their estimates than cutting them. The dramatic increase in the revisions ratios we have seen over the last month is mostly a function of old estimate cuts falling out of the system rather than a flood of new estimate increases coming into the system. On the other hand, it is nice to see that estimate cutting has come to a near complete stop.

"
1313,ARNC,"We are off and running on the first-quarter earnings season with the traditional kick-off by Alcoa, Inc. (AA), which incurred a penalty by kicking it out of bounds with a loss of $470 million.
"
1314,ARNC,"While we are still very early in the season, with just 27 or 5.4% of all firms reporting, the start has been rocky. Total net income is off 23.5% from a year ago versus an 11.4% drop last quarter. Granted this is far from a representative sample, but it does not seem to be a good omen.
"
1315,ARNC,"The big upward surge we saw in the financials expectations for the quarter backed off a bit, but will probably resume given Thursday's announcement from Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report). (Revisions related to the announcement are reflected in the data). Excluding provisions for bad existing loans, the banks should be very profitable given the steep yield curve and the refinance boom. However, provisions are a mighty big exclusion. The shirt in mark-to-market rules though may give banks cover to avoid adequate provisioning. The pass through of the American International Group (AIG  -  Free Report) bailout funds will also greatly help on that front as well.
"
1316,ARNC,"Looking at the total picture of both companies that have reported and expectations for those that have not shows expectations for total net income being down 28.7% from a year ago. That is a big improvement from the 62.0% decline in the fourth-quarter, but is hardly good news.
"
1317,ARNC,"A very big part of the fourth-quarter decline was drive by exceptionally large losses at a handful of financial firms, most notably Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and AIG. It seems unlikely that AIG will post anything like the loss it saw in the fourth quarter.
"
1318,ARNC,"For most stocks the year-over-year decline in net income is likely to be steeper in the first quarter than it was in the fourth quarter. Seven of the 10 sectors are expected to post a bigger drop this quarter. The exceptions are Financials, Materials and Consumer Discretionary. All 3 were absolute disasters in the fourth quarter, and for Materials and Discretionary this will be a very ugly quarter, but just slightly better than the fourth quarter.
"
1319,ARNC,"Looking at full-year projections, total net income is expected to fall 12.2% following an 18.9% decline in 2008. Most sectors are expected to post far worse results for the year than last year, with the cyclical areas expected to be hit the hardest, particularly the commodity sensitive Materials and Energy sectors. Keep in mind though that those firms were printing money early in 2008.

The median surprise is 2.87%, which is closer to historical norms. These figures will be very volatile in the early going and may change significantly by the time earnings season is over.
"
1328,ARNC,"The positive surprises have been concentrated in the Discretionary sector, and it is the only sector to show positive year-over-year growth in median EPS. The rest of the sector is not expected to fare as well, with a median EPS decline of 28.6% expected. Then again low expectations make it easier to have a positive surprise.
"
1329,ARNC,"Excluding that sector disappointments are beating positive surprises by almost 2:1. These are mostly still firms with February fiscal ends, and are not a very representative sample.

1338,ARNC,"The revisions ratio reversed a gradual uptrend it had been in for several weeks, and remains in very negative territory. (Generally we consider anything below 0.80 to be negative, and anything above 1.25 to be positive.) Only health Care has made into neutral territory.
"
1339,ARNC,"The Telecom sector was the only one with more increases than cuts, but the sample size is so small (16 total) that it really is not that significant. The Consumer Discretionary sector has improved significantly, most likely in response to the better than expected earnings for the early reporters in the sector.
"
1340,ARNC,"The dramatic improvement in the total net income expectations for the Financial sector in the first quarter has not been matched to a flood of estimate increases for the full year. This should make you suspicious of how real the improvement really is. Full-year cuts outnumber increases for the sector by almost 4:1.
"

1350,ARNC,"The 2010 revisions ratio story is pretty much the same as 2009. A gradual pattern of a low but improving revisions ratio was slightly reversed this week. In a bit of a surprise, the total number of revisions actually grew this week, counter the normal seasonal pattern.
"
1351,ARNC,"The very small Telecom sector (15 total revisions) is the best on a relative basis, but nothing to really write home about. The Consumer Discretionary sector has also improved significantly in recent weeks, as has the Consumer Staples sector. The Health Care sector has been fading.
"
1352,ARNC,"As with 2009, the Industrials sector was far and away the weakest, with Financials, Energy and Materials also very weak. However, in recent weeks the price of oil has started to rebound. If that holds, it seems likely that the estimates could start to head up again for the energy sector. As it stands now, the size of the cuts in the sector is very large.

"
1368,ARNC,"The big keys for first-quarter earnings season will be whether actual results are not as bad as feared and how much visibility do companies have. If a super-majority of companies can surpass expectations, then the numbers could give the market an additional boost.

"
1388,ARNC,"Stocks had difficulty finding direction Tuesday, closing at near break-even levels for the day. Investor pessimism over the earnings season sent the Dow into the red for the 5th consecutive session. However, losses were modest thanks in part to encouraging words from Bernanke.    
"
1389,ARNC,"The Dows dip of 25.41 points, or 0.30%, led to a close of 8,448.56. The S&P 500 gained 1.53 points, or 0.18%, ending the session at 871.79. The Nasdaq picked up 7.67 points, or 0.50%, closing at 1,546.46.
"
1390,ARNC,"Forthcoming earnings reports are expected to be bleak as Alcoa (AA) began the season by reporting a loss, and investors have had very little positive news to rely on since. Meanwhile other companies continue to issue earnings warnings.
"
1391,ARNC,"The financial sector was somewhat of a bright spot today as Fed Chairman Bernanke noted in a speech in London that more steps need to be taken in order to stabilize banks. Market participants were reassured by his statements, envisioning the possibility of U.S. authorities buying up more toxic assets.  
"
1392,ARNC,"Oil recovered some of its recent losses on colder temperatures and as Saudi Arabia announced significant production cuts. Light, sweet crude jumped 19 cents a barrel to settle at $37.78.

1395,ARNC,"The Focus List was down by 0.70%, which was not too far off todays broader market results.
"
1396,ARNC,"Multi Fineline Electronix, Inc. (MFLX) was added to the Focus List at the close of trading. The circuit board maker raised its fiscal first quarter guidance last week and described demand as remaining strong headed into its fiscal second-quarter. The company also announced a new share repurchase program that could acquire as much as 9% of the outstanding shares.
"
1397,ARNC,"Open Text Corporation (OTEX  -  Free Report) was another Focus List addition. OTEX is one of several software companies that brokerage analysts have recently raised earnings estimates on. OTEX helps companies manage content, including documentation related to regulatory requirements. In addition, the companys latest platform provides wikis, forums and blogs, Internet tools that companies are increasingly using.
"
1398,ARNC,"Apollo Group Inc. (APOL) was in the news recently as 3 former University of Phoenix students filed a complaint against the company, alleging an improper return of federal loan funds to students who dropped classes shortly after enrolling.   
"
1399,ARNC,"It is not yet certain what impact, if any, the complaint will have on APOL's bottom line. The Focus List has seen a gain of about 16% from this company, and we are not ready to remove the Zacks #1 Rank (""strong buy"") stocks at this time. We will, however, monitor this one closely in light of the new development.  
"
1400,ARNC,"The Growth and Income portfolio declined by 2% for the day on no major developments. 
"
1401,ARNC,"Norfolk Southern (NSC  -  Free Report) is now a Zacks #4 Rank stock and was removed from the portfolio. 5 out of 14 covering analysts have lowered 2008 estimates in the last 30 days to $4.55 from $4.58. Analysts have also been cutting 2009 estimates which fell in the last month to $4.58 from $4.73.
"
1402,ARNC,"Major indices slowly ground their way lower throughout the day as the fourth-quarter and year-end earnings season begins.  The Dow shed 125 points, or 1.5%, to close at 8,474.

However, there will also be more restrictions and oversight on how the money is spent.  
"
1404,ARNC,"Earnings season kicked off today when Alcoa, Inc (AA) announced earnings results after the bell. The aluminum maker announced a loss of $1.2 billion, or $1.49 per share, in a worse than expected release.  Shares have been getting hammered since the company announced an 18% cut in production last week.  
"
1405,ARNC,"Shares of Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) plummeted more than 17% today as the troubled bank engages in talks with Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) to raise capital.  The deal to sell off a majority of its retail brokerage unit would generate roughly $6 billion in after-tax gains. Confidence has still not been restored in the bank that may post a $10 billion loss for the fourth quarter of 2008.  
"
1406,ARNC,"Crude was pummeled today, down almost 8%, or $3.24, to $37.59 per barrel.  Oil is down more than $11 in the past 6 sessions as the economic outlook for 2009 weakens.

"
1426,ARNC,"Even during periods of economic growth, Alcoa Inc. (AA) often misses earnings estimates. So it is not shocking that brokerage analysts are lowering their expectations ahead of the company's fourth-quarter report. Over the past 30 days, cuts by 7 analysts have resulted in the consensus earnings estimate falling to a loss of 2 cents per share from a projected profit of 17 cents. The most accurate estimate is even more bearish and calls for a loss of 4 cents per share. As stated above, Alcoa will report on Monday, Jan 12, after the close of trading.
"
1427,ARNC,"Last Wednesday, Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) warned that fourth-quarter revenues would be about $8.2 billion, a 20% decrease from a year prior and below the chipmaker's previous forecast. The company did not provide an EPS figure, but 8 brokerage analysts cut their quarterly projections in response. The revisions led to a 2-cent drop in the consensus estimate, which is now at 20 cents per share. The most accurate estimate is more bearish at 14 cents per share.
"
1428,ARNC,"Though INTC does have a history of meeting or topping expectations, its 2009 guidance could dampen enthusiasm about fourth-quarter profits not being as bad as feared. INTC is scheduled to report on Thursday, Jan 15, after the close of trading.

Also, today s pullback occurred on less volatility than seen in the past, and some sort of reversal from recent upswings was expected.

"
1465,ARNC,"1Some of the companies listed in the earnings calendar may not be in the Zacks Rank universe.
"
1466,ARNC,"Stocks moved moderately higher Tuesday as investors seemed unfazed by more negative economic data. While todays upswing was modest, it lifted stocks to the highest levels in 2 months.
"
1467,ARNC,"The Dow saw an increase of 62.21 points, or 0.69%, closing at 9,015.10. The S&P 500 ended todays session 7.25 points, or 0.78%, higher at 934.70. The Nasdaq rose by 24.35 points, or 1.50%, to 1,652.38.
"
1468,ARNC,"The day did, however, have a bearish start on some bad news. The National Association of Realtors released data that showed pending home sales tumbling to a record low in November. The reading for the seasonally adjusted index of pending sales for existing homes declined 4% to 82.3, compared to a downwardly revised October figure of 85.7. Economists were looking for a level of 88. 
"
1469,ARNC,"The Commerce department reported a fall in factory orders of 4.6% in November, while economists were forecasting only a 2.5% slide. This was the fourth consecutive month of decreases. 
"
1470,ARNC,"Todays economic news was not all doom and gloom. The Institute for Supply Management announced that the U.S. services sector saw contraction, but by a narrower margin than the previous month. The services sector index climbed to 40.6 in December, versus Novembers 37.3. Economists were expecting to see the index at 37 for December. Any reading below 50 signals contraction.  
"
1471,ARNC,"The Fed released minutes from last month, indicating that further economic deterioration and rising unemployment is on the horizon, which led to the rate cut that is now near zero. Fed members see a slow recovery in the second half of the year but unemployment is expected to increase significantly into 2010. 
"
1472,ARNC,"Oil saw a dip of 23 cents mostly on profit taking, settling at $48.58 per barrel. Conversely, gold advanced by $8.20 to $866 an ounce.   
"
1473,ARNC,"After the closing bell, Alcoa (AA) announced a global staffing reduction of 13% as well as cuts in spending and output amid economic woes. Consequently, the aluminum producer noted that it expects fourth-quarter charges to range between $900 million and $950 million. The company is scheduled to release quarterly results on Jan 12.    
"
1474,ARNC,"Zacks Elite Portfolios
"
1475,ARNC,"The Focus List closed slightly in the red by 0.77% on no major developments.
"
1476,ARNC,"We remain satisfied with the Focus List's current allocation. There are only 2 stocks in negative territory. Techne Corp. (TECH  -  Free Report) is down by only 3.6% and Church & Dwight Co. (CHD  -  Free Report) has lost a mere 0.56%.
"
1477,ARNC,"On the flipside, McDonald's Corp. (MCD  -  Free Report), a Focus List Stalwart, is up an impressive 80%.   
"
1478,ARNC,"The Growth and Income portfolio's performance was on par with the Dow as it picked 0.62% for the day also on no major news. 
"
1479,ARNC,"This portfolio is also positioned well right with only one holding in the red. While McDonald's Corp. (MCD  -  Free Report) is the Focus List's strongest performer, because it was added to the Growth and Income a couple years later, its overall performance in the Growth and Income is currently at a negative 3%.
"
1480,ARNC,"However, we expect to see profitability from the fast food giant in 2009 and will continue to hold it in both portfolios for now.
"
1481,ARNC,"Highlighted stocks include: Alcoa Inc. (AA), Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation (BNI), Cephalon, Inc. (CEPH), CONSOL Energy, Inc. (CNX  -  Free Report), Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report), and Sunoco, Inc. (SUN)
"
1482,ARNC,"Fourth-quarter earnings for the S&P 500 are projected to rise just 3.3%.
"
1483,ARNC,"On a company-specific basis, the numbers look far worse. More than 275 S&P 500 members are forecast to report a year-over-year drop in per share earnings.
"
1484,ARNC,"Growth Industries
"
1485,ARNC,"Refiners, such as Sunoco, Inc. (SUN), will have among the highest growth rates. Plunging oil prices led to an improved crack spread, which allowed these companies to enjoy widened margins. (Lower demand due to economic conditions will cause profits to drop in 2009, however.)
"
1486,ARNC,"SUN is a Zacks #2 Rank (""buy"") stock classified in Oil Refining & Marketing. The favorable Zacks Rank reflects the fact that fourth-quarter estimates have been revised upwards.
"
1487,ARNC,"Staying on the energy front, coal producers CONSOL Energy, Inc. (CNX  -  Free Report) and Massey Energy Company (MEE) should also report strong growth. Though coal prices have dropped significantly since June, much of the 2008 production had already been contracted out. This enabled these companies to enjoy higher prices, relative to the spot market and relative to 2007. (Both companies are also expected to show strong growth in 2009.)
"
1488,ARNC,"CNX and MEE are Zacks #3 Rank (""hold"") stocks classified in Coal.
"
1489,ARNC,"High demand for coal also played a role in maintaining earnings momentum for rail companies. As discussed previously in this column, rail companies' reliance on coal and agricultural products has helped to offset some of the weakness caused by the automotive and housing sectors. In addition, they have taken market share away from trucking companies and their
"
1490,ARNC,"Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation (BNI), Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report), Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) and CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) should report growth rates of 18% or better.
"
1491,ARNC,"These are all Zacks #3 Rank stocks classified in Transportation-Rail. All of the aforementioned rail companies should have higher profits in 2009 as well, though rate of growth will be slower than it was in 2008.
"
1492,ARNC,"Outside of the energy sector, drug and medical product companies enjoyed a good quarter. In fact, more than half of the drug companies within the S&P 500 are projected to have generated double-digit earnings  growth thanks to insurance coverage, a lower level of economic sensitivity and Medicare Part D are playing positive roles.
"
1493,ARNC,"Cephalon, Inc. (CEPH), Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) and Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (VAR  -  Free Report) should all report fourth-quarter growth in excess of 20%.
"
1494,ARNC,"All 3 are Zacks #2 Rank (""buy"") stocks. CEPH and GILD are classified in Medicine-Biomed/Genetics. VAR is classified in Medical Instruments.
"
1495,ARNC,"Industries With Declining Profits
"
1496,ARNC,"The significant drop in commodity prices, combined with the credit crunch, significantly affected both mining companies and steel producers. Profits for Alcoa Inc. (AA), AK Steel Holding Corporation (AKS  -  Free Report) and Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report) likely dropped by 50% or more.
"
1497,ARNC,"AA and AKS are Zacks #5 Rank (""strong sell"") stocks and NUE is a Zacks #4 Rank (""sell"") stock. AA is classified in Mining-Non-Ferrous. AKS and NUE are classified in Steel-Producers.
"
1498,ARNC,"Semiconductor prices remain under pressure. Inventory and price competition had been a problem before the credit crunch occurred and the recession has only made matters worse. This morning, Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report) said that DRAM and NAND Flash prices fell 34% and 24%, respectively, during the quarter.
"
1499,ARNC,"Nearly every chip company within the S&P 500 is expected to report a year-over-year decline in profits. This includes Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) and Microchip Technology, Inc. (MCHP).
"
1500,ARNC,"The only exception is Altera Corporation (ALTR), which may have generated profit growth of 31% this quarter.
"
1501,ARNC,"ALTR and MU are Zacks #3 Rank stocks, MCHP is a Zacks #4 Rank stock and INTC is a Zacks #5 Rank stock. All 4 are classified in Electronic Components-Semiconductors.

"
1504,ARNC,"As I write this on Friday morning, there is scuttlebutt that several central banks could announce rate cuts on Monday morning. Though the rumors are unconfirmed, fed fund futures are pricing in a significantly higher probability of a half-point cut occurring at the late-October meeting.
"
1505,ARNC,"Alcoa (AA) will ""officially"" kick off earnings season when it reports on Tuesday afternoon. The aluminum maker is expected to announce profits of 60 cents per share.
"
1506,ARNC,"Joining AA throughout the week will be fellow S&P 500 members: Costco (COST  -  Free Report), Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report), General Electric (GE  -  Free Report), Host Hotel & Resorts (HST  -  Free Report), Monsanto (MON), Progressive (PGR  -  Free Report), Safeway (SWY) and Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report).
"
1507,ARNC,"The minutes from the September Fed meeting will be released on Tuesday afternoon. If a rate cut is announced on Monday morning, the significance of these minutes would be reduced. Nonetheless, the notes will be scrutinized for anything that could unnerve traders or give them hope that things are better than thought.
"
1508,ARNC,"The week's key economic data will include:
"
1509,ARNC,"Tuesday: August consumer credit, Fed minutes
"
1510,ARNC,"Wednesday: August pending home sales, weekly crude inventories
"
1511,ARNC,"Thursday: September import and export prices, weekly initial jobless claims

1512,ARNC,"Friday: August trade balance
"
1513,ARNC,"Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke is scheduled to speak at the National Association of Business Economics' annual meeting on Tuesday afternoon. He will discuss the economy and financial markets.
"
1514,ARNC,"Yom Kippur, the Jewish day of atonement, starts Wednesday at sundown. This should result in lower volume on Thursday. The Stock Trader's Almanac says buying on Yom Kippur and selling at the start of Passover has been a profitable strategy.
"
1515,ARNC,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings Surprises
"
1516,ARNC,"This past Thursday, Monsanto (MON) boosted its fiscal 2008 earnings outlook for the second time in as many months. MON cited strong performance from its Roundup business as the reason for the recent bullishness.
"
1517,ARNC,"Brokerage analysts accordingly narrowed their fiscal fourth-quarter projections to a loss of 12 cents per share from a previously forecasted loss of 16 cents per share. The most accurate estimate is more bullish at a loss of 10 cents per share. Monsanto is scheduled to report on Wednesday, Oct 10, before the start of trading.
"
1518,ARNC,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings SurprisesGeneral Electric  (GE  -  Free Report) recently cut its profit guidance, as volatility in the credit markets hurt its finance arm - GE Capital. The division contributes about 45% to GEs earnings. All of the covering brokerage analysts lowered their profit estimates, sending the third-quarter consensus earnings estimate down to 45 cents per share. The Zacks #4 Rank (""sell"") company has missed consensus in 2 of the last 4 quarters. GE is scheduled to report on Friday, Oct 10, before the start of trading.

"
1542,ARNC,"Aditi Samajpati contributed to this article.1Some of the companies listed in the earnings calendar may not be in the Zacks Rank universe.
"
1543,ARNC,"The lack of fear in the markets continues to be puzzling.
"
1544,ARNC,"Take Thursday for instance. Former St. Louis Fed President William Poole told Bloomberg that Fannie Mae (FNM) and Freddie Mac (FRE) were """"insolvent"". Rising retail sales at Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) were offset by lower spending at J.C. Penny (JCP  -  Free Report), Limited (LTD) and Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report).  Oil rebounded back above $141.
"
1545,ARNC,"So what did stocks do? Close higher on strong volume.
"
1546,ARNC,"It could well be that investors were trying to pick a bottom before earnings season heats up next week. Remember April? Stocks rallied in spite of bad news from the financial sector. Possibly some traders are hoping for a repeat.
"
1547,ARNC,"As much as I want to be optimistic and call for a market rebound, I have to be pragmatic.
"
1548,ARNC,"Excluding energy and financials, negative revisions to full-year earnings estimates are outnumbering positive revisions by a ratio of 1.2:1. This could change in the next few weeks, if guidance is good, but we'll need more than good numbers from Alcoa (AA) and flat earnings from General Electric (GE  -  Free Report).
"
1549,ARNC,"The housing slump appears likely to get worse. The Fed wants to tighten regulations on mortgages. (A step that is long overdue.) Meanwhile, Freddie and Fannie are in trouble (though the Fed might help). Combined, these two events suggest that mortgages will be harder to get. At a time when pending home sales are falling, this is not welcome news.
"
1550,ARNC,"Crude's bubble got bigger, and now it's hurricane season. Bertha didn't do much, fortunately, but it's just July.
"
1551,ARNC,"Consumers are tightening their wallets. With gas averaging $4.10 a gallon and the job market tight, who could blame them? $1200 does not go very far when you're driving a SUV.
"
1552,ARNC,"Despite all of this, the VIX has been at historically tame levels and gold remains far below its recent highs. These are signs of complacency. (Both rose notably on Friday, however.)
"
1553,ARNC,"Adding to the befuddlement is the indiscriminate selling. Video game sales are setting records this year and GameStop's (GME  -  Free Report) valuation keeps getting compressed. EOG Resources (EOG  -  Free Report) got knocked down even though profit forecasts have risen by 50 cents in just the past 30 days.
"
1554,ARNC,"Good stocks with strong fundamentals are being taken out to the woodshed. If there were signs of fear, this would make sense, but there aren't any.
"
1555,ARNC,"The markets can and do act in random ways. This is certainly the case right now.
"
1556,ARNC,"More Volatility Ahead
"
1557,ARNC,"Next week will bring more volatility. There will be earnings announcements from 6 Dow components, inflation data, Fed minutes, option expiration and Congressional testimony from Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke. In addition, about 70 financial firms will report second-quarter results.
"
1558,ARNC,"The light at the end of the tunnel could start appearing in about 10 days, however.
"
1559,ARNC,"Earnings season will shift towards energy and tech companies. Oil companies will have strong profits. If the tech companies can reaffirm full-year guidance, we could get a rebound. Unfortunately, there are concerns about IT spending weakening in the second-half of the year, so don't bet the farm yet.
"
1560,ARNC,"Keep Looking At Stocks
"
1561,ARNC,"When things get messy in the markets, the temptation for investors is to stop looking at the stocks. This is the exact opposite of what you should do. Risky environments bring opportunities.
"
1562,ARNC,"I learned this early in my career by analyzing oilfield companies in Houston. I heard multiple stories of investors who greatly increased their wealth by buying assets when Houston's economy went bust in the 1980s.
"
1563,ARNC,"Rather than shy away, they created a shopping list and looked for bargains.
"
1564,ARNC,"Investing in stocks is no different. This is why we are looking at potential names to add to the Focus List if prices keep dropping.
"
1565,ARNC,"For those of you who are nervous, consider dollar-cost averaging. Given the low cost of commissions, you can easily get your toes wet and still sleep comfortably at night.
"
1566,ARNC,"And if you don't feel comfortable at investing, don't. But keep looking, because when the rebound finally occurs, stocks could rise very quickly.
"
1567,ARNC,"Focus List Update
"
1568,ARNC,"The Zacks Rank for Corning (GLW  -  Free Report) fell to 4 due to a lack of agreement among analysts and a most accurate consensus estimate that was below the current estimate. Consequently, the stock was removed from the portfolio. If GLW provides good guidance and brokerage analysts raise their forecasts, we will consider adding the stock back to the portfolio.
"
1569,ARNC,"Kirby (KEX  -  Free Report) was removed from the portfolio because full-year forecasts were cut within the past 30 days.
"
1570,ARNC,"Silicon Motion (SIMO  -  Free Report) was removed from the Focus List because of unfavorable market conditions. We remain optimistic about the company's prospects, however, and will consider adding it back to the Focus List in the future.
"
1571,ARNC,"Charles Rotblut, CFA is the Senior Market Analyst for Zacks.com. He can be reached at crotblut@zacks.com.
"
1572,ARNC,"This week Alcoa (AA) will report and the second-quarter earnings season will be underway in earnest. At this point the reported data is not that significant.
"
1573,ARNC,"To date, just 28 firms within the S&P 500 have reported second-quarter earnings. Though limited in number, the results have been somewhat encouraging. Positive surprises are leading disappointments by a 3.2:1 ratio, inline with recent historical norms. The median surprise is also inline with recent history, and perhaps a bit better than normal at 4.33%. Expect both the surprise ratio and the median surprise to jump around quite a bit in the early going of the earnings season.
"
1574,ARNC,"The median year over year EPS growth rate of 10.26% would be wonderful news for the market, if it can be held on to as the season progresses. Given the expectations for those that have yet to report that seems possible. The median expected EPS growth rate for the 94.4% of firms that are yet to report is 9.64%. Given the propensity for positive surprises to outnumber disappointments, on a median EPS basis, the second quarter earnings season could be far better than the mood of the market would seem to indicate.
"
1575,ARNC,"Energy is currently expected to win the growth derby, not exactly a shocking idea with oil currently hovering in the $140 a barrel area. Perhaps the bigger question is: Why isnt the expected growth rate much higher than it is? After all, the price of crude has just about doubled since this time last year. The 30.0% year-over-year growth in EPS for the sector looks very conservative to me (but up from 22.3% last week, and 19.7% two weeks ago).
"
1576,ARNC,"Tech and Industrials are currently expected to win Silver and Bronze in the second quarter, with growth of 21.5% and 17.7%, respectively.
"
1577,ARNC,"Once again, the biggest expected loser in the quarter is expected to be the Financials, with half the firms seeing a drop in their EPS of over 7.8%. Consumer Durables follows closely behind with an expected drop of 1.3%. Given that the bulk of the stimulus checks are being mailed out in May and June, it would not surprise me if the retailers in the sector do a little bit better than expected for the quarter. However, even if that is the case, the effect would be short lived. The expected rebound to 3.9% growth in the third quarter seems to reflect slower assumptions about the pace of stimulus check disbursements than has actually happened.
"
1578,ARNC,"Some of the factors which should help median EPS growth are share repurchase, which even though it has slowed in recent months, will still reflect what happened last year. Oddly, increased share counts will also help boost EPS among the Financials. Since the ones that have increased their share counts the most (by going hat in had to the sovereign wealth funds looking for new capital) are the ones that are likely to reports losses, the loss per share will be less. In addition to the extent that firms have large operations overseas, they should benefit from the currency translation effects of the weak dollar. The weak dollar has also boosted those companies that export a substantial portion of their sales.

"
1580,ARNC,"Total net income for the S&P 500 is expected to fall for the third straight quarter. However, the magnitude of the decline is expected to be less than we saw in either the first quarter or in last years fourth quarter. The blame for net income decline once again goes to the Financials (with best supporting actor nomination for the Consumer Discretionary), but so does the credit for a less severe decline than last quarter. Overall, total net income for the S&P 500 is expected to be 12.9% below the second quarter of 2007.
"
1581,ARNC,"In the Financial sector, total net income is expected to be 56.9% lower (was 41.9% last week). In both cases, this marks an improvement over the first quarter when the overall S&P 500 was down by 15.3% and the Financials were down 79.3%. Things are also falling apart for the Discretionary firms, even despite the massive forced lending program known as the stimulus checks. Total net income for the sector is expected to be down 30.4% from a year ago, and even worse showing than the 9.2% year-over-year decline posted in the first quarter.
"
1582,ARNC,"Looking at the very early reports in so far, things look very bleak indeed for the Financials with the total net income of the four firms that have actually reported so far down 89% from a year ago. Those four firms reported a total of $705 million in profits this year versus $6.4 billion last year. There will be more massive write-offs this quarter, but hopefully not quite as massive as we have seen in the previous two quarters. The key flavor of the quarter this time around should be write-offs related to counterparty risk with the monocline insurance firms like Ambac (ABK) and MBIA , which have finally lost their AAA designations. Total net income for all the S&P 500 firms that have reported so far is 41.8% below last year.
"
1583,ARNC,"Energy is expected to be the strongest sector, with total net income climbing 19.1%. The analysts have been raising their sights for the sector rather dramatically. Just last week growth of only 15.8% was expected, and 14.4% growth two weeks ago. However, that is significantly slower growth than the 25.8% posted in the first quarter. With oil at $135 or so, and natural gas over $13, the 19.1% rise in total net income for the sector is seems very conservative, and points to the amount of escalation on the cost side of the equation for the energy firms. Yes, the price of oil is going up, but so too is the price of the steel pipe they put in the ground when they drill a well. While overall, there is a significant tendency for analysts to be too conservative in their earnings estimates, I suspect that energy will be the place with the most potential for large positive surprises.
"
1584,ARNC,"Tech looks like a strong runner up in an otherwise weak field, with growth of 12.6% expected. Beyond that, growth does not look very inspiring, Staples looks like it will capture the bronze with growth of only 6.2%. Five sectors are expected to post lower total net income in this years second quarter than they did a year ago.

"
1586,ARNC,"To help gauge the direction of the market, we take note of what analysts are thinking. By tallying their EPS changes, we can determine our revisions ratio. This ratio simply divides the total number of positive estimate revisions by the total number of estimate cuts. Thus, a high ratio is a bullish indicator and a low ratio is bearish. For the S&P 500 as a whole, a number below 0.80 or above 1.25 is generally significant. For individual sectors the distance from 1.0 should be greater for the numbers to be significant.
"
1587,ARNC,"The revisions ratio for 2008 fell back again, after a slight blip up last week. It has now fallen in five of the last six weeks. It is now at 0.80, a reading that we generally consider slightly negative, down from 0.84 last week, and 0.91 two weeks ago. The overall pace of estimate revisions is past the peak for this quarter, and is starting its seasonal rise. Over the last four weeks there have been 1,365 changes in estimates: 606 up and 759 down, up % from 1,289: 590 up and 699 down last week. Over the next five or six weeks the total number of revisions will most likely triple from current levels. The ratio of firms with rising mean estimates to falling mean estimates is 0.92, slightly stronger than the revisions ratio, and in neutral territory. Two sectors are in positive territory, two in neutral and six in negative territory.
"
1588,ARNC,"Energy was far and away the strongest with over six increases for every cut. While estimate increases were widespread in the sector, firms worth highlighting would include Noble Energy (NBL  -  Free Report), Occidental Petroleum (OXY) and Southwestern Energy (SWN  -  Free Report). From a total economic impact point of view, significant increases were also seen for all of the big three, Exxon (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) and Conoco (COP  -  Free Report)..
"
1589,ARNC,"Tech followed with almost increases for each cut. Dell Computer (DELL) was the most significant contributor to the Tech strength, although chip stocks were generally strong as well.  Staples and Utilities were just neutral to slightly positive, and all other sectors were decidedly negative. Telecom fared the worst this week, but that was on a very small number of total revisions. The Financials were once again very weak, with over three cuts per increase, although the pace of estimate cuts is less than we have generally seen in recent months. Keycorp (KEY  -  Free Report) and Zion (ZION) were among the weakest of the Financials. Lehman Brothers (LEH) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) were also beaten down by the analysts.

"
1591,ARNC,"The 2009 revisions story is similar to the 2008 story, just slightly weaker. The revisions ratio also resumed its decline, and is now solidly in negative territory. It fell to, 0.76, from 0.82 last week, and 0.89 two weeks ago. We still consider that to be in neutral territory.
"
1592,ARNC,"Virtually all the strength is in the Energy sector, with a revisions ratio of 5.00. Tech also put in a decent showing at 2.38, or five increases for every two cuts. The Energy sector accounted for over one quarter off all estimate increases over the last four weeks, and less than five percent of the estimate cuts. Twelve of the 37 firms in the Energy sector have seen their 2009 earnings estimate increase by double digits over the last four weeks alone, including all of the big three (XOM, CVX and COP). In Tech, the PC manufacturers, DELL and Apple (AAPL) were particularly strong.
"
1593,ARNC,"The revisions picture for the Financial sector is even worse for 2009 than it is for 2008, coming in at 0.20, or five cuts for every increase. Revisions like these will eat away at the robust earnings rebound seen for 2009 (unless 2008 gets cut faster). We do not seem to be getting out of the woods on the Financial sector front. While there is weakness throughout the sector, one of the worst areas seems to be banks with big exposure to Ohio, such as Keycorp (KEY  -  Free Report), Fifth Third (FITB), Huntington (HBAN  -  Free Report) and U.S. Bankcorp (USB  -  Free Report).
"
1594,ARNC,"The total number of revisions for the whole S&P 500 for 2009 is also well past its seasonal low point, and starting up out of the valley. There were a total of 1,234 revisions: 534 up and 700 down. This is up % from 1,162 (524 up and 638 down) last week. As second quarter earnings start rolling in, expect the pace of revisions activity to pick up significantly. The ratio of firms with rising mean estimates to falling mean estimates is 0.88, somewhat stronger than the revisions ratio, but also a weak neutral.

"
1596,ARNC,"When making investment decisions, growth should always be looked at in conjunction with how much you are paying for a stock. Thus, it makes sense to look at the total earnings expected for a sector, relative to that sectors total market capitalization. This is basically a variation on looking at the P/E.
"
1597,ARNC,"The chart below shows the share of total earnings for 2007, 2008 and 2009, as well as the share of total market capitalization for each sector (the final bar shown). Since the S&P 500 is a market cap weighted index, this is the same as its index weight. On the chart below, the difference between the sizes of the first three bars shows if a sector is gaining or losing ""earnings share"". The difference between the final bar and the first three bars shows if the sector is selling for an above or below market P/E. If the final bar is smaller than the other bars, the sector is selling for a below market P/E. However, as opposed to just showing the sector P/Es, it also shows the relative importance of the sectors to the overall index.
"
1598,ARNC,"For years, the Financials were the dominate force in the market, both in terms of market cap, and even more so in terms of total earnings. They have now been decisively dethroned on both counts. On the Market cap front it just slipped to third place behind Energy. While still in second place based on 2008 earnings, it seems likely that they will lose that slot as well. Still, despite their current problems, the Financials are still a very significant influence on the market. They will lose the earnings crown this year to the Energy sector. Even with all the disasters in the sector, for 2007, the Financials accounted for 22.0% of the total net income for the S&P 500. In 2008, that is currently expected to decline to 14.5% before rebounding to 19.1% in 2009. However, in recent years the sector has accounted for well over a quarter of all earnings. Energy has usurped the crown this year, with its earnings share climbing to 20.2% from 15.6% in 2007. However, analysts expect a Financials restoration next year, with the sectors share rebounding to 19.1% while Energy slips back to 18.5%. Given the trends in the earnings estimates, it strikes me as highly unlikely that the Financials will regain their throne. I expect that the expectations for total earnings for the Energy sector will surpass those of the Financial sector for 2009 within two months (probably sooner).
"
1599,ARNC,"On the market cap (and index weight) front, Tech overtook the Financials a two months ago and currently stands at 16.9%. Energy has moved into second place when it comes to index weight at 15.6%. The Financials have plunged to 14.1% of the index. As recently as the end of February, Financials had a 17.2% index weighting versus 15.7% for Tech and just 13.0% for Energy. Most analysts are using very conservative pricing assumptions in their forecasts for the Energy sector (relative to that implied in the futures market), so earnings estimates still have lots of room to rise.
"
1600,ARNC,"Keep in mind that these numbers are snapshots, when you should be thinking about a movie. At the end of February (the first time we had a complete read on 2009), the Financials were expected to gather 22.1% of all earnings for 2008, and Energy was expected to only get 16.0%. For 2009, the expected earnings shares were 15.0% for Energy and 22.4% for Financials. In general it seems as if the Energy sector is consistently gaining 0.2% of share for each year every week, with a similar decline for the Financials. If those trends continue, then Energy could be as dominate on the earnings front in 2008 as the Financials were in 2007, and the Financials could slip into third place in total earnings behind Tech.
"
1601,ARNC,"For many years Financials were clearly the dominate factor in the overall market, despite generally selling for below market P/Es. Based on 2008 earnings, the Financials have a P/E of 13.6x and based on 2009, only 8.5x. However given the pace of estimate cuts in the sector, the true P/E is probably higher since the actual earnings will be significantly lower. Energy has just taken the throne as the cheapest based on 2008 earnings trading at 10.8x, and 9.7x based on 2009 expectations.
"
1602,ARNC,"The Tech sector is far and away the most expensive in the market, trading for 17.1x 2008 and 14.5x 2009 expectations. Keep your eyes on the revisions. Unless the spreading of economic weakness to the rest of the world causes oil prices to plunge (and the recent trends are very much in the other direction), you can have much more confidence in energy earnings forecasts actually being achieved (or exceeded) than is true with the financials.
"
1603,ARNC,"The S&P 500 as a whole is trading for 14.0x and 11.6x, 2008 and 2009 earnings, respectively. Based on a blend of 60% 2008 earnings and 40% 2009 earnings; that translates to a 7.51% earnings yield, which looks extremely cheap relative to a 3.97% ten year T-note. Even against the AA corporate bond yield of 6.48% it looks attractive. However, the current level of expectations for corporate earnings still implies that profits will stay well above their historical averages as a share of GDP. That would be an exceedingly rare occurrence during a recession. The comparison between the earnings yield on the S&P and the 10 year T-note is in my opinion more a reflection of the extreme unattractiveness of long term T-notes at this point than stocks looking particularly cheap in general, however there are attractive stocks out there. It appears that the flight to quality has caused a massive bubble in the price of T-notes. This is far and away, in my opinion, the most significant bubble in the market today, not the price of oil. The prices are hard to justify given the risk that the massive injections of liquidity by the Fed to ameliorate the credit crunch will end up fueling the fires of inflation.
"
1604,ARNC,"Neil Malkin contributed significantly to this report.
"
1605,ARNC,"Data in this report, unless stated otherwise, is through the close on Wednesday 7/2/2008
"
1606,ARNC,"Just a few months after the last rate cut, calls for a rate hike are getting louder and louder. Fears of inflation spinning out of control are quieting concerns about the ongoing credit crunch and sluggish economy.
"
1607,ARNC,"Raising rates to curtail inflation has worked before. Unfortunately, the strategy may not be as effective this time without international coordination and the willingness to curtail global economic growth.
"
1608,ARNC,"Commodities and Economics 101
"
1609,ARNC,"The driving force behind the inflationary pressures is the rally in commodities. Although oil is currently in a speculative bubble, there are fundamental reasons for oil to trade in the $70-$90 range, which would be still expensive by most measures. Global economic expansion and limits (both physical and logistical) on the amount of new supply have pushed prices higher. It's economics 101: More cars and products made with petroleum-based materials = more demand = higher crude prices.
"
1610,ARNC,"Corn prices hit records this week as traders reacted to bad weather in the Midwest and a lowered forecast from the USDA. Again, even without speculators, food prices would be higher simply because more people can afford to eat, the emergence of biofuels and bad weather.
"
1611,ARNC,"Then there are various other commodities, such as metals, potash, etc. Economic expansion combined with physical and logistical limitations are resulting in higher prices.
"
1612,ARNC,"All of this diminishes the effectiveness of a rate hike by the Fed. If Bernanke really wants to get inflation under control, he should push aggressively for energy conservation and strongly argue against biofuels. In addition, he should work with other central banks to raise rates worldwide. And while he is at it, he should demand a solution to this country's health care crisis. (He is testifying on Monday before a Senate committee about health care reform.)
"
1613,ARNC,"Bernanke could coordinate with other central banks on adjusting rates, but that's about all he can do. After all, he can't (and shouldn't) tell people not to eat, his focus should not be on environmental matters and he's not going to directly tackle health care. Furthermore, I cannot foresee India and China raising rates by such a large amount that they would voluntarily derail their economic expansions.
"
1614,ARNC,"U.S. Economy Still Weak
"
1615,ARNC,"The other factor that Bernanke has to contend with is the state of the U.S. economy. The country is losing jobs. Home foreclosures rose last month, the 29th consecutive monthly increase according to RealtyTrac. The Beige Book described conditions as ""generally weak"". Yes, May retail sales were higher, but that number was influenced by the stimulus checks.
"
1616,ARNC,"Then there is the credit crunch. The Lehman (LEH) debacle was a yet another sign the financial community is not on stable ground. The Federal Reserve is bracing for more bank failures. Lending standards remain tight. As I have said before, history shows us that when liquidity bubbles are followed by credit crunches, recessions happen.
"
1617,ARNC,"Even though I remain hopeful for a rebound, I think the Fed should wait for the rebound to actually emerge before tinkering with interest rates.
"
1618,ARNC,"Reason for Hope
"
1619,ARNC,"It is very possible that prices could begin to stabilize sooner than later. Many commodities are in speculative bubbles and once those bubbles pop, prices will fall. This will take away some of the headline pressure and give Bernanke the ability to hold off on raising rates. Prices for the consumer, however, will not fall noticeably because many businesses have not fully passed on higher input costs. Therefore, even when the oil bubble finally bursts, gasoline will not be a bargain.
"
1620,ARNC,"More importantly, a stabilization of prices will help margins for multiple companies. This, in turn, should improve earnings growth and, in turn, boost stock prices.
"
1621,ARNC,"Second-Quarter Earnings Preview
"
1622,ARNC,"Several of the companies that traditionally report early are on next week's calendar, including Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) on Tuesday and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) on Wednesday. Second-quarter earnings season will not ""officially"" start until July 8, when Alcoa (AA) reports.
"
1623,ARNC,"Approximately 60% of the companies within the S&P 500 should report year-over-year profit growth. Median per share earnings, which diminish the negative impact of financial companies, should increase 6.4%.
"
1624,ARNC,"At the aggregate level, which is influenced by the weighting of the index, the outlook is pessimistic. Bottom-up analysis (compiling individual estimates for all 500 companies) calculates a year-over-year decrease of 9.6%. Top-down analysis (compiling estimates for the index itself) calculates a year-over-year decrease of 7.5%.
"
1625,ARNC,"VIX Rising
"
1626,ARNC,"The volatility of the past few days had some traders reaching for puts. The VIX, which is perceived as a measure of the amount of fear, rebounded strongly this week.
"
1627,ARNC,"Putting things into perspective, the VIX has been at relatively higher levels ever since the credit crunch took hold. Therefore, I would refrain from reading much into this week's rebound.
"
1628,ARNC,"Focus List Update
"
1629,ARNC,"The recent pullback in Genco Shipping & Trading (GNK  -  Free Report) was caused by a large drop in the Baltic Dry Index. The index calculates spot rates for ships. The Associated Press reported that the drop was caused by lower demand from China for iron ore. Spot rates are volatile and we are monitoring the situation.
"
1630,ARNC,"Diversification guidelines and a reluctance to chase stocks driven higher by the rally in commodity prices have kept us from making any additions as of late. Diversification has been the biggest hurdle lately, as we don't want to put too heavy an emphasis on fertilizer and oil E&P stocks.
"
1631,ARNC,"Rest assured, we are constantly looking for new candidates.

"
1633,ARNC,"The week is going to be about earnings and whether the stock market can sustain its current momentum.
"
1634,ARNC,"We have confirmed that nearly 800 companies are going to report. Most of the attention from the news media will rightfully be on large-caps with 167 members of the S&P 500 on the schedule. Included in this group are nine Dow components: 3M (MMM  -  Free Report), American Express (AXP), AT&T (T  -  Free Report), Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), Boeing (BA), DuPont (DD), McDonald's (MCD  -  Free Report), Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report).
"
1635,ARNC,"The economic calendar is very light with just a few key reports. The Federal Open Market Committee will meet next on Apr 29-30.

"
1639,ARNC,"Will the market be able to maintain its current upward momentum? All three of the major indexes are testing the upper end of their trading ranges as I write this on Friday morning. An upward breakout will need to be accompanied by strong volume and follow-through.
"
1640,ARNC,"The shift away from financial earnings could, ironically, hurt the market because less bad news is priced into companies from most other sectors. (Homebuilders, and to a lesser extent retailers, are the notable exception.) Brokerage analysts expect average earnings growth from the S&P 500 companies reporting next week to be 3.5%. (The median growth rate is higher at 8%).
"
1641,ARNC,"For the nine Dow components on the calendar, the average expected growth rate is -0.9% and the median is 6.3%. Not bad numbers, but also not the stuff that rallies are made of.
"
1642,ARNC,"Still, if an upside breakout does occur, there is a possibility of an extended upward move. Just be ware that bear markets can have strong, temporary rallies.
"
1643,ARNC,"First-Quarter Earnings
"
1644,ARNC,"As of Thursday evening, about 20% of the companies within the S&P 500 have reported first-quarter earnings. Positive earnings surprises are outnumbering negative earnings surprises by a margin of 2.2:1, which is actually worse than the recent sentiment would have investors believe.
"
1645,ARNC,"Growth remains a matter of perception. Median per share earnings growth is running at a brisk 8.6%. Median net income growth, however, is a nominal 1.6%. Average earnings per share and average net income are both down by more than 27%.
"
1646,ARNC,"Out of the 20 companies with the biggest declines in year-over-year net income, 16 are either in the financial or construction sector. The four exceptions are Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report), The New York Times (NYT  -  Free Report), Alcoa (AA) and International Game Technology (IGT). These companies have posted year-over-year declines of 40% or more.
"
1647,ARNC,"Keep in mind that the sample size remains small and there will be fluctuations over the next couple of weeks.
"
1648,ARNC,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings Surprises during the Week of Apr 21 - 25
"
1649,ARNC,"Utilities may seem too conservative for many traders, but shares of American Electric Power (AEP) have moved higher after the previous earnings surprises - providing an opportunity for short-term profits. A recent revision by one of the covering brokerage analysts suggests the electric utility could again surprise to the upside. The current first-quarter consensus earnings estimate of 75 cents per share is three cents higher than average forecast of a month ago. The most accurate estimate is more bullish at 88 cents per share. American Electric Power is scheduled to report on Thursday, Apr 24, before the start of trading.
"
1650,ARNC,"Record oil and natural gas prices are benefiting companies with exposure to the upstream side of the business, particularly exploration and production (E&P). This is why brokerage analysts have raised their first-quarter profit forecasts on EnCana (ECA  -  Free Report) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY  -  Free Report) within the past 30 days.
"
1651,ARNC,"During the past 30 days, positive revisions by three brokerage analysts have boosted the first-quarter consensus earnings estimate on EnCana to $1.23 per share, from $1.17 per share. The most accurate estimate is more bullish at $1.25 per share. ECA has exceeded expectations for four consecutive quarters. EnCana is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Apr 22, before the start of trading.
"
1652,ARNC,"The current consensus earnings estimate for OXY of $1.90 per share is 27 cents higher than the average forecast of a month ago and reflects positive revisions from half of the 14 covering brokerage analysts. The most accurate consensus is more bullish at $1.95 per share. OXY has exceeded expectations for five consecutive quarters. Occidental Petroleum is scheduled to report on Thursday, Apr 24, before the start of trading.
"
1653,ARNC,"Western Digital's (WDC  -  Free Report) newly announced stock repurchase plan won't have any impact on first-quarter results, but brokerage analysts remain optimistic about the company's performance. Revisions by two analysts have pushed the first-quarter consensus earnings estimate a penny higher to $1.09 per share. The most accurate estimate is more bullish at $1.12 per share. The storage device maker has exceeded expectations for 13 out of the past 14 quarters. Western Digital is scheduled to report on Thursday, Apr 24, after the close of trading.
"
1654,ARNC,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings Surprises during the Week of Apr 21 - 25
"
1655,ARNC,"One area adversely affected by the credit crunch, but overlooked by many traders, is residential pool supplies. Brokerage analysts have noticed, however, and they have reacted by cutting their forecasts on Pool Corporation (POOL  -  Free Report). The current first-quarter consensus estimate calls for a loss of four cents per share; two months ago, analysts had expected breakeven results. The most accurate estimate is more bearish at a loss of five cents per share. POOL has missed expectations during three out of the last four quarters. Pool Corp is scheduled to report on Thursday, Apr 24, before the start of trading.

"
1661,ARNC,"There is a noticeable differentiation between companies that are issuing positive surprises and those that are issuing negative surprises. Among S&P 1500 companies, 249 have beat earnings expectations and 100 have missed earnings expectations. Among those that have issued positive surprises, the median growth first-quarter EPS rate is 14.2%. Among those companies that have issued negative surprises, the median EPS growth rate is -7.2% 1. 
"
1662,ARNC,"Industry and economic trends are having an impact on how companies are performing. 
"
1663,ARNC,"For example, 10 machinery companies have reported better-than-expected earnings versus just three disappointments. The median growth rate is 18.3%. Astec Industries (ASTE  -  Free Report) topped expectations by a penny with profits of 69 cents per share. Profits were pushed 38% higher by improved sales of asphalt equipment and recycling equipment. Cooper Industries (CBE) earned 71 cents in the first quarter, five cents better than brokerage analyst forecasts and 24.6% over above year prior results. The company benefited from sustained strength in the utility and aerospace markets, as well as international economic growth. First-quarter sales of heavy-duty truck equipment and Brazilian agricultural equipment were better than the company expected and helped to offset some of the weakness in the U.S. ASTE is a Zacks #1 Rank (strong buy) classified in Machinery-Construction/Mining and CBE is a Zacks #2 Rank (buy) stock classified in Machinery-General Industrial.
"
1664,ARNC,"Metal companies have also reported strong earnings, with 10 of out 11 exceeding expectations. The median growth rate is 12.9%. Aerospace and non-residential construction helped Alcoa (AA) beat brokerage analysts forecasts. The company earned 79 cents per share versus 70 cents a year prior. (Analysts had been expecting profits of 77 cents per share.) U.S. Steel (X  -  Free Report) said yesterday that first-quarter earnings totaled $2.30 per share, 46 cents above forecasts and 22 cents above year-ago results. X benefited from higher contract prices and cost-cutting measures. The company also said that it expects shipment volumes of flat rolled-steel to improve in the second quarter. AA is a Zacks #3 Rank (strong buy) stock and is classified in Mining-Non Ferrous. U.S. Steel (X  -  Free Report) is a Zacks #1 Rank (strong buy) stock and is classified in Steel-Producers.
"
1665,ARNC,"Conversely, profits for semiconductor companies are lackluster. The median growth rate among the 11 S&P 1500 chip companies that have reported is -4.3%. Three companies generated triple-digit declines with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) reporting the biggest drop in year-over-year results. AMD generated a loss of 91 cents per share versus a profit of 41 cents per share. Downward pressure on prices and a lower number of shipments adversely impacted the company. Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report) attributed lower pricing for causing it to swing to a loss of seven cents from a year earlier profit of seven cents. Prices for NAND flash memory products fell by approximately 30%. AMD is a Zacks #5 Rank (strong sell) stock and MU is a Zacks #3 Rank stock; both are classified in Electronics-Semiconductors.
"
1666,ARNC,"The problems with the housing sector are weighing on Banks & Thrifts. The median growth rate among the 46 S&P 1500 firms that have reported is -2.4%. Slightly more companies have missed expectations than beat (19 negative surprises versus 18 positive surprises). Both First Horizon National (FHN) and Washington Mutual (WM) saw their profits fall. WM was also adversely affected by the ongoing deterioration in the subprime market. FHN is a Zacks #3 Rank stock classified in Banks-Southeast and WM is a Zacks #3 Rank stock classified in Finance-Savings & Loan. (The Zacks Rank for both FHN and WM is not worse because the comparatively large number of analysts covering both stocks. Although multiple brokerage analysts have cut full-year estimates on both stocks, not every analyst has revised their forecasts. Agreement is one of the four factors that determine the Zacks Rank.)

"
1669,ARNC,"The reaction to Alcoas (AA) first-quarter surprise has been positive overall. Since the company reported quarterly profits of 79 cents per share, five of the 15 covering brokerage analysts have raised their full-year forecasts. The new consensus estimate calls for earnings of $3.26 per share, five cents above the average projection of a week ago. It should be noted that one analyst did lower his forecast, but he still remains comparatively bullish with a prediction of $3.30 per share.
"
1670,ARNC,"Alcoa generated an 11% increase in sales, thanks to both good demand and higher prices. The company saw particular strength in the aerospace market, but also noted that Chinese demand remains very good. CEO Alain Belda described the world market as being robust.
"
1671,ARNC,"Steel Dynamics (STLD  -  Free Report) followed Alcoas report with its own first-quarter surprise. STLD generated earnings of $1.01 per share, three cents above the upper end of its raised guidance and five cents above the consensus estimate. Revenues rose 30%, reflecting strength in the non-residential construction and industrial markets. 
"
1672,ARNC,"A decline in prices adversely impacted margins; the company saw its average consolidated selling price drop by $31 per ton on a sequential quarterly basis. The price decline may have been caused by higher inventory levels within the channel during the first-quarter  a headwind that raised concern for the entire industry. STLD observed in late-March that inventory levels at steel service centers had declined, however  a bullish sign. 
"
1673,ARNC,"Two of the nine covering brokerage analysts raised their full-year forecasts on STLD following the release of the first-quarter results. The new consensus estimate calls for 2007 earnings to total $3.87 per share versus $3.84 a week ago and $3.76 two months ago. 
"
1674,ARNC,"AA is a Zacks #2 Rank (buy) stock and is classified in Mining-Non Ferrous. This group also contains four Zacks #1 Rank (strong buy) stocks: Chalco (ACH), Anglo American (AGPPY), Freeport McMoRan (FCX  -  Free Report) and Kaiser Aluminum (KALU  -  Free Report). STLD is a Zacks #3 Rank (hold) stock and is classified in Steel-Producers. This group contains five Zacks #1 Rank stocks, AK Steel Holdings (AKS  -  Free Report), Arcelor Mittal (MT  -  Free Report), CIA Siderur (SID  -  Free Report), Schnitzer Steel (SCHN  -  Free Report) and U.S. Steel (X  -  Free Report).

"
1677,ARNC,"Aluminum giant Alcoa (AA) typically gets the credit for kick-starting the earnings season even though its earnings release after the close on Wednesday April 8th wouldn’t technically be the first this reporting cycle (or any earnings season for that matter). We already have Q1 reports from 20 S&P 500 members, with many of them like FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report), Nike (NKE  -  Free Report), Costco (COST  -  Free Report) and other real bellwethers in their respective spaces and far more representative of the U.S. economy and Corporate America.
"
1678,ARNC,"We should be mindful, however, that all of these early reporters have been releasing results for their fiscal quarters ending in February, which gets counted as part of the Q1 tally. In fairness to the aluminum giant, they are the first S&P 500 member on the calendar quarter to release results this week. Alcoa’s earnings report isn’t totally irrelevant to the broader earnings season either, particularly since the company’s operations have become more downstream oriented and the automotive and aerospace industries have steadily become major end-markets.
"
1679,ARNC,"Alcoa is expected to earn 25 cents this quarter, down 4 cents since early January, but up materially from the 9 cents it earned in the year-earlier quarter. The strong growth this quarter is a function of higher aluminum price realizations and the absence of some of the issues that held down year-earlier profitability. But more important than earnings growth, market participants will be looking for management’s commentary about the state of global aluminum demand, which will be seen as a proxy for the health of the global economy.Sharp Revisions to Q1 Estimates
"
1680,ARNC,"Unlike the 4-cent negative revision to the Q1 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate for Alcoa over the last three months (from $0.29 to $0.25), estimates for the S&P 500 index came down far more sharply in that time period. Negative revisions to Q1 estimates were hardly unusual - this has been the trend for quite some time and has become particularly notable over the last couple of years as management teams have been consistently providing weak guidance.
"
1681,ARNC,"One could cite a variety of reasons for why this has been the norm lately, but the most logical though cynical explanation is that management teams have a big incentive to manage expectations. After all, it pays to under-promise and over-deliver.
"
1682,ARNC,"The chart below shows this trend clearly. The dark green columns show the earnings growth expected at the start of each quarter; the orange column shows the growth rate expected by the time the earnings season gets underway and the shaded green column shows the actual growth achieved that quarter. For 2015 Q1, we started at +4% in early January, which has effectively flipped by now. But if history is any guide, then the actual growth rate will likely be in the vicinity of where we started out in January. Other than 2014 Q4, this has been the pattern repeatedly in recent quarters.  
"
1683,ARNC,"Keep in mind however that while the trend of negative revisions is no different from other recent periods, the magnitude of negative revisions for 2015 Q1 exceeds any other recent quarter by a big margin.
"
1684,ARNC,"The chart below shows the magnitude of negative revisions for each quarter since 2013 Q2. As you can see, 2015 Q1 estimates have fallen -8% since January 1st, the most of any other recent quarter in the comparable period. Please note that the ‘average’ represents the average for the 7-quarter period through 2014 Q4.Chart 1: The Magnitude of 2015 Q1 Earnings Revisions Compared
"
1685,ARNC,"The Energy sector’s travails resulting from the sharp drop in oil prices are well known; we saw that in the sector’s performance in the last earnings season as well when total earnings for the Energy sector were down -17.3% on -13.5% lower revenues. The Energy sector is an even bigger drag this time around, with total earnings for the sector expected to be down -62.7% on -36.2% lower revenues.
"
1686,ARNC,"But it would be wrong to blame the Energy sector alone for the outsized negative revision to Q1 estimates that chart 1 above shows. The magnitude of negative revisions to Q1 estimates is still the highest of any other recent quarter after we isolate and exclude the Energy sector from the aggregate picture. We show that in chart 2 below which compares the magnitude of Q1 estimate revisions on an ex-Energy basis.Chart 2: Magnitude of Q1 Revisions outside of the Energy Sector
"
1687,ARNC,"Chart 3 below looks at the same revisions trend from another angle. Instead of the magnitude of revisions in total earnings over the quarter, here we are showing how the estimates of total earnings growth have evolved over this time period. We show the evolving aggregate growth picture for the S&P 500 index as a whole (green bars), as well as on an ex-Energy sector basis (grey bars). The shaded bars at the end show what is expected today, with and without the Energy sector.Chart 3: Evolution of 2015 Q1 Growth Estimates
"
1688,ARNC,"Chart 4 below shows the major sectors that have suffered the biggest negative revisions since the start of the quarter. Please note that each of the 16 Zacks sectors has suffered negative revisions; the Utilities sector has the lowest negative revision, but has nevertheless gone down.Chart 4: Major Sectors with Big Negative Revisions
"
1689,ARNC,"As you can see in chart 4, even the Technology sector has suffered negative revisions, with earnings for the sector now expected to be up only +1.2% from the same period last year vs. expectations of +9.1% growth at the start of the quarter. But even this positive growth is thanks only Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report). Exclude Apple from the Tech sector and the sector’s growth rate falls into negative territory.Are Q1 Estimates Too Low?
"
1690,ARNC,"The pronounced downshift in Q1 estimates has prompted some on Wall Street to start claiming that the revisions trend may have a gone bit too much; meaning that estimates have likely become too low. Hard to find a basis for such a claim in real time, particularly given the ongoing global growth woes and still-high U.S dollar.
"
1691,ARNC,"The market’s reaction to the results from the 20 S&P 500 members that have already reported Q1 results (all of these companies have reported fiscal February quarter results that get counted as part of the Q1 tally) doesn’t support the claim that estimates may be too low. While it may be premature to draw any firm conclusions from the 20 results thus far, but we nevertheless don’t get the impression that that estimates may have been too low.
"
1692,ARNC,"Here is the scorecard for the 20 S&P 500 members that have already reported 2015 Q1 results (all of these companies have fiscal quarters ending in February)
"
1693,ARNC,"As you can see, total earnings for these 20 companies are up +4.9% from the same period last year on +1.9% higher revenues, with 80% beating earnings estimates and 45% beating revenue estimates.
"
1694,ARNC,"Comparing the results from these 20 S&P 500 members with what we have been seeing from the same companies in other recent quarters shows that:
"
1695,ARNC,"The earnings and revenue growth rates are below what we have been seeing in other recent quarters.
"
1696,ARNC,"The earnings beat ratios are in-line with the preceding quarter (2014 Q4), but better than the 4-quarter average.
"
1697,ARNC,"The revenue beat ratios are below what these same companies reported in the preceding as well as 4-quarter average.
"
1698,ARNC,"The chart below shows the comparison of the results thus far with what we have been seeing from the same group of companies in other recent quarters.
"
1699,ARNC,"The table below presents the summary picture for Q1 contrasted with what companies actually reported in the 2014 Q4 earnings season.
"
1700,ARNC,"As you can see in the above summary table, total Q1 earnings are expected to be down -3.3% from the same period last on -4.5% lower revenues, with Energy as the biggest drag on the growth rate. Excluding Energy, total earnings for the remainder of the S&P 500 index would be up a decent enough +4.7% on +0.7% higher revenues.  Among the major sectors, Finance and Medical are big growth contributors this quarter, with Finance earnings expected to be up +9.2% and Medical earnings up +11.7%. We should keep in mind however that a small number of companies are accounting for most of the growth for these two sectors – Finance growth is solely due to easy comparisons for Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) and the Medical growth is due to the strong growth at Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) and Actavis (ACT). Exclude these three companies from the ex-Energy growth rate for the index, we are not left with much.Will Q1 be the Low Point for the Year?
"
1701,ARNC,"We haven’t had much earnings growth lately and the growth rate for Q1 is expected to turn negative. Not only is the growth rate for Q1 so low, but the overall level of total earnings for the S&P 500 index are also expected to be the lowest in two years. This will be a material change from the last two quarters when aggregate earnings for the index reached all-time record levels.
"
1702,ARNC,"The chart below shows the earnings totals for 2015 Q1 (shaded orange bar - $250.5 billion) contrasted with the actual earnings for the preceding four quarters as well estimates for the following three quarters. The hopes are that Q1 will be the low point for the year, with aggregate earnings moving back into record territory towards the end of the year. Recent history tells otherwise. If history is our guide, then the likely result will be revisions to those lofty estimates in the coming days.This Week’s Reporting Calendar

"
1706,ARNC,"Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX  -  Free Report) can't hide from the crash in commodity prices. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) recently slashed its dividend by 84% in order to conserve cash.
"
1707,ARNC,"Freeport-McMoRan is one of the largest copper and gold producers in the world but in 2013, in a controversial move, it expanded its commodities portfolio into energy and now has oil and natural gas assets in North America, including in the Deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico, onshore and offshore California and in the Haynesville shale.Dividend Cut
"
1708,ARNC,"Even while its shares slid, Freeport-McMoRan had been paying one of the juiciest dividends in the industry at 6.80%.
"
1709,ARNC,"But on March 24, the company announced that it was cutting the dividend by 84% to $0.05 per share from $0.3125 per share payable on May 1, 2015 to shareholders of record as of April 15 in order to conserve its cash.
"
1710,ARNC,"It was the first dividend cut since it suspended the dividend completely during the financial crisis in 2008. Once the crisis abated, it resumed the dividend.
"
1711,ARNC,"In 2013, the company paid $9 billion in cash and stock to acquire Plains Exploration & Production and McMoRan Exploration. Energy is now approximately 25% of revenue.
"
1712,ARNC,"But with crude prices crashing, so has revenue. 
"
1713,ARNC,"The company is also cutting capital expenditures in the oil and gas business to strengthen the balance sheet.Earnings Estimates Slashed for 2015 and 2016
"
1714,ARNC,"Not surprisingly, given weaker commodities prices, the analysts have been busy cutting full year estimates. 
"
1715,ARNC,"14 estimates have been cut for 2015 and 10 have slashed for 2016 in the last 60 days.
"
1716,ARNC,"Over the last 3 months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2015 has sunk to $0.99 from $2.23. 
"
1717,ARNC,"That's an earnings decline of 49.4% compared to 2014 when the company earned $1.96.
"
1718,ARNC,"This price and consensus chart is what you don't want to see as an investor. Earnings are going the wrong way. They're going down.Shares Still Not Cheap
"
1719,ARNC,"Freeport's shares have plunged 41% in the last year. 
"
1720,ARNC,"But because earnings are also being lowered at a similarly quick pace, the shares aren't cheap.
"
1721,ARNC,"Freeport still trades with a forward P/E of 19. That's still above the average of the S&P 500 which is trading at 17.5. And no one is talking about how cheap the S&P 500 is these days either.
"
1722,ARNC,"The commodities companies are in a tight place right now. 
"
1723,ARNC,"If you insist on owning one, you might want to focus on the aluminum producers like Alcoa Inc. (AA). It's trading with a forward P/E of just 11.5, so it actually IS cheap, and is expected to grow earnings by 19.5% this year. It's a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Want More of Our Best Recommendations?

"
1725,ARNC,"We are almost three weeks away from Alcoa’s (AA) earnings release on April 8th, but the 2015 Q1 earnings season will get underway this week with the Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) and Adobe (ADBE  -  Free Report) reports after the close on Tuesday. All of these early reporters have fiscal quarters ending in February, which we count as part of our 2015 Q1 tally.
"
1726,ARNC,"In total, we will get results from more than 100 companies this week, including 9 S&P 500 members. But as you can see in the chart below of weekly reporting calendar for companies in the S&P 500 index, we will have to wait another 4 weeks for the Q1 reporting cycle to really ramp up.
"
1727,ARNC,"Estimates have come down sharply over the last few months, with total earnings for the quarter now expected to be down -4.9% from the same period last year, down from expectations of positive +4.9% growth in mid-December and +10.8% in early October.
"
1728,ARNC,"As was the case in Q4, Energy is the biggest driver of this negative revisions trend. While total Q1 earnings for the Energy sector were expected to be down (only) -35.6% in mid-December, they are now expected to be down -63.3% year over year. But it’s not all due to the Energy sector, as estimates beyond the Energy sector have been coming down as well.
"
1729,ARNC,"The chart below plots the evolution of current and following quarter estimates over the last few months. As you can see, the first half 2015 growth rate has effectively evaporated under the combined effect of developments in the oil patch, the U.S. dollar strength and global growth issues.
"
1730,ARNC,"The chart above is spotlighting the revisions trend for the first two quarters of the 2015, though the expected growth picture for the second half of the year has taken a big beating in recent days as well. In fact, the double-digit earnings growth expectation for 2015 has already disappeared and been pushed forward into 2016 now.  
"
1731,ARNC,"The chart below focuses solely on evolution of 2015 Q1 estimates and presents the evolving picture with and without the Energy sector. As you can see, the Energy sector is undoubtedly the biggest driver, but estimates have been coming down fairly sharply outside of the Energy sector as well.
"
1732,ARNC,"The green columns represent the aggregate growth expectation for the S&P 500 as a whole over different time periods since early October 2014; the grey column shows the same data on an ex-Energy basis.
"
1733,ARNC,"The chart below shows the major sectors that suffered the negative revisions for Q1.
"
1734,ARNC,"This pronounced downshift in estimates has prompted some on Wall Street to start claiming that the revisions trend may have a gone bit too much; meaning that estimates have likely become too low. Hard to find a basis for such a claim in real time, particularly given the global growth woes and still-high U.S dollar. But we will find soon enough as actual Q1 results start coming in.

1738,ARNC,"Snakebit: adjective -,bit - having bad luck: very unlucky
"
1739,ARNC,"You can add another definition to the word snakebit here, and it’s not the phrase “Bear of the Day” which this snakebit stock is. No, you only need to add the company name, Freeport McMoran Copper & Gold (FCX). As if it wasn’t bad enough to be a gold miner over the course of the last couple of years, FCX tried, in vain, to hedge its metals exposure by getting into another very popular commodity. Unfortunately for FCX when it chose to diversify away from gold and copper into oil, it did so when Brent was at $109 and West Texas was at $86. In case you haven’t been paying much attention as of late, oil is trading in the $40s.
"
1740,ARNC,"Surprising to some may be the fact that gold has been staging a bit of a rally in the face of all this. While the US dollar continues to flex its muscle and bring the commodities space to its knees, the base metal has begun to creep up slowly. But the increase in gold’s price has yet to be reflected in analysts’ opinions of Freeport.
"
1741,ARNC,"Quite the opposite actually as over the last 60 days, ten analysts have dropped their estimates for the current year while only a single analyst has pushed higher. The activity has helped to suppress consensus estimates down to $1.85 from the lofty expectations for $2.65. The story next year looks very similar as well. Six analysts have brought estimates down, helping consensus dip down to $3.78 from expectations of $5.08 just 90 days ago. The recent quarterly miss isn’t doing much to bolster the stock either. FCX came in 25 cents per share for the quarter ending 12/2014, 10 cents shy of the Zacks Consensus at 35 cents.
"
1742,ARNC,"As you can imagine, traders haven’t been nice to FCX. After reaching a 52-week high of $39.32 in July 2014 FCX ran out of buying momentum. After stochastic switched from overbought ahead of the high, there was a bearish cross then a subsequent drop below the 25 day moving average shifted by 5 days (25x5). Since that first dip below, FCX has only managed to pop above the 25x5 on November 21st, but couldn’t manage to stay above it for more than a few days. Now you’ve got an extremely oversold FCX that’s dragging its knuckles down at $17.42, off 63% from the highs just a few months ago.
"
1743,ARNC,"Investors looking to gain more exposure to the metals and mining industry should take a closer look at Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stocks Alcoa (AA) and Thompson Creek (TC). 
"
1744,ARNC,"The 2014 Q4 earnings season has gotten underway already, with results from 22 S&P 500 members already out. These companies are reporting results for the fiscal quarter ending in November, which we count as part of our December quarter tally. Alcoa’s (AA) claim to fame as the first to come out with results is solely because it is the first index member with a fiscal calendar quarter to announce results. Most of the 18 S&P 500 members reporting results this week are on the December quarter.
"
1745,ARNC,"Results from the Finance sector would dominate this week’s reporting docket, with all the key players like J.P. Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) coming out with results this week. Expectations for the sector remain low, with total Finance sector earnings expected to be essentially flat from the same period last year (down -0.3% to be precise).
"
1746,ARNC,"Citigroup is a big drag on the aggregate picture for the sector, with its $2.7 billion settlement with the Department of Justice making year-over-year comparisons difficult. In principle, the Citigroup settlement charge in the quarter should be excluded from ‘operating’ results as a one-time and non-recurring item that isn’t part of the bank’s recurring operations. But we know better. These non-recurring charges have become so frequent that treating them as anything but recurring would be wrong. Excluding Citigroup from the sector’s results, total Finance sector earnings would be up +3.8% from the same period last year.
"
1747,ARNC,"Beyond Finance, here are the key four points to know about this earnings season.First, estimates remain low, having fallen sharply over the last three months. Total earnings for the quarter are expected to be up +1.0% on -0.7% lower revenues and modestly higher margins.Second, the magnitude of negative revisions over the last three months for Q4 estimates was the highest that we have seen in almost two years. The current +1.0% total earnings growth expected in the quarter is down from +9.6% at the start of the quarter.Third, the outsized decline in Q4 earnings estimates isn’t a reflection of a fresh deterioration in overall corporate profitability, but rather a function of the unusual oil price action in the recent past. By our estimates, roughly 45% of the drop in aggregate Q4 bottom-up total earnings since the start of the quarter is accounted for negative Energy sector revisions. The very strong U.S. dollar hasn’t been helping matters either. In fact, it wouldn’t be too much of an exaggeration to say that oil and dollar remain key drags on earnings this quarter.Fourth, low expectations mean an easy-to-beat hurdle rate for management teams. Nothing unusual there as management teams have refined the art of expectations management, with more than two thirds of the S&P 500 members coming ahead of consensus earnings estimates. But more than actual Q4 growth rates and beat ratios, we will be looking for management commentary about business conditions in the current backdrop of global growth worries. Guidance has overwhelmingly been negative in recent quarters and we will likely see more of the same this time around as well. But it will be interesting to see if the tone of management commentary any change, favorable or otherwise, in the outlook.  The Ever Falling Estimates
"
1748,ARNC,"Estimates for 2014 Q4 started coming down at an accelerated pace as companies predominantly guided lower on the 2013 Q3 earnings calls, consistent with the trend we have been seeing for almost two years now. Total Q4 earnings for companies in the S&P 500 are currently expected to be up +1.0% from the same period last year, a material decline from the +9.6% growth expected at the start of the quarter in early October. The table below presents the summary picture for Q4 contrasted with what companies actually reported in the Q3 earnings season.
"
1749,ARNC,"The chart below shows how estimates for Q4 have evolved since the quarter got underway. Please note that the magnitude of negative revisions for Q4 is the highest we have seen at comparable periods in other recent quarters, with the Energy sector as the biggest drag.
"
1750,ARNC,"The negative revision trend is widespread, but is particularly notable for the, Energy, Basic Materials, Autos, Finance, and Retail sectors. Construction, Utilities, and Business Services were the only sectors where estimates have modestly gone up.
"
1751,ARNC,"The chart below shows the sectors with big negative revisions.
"
1752,ARNC,"The negative revisions trend has been widespread, with 13 of the 16 Zacks sector suffering negative revisions over the last three months. That said, the revisions trend in the Energy sector stands out, with estimates for the quarter dropping from positive growth of +7% at the start of the quarter to a decline of -21.3% at present. This massive shift becomes evident when you look at what has been happening to estimates for some of the sector leaders like Exxon (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report). The Zacks Consensus EPS estimates for Exxon, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips dropped -22.5%, -33.2% and -44.7%, respectively over the last three months. Please note that these three companies combined bring in roughly 45% of the sector’s total earnings
"
1753,ARNC,"With roughly two-thirds of S&P 500 companies beating earnings expectations in any reporting cycle, actual Q4 results will almost certainly be better than these pre-season expectations. In fact, a look at the revisions trend for the last 5 quarters show that the actual growth rate at the end of the reporting cycle roughly approximates what was originally expected at the start of the quarter. You can see this trend play out clearly in the chart below
"
1754,ARNC,"What this means is that at the growth rate at the start of the (calendar) quarter is a good representation of what is actually achieved in that period. For example, earnings were expected to be up +6.3% in Q3 at the start of the quarter in July. But those growth estimates came down over time and fell to +3% by the time the Q3 reporting season got underway. The actual growth in Q3, however, turned out to be +6.2%.

1756,ARNC,"Industrial metals are the building blocks of an economy. At present, even though concerns over China’s future growth has added an element of uncertainly to the outlook, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the industrial metals industry for both the short and the long term. Below, we have discussed some of the key reasons and what investors in the industrial metals sector can look forward to in the coming months and years:Correction of the Aluminum Demand-Supply Imbalance
"
1757,ARNC,"After aluminum prices bore the brunt of chronic surplus, the global aluminum industry shutdown a significant portion of its production capacity, which eventually led to firmer prices. In the first six months of 2014, Rusal effectively cut aluminum production by 10.8%. Likewise, Alcoa Inc. (AA) undertook a number of restructuring measures (including closure of smelters) and is aggressively pursued cost-cutting actions.
"
1758,ARNC,"Alcoa curtailed 655,000 metric tons of smelting capacity during 2013. The company, in second-quarter 2014, reduced 147,000 metric tons of smelting capacity in Brazil and also closed a 190,000-metric ton smelter in Australia in the third quarter. With these curtailments, the company will have 1.2 million metric tons of reduced capacity from 2007 levels.
"
1759,ARNC,"In addition to closures and curtailments, Alcoa plans to aggressively accelerate actions to reduce the cost of raw materials used by its Primary Products business and will adjust capacity across its global refining system to reflect internal demand as well as prevailing market conditions. Alcoa has set the goal of lowering its position on the world aluminum production cost curve to the 38th percentile by 2016.Future of Aluminum Tied to Automotive & Aerospace Industries
"
1760,ARNC,"On the demand side, aluminum consumption is expected to improve on a global basis spurred by the automotive and packaging industries -- its key consumer markets. The automobile market is becoming increasingly aluminum-intensive, given the metal's recyclability and light-weight properties. The global push to improve fuel efficiency in vehicles is expected to more than double the demand for aluminum in the auto industry by 2025.
"
1761,ARNC,"The airline industry is also expected to boost demand for the metal. To capitalize on the lucrative aerospace market, Alcoa has agreed to buy U.K.-based leading jet engine components maker Firth Rixson, a significant milestone in its portfolio transformation strategy. This transaction will reinforce the company’s aerospace business and add a broad spectrum of high-growth, value-added jet engine components. Alcoa’s recent $1.1 billion agreement to supply key parts (including forgings) for Pratt & Whitney engines also underscores Alcoa’s continued efforts to profitably grow its aerospace business.
"
1762,ARNC,"Following China, which accounts for over 40% of the global aluminum consumption, India appears promising given its current low level of aluminum consumption and high urban population growth. With demand remaining strong and the industry pulling the reins on supply, the aluminum market is likely to witness supply deficits for a prolonged period rendering a supportive backdrop for high aluminum prices.
"
1763,ARNC," Pickup in Economic Activity to Drive Copper Demand
"
1764,ARNC,"Copper is a major industrial metal playing a particularly important role in emerging countries. Given its varied applications, it is often considered that the trends in the copper market are a useful indicator of the state of the global economy.
"
1765,ARNC,"Developments in the world economy have a strong correlation with movements in copper prices. Trends in Chinese GDP growth and world trade play a major role. Given that China accounts for the largest share by far of global copper consumption (around 46%), and also has a large share in the total production of pure copper (around 34%), the correlation with China is a key factor. A pickup in China’s economy will be instrumental in driving copper prices.
"
1766,ARNC,"It is expected that the rising middle class in Asia, particularly in India and China, will spend more on consumer goods such as air conditioners and refrigerators in the years to come, which require a lot of copper. Rio Tinto plc (RIO  -  Free Report) and BHP (BHP  -  Free Report) are planning to mine millions of additional tonnes of copper, despite envisaging an oversupplied market for the next few years.
"
1767,ARNC,"The economic outlook for 2015 is upbeat in the U.S. while the European economy is recovering slowly. In China, the government remains committed to maintaining control over the gradually slowing economy. Expectations are high that Beijing will roll out more stimulus to avert a sharper slowdown. Overall, as the global economic activity improves, copper as well as other industrial metals will move in tandem.Rebound in Construction
"
1768,ARNC,"The housing and construction sector is the largest consumer of steel today and consequently of iron ore. Building construction (pipes and wires) is also the largest market for copper. An uptrend has been noticed in real estate activity in the U.S., like new home starts and construction spends, over the past few quarters.
"
1769,ARNC,"The U.S. Architecture Billings Index (ABI), an economic indicator that provides an approximately nine-to-twelve-month glimpse into the future of non-residential construction spending activity, remained over 50 for most part of 2014 and reached 55.8 in July, its highest level since 2007. Any score above 50 indicates an increase in billings. The ABI has been positive for seven consecutive months.
"
1770,ARNC,"Long-stalled construction projects are being renewed. Moreover, easier access to credit from lending institutions along with an increasing comfort level in the overall economy has helped revitalize the commercial real estate sector in recent months. The requirement for emerging projects, such as education facilities and government buildings, is also leading to demand in the sector.
"
1771,ARNC,"In the long term, as the urban population increases worldwide, so will the need for steel to build skyscrapers and public-transport infrastructure. Emerging economies will also continue to be major demand drivers for increasing urbanization and industrialization. The demand for iron ore is thus expected to remain strong in the years to come. Thus, a rebound in construction bodes well for the iron ore and copper industries.Bottom Line
"
1772,ARNC,"As you can see, there is no reason not to be optimistic about the industrial metals industry over the long haul. But what about investing in the space right now?

"
1774,ARNC,"The 2014 Q4 earnings season takes center stage next week with Alcoa’s (AA) release after the close on Monday. Alcoa isn’t the overall first to report Q4 results, though it is the first S&P 500 member with a fiscal calendar quarter to come out with results. Companies with fiscal quarters ending in November have been reporting since mid-December, with 17 such S&P 500 members having reported results already.
"
1775,ARNC,"In fairness to Alcoa, however, the market starts paying attention to the earnings season after their earnings announcement even though the list of companies that report before it includes such industry leaders like FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report), Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) and others. In total, we will see results from 4 S&P 500 members the rest of this week, with 20 index members on deck to report results next week.
"
1776,ARNC,"Here are the four key points to know about this earnings season.First, estimates remain low, having fallen sharply over the last three months. Total earnings for the quarter are expected to be up +1.2% on -0.5% lower revenues and modestly higher margins.Second, the magnitude of negative revisions that Q4 estimates went through over the last three months was the highest that we have seen in almost two years.

"
1788,ARNC,"The 2014 Q4 earnings season takes center stage from next week onwards even though the reporting cycle has actually been underway for a couple of weeks. The reports thus far (17 S&P 500 companies have reported results) are from companies with fiscal quarters ending in November, which we count as part of the Q4 tally.
"
1789,ARNC,"Results for companies with fiscal quarter ending in December will start next week with Alcoa’s (AA) release on January 12th. But the cycle wouldn’t ramp up really till the following week, as the chart below of weekly Q4 earnings for the S&P 500 index shows.
"
1790,ARNC,"Estimates for Q4 came down as the quarter unfolded, with current expectations of +1.2% total earnings growth down from +9.6% growth expected in late September. The chart below shows how estimates for the quarter have evolved over the past three months.
"
1791,ARNC,"Estimates for 13 out of 16 sectors have declined, though revisions for the Energy, Basic Materials and Autos the most pronounced. The chart below shows the sectors with the major negative estimate revisions.
"
1792,ARNC,"The green bars in the chart above show the earnings growth rate that was expected for each of those sectors at the beginning of Q4 while the orange bar shows what that expected growth rate is at present. As you can see, negative revisions to the Energy sector estimates really stand out. In fact, the Energy sector alone accounts for roughly 45% of all negative revisions to the bottom-up estimates for the S&P 500 index. The negative revisions trend is broad based, but the magnitude of Q4 revisions wouldn’t be as pronounced had it not been for the Energy sector.
"
1793,ARNC,"The Zacks Consensus EPS estimates for Exxon (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) for the December quarter have fallen by -22.5%, -33.2% and -44.7% since the quarter started – no doubt the overall Q4 growth rate for the sector has flipped from a positive growth rate of +7% to a decline of -19.9% at present. The sector’s growth picture isn’t expected to improve anytime soon either, as the chart below of total energy sector quarterly earnings shows.
"
1794,ARNC,"Beyond the Energy sector, the outlook for activity levels has been looking up on the home front, with business and consumer confidence expected to push economic growth into above-trend levels going forward. But the picture is a lot less reassuring beyond the U.S. borders, with recent data from Europe as well as China showing renewed loss of momentum in those regions.

1805,ARNC,"Industrial metals are used in a wide variety of applications, including numerous construction and manufacturing businesses. The rise in global population, growth in the Chinese economy and increasing requirements from the developed countries had created an unprecedented demand for minerals and metals.
"
1806,ARNC,"However, over the last couple of months, a stronger greenback, falling oil prices and a slowdown in the Chinese economy have emerged as major headwinds for the global metal industry.Iron – Prices Going Downhill
"
1807,ARNC,"Iron ore prices have gone down since the beginning of 2014, losing 50% of its value -- the biggest annual decline in at least five years. Prices have been impacted by excessive inventory along with abundant supply and slow economic growth in China. Global steel production, as per the latest data from the World Steel Association, rose by a meager 1.8% in the first nine months of 2014, mainly dragged down by a slowdown in China's output that affected demand for iron ore, its main ingredient.
"
1808,ARNC,"The low prices have squeezed margins of iron producers leading to the cancellation or suspension of mining projects. Australia's largest iron ore producer, Rio Tinto plc (RIO  -  Free Report), announced in November that it was deferring an investment decision on its proposed Silvergrass mine in Australia. Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. (CLF  -  Free Report) has ceased production at Bloom Lake iron ore mine in Canada, thus exiting a higher cost operation.
"
1809,ARNC,"    Aluminum – Prices Recovered in 2014
"
1810,ARNC,"In 2014, the global aluminum industry went through a substantial change to correct the supply-demand imbalance that had affected prices through 2013. Major aluminum producers like Rusal and Alcoa Inc. (AA) effectively cut their aluminum production. This tightening of aluminum supply helped lift aluminum prices from the four and a half year low of $1,675 per ton in February. Prices of the base metal subsequently went on an uptrend.
"
1811,ARNC,"However, in the past few months, falling oil prices and weak industrial data from China have led to a fall in aluminum prices. Aluminum is an energy intensive industry, with energy costs accounting for nearly 30% of the total cost of production. Falling oil prices tend to have a deflationary effect on aluminum. Nevertheless, aluminum prices ended the year with a 13% gain, higher than January levels.
"
1812,ARNC,"Aluminum companies have on the whole benefited from rising prices in 2014. Russian producer Rusal reported a turnaround in profits in the third quarter. The U.S. aluminum giant Alcoa also reported better-than-expected results with adjusted earnings skyrocketing 182% year over year in the third quarter.Copper Prices – The Worst Hit
"
1813,ARNC,"During 2014, copper prices declined given the slowdown in China amid an oversupply of the metal. Copper prices further dipped to a four-year low in November end to $2.861 per pound on falling oil prices. Overall, copper fared the worst among all industrial metals, with prices declining 11% through the year.Industry Ranking & Outlook – Positive on Aluminum and Copper, Negative on Iron
"
1814,ARNC,"Within the Zacks Industry classification, the iron mining and non-ferrous mining industries (aluminum, copper, etc.) are broadly grouped under the Basic Materials sector (one of 16 Zacks sectors). We rank all of the 260 industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in each industry. This ranking is available in the Zacks Industry Rank page.
"
1815,ARNC,"The way to align the ranking and outlook from the complete list of Zacks Industry Rank for the 260+ companies is that the outlook for the top one-third of the list (Zacks Industry Rank of #87 and lower) is positive, the middle one-third (Zacks Industry Rank between #88 and #173) is neutral while the outlook for the bottom one-third (Zacks Industry Rank #231 and higher) is negative.
"
1816,ARNC,"The non-ferrous mining industry features in the middle tier with a Zacks Rank of #69 indicating that the outlook is positive. The iron mining industry, however, is in the bottom tier with a Zacks Industry Rank #213, indicating a negative outlook.Sector Level Earnings TrendSector Q3 Earnings Scorecard – Growth Picks Up
"
1817,ARNC,"In the Basic Materials sector, earnings jumped 17.6% on the back of a 2.6% increase in revenues. It was a marked improvement from the second quarter wherein sector earnings had increased 8.6% and from the 3.8% decline in the first quarter of 2014. For further detail about earnings for this sector and others, please read our 'Earnings Trends' report.
"
1818,ARNC," Q4 & Beyond – Momentum to Continue
"
1819,ARNC,"The sector’s earnings are expected to grow 13.7% in the fourth quarter, to log overall growth of 8.3% for 2014. For 2015, earnings for the sector are expected to grow at a rate of 5.4% in the first quarter, decline 2.2% in the second but rise 10.9% in the third. Despite the choppiness, the sector’s earnings are projected to grow 14.3% in 2015.
"
1820,ARNC," What’s in Store?Iron: The threat of oversupply looms large over the iron ore industry as major iron ore producers, Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP  -  Free Report), Vale S.A. (VALE  -  Free Report) and Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. (FMG.AX) continue to ramp up production. Australia, the world’s top exporter, cut its iron ore price estimate for next year by 33% as the surging output will outpace Chinese demand growth, leading to a supply glut.
"
1821,ARNC,"Per the World Steel Association, global apparent steel use is expected to grow 2% in 2015 to reach 1,594 Mt. The slowdown in China’s steel demand will continue to be a drag on steel demand. China is currently the largest producer of steel and consequently the largest consumer of iron ore, accounting for around 60% of the global seaborne market. Thus, the mismatch between the excess supply and demand for iron ore will keep iron ore prices subdued in the near term.Aluminum: Aluminum consumption is expected to improve on a global basis spurred by the automotive and packaging industries, its key consumer markets. The airline industry is also expected to boost demand for the metal. Following China, which accounts for over 40% of the global aluminum consumption, India appears promising given its current low level of aluminum consumption and high urban population growth.
"
1822,ARNC,"With demand remaining strong and the industry pulling in the reins on supply, the aluminum market is likely to witness deficits for a prolonged period. This will support high aluminum prices going forward.Copper: The copper market seems to be shifting into supply surplus. In the near term, prices will be influenced by economic activity in the U.S. and other industrialized countries. Revival in demand from China will also act as a catalyst.
"
1823,ARNC,"Notwithstanding the current volatility in prices, we have a long-term bullish stance on copper, supported by its widespread use in transportation, manufacturing and construction, limited supplies from existing mines and the absence of new significant development projects.To Sum Up
"
1824,ARNC,"A revival in the Chinese economy on the back of policy support and correction of the supply-demand imbalance will be instrumental in driving growth in the industry. Projected earnings growth for 2015 instills optimism in the industry.
"
1825,ARNC,"The following is an excerpt from this week's Earnings Trends article.  To see the full article, please click here.Will Q3 Earnings Season Ease Growth Fears?
"
1826,ARNC,"Global growth worries have started weighing on stock prices lately, prompting some to claim that the long-feared ‘correction’ has finally arrived. Hard to tell at this stage how enduring the current pullback will prove to be as other recent episodes of market weakness have been short-lived and shallow. Reports from the likes of Alcoa (AA) and Pepsi (PEP  -  Free Report) appear reassuring enough on the growth question. But we will know better as the Q3 earnings season ramps up in the coming days will give the market a clear directional push one way or the other.
"
1827,ARNC,"The chart below provides the weekly calendar of earnings reports
"
1828,ARNC,"The low levels to which estimates have fallen gives companies an easy-enough hurdle to jump through. But that will hardly be new as roughly two-thirds of the S&P 500 members beat earnings estimates in the typical earnings season anyway. What will be new however is if we see any improvement on the guidance front, which has persistently been negative for quite some time.
"
1829,ARNC,"Even modest improvement on the guidance front will reassure investors that questions about the growth outlook for Europe, Japan, China and elsewhere are not having a bearing on corporate profitability. Hard to imagine how guidance could become even worse than it has been in recent quarters. But any guidance deterioration will likely accentuate current global growth worries and serve as a fresh headwind for stock prices.
"
1830,ARNC,"Estimates for Q3 came down as the quarter has unfolded, with current expectations of +1.6% total earnings growth in the quarter down from +6.3% growth expected in late June. The chart below shows how estimates for the quarter have evolved over the past two and a half months.
"
1831,ARNC,"Estimates for most sectors came down, though revisions for the Consumer Retail/Wholesale, Finance, and Energy are the most pronounced. The Finance sector was relatively late to the negative revisions party, but Bank of America’s (BAC  -  Free Report) shift from estimates of positive 32 cents earnings two months back to a loss of 8 cents at present has been a big reason for the sector’s weak aggregate growth numbers. The 40 cents negative swing in Bank of America estimates may not sound like much, but that’s a actually a swing of a little over $4 billion in total earnings.
"
1832,ARNC,"For a more detailed look at the Finance Sector earnings, please read the Finance Industry Outlook for Q3.
"
1833,ARNC,"The chart below shows the sectors with the major negative estimate revisions.
"
1834,ARNC,"The last earnings season was a notable improvement over what we have been seeing in recent quarters, with growth and positive surprises, particularly on the revenue front, tracking above recent trend levels. The question is whether it was a one-off bounce from the anemic Q1 level or the start of something more enduring? We don’t know yet, though the coming Q3 earnings season will give us a good sense of how to answer that question.
"
1835,ARNC,"Estimates for the coming quarters remain high, as the chart below shows.
"
1836,ARNC,"Recent history suggests that we should expect the 2014 Q4 estimate (+7.3%) to start coming down as companies guide along the lines of what they have been doing in recent quarters. That is exactly what happened in Q3 and has remained the enduring trend for more than two years now. It is possible that the coming round of negative revisions will be even bigger in magnitude as a result of the global growth worries. Market volatility has increased in recent days and the situation isn’t expected to get any calmer this earnings season either.Note: Want more articles from this author?

1838,ARNC,"Q3 Earnings Season in the Spotlight (Revised)
"
1839,ARNC,"The 2014 Q3 earnings season takes center stage this week with Alcoa’s (AA) release after the close on Wednesday. Alcoa isn’t the first to report quarterly results, though it is the first S&P 500 member with the calendar fiscal quarter to come out with results. Companies with fiscal quarters ending in August have been reporting since mid-September and the tally of such Q3 reports already totals 22 S&P 500 members. In fairness to Alcoa, however, investors start paying attention to the earnings season after their earnings announcement.
"
1840,ARNC,"It is way too early to draw even preliminary conclusions from the results thus far. But the results thus far aren’t materially different from what we have seen from the same group of 22 companies in other recent quarters. The table below shows the scorecard for the 22 companies that have reported results already.
"
1841,ARNC,"The earnings calendar is on the light side, with only about 30 companies reporting quarter results, including 9 S&P 500 members. But as you can see in the updated weekly earnings calendar below, the reporting cycle ramps up in a big way the following week.
"
1842,ARNC,"This earnings season will give us a good sense of whether the profitability strength on display in the last reporting cycle was a one-off event or the start of something enduring. Please recall that part of the Q2 strength was a bounce back from the extremely low levels to which all activity levels had fallen in the weather-disrupted first quarter of the year. As such, one could argue that none of the last two earnings seasons represented truly normal conditions, which we will most likely see for the first time this year only in Q3.
"
1843,ARNC,"The table below shows a summary picture of current Q3 expectations compared to what was actually achieved in Q2. As you can see, total earnings are expected to be up +1.5% from the same period last year on +1.8% higher revenues and modest margin gains. Finance remains a big drag this quarter, with total earnings for the sector expected to be down -3.9% from the same period last year. Excluding Finance, total earnings for the S&P 500 would be up +2.8%.
"
1844,ARNC,"As has been the trend each quarter ahead of the start of the earnings season, estimates for Q3 have come down as well as the quarter unfolded. The recent leg down in estimates has mostly been due to Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), with the bank’s settlement with the government causing its Q3 EPS estimates to drop from positive 32 cents to the current 8 cents loss. In dollar terms, that’s a $4.2 billion negative swing in Bank of America’s Q3 earnings estimates.
"
1845,ARNC,"The chart below shows estimates for 2014 Q3 have evolved over the last 10 or so weeks.
"
1846,ARNC,"The negative revisions trend has been broad based, with most sectors suffering downward adjustments in estimates. But the trend has been most pronounced for Oil/Energy, Retail, and Conglomerates. The chart below shows the sectors with the biggest revisions. The Finance sector swing is primarily due to Bank of America.  
"
1847,ARNC,"Total earnings for the S&P 500 reached an all-time quarterly record in 2014 Q2 and current estimates for Q3 put the quarterly total as the second highest ever. But given the historical trend of roughly two-thirds of the companies beating earnings estimates, the final Q3 tally will likely be right in the preceding quarter’s record vicinity. The chart below shows that current consensus estimates reflect record tallies in the following quarters.  
"
1848,ARNC,"For these estimates to hold, we need an improvement on the guidance front, which has been persistently been weak for almost two years now. There was modest improvement in tone of management guidance on the Q2 earnings calls, but the majority of companies providing guidance still guided lower.
"
1849,ARNC,"Given the global growth worries, it is likely that the quality and quantity of guidance will deteriorate even further this earnings season. Importantly, continued negative guidance will effectively guarantee that we will see a repeat of negative estimate revisions, with estimates for Q4 coming down as earnings season unfolds.
"
1850,ARNC,"That said, continuation of even the modest improvement in guidance will be a net positive in the overall earnings picture.Note: Want more articles from this author?

"
1864,ARNC,"Global growth worries have started weighing on stock prices lately, prompting some to claim that the long-feared ‘correction’ has finally arrived. Hard to tell at this stage how enduring the current pullback will prove to be as other recent episodes of market weakness have been short-lived and shallow. But we will know soon enough as the Q3 earnings season that ramps up in the coming days will give the market a clear directional push one way or the other.
"
1865,ARNC,"As you can see in the chart weekly earnings calendar below, we don’t have that many reports coming out next week, with Alcoa (AA) and Pepsi (PEP  -  Free Report) as the only major releases. But the cycle really ramps up in a big way the following week.   
"
1866,ARNC,"The low levels to which estimates have fallen gives companies an easy-enough hurdle to jump through. But that will hardly be new as roughly two-thirds of the S&P 500 members beat earnings estimates in the typical earnings season anyway. What will be new however is if we see any improvement on the guidance front, which has persistently been negative for quite some time now.
"
1867,ARNC,"Even modest improvement on the guidance front will reassure investors that questions about the growth outlook for Europe, Japan, China and elsewhere are not having a bearing on corporate profitability. Hard to imagine how guidance could become even worse than it has been in recent quarters. But any guidance deterioration will likely accentuate current global growth worries and serve as a fresh headwind for stock prices.
"
1868,ARNC,"Estimates for Q3 came down as the quarter has unfolded, with current expectations of +1.5% total earnings growth in the quarter down from +6.3% growth expected in late June. The chart below shows how estimates for the quarter have evolved over the past two and a half months. 
"
1869,ARNC,"Estimates for most sectors came down, though revisions for the Consumer Retail/Wholesale, Finance, and Energy are the most pronounced. The Finance sector was relatively late to the negative revisions party, but Bank of America’s (BAC  -  Free Report) shift from estimates of positive 32 cents earnings two months back to a loss of 8 cents at present has been a big reason for the sector’s weak aggregate growth numbers. The 40 cents negative swing in Bank of America estimates may not sound like much, but that’s a actually a swing of a little over $4 billion in total earnings.

1871,ARNC,"The last earnings season was a notable improvement over what we have been seeing in recent quarters, with growth and positive surprises, particularly on the revenue front, tracking above recent trend levels.

1883,ARNC,"Getting Ready for Start of Q3 Earnings Season
"
1884,ARNC,"The 2014 Q3 earnings season has gotten underway, with results from 17 members of S&P 500 members already out. All of these early reporters have fiscal quarters ending in August and some of them are notable industry leaders.
"
1885,ARNC,"It is way too early to draw even preliminary conclusions from the results thus far. But as the table below of early reporters shows, 64.7% of the total (11 out of 17) have beat EPS estimates while 70.6% have come out with positive revenue surprises. Top line surprises stood out in the last quarter as well, though it’s premature to say what we will get this time around.
"
1886,ARNC,"The focus this week is on economic data, with the September jobs report coming out on Friday. There is not much on the earnings front, with less than two dozen companies coming out with results, including four (4) S&P 500 members. As the chart below shows, we are still about two weeks away from a full ramp up in the reporting cycle. But the Q3 earnings season will start getting attention with the Alcoa (AA) report on October 8th.
"
1887,ARNC,"This earnings season will give us a good sense of whether the profitability strength on display in the last reporting cycle was a one-off event or the start of something enduring. Please recall that part of the Q2 strength was a bounce back from the extremely low levels to which all activity levels had fallen in the weather-disrupted first quarter of the year. As such, one could argue that none of the last two earnings seasons represented truly normal conditions, which we will most likely see for the first time this year only in Q3.
"
1888,ARNC,"The table below shows a summary picture of current Q3 expectations compared to what was actually achieved in Q2. As you can see, total earnings are expected to be up +1.2% from the same period last year on +1.5% higher revenues and modest margin gains. Finance remains a big drag this quarter, with total earnings for the sector expected to be down -4.5% from the same period last year. Excluding Finance, total earnings for the S&P 500 would be up +2.6%.
"
1889,ARNC,"As has been the trend each quarter ahead of the start of the earnings season, estimates for Q3 have come down as well as the quarter unfolded. The recent leg down in estimates has mostly been due to Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), with the bank’s settlement with the government causing its Q3 EPS estimates to drop from positive 32 cents to the current 8 cents loss. In dollar terms, that’s a $4.2 billion negative swing in Bank of America’s Q3 earnings estimates.
"
1890,ARNC,"The chart below shows estimates for 2014 Q3 have evolved over the last 10 or so weeks. 
"
1891,ARNC,"The negative revisions trend has been broad based, with most sectors suffering downward adjustments in estimates. But the trend has been most pronounced for Oil/Energy, Retail, and Consumer Disc. The chart below shows the sectors with the biggest revisions. The Finance sector swing is primarily due to Bank of America.  
"
1892,ARNC,"Total earnings for the S&P 500 reached an all-time quarterly record in 2014 Q2 and current estimates for Q3 put the quarterly total as the second highest ever. But given the historical trend of roughly two-thirds of the companies beating earnings estimates, the final Q3 tally will likely be right in the preceding quarter’s record vicinity. The chart below shows that current consensus estimates reflect record tallies in the following quarters.  
"
1893,ARNC,"For these estimates to hold, we need an improvement on the guidance front, which has been persistently been weak for almost two years now. There was modest improvement in tone of management guidance on the Q2 earnings calls, but the majority of companies providing guidance still guided lower. That said, continuation of even the modest improvement in guidance will be a net positive in the overall earnings picture.Note: Want more articles from this author?

"
1903,ARNC,"A rise in the global population, growth in the Chinese economy, urbanization of other Asian countries and the increasing requirements of developed countries have created an unprecedented demand for industrial or base metals given their usage in a wide variety of applications in the construction and manufacturing businesses. However, of late, tepid global economic growth and a slowdown in the Chinese economy have emerged as major headwinds for the global metal industry.
"
1904,ARNC,"Let's have a look at how some of the base metals have fared so far and the road ahead –
"
1905,ARNC," Iron
"
1906,ARNC,"Iron Prices Going Downhill
"
1907,ARNC,"Iron ore prices had a bullish run in 2013, in contrast to other base metals, thanks to heightened demand from steel end-consumers, particularly in the Chinese construction sector. However, the scenario changed dramatically in 2014. In March, the industry was dealt a severe blow, with iron ore prices suffering the sharpest one-day drop since the 2008-2009 financial crisis, tumbling 8.3% to close at around $105 per ton. This represented an 18-month low for iron ore prices.
"
1908,ARNC,"Since the first quarter, iron ore prices had somewhat recovered but again plunged to $89 per ton in June -- the weakest performance since September 2012. In August, prices again slid below the $90 per ton threshold.
"
1909,ARNC,"So far this year, the commodity has lost 33% of its value. Overall, prices have been impacted by myriad reasons such as excessive inventory along with abundant supply of iron as mining companies increased their output, as well as tight credit and slow economic growth in China. Global steel production, as per the World Steel Association, rose by a meager 2.4% in the first seven months of 2014, mainly dragged down by a slowdown in China's output that affected demand for iron ore, its main ingredient.  
"
1910,ARNC,"The lowering price trend has resulted in the closure of high cost iron ore miners and the reduction of exports from non-traditional suppliers such as Indonesia, Mexico and Vietnam. Falling iron ore prices have impacted the second-quarter results. Mining giant Vale S.A. (VALE  -  Free Report) reported a 15% plunge in its second-quarter profit due to the fall in prices of iron ore, its main product. However, its peers BHP Billiton Limited (BHP  -  Free Report) and Rio Tinto plc (RIO  -  Free Report) reported an increase in earnings mostly attributable to their cost reduction efforts which helped mitigate the effect of lower iron prices.
"
1911,ARNC," Threat of Oversupply Looms for the Iron Industry
"
1912,ARNC,"There is a threat of oversupply in 2014 as major iron ore producers, Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton, Vale and Fortescue Metals Group Limited (FMG.AX) have ramped up production. They intend to continue exploring for iron ore in Australia despite lower growth forecasts for China and weaker iron ore prices, betting on continued strength in iron ore demand over the long term. Thus, Australia, the world's top exporter of iron ore, will rev up its shipments.
"
1913,ARNC,"Brazil, the second largest explorer, will follow suit. Vale, which alone contributes almost 85% of Brazil’s iron ore, is expected to increase its iron shipments by 22% in the second half of fiscal 2014 compared with the first half. In case this excess supply is not matched by adequate demand, it will expose the market to a risk of further decline in prices.
"
1914,ARNC,"Per the World Steel Association, global apparent steel use is expected to increase 3.1% in 2014, following the 3.6% growth in 2013. In China, apparent steel use had soared 6.1% in 2013 on support from government infrastructure investment. However, this year the government's efforts to rebalance the economy will lead to 3% growth in apparent steel usage in 2014.
"
1915,ARNC,"An impending slowdown in China's growth is bound to affect prices as China is currently the largest producer of steel and consequently the largest consumer of iron ore, accounting for around 60% of the global seaborne market. Thus the mismatch between the excess supply and demand for iron ore will keep iron ore prices subdued in the near term. 
"
1916,ARNC,"Aluminum
"
1917,ARNC,"Prices Regain in 2014 Following a Lull in 2013
"
1918,ARNC,"In 2013, aluminum prices slid and particularly in the fourth quarter, London Metal Exchange (LME) aluminum prices fell to a four-year low, given the oversupply of the metal in the market (evidenced by large aluminum inventories in LME warehouses). Supply outpacing demand led to the dismal performance, which was aggravated by rising inventories.
"
1919,ARNC,"After hitting a four and half year low of $1,675 per ton in February, the base metal has dramatically regained ground surging 24% to over $2,000 in August. The upward trajectory was driven by a 10% drop in LME inventories so far this year and tightening of aluminum supply due to production curtailments by aluminium producers. Furthermore, production cut down in Brazil, as electricity prices surged to records this year, led to the supply constraint.
"
1920,ARNC,"Aluminum companies are benefitting from the rising aluminum prices. The world's largest aluminum producer, Rusal, swung to profit for the first time in the last five quarters. U.S. aluminum giant Alcoa Inc. (AA) also reported better-than-expected results with adjusted earnings skyrocketing 157% from the year-ago quarter.
"
1921,ARNC," Future of Aluminum Industry Lies in Automotive and Aerospace Industries
"
1922,ARNC,"After aluminum prices bore the brunt of chronic surplus, the global aluminum industry is going through a substantial change in the supply-demand picture. In the first six months of 2014, Rusal has effectively cut aluminum production by 10.8%. Likewise, Alcoa has taken up a number of restructuring measures (including closure of smelters) and is aggressively pursuing cost-cutting actions.
"
1923,ARNC,"Alcoa, during the second quarter, completed the curtailment of 147,000 metric tons of smelting capacity in Brazil at Sao Luis (Alumar) and Pocos de Caldas. In August, Alcoa announced that it will permanently shut down its Portovesme primary aluminum smelter in Italy that will cut the company’s smelting capacity by 150,000 metric tons to 3.6 million metric tons a year. Alcoa has set the goal of lowering its position on the world aluminum production cost curve to the 38th percentile by 2016. Once all announced curtailments and closures are executed, Alcoa will have its operating smelting capacity reduced by 1.2 million metric tons, or 28% since 2007.
"
1924,ARNC,"On the demand side, aluminum consumption is expected to improve on a global basis spurred by the automotive and packaging industries -- the key consumer markets. The automobile market is also becoming increasingly aluminum-intensive, given the metal's recyclability and light-weight properties. The global push to improve fuel efficiency in vehicles is expected to more than double the demand for aluminum in the auto industry by 2025.
"
1925,ARNC,"The airline industry is also expected to boost demand for the metal. To capitalize on the lucrative aerospace market, Alcoa has agreed to buy U.K.-based leading jet engine components maker Firth Rixson, a significant milestone in its portfolio transformation strategy. It reinforces the company’s aerospace business and strongly places it to capture additional growth in this developing market through a broad spectrum of high-growth, value-add jet engine components. Alcoa’s recent $1.1 billion agreement to supply key parts (including forgings) for Pratt & Whitney’s engines also underscores Alcoa’s continued efforts to profitably grow its aerospace business.
"
1926,ARNC,"Following China, which accounts for over 40% of the global aluminum consumption, India appears promising given its current low level of aluminum consumption and high urban population growth. With demand remaining strong and the industry pulling the reins on supply, the aluminum market is likely to witness deficits for a prolonged period which creates a supportive backdrop of high aluminum prices.
"
1927,ARNC," Copper
"
1928,ARNC,"Copper Price Makes a Comeback
"
1929,ARNC,"For the most part of 2013, oversupply, lack of demand and growing bearish economic outlook for China, the world’s largest consumer of copper, kept copper prices in check. During the first half of 2014, copper prices declined based on concerns about slowing growth rates in China and an outlook for higher near-term supplies. During the mentioned period, copper prices have averaged $3.14 per pound, down 8.2% over the prior-year comparable period.
"
1930,ARNC,"In August, copper prices made a comeback, rising 3.3% last week amid signs of a strengthening economic recovery in the U.S which is expected to support strong copper demand, being the world’s second-biggest consumer of industrial metals. However, weakness in the Chinese economy will continue to be a drag considering that it accounts for about 40% of the world's annual demand.
"
1931,ARNC," Copper Demand Will be Driven by Pickup in Economic Activity
"
1932,ARNC,"Along with excess supply that has depressed copper prices, miners have been plagued with rising costs. Copper companies have reduced their budgeted future capital expenditures, exploration and other costs and are looking to rid themselves of some of their saleable assets.
"
1933,ARNC,"Notwithstanding the current volatility in prices, we have a long-term bullish stance on copper, supported by its widespread use, limited supplies from existing mines and the absence of significant new development projects. In the near term, prices will be influenced economic activity in the U.S. and other industrialized countries. Revival in demand from China will also act as a catalyst.
"
1934,ARNC," Sector Q2 Earnings Scorecard – Growth Picks Up
"
1935,ARNC,"Within the Zacks Industry classification, the metals-ferrous and non ferrous industry falls under the broader Basic Materials sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors). With all the companies in our coverage under the Basic Material sector having reported their results, the curtains have fallen on the second-quarter earnings. Overall, earnings increased 8.6% in the quarter on the back of 3.4% increase in revenues. Moreover, the Basic Material sector had a beat ratio (percentage of companies coming out with positive surprises) of 66.7% in Q2.
"
1936,ARNC,"There has been a marked improvement from the first quarter of 2014 wherein sector earnings had declined 3.8% while revenues had nudged up 1.2%. This depicts a better picture compared with what we have witnessed in the recent quarters. For further details about earnings for this sector and others, please read our 'Earnings Trends' report.
"
1937,ARNC," Q3 & Beyond – Momentum to Continue
"
1938,ARNC,"For 2014, earnings at the sector are expected to grow at a rate of 9.3% in the third quarter but decelerate to 6.9% in the fourth quarter. Overall, in 2014, the sector’s earnings are projected to grow 8.3%. In 2015, the growth will accelerate at a brisk pace to 19.3%.
"
1939,ARNC," Industry Ranking & Outlook – Positive on Aluminum and Copper, Neutral on Iron
"
1940,ARNC,"Within the Zacks Industry classification, the iron mining and non-ferrous mining industries are broadly grouped in the Basic Materials sector (one of 16 Zacks sectors). We rank all of the 260 industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in each industry. This ranking is available in the Zacks Industry Rank page.
"
1941,ARNC,"The way to align the ranking and outlook from the complete list of Zacks Industry Rank for the 260+ companies is that the outlook for the top one-third of the list (Zacks Industry Rank of #87 and lower) is positive, the middle one-third (Zacks Industry Rank between #88 and #173) is 'Neutral' while the outlook for the bottom one-third (Zacks Industry Rank #174 and higher) is negative.
"
1942,ARNC,"The non-ferrous mining industry features in the top 1/3rd with a Zacks Rank of #56 indicating that the outlook is positive. The iron mining industry features in the middle tier with a Zacks Industry Rank #108, indicating a neutral outlook.
"
1943,ARNC,"Please note that the Zacks Rank for stocks, which are at the core of our Industry Outlook, has an impressive track record, verified by outside auditors, to foretell stock prices, particularly over the short term (1 to 3 months). The rank, along with Expected Surprise Prediction (ESP) (Read: Zacks Earnings ESP: A Better Way to Find Earnings Surprises) helps in predicting the probability of earnings surprises.

1945,ARNC,"At the onset of 2014, the outlook for industrial metals was bleak as increased supply and insufficient demand exerted a downward pricing pressure on commodities. But six months into the year, the situation has changed with once laggards -- aluminum and copper -- showing signs of revival. These base metals prices will improve on the back of growth in the U.S. and an improving global macroeconomic scenario, as well as an improved supply and demand balance. A positive Zacks Rank and projected earnings growth for 2014 instills optimism in the so far faltering non-ferrous mining industry.
"
1946,ARNC,"On the other hand, a glut in supply and current high inventories will keep iron prices in check, justifying a neutral outlook for the iron mining industry. A revival of the Chinese economy and correction of the supply-demand imbalance will be instrumental in driving growth in the industry.

"
1948,ARNC,"Earnings headlines will be the primary catalyst for stocks in the coming days as the Q2 earnings season takes center stage. We have only a handful of companies reporting this week, but the cycle really ramps up next week when more than 60 S&P 500 members coming out with Q2 results.
"
1949,ARNC,"The chart below shows weekly schedule for how Q2 results will come out.
"
1950,ARNC,"The earnings growth expected in Q2 represents an improvement over what we got in the preceding quarter. But that’s not really saying much give how weak Q1 was. Total Q2 earnings for companies in the S&P 500 are expected to be up +3% on +1% higher revenues and a modest uptick in net margins. Estimates fell as the quarter unfolded, a trend that we has been in place quarter after quarter for almost two years now, with the current +3% earnings growth down from +5.5% at the start of the quarter. 
"
1951,ARNC,"The magnitude of negative revisions in Q2, however, was relatively on the lower side relative to other recent quarters, likely indicating the analyst community’s improving growth outlook. Lower negative revisions to Q2 estimates could be interpreted to mean that estimates not ‘low enough’ for companies to easily beat. But given management teams’ well-earned reputation for anchoring analysts’ expectations, this seems like a low-probability event.
"
1952,ARNC,"The more likely scenario is that we will see a repeat performance, with roughly two-thirds of the companies beating earnings estimates. But more important than beat ratios, the element of interest for the market will be how estimates for Q3 and beyond evolve in the coming days and weeks. As you can see in the chart below, consensus expectations reflect a material ramp up in the growth trajectory in the coming quarters. 
"
1953,ARNC,"Guidance has been overwhelmingly weak for quite some time, keeping the revisions trend firmly in the negative direction. Any improvement on that front will be a notable positive in the earnings picture and will validate the market’s gains thus far. On the other hand, it will be hard for the market to hold its ground in the face of continued negative guidance and revisions trends.Key Points
"
1954,ARNC,"The 2014 Q2 earnings season has gotten underway. Alcoa (AA) came out in style in its quarterly report, but it was preceded by 22 S&P 500 members with May fiscal quarters. Alcoa’s reassuring report notwithstanding, it is way too early to read anything into the results thus far.
"
1955,ARNC,"Total earnings in Q2 are expected to be up +3.0% on +1.0% lower revenues and modest gains on the margins front. As has been the case quarter after quarter for almost two years, estimates for Q2 fell as the quarter unfolded. That said, the growth rate expected in Q2 represents an improvement over what was expected in the prior quarter at a comparable stage.
"
1956,ARNC,"Three sectors – Utilities, Construction and Business Services – are expected to show double-digit growth rates in Q2. The Finance sector is expected to see another quarter of earnings decline, with total earnings for the sector expected to be down -3.6% from the same period last year. This would follow -7.1% decline in the sector’s earnings in Q1. But while the sector’s Q1 weakness was mostly due to Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), the Q2 weakness is broad-based.
"
1957,ARNC,"Total earnings for the Utilities sector, the strongest price performer in the S&P 500 year to date, are expected to be up +11.3% after the +18.1% gain in Q1. The sector was a beneficiary of the frigid weather in Q1, the Q2 growth pace is a bit misleading as it primarily reflects easy comparisons for Verizon (VZ  -  Free Report), which we place in the sector.
"
1958,ARNC,"Total earnings for the Technology sector are expected to be up +6.4% from the period last year on +4.7% higher revenues. This would follow +3.3% earnings growth for the sector on +2.7% higher revenues in Q1.
"
1959,ARNC,"Beyond Q2, earnings growth for the S&P 500 is expected to accelerate to +5.6% in Q3 and +8.9% in Q4, with growth in the second half of the year ramping up to +7.3% from the first half’s +1.9% pace. Total earnings are expected to be up +7.2% in 2014 and +11.7% in 2015.

"
1975,ARNC,"The rise in global population, growth in the Chinese economy, urbanization of the Asian countries and increasing requirements of the developed countries have created an unprecedented demand for minerals and metals. The metals & mining industry caters to this ever-rising demand through extraction (mining) and primary and secondary processing of these metals. However, of late, the tepid global economic growth and a slowdown in the Chinese economy have emerged as a major headwind for the global metal industry.Mining - Ferrous: Iron
"
1976,ARNC,"Iron Ore Price Trends
"
1977,ARNC,"Iron ore prices had a bullish run in 2013, in contrast to other base metals, helped by heightened demand from steel end consumers, particularly the Chinese construction sector. The scenario changed dramatically in the first quarter of 2014, with iron ore prices recording its sharpest one-day drop in four years in March tumbling by 8.3% to close at $104.7 per ton. This represented an 18-month low for iron ore prices.
"
1978,ARNC,"Overall, prices have been impacted by myriad reasons ? rising production and abundant supply of iron, tight credit in China and persistent fears regarding China's economy. Global steel production rose by a meager 2.5%, mainly dragged down by a slowdown in China’s output and affecting demand for iron ore, its main ingredient. Falling iron ore prices have reflected upon first-quarter results. Mining giant Vale S.A. (VALE  -  Free Report) reported a 19% plunge in its first-quarter profit due to the fall in prices of iron ore, its main product.
"
1979,ARNC,"Since the first quarter, iron ore prices had recovered somewhat to move up as high as $119.40 a ton on Apr 10, but have again dipped. In April, price of the steelmaking raw material overall dipped 8%. Iron prices have gone downhill due to slow economic growth in China and the government’s disapproval of the practice of using iron ore as collateral in lending transactions.Iron Industry: Outlook
"
1980,ARNC,"There is a threat of oversupply in 2014 as major iron ore producers, Rio Tinto plc (RIO  -  Free Report), BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP  -  Free Report) and Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. (FMG.AX) have ramped up production. They intend to continue exploring for iron ore in Australia despite lower growth forecasts for China and weaker iron ore prices, betting on continued strength in iron ore demand over the long term. Thus, Australia, the world’s top exporter of iron ore, will continue to increase its shipments.
"
1981,ARNC,"Even though iron ore exports from India have lessened significantly in the last two years as the court imposed a ban on mining, an improvement in export shipments is expected this year. Brazil will also hike its exports. In case this excess supply is not matched by adequate demand, it will expose the market to the risk of a further decline in prices.
"
1982,ARNC,"Per the World Steel Association, global steel production is expected to increase 3.1% in 2014, less than half of last year's rate and the slowest pace in at least 15 years. After it soared 6.1% in 2013 aided by support from government infrastructure investment, apparent steel use in China is expected to slow to 3% growth in 2014 as the Chinese government’s efforts to rebalance the economy continues to restrain investment activities.
"
1983,ARNC,"An impending slowdown in China’s growth is bound to affect prices as China is currently the largest producer of steel and consequently the largest consumer of iron ore, accounting for around 60% of the global seaborne market. Thus the mismatch between the excess supply and demand for iron ore will keep iron ore prices subdued in the near term.Mining - Non-Ferrous: Aluminium
"
1984,ARNC,"Price Trends
"
1985,ARNC,"In 2013, aluminium prices slid and in the fourth quarter, London Metal Exchange (LME) aluminum prices fell to a four-year low, given the oversupply of the metal in the market (evidenced by large aluminum inventories in LME warehouses). Realized aluminum prices declined 8% year over year in the first quarter of 2014. Supply outpacing demand led to the dismal performance, which was aggravated by rising inventories. Industry results suffered because of the decline in realized aluminum prices.Aluminium Industry: Outlook
"
1986,ARNC,"After aluminum prices bearing the brunt of chronic surplus, the global aluminium industry is going through a substantial change. Companies have decided to cut back on production. Rusal, the world’s largest aluminum producer, reduced production by 9% in 2013 compared with 2012. Rusal has effectively attained almost a 3-year low cash cost within the aluminium segment.
"
1987,ARNC,"Likewise, Alcoa Inc. (AA) has taken up a number of restructuring measures (including closure of smelters), and is aggressively pursuing cost-cutting actions. Alcoa, during the first quarter, announced three smelting capacity reductions. Once all announced curtailments and closures are executed, Alcoa will have reduced its operating smelting capacity by 1.2 million metric tons, or 28% since 2007.
"
1988,ARNC,"On the demand side, aluminum consumption is expected to improve on a global basis spurred by the automotive and packaging industries -- the key consumer market. The automobile market is also becoming increasingly aluminum-intensive, given the metal’s recyclability and light-weight properties. The global push to improve fuel efficiency in vehicles is expected to more than double the demand for aluminum in the auto industry by 2025. The airline industry is also expected to boost demand for the metal.
"
1989,ARNC,"Following China, which accounts for over 40% of the global aluminum consumption, India appears promising as its current low level of aluminum consumption and high urban population growth make a favorable combination. With demand remaining strong and the industry pulling the reins on supply, the aluminum market is likely to witness deficits for a prolonged period which creates a supportive backdrop of high aluminum prices.Mining - Non-Ferrous: Copper
"
1990,ARNC,"Movement in Copper Price & Performance
"
1991,ARNC,"For the most part of 2013, oversupply and lack of demand kept copper prices in check. LME spot copper prices averaged $3.19 per pound during first-quarter 2014. Lower prices hurt results of copper producers like Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX  -  Free Report), Southern Copper Corp. (SCCO  -  Free Report) and Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM  -  Free Report). Demand from key end markets, like construction materials and electronics, remained weak due to the overall economic softness. Weakness in the Chinese economy led to decline in copper demand as it accounts for about 40% of the world's annual copper demand.
"
1992,ARNC,"In the wake of the decline in metal prices, copper companies have reduced their budgeted future capital expenditures, exploration and other costs and are looking to rid themselves of some of their saleable assets. In 2013, Freeport diversified from its bread-and-butter copper mining business by venturing into the U.S. energy space with the acquisition of Plains Exploration & Production Company and McMoRan Exploration Co. The merger positions the combined entity as a leading natural resource conglomerate in the U.S.Copper Industry: Outlook
"
1993,ARNC,"The scenario in 2014 will be similar to 2013 with demand and supply imbalances. Notwithstanding the current volatility in prices, we have a long-term bullish stance on copper, supported by its widespread use, limited supplies from existing mines and the absence of significant new development projects. Prices will be influenced by demand from China and emerging markets, economic activity in the U.S. and other industrialized countries.Overall Industry Ranking
"
1994,ARNC,"Within the Zacks Industry classification, the Iron Mining and Non-Ferrous Mining industries are broadly grouped in the Basic Materials sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors). We rank all of 258 industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in each industry. This ranking is available on the Zacks Industry Rank page.
"
1995,ARNC,"The way to align the ranking and outlook from the complete list of Zacks Industry Rank for the 258+ industries is that the outlook for the top one-third of the list (Zacks Industry Rank of #86 and lower) is positive, while the outlook for the bottom one-third (Zacks Industry Rank #172 and higher) is negative.
"
1996,ARNC,"The Iron Mining industry features in the top 1/3rd with its Zacks Industry Rank #63 indicating a positive outlook, while the Non-Ferrous Mining industry features in the middle tier at Zacks Industry Rank with a Zacks Rank of #91 indicating that the outlook is on the neutral side. One could say that the near-term outlook for the group as a whole depicts a Neutral outlook.
"
1997,ARNC,"Please note that the Zacks Rank for stocks, which are at the core of our Industry Outlook, has an impressive track record, verified by outside auditors, to foretell stock prices, particularly over the short term (1 to 3 months). The rank, along with the Expected Surprise Prediction (ESP) (Read: Zacks Earnings ESP: A Better Way to Find Earnings Surprises) helps in predicting the probability of earnings surprises.Sector Level Scorecard in Q1
"
1998,ARNC,"As we have crossed the halfway mark in the Q1 earnings season, for the 77.3% of the companies in the Basic Material Sector that have reported, earnings increased 1.2% in the first quarter of 2014, a much weaker performance than the 29.3% rise in earnings witnessed in the fourth quarter of 2013. Taking into account all the companies in the Basic Material sector that are yet to announce their results, earnings is expected to dip 2.2%.
"
1999,ARNC,"The expected earnings dip should not make investors shy away from the Basic Material sector as the feebleness in the first quarter is broad-based and not concentrated in any one sector. Of the 16 Zacks sectors, 5 are expected to experience a year-over-year earnings decline.Q2 & Beyond: What Zacks Predicts
"
2000,ARNC,"In the second quarter of 2014, earnings of the Basic Material sector is expected to recover and grow 11.6% and accelerate further to 14.6% in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, earnings growth is expected to decelerate to 6.1%. Overall in fiscal 2014, earnings are expected to grow 10% and thereafter at 18.2% in 2015.Overall Industry Outlook
"
2001,ARNC,"Overall in the metals market, increased supply and insufficient demand exerted a downward pricing pressure on commodities and this trend is expected to continue over the short term. Additionally, cost inflation is expected to be a headwind for metal and mining companies over the next several years, driven by a number of factors: labor, energy, ore grades, currencies, supply constraints and taxes. Global economic uncertainties, softening commodity prices and higher input costs are increasing the pressure on company margins.
"
2002,ARNC,"To combat this, mining and metals companies are reviewing their portfolios to identify underperforming assets and to shut down or divest these high-cost and non-core assets. Industry consolidation, automation technology, owner-operated mines and investment in energy assets are some of the steps that these companies are taking to mitigate the impact of rising costs.
"
2003,ARNC,"Growth in the U.S. and an improving global macroeconomic scenario in tandem will boost demand in the industry. Revival of the Chinese economy will be instrumental in driving growth in the industry.
"
2004,ARNC,"Will Q1 Earnings Be the Low Point for the Year?
"
2005,ARNC,"The 2014 Q1 earnings season takes center stage this week with Alcoa’s (AA) release after the close on Tuesday. Alcoa isn’t the overall first to report Q1 results, though it is the first S&P 500 member with the calendar fiscal quarter to come out with results. Companies with fiscal quarters ending in February have been reporting since mid-March and all 21 of those form part of the Q1 tally.
"
2006,ARNC,"In fairness to Alcoa, however, the market starts paying attention to the earnings season after their earnings announcement even though the list of companies that report before it includes such industry leaders like FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report), Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) and others. In total, we have 33 companies reporting Q1 results this week, including 8 S&P 500 members. The reporting cycle really gets into high gear from next, as the chart below shows.
"
2007,ARNC," Expectations for 2014 Q1
"
2008,ARNC,"Estimates for Q1 started coming down at an accelerated pace as companies predominantly guided lower on the 2013 Q4 earnings calls, consistent with the trend we have been seeing for more than a year now. Total Q1 earnings for companies in the S&P 500 are currently expected to be down -3.3% from the same period last year, a material decline from the +2.1% growth expected in early January 2014. Please note that the expected Q1 earnings decline has been exacerbated by Google’s new class of stock. Excluding Google from the S&P 500, total S&P 500 earnings would be down (only) -2.7%.  
"
2009,ARNC,"The negative revision trend is widespread, but is particularly notable for the Retail, Basic Materials, Autos, Consumer Staples, and the Energy sectors, as the chart below shows.
"
2010,ARNC,"With roughly two-thirds of S&P 500 companies beating earnings expectations in any reporting cycle, actual Q1 results will almost certainly be better than these pre-season expectations. But Q1 is unlikely to repeat the performance of the last few quarters where we would witness a new all-time earnings total record each quarter. Total earnings for the S&P 500 reached a new all-time record of $267.6 billion in 2013 Q4.
"
2011,ARNC,"Current estimates for 2014 Q1 aggregate to a quarterly total of $248.8 billion, but the expectation is that Q1 will be the low point for earnings this year, both in terms of earnings totals as well as the growth rate. Consensus expectations reflect a rebound in Q2, with the earnings totals in each of the following three quarters of the year setting new all-time records one after the other.
"
2012,ARNC,"The chart below shows the aggregate quarterly earnings for the S&P 500 as whole. 
"
2013,ARNC,"Given the low Q1 expectations, it wouldn’t take much for companies to come out ahead of them. Roughly two-thirds of the S&P 500 members beat earnings expectations every quarter any way. So, more results along those lines would be nothing new and wouldn’t tell us much about the health of corporate earnings.
"
2014,ARNC,"What we haven’t seen for a while instead is some evidence of strength on the revenue front and favorable comments from management teams about business outlook. Corporate guidance has been negative for almost two years now, causing estimates to keep coming down and the long hoped-for earnings growth turnaround getting pushed forward.  Guidance is important in any earnings season, but it is particularly important this time around given the relatively elevated expectations for the second half of the year and beyond.Scorecard for 2014 Q1 (as of Friday, April 4th)
"
2015,ARNC,"Total earnings for the 21 S&P 500 members were up +14.2% from the same period last year, with a ‘beat ratio’ of 57.1% and a median surprise of +1.9%. Total revenues were in the positive column as well, up +6.1%, with a revenue ‘beat ratio’ of 47.6% and a median surprise of +0.1%.
"
2016,ARNC,"It’s premature to draw any conclusions from this small sample of results, but the growth rates and beat ratios for these 21 companies in Q1 are weaker than what we have seen from the same group of companies in other recent quarters. It has overall been a fairly uninspiring start to the Q1 earnings season.

2024,ARNC,"The following is an excerpt from this week's Earnings Trends article.  To see the full report, please click here. Taking Stock of the Q1 Earnings Season
"
2025,ARNC,"The 2014 Q1 earnings season takes center stage from next week onwards even though the reporting cycle has actually been underway for a couple of weeks. The reports thus far (19 S&P 500 companies have reported results) are from companies with fiscal quarters ending in February, which we count as part of the Q1 tally. Results for companies with March ending quarter will start next week with Alcoa’s (AA) release on April 8th.
"
2026,ARNC,"Many of these early February quarter-ending companies aren’t obscure players as the list includes industry leaders like FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report), Nike (NKE  -  Free Report), Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), and others. These initial reports don’t inspire much confidence and appear to be pointing towards another underwhelming reporting season ahead. But it’s perhaps premature to draw any firm conclusions based on such an unrepresentative sample of reports.
"
2027,ARNC,"The chart below shows weekly schedule for how Q1 results will come out. 
"
2028,ARNC,"Expectations for the Q1 earnings season as whole remain low, with total earnings expected to be down -2.6% from the same period last year on +1.0% higher revenues and modestly lower margins. As has been the trend for more than a year now, estimates for Q1 came down sharply as the quarter unfolded. The current -2.6% decline in total earnings in Q1 is down from +2.1% growth expected at the start of the quarter in January. 
"
2029,ARNC,"Current estimates for total S&P 500 earnings in Q1 are down -2.9% from what was expected at the start of the quarter in early January. This magnitude of negative revision to Q1 earnings over the last three months is greater than what we witnessed in the comparable period in 2013 Q4, but is broadly in-line with the magnitude of the 4-quarter average of negative revision.
"
2030,ARNC,"The chart below shows the magnitude of negative earnings revision for 2014 Q1 and each of the preceding four quarters over the course of each quarter. 
"
2031,ARNC,"Estimates for Q1 have fallen across the board, but the trend is particularly notable for the Retail, Basic Materials, Autos, Consumer Staples, and the Energy sectors, as the chart below shows.
"
2032,ARNC,"With two-thirds of S&P 500 members typically beating earnings estimates in any reporting cycle, actual Q1 results will almost certainly be better than these pre-season expectations. But Q1 is unlikely to repeat the performance of the last few quarters when we would witness new all-time records for total earnings each quarter.
"
2033,ARNC,"Guidance has been overwhelmingly weak for more than a year now, keeping the revisions trend firmly in the negative direction. Odds are that we wouldn’t see any change on that front this earnings season either, bringing down estimates for the rest of the year. Investors haven’t cared about negative estimate revisions thus far, but it will be interesting that behavior will remain in place going forward as well.Key Points
"
2034,ARNC,"The 2014 Q1 earnings season has gotten underway with results from 19 S&P 500 members (with fiscal quarters ending in February) already out. The reporting cycle gets into high gear from next week onwards.
"
2035,ARNC,"Total earnings for the 19 S&P 500 companies that have reported results are up +0.5%, with 57.9% beating earnings expectations. Revenues for these companies are up +4.3%, with a revenue ‘beat ratio’ of 47.4%. The performance from these companies is weaker than what we have seen from this same group of companies in recent quarters.  
"
2036,ARNC,"For the S&P 500 companies as whole, total Q1 earnings are expected to be down -2.6% from the same period last year, on +1% higher revenues and 35 basis points in lower margins. Sequentially, total earnings for the S&P 500 are expected to be down -6.3%.
"
2037,ARNC,"Estimates fell sharply as the quarter unfolded, with the current -2.6% decline in total earnings down from expectations of +2.1% positive growth in early January.
"
2038,ARNC,"The growth weakness is broad-based and not concentrated in any one sector, with 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to show earnings declines in Q1. Among the major sectors, earnings are expected at this stage to be down -3.9% in Finance, -4.2% in Technology, -6.9% in Energy, and -13.5% in Autos. Business Services and Utilities are the only sectors expected to show double-digit earnings growth.
"
2039,ARNC,"The Q1 earnings season is expected to be the low point of this year’s earnings picture, both in terms of total earnings as well as the growth rate. Total quarterly earnings reached an all-time record in 2013 Q4, but are expected to fall short of that level in 2014 Q1. Expectations for the coming quarters reflect a strong ramp up, with each of the following three quarters a new all-time record.
"
2040,ARNC,"Guidance has overwhelmingly been negative in recent quarters and we saw the same trend in place with the initial Q1 reports. Continuation of that trend through the rest of this earnings season will result in the by-now all-too-familiar negative revisions to estimates for 2014 Q2.
"
2041,ARNC,"Total earnings in Q2 are currently expected to be up +5.4%, followed by growth rates of +7.2% in Q3 and +9.4% in Q4. For the full year, total earnings are expected to be up +7.8% in 2014 and +11.7% in 2015.
"
2042,ARNC,"The bottom-up ‘EPS’ estimate for the S&P 500 for 2014 currently stands at $116.60, while the top-down estimate for the same is currently at $117.25. For 2015, the bottom-up estimate remains $130.19.

Expectations for the coming quarters reflect a strong ramp up, with each of the following three quarters a new all-time record.
"
2060,ARNC,"Guidance has overwhelmingly been negative in recent quarters and we saw the same trend in place with the initial Q1 reports. Continuation of that trend through the rest of this earnings season will result in the by-now all-too-familiar negative revisions to estimates for 2014 Q2.
"
2061,ARNC,"Total earnings in Q2 are currently expected to be up +5.4%, followed by growth rates of +7.2% in Q3 and +9.4% in Q4. For the full year, total earnings are expected to be up +7.8% in 2014 and +11.7% in 2015.
"
2062,ARNC,"The bottom-up ‘EPS’ estimate for the S&P 500 for 2014 currently stands at $116.60, while the top-down estimate for the same is currently at $117.25. For 2015, the bottom-up estimate remains $130.19.

2064,ARNC,"Will We Finally See Some Sunshine?
"
2065,ARNC,"The focus this week is on the economy, with a number of top-tier economic reports dominating the market’s attention. But the earnings season is slowly gaining attention as well.
"
2066,ARNC,"We don’t have that many earnings reports this week, but more than a dozen S&P 500 companies have already reported 2014 Q1 results (companies with fiscal quarters ending in February get counted as part of the Q1 tally). The reporting cycle will start ramping up materially from next week onwards after Alcoa’s (AA) release. The results thus far from the likes of Nike (NKE  -  Free Report), FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report), Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) and others have been underwhelming. But it’s way too early to draw any firm conclusions from what we have seen thus far.
"
2067,ARNC,"The economic data coming out this week, particularly Tuesday’s manufacturing ISM survey and Friday’s non-farm payroll report, is expected to show that the economy is coming out of the weather-induced soft patch. The U.S economy did reasonably well in the second half of 2013, but lost momentum at the start of this year. Investors resigned themselves to the weather explanation for the soft data at the start of the year, but expect to see data showing the economy springing back into action in the coming days.
"
2068,ARNC,"The market is looking for evidence that the U.S. economy is on track to graduate to a higher growth pace this year than has been the case over the last few years. The first quarter has essentially been washed out because of weather, but growth is expected to resume from the second quarter onwards, with GDP growth going above the +3%-plus pace in the second half and continuing into 2015. This favorable economic outlook is at the root of strong corporate earnings estimates as well.Expectations for 2014 Q1
"
2069,ARNC,"Estimates for 2014 Q1 started coming down at an accelerated pace as companies predominantly guided lower on the 2013 Q4 earnings calls, consistent with the trend we have been seeing for more than a year now. Total Q1 earnings for companies in the S&P 500 are currently expected to be down -1.8% from the same period last year, a material decline from the +2.1% growth expected in early January 2014.
"
2070,ARNC,"The negative revision trend is widespread, but is particularly notable for the Retail, Basic Materials, Autos, Consumer Staples, and the Energy sectors, as the chart below shows.
"
2071,ARNC,"With roughly two-thirds of S&P 500 companies beating earnings expectations in any reporting cycle, actual Q1 results will almost certainly be better than these pre-season expectations. But Q1 is unlikely to repeat the performance of the last few quarters where we would witness a new all-time earnings total record each quarter. Total earnings for the S&P 500 are on track to reach $269.4 billion in 2013 Q4. This is a new all-time quarterly record for total earnings, surpassing the previous record set in 2013 Q3 at $262.7 billion. Current estimates for 2014 Q1 aggregate to a quarterly total of $251.5 billion, but the expectation is for a strong ramp up from Q2 onwards.Scorecard for 2013 Q4 (as of Friday, March 28th)
"
2072,ARNC,"Total earnings for the 500 S&P 500 members were up +9.1% from the same period last year, with a ‘beat ratio’ of 65.6% and a median surprise of +2.4%. Total revenues were barely in the positive column, up only +0.7%, with a revenue ‘beat ratio’ of 57.2% and a median surprise of +0.6%. While the revenue growth rate in Q4 was held down by tough comparisons in the Finance sector, the overall earnings growth rate in the quarter was the highest of 2013.
"
2073,ARNC,"A big contributor to the strong Q4 earnings growth was easy comparisons for three companies – Bank of America (BAC), Verizon (VZ), and Travelers (TRV). Exclude these three companies and total earnings growth for the S&P 500 companies that have reported drops to +5.5% from the ‘headline’ +9.1%, which is about where growth has been in recent quarters.

2085,ARNC,"Jobs in Focus as Q4 Earnings Reports Trickle In
"
2086,ARNC,"The focus this week is justifiably on the labor market data, particularly the government jobs report coming out on Friday. The overall tone of recent U.S. economic data has been favorable, prompting positive revisions to Q4 GDP growth. Given this underlying momentum, it is perhaps reasonable to look for a positive surprise to the expected 190K ‘headline’ jobs reading on Friday. Also of interest in the economic docket will be minutes of the Fed’s December that resulted in the ‘Taper’ announcement.
"
2087,ARNC,"The labor market will no doubt be the big subject this week, but the drumbeat for the start of the 2013 Q4 earnings season will also get underway this week. We only have 6 S&P 500 companies reporting results this week, including Alcoa (AA), Monsanto (MON), and Family Dollar (FDO), with the full list of companies reporting in the week totaling about 40. The Q4 earnings season will get in the spotlight the following week when J.P. Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) will report results.
"
2088,ARNC,"The 6 S&P 500 companies reporting this week aren’t (officially) the first Q4 earning releases. Companies with fiscal quarters ending in November start reporting in mid-December and get counted as part of the Q4 earnings season. By this definition, we already have seen reports from 18 S&P 500 members, including such industry bellwethers as FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report), Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), and Nike (NKE  -  Free Report).
"
2089,ARNC,"Here is the Scorecard for the 18 S&P 500 companies that have already reported Q4 results, as of Friday, January 3, 2014. Total earnings for these 18 companies (not EPS, median or otherwise) are up +3.2% from the same period last year, with a ‘beat ratio’ of 55.6% and a median surprise of +1.5%. Total revenues are up +5.4%, with an impressive revenue ‘beat ratio’ of 66.7% and a median surprise of +1.3%.
"
2090,ARNC,"In comparative terms, the earnings growth for these 18 companies is below what these same companies reported in recent quarters, while performance on the revenue front compares favorably to the recent past.
"
2091,ARNC,"But the Q4 earnings season’s story isn’t about the few companies that have reported, but rather about the still-to-come reports. To that point, the ‘composite’ picture for Q4, where we combine the results from the 18 companies that have reported already with the 488 still to come, is for growth rate of +6.3%. As has been the case at the start of recent quarterly earnings cycles, the current +6.3% growth rate for Q4 represents a sharp drop over the last three months, as the chart below shows. 
"
2092,ARNC,"This negative revisions behavior is hardly unusual as we have been repeatedly seeing this pattern play out in recent quarters. Companies have been overwhelmingly guiding lower, prompting analysts to cut estimates for the following quarter. The revisions behavior ahead of the Q3 earnings season was no different and most of the same sectors have experienced negative revisions this time around as well. The ‘regulars’ on the negative estimate revisions beat include Technology, Industrials, and Energy. Construction and Aerospace suffered negative revisions as well, while estimates for Basic Materials went up.
"
2093,ARNC,"The earnings growth expected in Q4 at this stage of the reporting cycle is the highest that we have seen in any of the last few quarters. A big reason for that is easy comparisons, as 2012 Q4 represented the lowest quarterly earnings total for the S&P 500 in the last six quarters, with the comps particularly easy for the Finance sector, helping produce the sector’s impressive +20.1% growth rate.
"
2094,ARNC,"Within the Finance sector, the comparisons are particularly easy for the insurance industry – the industry alone accounts for more than a quarter of the sector’s total earnings – given the impact on the industry’s profitability from the East Coast storms in late 2012. Total earnings for the insurance industry are expected to be up more than +40% in Q4, with all the major industry players like Chubb (CB) and Travelers (TRV  -  Free Report) producing strong growth rates.   
"
2095,ARNC,"While easy comparisons are driving the year over year growth rate in Q4, there hasn’t been much growth lately despite very high level overall total earnings. Total earnings for companies in the S&P 500 reached an all-time record at $262.5 billion, surpassing the previous record reached the quarter before. Current estimates for Q4 work out to a modestly lower total for the quarter. But when all is said and done about Q4, we will likely have seen another quarterly record.
"
2096,ARNC,"But of more interest than Q4 growth will be management guidance for 2014. Companies typically provide guidance only for the following quarter, but they do tend to discuss their outlook their outlook for the coming year on the Q4 earnings calls. It will be interesting to see if management teams see any material improvement in the earnings picture this year along the lines of current consensus earnings expectations for 2014. Total earnings are expected to be up +9.8% in 2014, up from +4.6% growth in 2013, with most of the growth coming in the back half of the year.Monday-1/6

2106,ARNC,"Shutdown & the Q3 Earnings Season
"
2107,ARNC,"We didn’t get the September jobs report thanks to the government shutdown and the impasse promises to steal the limelight from the 2013 Q3 earnings season. With the October 17th debt-ceiling deadline fast approaching, we can only hope that we move past these hurdles without further damage.  
"
2108,ARNC,"The Q3 reports have been trickling in, with results from 21 S&P 500 companies out already. All of the reports thus far are from companies with fiscal quarters ending in August, which we count as part of the Q3 reporting cycle. Most of the companies reporting going forward, including Alcoa (AA) that reports October 8th after the close, are on the calendar quarter. In total, we have 33 companies reporting results this week, including 10 S&P 500 members. J.P. Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), Costco (COST  -  Free Report), and Yum Brands (YUM  -  Free Report) are some of the notable companies reporting results this week.   
"
2109,ARNC,"We have had a few strong earnings reports already, particularly from Nike (NKE  -  Free Report), FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report), and AutoZone (AZO  -  Free Report), but the overall trend at this admittedly very early stage is mixed. The earnings and revenue growth rates for the 21 companies are tracking better than what these same companies in Q2 and the 4-quarter average, though the beat ratios (percentage of companies coming ahead of expectations) are a bit weaker.
"
2110,ARNC,"This week’s results will provide better color on underlying trends, with results from companies like Costco (COST  -  Free Report), Yum Brands (YUM  -  Free Report), Family Dollar (FDO) and Safeway (SWY) giving us a sense of the consumer economy. Results from the big banks aren’t arriving till Friday, but they will set the stage for the rest of the group the following week. Finance was instrumental in keeping last quarter’s aggregate earnings growth in the positive column and is playing a similar, though less pronounced, role this quarter as well.
"
2111,ARNC,"J.P. Morgan has been in the news lately for all the wrong reasons, though the company has an impressive track record of positive earnings surprises, having beat expectations in the last 6 quarters. This report could have noisy parts related to the company’s recent litigation and regulatory troubles, but core earnings should still remain best in class. The mortgage business will likely be less of a contributor this time around, both for JPM as well Wells Fargo.Low Expectations for Q3
"
2112,ARNC,"As has been the case at the start of recent quarterly earnings cycles, expectations for the Q3 earnings season have fallen sharply over the last three months. Total earnings for companies in the S&P 500 are now expected to be up only +1.1% from the same period last year, down from +5.1% at the start of the quarter in early July, as the chart below shows.
"
2113,ARNC,"This negative revisions behavior is hardly unusual as we have been repeatedly seeing this pattern play out in recent quarters. Companies have been overwhelmingly guiding lower, prompting analysts to cut estimates for the following quarter. The revisions behavior ahead of the Q2 earnings season was no different, as the chart below shows.
"
2114,ARNC,"Most of the same sectors have experienced negative revisions this time around as was the case in Q2. The ‘regulars’ on the negative estimate revisions front include Technology, Basic Materials, and Industrials. But in addition to those sectors, Retail and Consumer Staples have played some roles in bringing down expectations for Q3 as well.
"
2115,ARNC,"The chart below compares the Q3 total earnings growth expected for these five sectors at the start of the quarter and where those expectations stand at present
"
2116,ARNC,"Estimates for other sectors have come down as well, with even the Finance sector earnings expected to be up +5.9% today, vs. +6.2% last week and +8.1% in early July. Energy, Utilities, Conglomerates and even Construction have suffered negative revisions in varying degrees.High Expectations for Q4
"
2117,ARNC,"While estimates for Q3 have come down, the same for Q4 and the following quarters have held up fairly well, as the chart below shows.
"
2118,ARNC,"Part of the strong Q4 growth is a function of easier comparisons, as 2012 Q4 represents the lowest quarterly earnings total for the S&P 500 in the last six quarters, with the comps particularly easy for the Finance sector. But it’s not all due to easy comparisons, as the expected earnings totals for Q4 represent a new all-time quarterly record. Total earnings for the S&P 500 reached a new record at $258.6 billion in Q2, surpassing Q1’s $253.6 billion record. But they are expected to reach $265.7 billion in 2013 Q4, with total earnings growth outside of Finance expected at +5.3%.
"
2119,ARNC,"The evolving outlook for Q4 is perhaps the most important aspect of the Q3 earnings season, more so than Q3 earnings/revenue growth rates and beat ratios. While the overall level of aggregate earnings is in record territory, there isn’t much growth. The longstanding hope in the market has been for earnings growth to eventually ramp up. But the starting point of this expected growth ramp-up keeps getting delayed quarter after quarter. The hope currently is that Q4 will be the starting point of such growth.
"
2120,ARNC,"Guidance has overwhelmingly been negative over the last few quarters. But if current Q4 expectations have to hold, then we will need to see a change on the guidance front; we need to see more companies either guide higher or reaffirm current consensus expectations.
"
2121,ARNC,"Anything short of that will result in a replay of the by-now familiar negative estimate revisions trend that we have been seeing in recent quarters. The market didn’t care much as estimates came down in the last few quarters, hoping for better times ahead. Will it do the same this time as well, pushing its hopes of earnings ramp up into 2014? We will find out the answer to that question over the next two months.

2135,ARNC,"Q3 Earnings Season in the Spotlight
"
2136,ARNC,"The 2014 Q3 earnings season takes center stage this week with Alcoa’s (AA) release after the close on Wednesday. Alcoa isn’t the first to report quarterly results, though it is the first S&P 500 member with the calendar fiscal quarter to come out with results. Companies with fiscal quarters ending in August have been reporting since mid-September and the tally of such Q3 reports already totals 22 S&P 500 members. In fairness to Alcoa, however, investors start paying attention to the earnings season after their earnings announcement.
"
2137,ARNC,"It is way too early to draw even preliminary conclusions from the results thus far. But the results thus far aren’t materially different from what we have seen from the same group of 22 companies in other recent quarters. The table below shows the scorecard for the 22 companies that have reported results already.
"
2138,ARNC,"The earnings calendar is on the light side, with only about 30 companies reporting quarter results, including 9 S&P 500 members. But as you can see in the updated weekly earnings calendar below, the reporting cycle ramps up in a big way the following week.
"
2139,ARNC,"This earnings season will give us a good sense of whether the profitability strength on display in the last reporting cycle was a one-off event or the start of something enduring. Please recall that part of the Q2 strength was a bounce back from the extremely low levels to which all activity levels had fallen in the weather-disrupted first quarter of the year. As such, one could argue that none of the last two earnings seasons represented truly normal conditions, which we will most likely see for the first time this year only in Q3.
"
2140,ARNC,"The table below shows a summary picture of current Q3 expectations compared to what was actually achieved in Q2. As you can see, total earnings are expected to be up +1.5% from the same period last year on +1.8% higher revenues and modest margin gains. Finance remains a big drag this quarter, with total earnings for the sector expected to be down -3.9% from the same period last year. Excluding Finance, total earnings for the S&P 500 would be up +2.8%.
"
2141,ARNC,"As has been the trend each quarter ahead of the start of the earnings season, estimates for Q3 have come down as well as the quarter unfolded. The recent leg down in estimates has mostly been due to Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), with the bank’s settlement with the government causing its Q3 EPS estimates to drop from positive 32 cents to the current 8 cents loss. In dollar terms, that’s a $4.2 billion negative swing in Bank of America’s Q3 earnings estimates.
"
2142,ARNC,"The chart below shows estimates for 2014 Q3 have evolved over the last 10 or so weeks.
"
2143,ARNC,"The negative revisions trend has been broad based, with most sectors suffering downward adjustments in estimates. But the trend has been most pronounced for Oil/Energy, Retail, and Conglomerates. The chart below shows the sectors with the biggest revisions. The Finance sector swing is primarily due to Bank of America.  
"
2144,ARNC,"Total earnings for the S&P 500 reached an all-time quarterly record in 2014 Q2 and current estimates for Q3 put the quarterly total as the second highest ever. But given the historical trend of roughly two-thirds of the companies beating earnings estimates, the final Q3 tally will likely be right in the preceding quarter’s record vicinity. The chart below shows that current consensus estimates reflect record tallies in the following quarters.  
"
2145,ARNC,"For these estimates to hold, we need an improvement on the guidance front, which has been persistently been weak for almost two years now. There was modest improvement in tone of management guidance on the Q2 earnings calls, but the majority of companies providing guidance still guided lower.
"
2146,ARNC,"Given the global growth worries, it is likely that the quality and quantity of guidance will deteriorate even further this earnings season. Importantly, continued negative guidance will effectively guarantee that we will see a repeat of negative estimate revisions, with estimates for Q4 coming down as earnings season unfolds.
"
2147,ARNC,"That said, continuation of even the modest improvement in guidance will be a net positive in the overall earnings picture.Note: Want more articles from this author?

2160,ARNC,"Fed in Focus as 2013 Q3 Earnings Season Gets Underway
"
2161,ARNC,"The market’s focus is justifiably on the Fed this week, given expectations that the FOMC will start ‘Tapering’ its bond-purchase program. Also of interest will be the FOMC members’ updated economic forecasts and the Bernanke press conference where the outgoing Fed Chairman will try to explain their ‘Taper’ decision, or lack thereof.
"
2162,ARNC,"Some in the market continue to hope that the Fed will hold off on the ‘Taper’ decision this week given the still-tepid economic picture and the potentially destabilizing upcoming budget and debt-ceiling debates in Congress. With the Syria debate now moving to the background, Congress’s attention will be shifting to these divisive topics in the coming days, not to mention a potentially noisy Senate confirmation battle for Larry Summers as the next Fed Chairman, should he get the nod as many speculations seem to suggest.
"
2163,ARNC,"Please check out the very informative post by Nick Kalivas on the evolving monetary policy picture and the issues facing the Fed. Click here.
"
2164,ARNC,"The Fed will no doubt be the big subject this week, but we are getting close to the start of the 2013 Q3 earnings season as well. In fact, the Q3 earnings season will actually get underway this week with the earning release from Adobe Systems (ADBE  -  Free Report) after the close on Tuesday, followed by reports from such bellwethers as FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) on Wednesday.
"
2165,ARNC,"Alcoa (AA) typically gets credited for kick-starting each earnings season, but since we count all companies with quarters ending in August as part of our Q3 tally, the Q3 earnings season will have gotten underway weeks before Alcoa reports on October 8th. It will be interesting to see how much attention the aluminum giant’s earnings report will get this earnings season since it will have lost its position in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. In total, we have 20 companies reporting Q3 results this week, including 5 S&P 500 members.
"
2166,ARNC,"As has been the case at the start of recent quarterly earnings cycles, expectations for the Q3 earnings season have fallen sharply over the last three months. Total earnings for companies in the S&P 500 are now expected to be up only +1.3% from the same period last year. This is down materially from what was expected at the start of the quarter in early July, as the chart below shows. 
"
2167,ARNC,"This negative revisions behavior is hardly unusual as we have been repeatedly seeing this pattern play out in recent quarters. Companies have been overwhelmingly guiding lower, prompting analysts to cut estimates for the following quarter. The revisions behavior ahead of the Q2 earnings season was no different and most of the same sectors have experienced negative revisions this time around as well. The ‘regulars’ on the negative estimate revisions beat include Technology, Basic Materials, and Industrials. But Retail and Consumer Discretionary have played material roles in bringing down expectations for Q3.
"
2168,ARNC,"The chart below compares the Q3 total earnings growth expected for these five sectors at the start of the quarter and where those expectations stand at present
"
2169,ARNC,"Estimates for other sectors have come down as well, with even the Finance sector earnings expected to be up +7% now vs. the +8.1% that was expected in early July. Energy, Utilities, Conglomerates and even Construction have suffered negative revisions in varying degrees.
"
2170,ARNC,"While estimates for Q3 have come down, the same for Q4 and the following quarters have held up fairly well, as the chart below shows.   
"
2171,ARNC,"Part of the extremely strong growth expected in Q4 is a function of easier comparisons, as 2012 Q4 represents the lowest quarterly earnings total for the S&P 500 in the last six quarters, with the comps particularly easy for the Finance sector. But it’s not all due to easy comparisons, as the expected earnings totals for Q4 represent a new all-time quarterly record. Total earnings for the S&P 500 reached a new record at $255.9 billion in Q2, surpassing Q1’s $253.9 billion record. But they are expected to reach $273.6 billion in 2013 Q4, with total earnings growth outside of Finance expected at +8.5%.
"
2172,ARNC,"Judging by what has happened over the past year or so, these Q4 estimates will come down as companies share their outlooks on the Q3 earnings calls. The market didn’t care much as estimates came down in the last few quarters, hoping for better times ahead. Will it do the same this time as well, pushing its hopes of earnings ramp up into 2014? We will find out the answer to that question over the next two months.Monday-9/16
"
2173,ARNC,"We will get the August Industrial Production index and capacity utilization numbers in the morning. The expectation is for +0.4% increase in IP and an uptick in utilization.

2175,ARNC,"The Fed’s two-day meeting gets underway today.
"
2176,ARNC,"August CPI and September homebuilder sentiment index will be coming out in the morning. The CPI reading is expected to remain benign and the homebuilder index is expected to remain unchanged from the prior month’s 59 reading. The recent spike in interest rates is a net negative for the housing sector and could show up in this reading.
"
2177,ARNC,"The Q3 earnings season gets underway today, with earnings reports from FactSet Research (FDS  -  Free Report) in the morning and Adobe Systems (ADBE  -  Free Report) after the close.Wednesday-9/18
"
2178,ARNC,"The big news of the day is whether the FOMC meeting will result in the ‘Taper’ announcement or not. Economic projections of FOMC members and the Bernanke press conference will be other key events of the day. But the Fed activities will take place in the afternoon.
"
2179,ARNC,"In the morning, we will get the August Housing Starts and Permits numbers, with expectations of gains on the Starts and a decline on the Permits fronts.
"
2180,ARNC,"FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report), General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report) and Cracker Barrel (CBRL  -  Free Report) will be the key Q3 earnings reports in the morning, while Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) will report after the close.Thursday -9/19

2185,ARNC,"A Brief Overview
"
2186,ARNC,"Metals, given their characteristics -- high strength, durability, conductivity and aesthetic appeal -- command a pivotal role in daily life and economic development. The global population growth, phenomenal rise in the Chinese economy, urbanization in the Asian countries and the increasing requirements in the developed countries have created an unprecedented demand for minerals and metals. The metals & mining industry caters to this ever-rising demand by extracting (mining) and through primary and secondary processing of these metals.
"
2187,ARNC,"The industry is oligarchic in structure, with certain producers accounting for a lion’s share of the output. The industry is highly cyclical and competitive. Metal producers are subject to cyclical fluctuations in prices, general economic conditions and end-user markets. However, the tepid global economic growth outlook has currently emerged as a major headwind for the global metal industry.
"
2188,ARNC,"With respect to volume, iron and steel command a majority in the global metal industry, followed by aluminum. We have thus divided the metal industry into two broad parts: ferrous and non-ferrous. Ferrous indicates the presence of iron and it includes steel, iron and alloys of iron. Non-ferrous indicate metals that do not contain an appreciable amount of iron. Popular non-ferrous metals include aluminum, copper, lead, nickel, tin, titanium and zinc, and alloys like brass.
"
2189,ARNC,"Let’s have a look at the ferrous and non-ferrous industry in detail, including driving factors, price dynamics, performance, outlook, etc.Mining - Ferrous: Iron & Steel
"
2190,ARNC,"The steel industry, as well as its provider of raw materials -- the iron ore and coal mining industries -- have historically been highly cyclical and are highly susceptible to general economic conditions. This is particularly due to the cyclical nature of its main customers: the automotive, construction, machinery and equipment industries.Iron Ore Price Trends
"
2191,ARNC,"The cost of iron ore is crucial for the global economy as it affects the price of steel and consequently changes the cost of everyday goods. It is also critical for the profitability of two of the world’s largest heavy industries: mining and steelmaking.
"
2192,ARNC,"In the first half of 2012, iron ore prices were more or less stable before plummeting to a three-year low of $88.50 per ton in September last year. The price was dragged down by low buying activity due to a weak economic environment. It recovered by the end of 2012 due to aggressive restocking driven by Chinese steel mills.
"
2193,ARNC,"In the first quarter of 2013, iron ore prices attained a high of $160 per ton, aided by strong steel production in China, seasonally weaker supply of the seaborne iron ore and increased demand growth from steel end-consumers, particularly the Chinese construction sector.
"
2194,ARNC,"However, iron ore prices remained volatile in the second quarter with an average price of $137.4 per ton in April, $124.7 per ton in May and then down to an average price of $114.5 per ton in June. The volatility owed much to the uncertain outlook for steel demand in China. Post-June, iron ore prices have trended higher as sentiment improved across the Chinese metals sector. Steelmakers were no longer destocking raw materials like iron ore, thus necessitating iron ore buying to meet the demand of the steel mills.Iron Ore Industry Performance So far
"
2195,ARNC,"Emergence of Chinese industrial demand has led to a paradigm shift in the iron ore market over the last two decades. China has become the largest producer of steel and consequently the largest consumer of iron ore, accounting for around 60% of the global seaborne market.
"
2196,ARNC,"Incidentally, global exporters of iron such as BHP Billiton Ltd (BHP  -  Free Report), Vale S.A. (VALE  -  Free Report) and Rio Tinto plc (RIO  -  Free Report), which together control 70% of total iron ore exports, largely benefited as China’s inland production failed to meet the burgeoning demand.
"
2197,ARNC,"Meanwhile, just as the iron ore and steel market recovered from the effects of recession in the second half of 2009 and through the first three quarters of 2011, the Euro-zone crisis and significant destocking caused demand to weaken again in the fourth quarter of 2011.
"
2198,ARNC,"In 2012, contraction in Europe and a slowdown in China dampened both iron and steel prices. In the first half of 2013, demand continued to be weak, particularly in Europe where demand plunged to about 30% below the 2007 peak.
"
2199,ARNC,"In 2012, demand in China weakened in response to policy tightening, mainly directed toward the real estate market. However, demand picked up thereafter from the fourth quarter of 2012 on the back of acceleration in infrastructure approvals, which has continued through the first half of 2013.Major Game-Changing Projects in the Iron Ore Industry
"
2200,ARNC,"BHP Billiton’s $3.4 billion project of Jimblebar Mine expansion in the Pilbara region in Western Australia is expected to augment its iron ore annual production capacity to 220 million tons. The mine will start producing in the fourth quarter of 2013, and help the company cash on the continued appetite for iron of countries like China.
"
2201,ARNC,"BHP’s rival Rio Tinto is investing heavily in growing iron ore output in the Pilbara region. Rio Tinto has embarked on a major port, rail and mine expansion, which is touted to be the largest integrated mining project in Australia and will up its annual capacity to 290 million tons. Rio Tinto has successfully loaded its first iron ore shipment from its expanded operations in Pilbara, ahead of schedule, marking the commencement of commissioning of the expansion program.
"
2202,ARNC,"Separately, Vale was recently granted an environmental license for its $20 billion investment, in new iron ore production capacity at its Carajas mining complex in northern Brazil. This will help Vale to scale up its iron ore production and will be the largest project in Vale’s history as well as in the iron ore industry. It is also considered to be a path-breaking project that will fully replace in-mine trucks with conveyor belts.Iron Industry: Outlook
"
2203,ARNC,"The industry has been affected by the falling iron ore prices. However, the companies have stayed afloat by reducing costs to maintain their margins in the falling commodity prices scenario. We see improved future prospects for the industry on the back of ongoing industrialization in China, India and in other developing economies.Steel Industry
"
2204,ARNC,"The steel industry is considered an economic indicator, as it plays a critical role in infrastructure and overall economic development.Steel Price Trends
"
2205,ARNC,"Steel prices have been on the decline in 2013 due to a glut in imports, oversupply in the market from zealous steelmakers, weak demand in Europe and slow growth in Asia. A sustained downside in steel prices will materially and adversely affect the margins of steel companies. We believe that the recovery in pricing momentum will be driven by a reviving economy, stabilization in the Euro-zone and a rebound in construction activity in the developing countries, particularly in China, India and South Korea.Challenges
"
2206,ARNC,"A lingering Euro-zone sovereign debt crisis, economic stagnation or slow growth in developed economies and a cooling of emerging market economies have taken a toll on the steel industry. Furthermore, overcapacity has been a perennial problem. Stiff competition in the United States from cheaper imports and from domestic producers with new or expanded facilities or under-utilized existing facilities continues to result in significant oversupply of steel compared to demand.Steel Industry: Outlook
"
2207,ARNC,"The World Steel Association projects global steel usage to rise 2.9% in 2013 to 1.454 Mt. In 2013, the steel industry will continue to face headwinds in the form of overcapacity and surge of imports. The steel companies are going through a restructuring process, which will have a positive impact on operations in the mid to long term. Some of the major industry trends are strategic cost reduction, vertical integration and capital optimization.
"
2208,ARNC,"Growth in the United States will be supported by strong momentum in the auto sector and recovery in construction markets. Concerns surrounding China’s growth and the European debt crisis remain overhangs on the sector’s outlook.
"
2209,ARNC,"The overall scenario is expected to improve in 2014 with global demand expected to increase 3.2% to a record 1,500 Mt. The increase will be driven by a further pickup in global steel demand as the developed economies increasingly contribute to growth.Mining - Non-Ferrous
"
2210,ARNC,"Aluminum
"
2211,ARNC,"Given its unique characteristics -- lightness, strength, flexibility, non-corrosive and infinitely recyclable -- aluminum is one of the most widely used metals. The world’s leading aluminum market is China, which accounts for over 40% of global aluminum consumption thanks to the rapid development and urbanization of China. Japan, Europe and the US are next in line in the aluminum market. Aluminum’s main markets are transportation, machinery and construction.About the Industry
"
2212,ARNC,"The aluminum industry is an extremely competitive and highly consolidated sector with 40% of global output commanded by the largest producers: Russia’s Rusal, Alcoa Inc. (AA), Aluminum Corporation of China Ltd  and Hydro Aluminum (part of the Norsk Hydro group).
"
2213,ARNC,"The demand for aluminum in developed countries stems from the rapidly growing auto market. A strong focus on environment and strict restrictions on carbon emissions prompt the automakers to increase the energy efficiency of the vehicles.
"
2214,ARNC,"Due to its lightness, aluminum makes cars more energy efficient, decreasing fuel consumption and cutting hazardous emissions. In developing countries, the construction industry is the biggest consumer of aluminum as these countries are expanding their infrastructure to satisfy the needs of a growing population.Performance
"
2215,ARNC,"Industry results suffered because of the decline in realized aluminum prices. Alcoa kicked off the second quarter earnings season with a revenue decline of 2%, affected by weak aluminum prices. Alcoa continued to see pricing pressure with London Metal Exchange (LME) cash price falling 8% sequentially in the reported quarter.Adaptive Measures to Combat Falling Prices
"
2216,ARNC,"Following the decline in aluminum prices, BHP had to sale its 33.3% stake in the Guinea Alumina joint venture to Dubai Aluminum and Abu Dhabi state-owned Mubadala. In 2012, it had halted bauxite exploration at its Boffa-Santou-Houda site in Guinea and abandoned plans to build a smelter in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
"
2217,ARNC,"Rio had earlier planned to sell its underperforming Pacific Aluminum, which has high-cost smelters in New Zealand and Australia and an alumina refinery. However, it had to abandon its plan after failing to find a buyer. Rio will incorporate Pacific Aluminum back under its larger aluminum umbrella, Rio Tinto Alcan group.
"
2218,ARNC,"Prices have been under pressure, prompting companies to cut back on production. Aluminum prices have fallen to four-year lows and the market continues to be uncertain and volatile. Rusal, the world’s largest aluminum producer, reported losses in the first half of 2013 and announced that it will further reduce production by 357,000 metric tons (mt) in 2013, or 9% compared with 2012. Rusal plans to accelerate aluminum output cuts in the second half. Rusal is also contemplating production halts at its least efficient smelters and cut down production at certain smelters in Siberia.
"
2219,ARNC,"Alcoa is aggressively slashing costs and pursuing strategies to move down its cost curves in its upstream businesses. The company remains committed to achieving its target of moving down the cost curve by 10 percentage points in smelting and by 7 percentage points in refining by 2015.
"
2220,ARNC,"In May, Alcoa announced its plans to curtail 460,000 mt over a 15-month period of smelting due to falling aluminum prices and maintain cost competitiveness. In line with this, Alcoa announced closures or curtailments representing 269,000 mt, which included the permanent closure of 105,000 mt of capacity at Alcoa’s Baie-Comeau smelter in Canada and its Fusina, Italy, smelter representing 44,000 mt that was not part of the May review. Recently, Alcoa announced that it will close or curtail 164,000 mt of smelting capacity in the United States and Brazil.Going Forward
"
2221,ARNC,"Energy prices and other input costs are expected to pose challenges for the aluminum industry. In addition to the curtailments, the companies will step up activities to reduce the escalating cost of raw materials.
"
2222,ARNC,"In the medium to long term, aluminum consumption is expected to improve on a global basis. The revival is palpable in the automotive and packaging industries, one of the key consumer markets. The automobile market is also becoming increasingly aluminum-intensive, benefiting from its recyclability and light-weight properties.
"
2223,ARNC,"The global push to improve fuel efficiency in vehicles is expected to more than double the demand for aluminum in the auto industry by 2025. Further, the surge in substitute metals such as copper and zinc has triggered a switch among manufacturers to aluminum. Automobiles, air conditioners and industrial components manufacturers are now shifting their focus to the more economical metal.
"
2224,ARNC,"To capitalize the growing aluminum demand for auto production, Alcoa recently broke ground on its $275 million expansion of Alcoa's Tennessee Operations. This marks Alcoa’s second automotive expansion to cater to the car makers. The previous one was a $300 million expansion of Alcoa's Davenport, IA plant that has already begun commissioning and is set to be completed by the end of 2013.
"
2225,ARNC,"We expect aluminum demand to increase over the next three years, outstripping supply growth. Following China, India also holds promise as its current low level of aluminum consumption and high urban population growth make a favorable combination. As a result, the aluminum market is likely to witness deficits for a prolonged period and creates the backdrop supportive of high alumina and aluminum prices.Copper
"
2226,ARNC,"Copper is a major industrial metal with its price strongly depending on the economic growth outlook. The metal’s strong cyclical leverage accounts for its nickname “Dr. Copper.” The metal’s popularity in industrial usage is due to its high ductility, malleability and thermal and electrical conductivity, along with its resistance to corrosion.
"
2227,ARNC,"In terms of consumption, copper holds the third place after iron and aluminum. Construction is the single largest market for copper, followed by electronics and electronic products, transportation, industrial machinery, and consumer and general products.Movement in Copper Prices
"
2228,ARNC,"Copper prices witnessed record high levels from 2006 through most of 2008 as limited supplies, growing demand from China and other emerging economies led to the surge in copper prices and low level of inventories. In Dec 2008, copper prices dipped to a low of $1.26 per pound due to reduced consumption, turbulence in the U.S. financial markets and concerns about the global economy.
"
2229,ARNC,"During 2012, LME spot copper prices ranged from a low of $3.29 per pound to a high of $3.93 per pound, which averaged $3.61 per pound, a 10% drop from 2011. This drop reflected concerns regarding a slowdown in the Chinese economy, Europe’s sovereign debt crisis and a slowing U.S. economy.
"
2230,ARNC,"During first-quarter 2013, LME spot copper prices ranged from $3.42 per pound to $3.74 per pound, averaging $3.60 per pound. During the second quarter 2013, LME spot copper prices ranged from a low of $3.01 per pound to a high of $3.42 per pound, averaging $3.24 per pound.Performance
"
2231,ARNC,"Lower prices hurt the results of copper producers like Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX  -  Free Report) and Southern Copper Corp. (SCCO  -  Free Report) and Newmont Mining Corporation (NEM  -  Free Report). Demand from key end-markets, including construction materials and electronics, remains weak due to the overall economic softness.Diverse Reactions
"
2232,ARNC,"In the wake of recent decline in metal prices, Freeport has reduced budgeted future capital expenditures, exploration and other costs by a total of $1.9 billion in 2013 and 2014.
"
2233,ARNC,"Freeport has recently taken a major step to venture into the U.S. energy space by wrapping up Plains Exploration & Production Company and McMoRan Exploration Co. for $19 billion as part of the company’s strategy to diversify from its bread-and-butter copper mining business. The merger positions the combined entity as a leading natural resource conglomerate in the U.S., leveraging Freeport’s industry-leading mineral assets and the oil and gas resources of Plains and McMoRan.
"
2234,ARNC,"On the contrary, banking on strong returns from the copper business, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto are jointly investing $3 billion in a sea desalination plant that will supply water to Chile’s Escondida copper mine. BHP, which has a 57.5% ownership in the mine, is investing $1.97 billion and Rio Tinto, which owns 30%, will contribute $1.03 billion. BHP Billiton expects global demand for copper to rise by 3% annually.Copper Industry: Outlook
"
2235,ARNC,"Notwithstanding the current volatility in prices, we have a long-term bullish stance on copper, supported by its widespread use, limited supplies from existing mines and the absence of significant new development projects. Prices will be influenced by demand from China and emerging markets, economic activity in the U.S. and other industrialized countries, the timing of new supplies of copper and production levels of mines and copper smelters.
"
2236,ARNC,"Companies that have a high leverage to copper prices will benefit immensely from the potential demand for the metal in the developing markets.Overall Industry Ranking

2237,ARNC,"Within the Zacks Industry classification, the industry is broadly grouped in the Basic Materials sector (one of 16 Zacks sectors) and is further sub-divided into three industries at the expanded level: Mining – Gold, Mining – Iron and Mining – Non-Ferrous. We rank all of 260 industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in each industry. This ranking is available in the Zacks Industry Rank page.
"
2238,ARNC,"The way to align the ranking and outlook from the complete list of Zacks Industry Rank for the 260+ industries is that the outlook for the top one-third of the list (Zacks Industry Rank of #87 and lower) is positive, while the outlook for the bottom one-third (Zacks Industry Rank #174 and higher) is negative.
"
2239,ARNC,"For the Mining Industry, Iron Mining barely makes into the top 1/3rd with its Zacks Industry Rank #81, while the Non-Ferrous (aluminum, copper, etc.) is barely in the bottom 1/3rd at Zacks Industry Rank with a Zacks rank of #222, respectively.
"
2240,ARNC,"The steel producers industry makes it to the bottom 1/3rd with a Zacks Industry Rank #174, followed by steel–pipe and tube industry producers with a Zacks Industry Rank #198. The steel specialty industry is near the bottom of the list with a Zacks Rank #244.
"
2241,ARNC,"This indicates that the overall outlook for the steel industry is on the ‘Negative’ side. Given the exact location of the three mining industries on the Zacks Industry Rank, one could say that the near-term outlook for the group depicts a Neutral outlook.
"
2242,ARNC,"Please note that the Zacks Rank for stocks, which are at the core of our Industry Outlook, has an impressive track record, verified by outside auditors, to foretell stock prices, particularly over the short term (1 to 3 months). The rank, along with Expected Surprise Prediction (ESP) (Read: Zacks Earnings ESP: A Better Way to Find Earnings Surprises) helps in predicting the probability of earnings surprises.Earnings Performance in 2Q13
"
2243,ARNC,"Looking at the overall results of the Basic Material Sector, earnings dipped 11.1% in the second quarter of 2013, deteriorating from the 1.8% decline in earnings witnessed in the first quarter of 2013. However, revenues for the sector went down 1.4% in the second quarter, faring better than the 2.1% decline in the first quarter.
"
2244,ARNC,"Second quarter earnings across all 16 sectors covered by Zacks increased 2.5% with the Finance sector being the only saving grace. Barring the finance sector, earnings dipped 2.9% with the Basic Material sector being one of the laggards. Nevertheless, the Basic Material sector had a beat ratio (percentage of companies coming out with positive surprises) of 56.5%, though lower than the 69.6% noted in the first quarter.
"
2245,ARNC,"The Basic Material sector has suffered given its heavy exposure to the negative cross-currents in the global economy, particularly the emerging markets. The weak global conditions are a deterrent factor for volumes and falling metal prices has dented the earnings for the companies.Expectations for 2013 & 2014
"
2246,ARNC,"The Basic Material sector is one of the sectors experiencing material negative estimate revisions, largely reflecting the overall negative tone of guidance provided by companies. However, the overall projection of a 3.0% dip in the third quarter paints a somewhat better picture when compared with the 11.1% drop experienced in the second quarter.
"
2247,ARNC,"The sector is expected to return to growth with a 12% increase in earnings. Revenues are expected to rise 1.5% in the third quarter and 2.1% in the fourth quarter.
"
2248,ARNC,"In the first quarter of 2014, the sector’s earnings are expected to rise 14.3% in the first quarter of 2014 despite a decline of 14.9% in revenues.Overall Industry Outlook
"
2249,ARNC,"Cost inflation in the sector is expected to be a headwind for metal and mining companies over the next several years, driven by a number of factors viz. labor, energy, ore grades, currencies, supply constraints and taxes. Global economic uncertainties, softening commodity prices, higher input costs are increasing the pressure on company margins.
"
2250,ARNC,"To combat this, mining and metals companies are reviewing their portfolios to identify underperforming assets and shut down or divest these high cost and non-core assets. Industry consolidation, automation technology, owner-operated mines and investment in energy assets are some of the steps that companies are taking to mitigate the impact of rising costs.
"
2251,ARNC,"Persistent recessionary conditions in Europe will have residual effects elsewhere. This synchronized global economic slowdown is the biggest headwind for the metals space at present. Thus, the long-term picture remains a lot more promising as growth in the emerging markets, particularly in China and India, will be a major driver of metals demand.
"
2252,ARNC,"Alcoa AA unofficially
"
2253,ARNC,"kicked off earnings season yesterday with a decent report.  The Aluminum giant actually came in line with
"
2254,ARNC,"the Zacks Consensus of 7 cents and came up slightly short on the revenue
"
2255,ARNC,"side.  The report was initially viewed
"
2256,ARNC,"with a positive light due to the increase in aluminum demand Alcoa was seeing. That said,
"
2257,ARNC,"shares of Alcoa moved lower today after investors had time to examine the details.It’s
"
2258,ARNC,"important to note that the earnings bar remains extremely low and has come down
"
2259,ARNC,"substantially over the last quarter from close to 4% year over year growth to
"
2260,ARNC,"now just 0.3%.Even with
"
2261,ARNC,"the low expectations, it will be challenging to find companies that beat earnings
"
2262,ARNC,"estimates especially being that revenues are down year over year and the global
"
2263,ARNC,"consumer is barely hanging on. One bright
"
2264,ARNC,"spot for growth may be the financial space; our Director of Research, Sheraz

"
2266,ARNC,"The three financial stocks below all have increased probability of a

"
2272,ARNC,"Earnings ESP is Zacks’ proprietary methodology for determining which stocks
"
2273,ARNC,"have the best chance to surprise with their next earnings announcement. The
"
2274,ARNC,"Earnings ESP shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate Estimate
"
2275,ARNC,"and the Consensus. The Zacks ESP helps predict earnings surprises to the upside
"
2276,ARNC,"and downside; the greater the ESP (positive or negative) the greater the
"
2277,ARNC,"likelihood for a surprise. I use ESP to help quantify the conviction of the
"
2278,ARNC,"analysts for a surprise and stack the odds in my favor when I combine it with
"
2279,ARNC,"other measurements and statistics. The
"
2280,ARNC,"Accuracy of ESP
"
2281,ARNC,"Of course, some ESP numbers are better than others. In our testing, over the
"
2282,ARNC,"last 10 years, we have found that stocks with a positive ESP and with a Zacks
"
2283,ARNC,"Rank of 1, 2 or 3 (Strong Buy, Buy or Hold), produced a positive surprise 70%
"
2284,ARNC,"of the time.  (The other 9% of the time, they reported in line with
"
2285,ARNC,"expectations, with a negative surprise occurring only 21% of the time.)Bullish

"
2323,ARNC,"of a positive surprise, let’s look at the size of the ESP that has historically
"
2324,ARNC,"generated the best results.First, just having a positive ESP
"
2325,ARNC,"produces market beating results. Over the last 10 years, using a 1 week holding
"
2326,ARNC,"period (stocks were held for no more than one week after they reported), the
"
2327,ARNC,"average annual return was 23.5%. This is in stark contrast to stocks with a
"
2328,ARNC,"negative ESP which produced a -9.20% return.Now apply the Zacks Rank of 1, 2 or
"
2329,ARNC,"3 to that list and the returns jump to 28.3%.If you require your stocks to have
"
2330,ARNC,"an ESP of greater than 1%, we found it increased performance to 29.6%. An ESP
"
2331,ARNC,"of greater than 2% bumps performance up to 31.6%. While an ESP of greater than
"
2332,ARNC,"3%, produces an average annual return of 37.2%.Note: there’s no need to hold out
"
2333,ARNC,"for stocks with significantly higher ESP’s than 3%. While some stocks with
"
2334,ARNC,"higher ESP’s will do fantastic, there’s no aggregate increase in performance by
"
2335,ARNC,"ratcheting it up beyond d the 3% threshold. And as the above stats illustrate,
"
2336,ARNC,"simply having a positive ESP (i.e., the Most Accurate Estimate is above the

2350,ARNC,"The June jobs report has put the spotlight back on the Fed and what it will do to the QE program in the coming months. But hopefully the Q2 earnings season will provide enough of a distraction to not let the Fed become a full-time fixation for the market.
"
2351,ARNC,"Given how low expectations have come down over the last few months, the Q2 reporting season may not carry many surprises. In fact, it may be reasonable to expect this earnings season to be no different from what we have become accustomed to seeing over the last few quarters. But two aspects of this coming earnings season need paying special attention to – revenues and guidance.
"
2352,ARNC,"Management teams are typically very good at under-promising and over-delivering. That’s why roughly two-thirds of the companies end up beating earnings expectations. But an unusually big proportion of the companies came short of revenue expectations in the previous quarter. The situation has not been much different from the 23 S&P 500 companies that have reported results already, which includes companies like Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report), Walgreen (WAG) and others. As such, more than earnings surprises, it will be interesting to keep an eye on revenue surprises.
"
2353,ARNC,"But even more significant than growth rates and surprises will be guidance. Guidance is always important, but it has assumed even more significance this time around given the elevated expectations for the second half of the year, as the chart below shows.
"
2354,ARNC," Source: Zacks Data
"
2355,ARNC,"We may not see much earnings growth in the first half of 2013, but consensus expectations are for a material growth ramp up in the back half of the year – from +2.7% in the first half to +9.2% in the second half.
"
2356,ARNC,"Importantly, the growth expectations for the second half of the year are not due to easy comparisons – the level of total earnings expected in 2013 Q3 and Q4 represent new all-time high quarterly records, as shown by the chart below of total bottom-up consensus earnings estimates.
"
2357,ARNC," Source: Zacks Data
"
2358,ARNC,"My sense is that estimates need to come down in a big way. The market hasn’t cared much in the recent past about negative revisions as aggregate earnings estimates have been coming down for over a year now. But if we are entering a post-QE world, as I believe we are, then it will likely be difficult to overlook negative earnings estimate revisions going forward. How the market responds to negative guidance over and the resulting negative revisions will tell us a lot about what to expect going forward.Key Points
"
2359,ARNC,"Total earnings for the 23 S&P 500 companies that have reported results already are up +8.1%, with 60.9% of this small sample beating earnings expectations. Revenues for these companies are up +5.3%, with a revenue ‘beat ratio’ of 43.5%.  
"
2360,ARNC,"Overall expectations remain low, with total earnings for the S&P companies as a whole expected to be up +0.4% from the same period last year, reflecting -0.8% lower revenues and modestly higher margins. This follows +2.6% earnings growth in Q1 on -1.3% lower revenues.
"
2361,ARNC,"Estimates for Q2 have come down materially since the quarter got underway, with the current +0.4% growth down from +3.9% in early April.
"
2362,ARNC,"Finance is the only major sector with a strong growth profile, with total earnings for the sector expected to be up +18.6% in Q2. This follows +7.6% earnings growth in Q1 and many quarters of double-digit gains for the sector. Excluding Finance, total earnings would be down -3.2% in Q2.
"
2363,ARNC,"Finance reclaims its leadership role in the S&P 500, contributing more earnings to the index’s total than Technology this year for the first time since the 2008 crisis. The sector is expected to account for 19.2% of total S&P 500 earnings in 2013 compared to Technology’s 18%.   
"
2364,ARNC,"Technology earnings were weak in Q1 and they are even weaker this time around, with total earnings for the sector expected to decline -8.3% in Q2 after declining -4.2% in Q1. Weakness in hardware and semi-conductor industries more than offset the modest growth in software earnings. Excluding Technology, total earnings for the S&P 500 would be up +2.4% in Q2.
"
2365,ARNC,"Estimate revisions remain in neutral territory at present, though Finance continues to experience strong positive revisions, while revisions for Basic Materials, Industrials, Staples, and Business Services predominantly to the downside.
"
2366,ARNC,"Estimates for the second half of the year still reflect strong growth, with total earnings in the second half expected to increase by +9.2% after the +2.7% increase in the first half. Total earnings are expected to be up 6.4% in 2013 and +11.5% in 2014.
"
2367,ARNC,"While there is not much growth, the overall level of total earnings is quite high. Total earnings were an all-time record at $252.6 billion in Q1 and are expected to total $250.3 billion in Q2. For the full year, earnings are expected total $1.03 trillion in 2013 and $1.15 trillion in 2014.   
"
2368,ARNC,"Net margins are expected to be up 20 basis points in Q2 as a whole and stay flat outside of the Finance sector. But expectations are for net margins to start expanding materially from the third quarter onwards. For the full year 2013, net margins are expected to top the 2006 peak and expand even further in 2014.
"
2369,ARNC,"The bottom-up ‘EPS’ for the S&P 500 for 2013 and 2014 currently stands at $109.18 and $121.72, respectively. The top-down ‘EPS’ estimates for 2013 and 2014 currently stand at $107.83 and $114.80. (Note: All the data in this report is based on bottom-up estimates).

"
2392,ARNC,"Market anxieties about the future of the Fed’s QE program have eased a bit after clarifications from Fed officials that no imminent tapering decision was in the cards. Bernanke was fairly explicit in his guidance on the issue, but the bond market’s reaction appears to have forced the Fed into retreat. At least that’s how some of us are seeing the pronouncements from Fed officials in recent days. Did the Bond Market Stare Down the Fed?
"
2393,ARNC,"The Fed will remain in the spotlight this holiday-shortened week, with investors evaluating each of the week’s top-tier economic reports from the Fed’s perspective. The most important report doesn’t arrive till after the July 4th holiday, when June non-farm payrolls come out on Friday. Other major reports include the two ISM surveys, the ADP jobs report, motor vehicle sales, and construction spending.
"
2394,ARNC,"Earnings wouldn’t be the focus this week, with Constellation Brands (STZ  -  Free Report) as the notable report coming out. But the earnings reporting cycle is about to take the spotlight with Alcoa’s (AA) release on July 8th. The Q2 earnings season has already gotten underway, with results from Nike (NKE  -  Free Report), Accenture (ACN), Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) and others.
"
2395,ARNC,"Accenture’s weak guidance reconfirms what we saw in the recent Oracle report about macro issues weighing on corporate spending outlook. Importantly, it puts us on notice about what to expect from IBM (IBM  -  Free Report) and others in the coming days.
"
2396,ARNC,"As has become customary at the start of recent quarterly earnings cycles, expectations for the Q2 earnings season remain quite low. A major driver of these low expectations is company guidance during the Q1 earnings season, which was overwhelmingly on the negative side. Total earnings for companies in the S&P 500 are expected to be down -0.3% from the same period last year on -0.5% lower revenues and almost flat margins. This is sharply down from +3.9% growth expected in the quarter in early April.
"
2397,ARNC,"Nine of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to show negative earnings growth in Q2. But the growth picture in Q2 is even more underwhelming when Finance is excluded from the data. Outside of Finance, total earnings for the S&P 500 would be down -4.3%. Total earnings were up +2.4% in Q1, but growth was expected to be in negative territory at this stage before that reporting season.Finance to the Rescue

2398,ARNC,"Finance wasn’t a big driver of aggregate earnings growth for the S&P 500 in Q1, but takes back the lead role in Q2, with total earnings for the sector expected to be up +19.5% and estimates for the group are steadily going up. Earnings for the sector were up +7.7% in Q1, which came after many quarters of double-digit growth.
"
2399,ARNC,"All the industries within the Finance sector like the major banks, regional banks, brokers and insurers are expected to have positive growth. But the growth picture is particularly notable for the brokerage and investment management industry players like Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), with total earnings for the group expected to be up +38.7% in Q2 after the +2.6% gain in Q1.
"
2400,ARNC,"Unlike Finance, the earnings picture for the Technology sector remains fairly weak. Total earnings for the sector are expected to be down -11.8% from the same period last year, which follows the -4.4% earnings decline in Q1. Earnings estimates for the sector have been steadily coming down as the quarter progressed, with the current -11.8% decline down from the expected decline of -3.1% in mid-April.
"
2401,ARNC,"The weakest group within the Technology sector is the PC makers, with total earnings for the Computers and Office Equipment industry expected to be down -16.1% in Q2 after the -14.1% decline in Q1. Semiconductors and electronics are other Tech industries with negative earnings growth in the quarter, while the software group is expected to show modest positive growth.High Expectations for Second Half & Next Year
"
2402,ARNC,"Expectations for total earnings in 2013 have come down as estimates for Q2 were revised lower, though estimates for the second half of the year and full-year 2014 have held up fairly well. The +6% growth in total earnings this year, down from +6.8% in early April, reflects a material ramp up in the second half of the year that is then expected to carry into 2014.
"
2403,ARNC,"Combining the actual results for Q1 with estimates for Q2 gives us +1.1% year-over-year growth in total earnings in the first half of 2013. But total earnings are expected to be up +9.6% in the second half of the year and a further +11.5% in full-year 2014.
"
2404,ARNC,"Total earnings for companies in the S&P 500 in Q2 are expected to remain below Q1’s record level. By our calculation, aggregate bottom-up earnings in Q2 will total $246.6 billion, compared to $247.4 billion in 2012 Q2 and 2013 Q1’s record of $253 billion. The Finance sector will generate $48.9 billion or 19.8% of the S&P 500’s total Q2 earnings, while the Tech sector is expected to generate $41.2 billion or 16.7% of the index’s total earnings.
"
2405,ARNC,"Finance is reclaiming its dominant earnings position in the index which was taken over by the Tech sector following the 2008 crash. Tech remained the biggest earnings producer for the S&P 500 from 2008 through 2012, but the leadership role moves back to Finance this year.
"
2406,ARNC,"Finance is on track to produce $198.5 billion in 2013 (19.3% of the total), up from $173.6 billion in 2012 (17.9% of the total), while Tech is expected to produce $183 billion this year (17.8% of the total), up from $182.9 billion in 2012 (18.9% of the total).
"
2407,ARNC,"For more details about the Q2 earnings expectations, please read our Earnings Trends: Q2 Earnings Expectations Remain LowTrends in Estimate Revisions
"
2408,ARNC,"The revisions trend appears to have lost some ground in the last few weeks, though it still remains in neutral territory as the charts below show. The key metric in all the charts is the ‘revisions ratio’, which is the ratio of total number of upward revisions over the preceding four weeks to the total number of revisions (positive and negative) over that same period.
"
2409,ARNC,"We have two charts each for 2013 and 2014. The bar charts show the current state of the ‘revisions ratio’ (as of 6/21/13), while the line charts plot the ratio’s trajectory over the preceding 24 months. As you can see below, the revisions ratio for 2013 dropped to 46% from the prior week’s 49% level, while the same for 2014 dropped to 49% from 51% the week before.
"
2410,ARNC,"The ratio doesn’t tell you the ‘magnitude’ of the revisions, only the direction. The ‘50%’ level (the dark line) is the dividing line between positive and negative trends, with readings above 50% implying more positive than negative revisions. That said, our analysis shows that readings between 45% and 55% don’t offer material insights into the magnitude of revisions. It is only readings above 55% and below 45% that offer bullish and bearish signals about the magnitude of earnings revisions.
"
2411,ARNC,"As you can see in the charts above, the revisions trend for the S&P 500 as a whole is still in neutral territory, the current level (46% for 2013) is down from three weeks back (56% at the end of May). Finance has been in bullish trend for weeks now, but the revisions trend for the Tech sector also seems to be moving in that direction now.
"
2412,ARNC,"Hard to tell how sustainable the trend will prove to be, but the sector’s revisions ratio for 2013 currently (as of 6/21) stands at 56.8%, down from the prior week’s level, but still the highest level in over 12 months. Some of the stand-out revisions in the sector were industry players like Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report). Salesforce.com (CRM) is the only Tech sector firm that has suffered material negative revisions lately.  
"
2413,ARNC,"Finance continues to be in bullish territory for both this year and next (the blue line) even though the revisions ratio has come down lately. The sector’s revisions ratio currently (as of 6/21) stands at 69% for 2013 (down from 72% the week before) and 73% for 2014 (down from 74%), signaling good times ahead for the sector.
"
2414,ARNC,"The trend makes perfect sense as higher interest rates may be a hindrance for other industries, but they are beneficial for the Finance sector’s earnings. Flat net-interest margins have been a permanent feature of the sector’s, particularly banking’s, earnings picture in recent quarters. The Finance sector’s positive earnings outlook is a function of the rising trend in interest rates.
"
2415,ARNC,"On the negative side, the revisions trend is decidedly in bearish territory for Industrials and Basic Materials both for this year and next. Peabody Energy (BTU), U.S. Steel (X  -  Free Report), Joy Global (JOY), Freeport-McMoran (FCX  -  Free Report) have all suffered significant negative estimate revisions lately.
"
2416,ARNC,"The market was looking for clarity from the Fed about the future of the QE program. But it didn’t like the surprisingly explicit timeline from Chairman Bernanke, and has been in a somewhat downbeat mood ever since.
"
2417,ARNC,"The after-effects of the Bernanke announcement and the resultant impact on benchmark interest rates will no doubt remain the big issues for the market this week as well, but we are also getting close to the start of the Q2 earnings season. In fact, the Q2 earnings season actually got underway last week with the earning releases from FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report), Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), Adobe (ADBE), Darden (DRI  -  Free Report) and others.
"
2418,ARNC,"It hasn’t been a very inspiring start thus far, but all of these companies have been grappling with lingering issues affecting their businesses for awhile and their Q2 reports didn’t indicate that they had finally turned the corner. We will see if this week’s reports from the likes of Walgreen (WAG), ConAgra (CAG  -  Free Report), Lennar (LEN  -  Free Report), Paychex (PAYX  -  Free Report) and others will show a more promising side of the earnings picture. But we will likely have to wait a bit longer for the reporting season to get really high gear -- Alcoa’s (AA) report is coming on July 8th.
"
2419,ARNC,"As has become customary at the start of recent quarterly earnings cycles, expectations for the Q2 earnings season remain quite low. A major driver of these low expectations is company guidance during the Q1 earnings season, which was overwhelmingly on the negative side. Total earnings for companies in the S&P 500 are expected to be up only +0.5% from the same period last year.
"
2420,ARNC,"This is sharply down from +3.9% growth expected in the quarter in early April. Total earnings were up +2.3% in Q1, but growth was expected to be in negative territory at this stage before that reporting season.
"
2421,ARNC,"Finance wasn’t a big driver of aggregate earnings growth for the S&P 500 in Q1, but takes back the lead role in Q2, with total earnings for the sector expected to be up +19.6% and estimates for the group are steadily going up. Earnings for the sector were up +7.7% in Q1, which came after many quarters of double-digit growth.

2422,ARNC,"All the industries within the Finance sector -- major banks, regional banks, brokers and insurers -- are expected to have positive growth. But the growth picture is particularly notable for the brokerage and investment management industry players like Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), with total earnings for the group expected to be up +39.6% in Q2 after the +2.6% gain in Q1.
"
2423,ARNC,"Unlike Finance, the earnings picture for the Technology sector remains fairly weak. Total earnings for the sector are expected to be down -8.7% from the same period last year, which follows the -3.8% earnings decline in Q1. Earnings estimates for the sector have been steadily coming down over recent weeks, with the current -8.7% decline down from expected decline of -3.1% in mid-April.
"
2424,ARNC,"The weakest group within the Technology sector is the PC makers, with total earnings for the Computers and Office Equipment industry expected to be down -16.1% in Q2 after the -14.1% decline in Q1. Semiconductors and electronics are other Tech industries with negative earnings growth in the quarter.
"
2425,ARNC,"Expectations for full-years 2013 and 2014 have come down far less than what we have seen for Q2 estimates. In fact, it is reasonable to assume that given the improving outlook for the Finance sector, aggregate estimates will start rising after a very long time in the coming weeks.
"
2426,ARNC,"The +6.1% growth in total earnings this year, down from +6.8% in early April, reflects a material ramp up in the second half of the year that is then expected to carry into 2014. Combining the actual results for Q1 with estimates for Q2 gives us +1.5% year-over-year growth in total earnings in the first half of 2013. But total earnings are expected to be up +9.4% in the second half of the year and a further +11.5% in full-year 2014.
"
2427,ARNC,"Total earnings for companies in the S&P 500 in Q2 are expected to remain to below Q1’s record level. By our calculation, aggregate bottom-up earnings in Q2 will total $246.8 billion, compared to $245.6 billion in 2012 Q2 and 2013 Q1’s record of $253.9 billion. The Finance sector will generate $49 billion or 19.8% of the S&P 500’s total Q2 earnings, while the Tech sector is expected to generate $41.5 billion or 16.7% of the index’s total earnings.
"
2428,ARNC,"Finance is reclaiming its dominant earnings position in the index which was taken over by the Tech sector following the 2008 crash. Tech remained the biggest earnings producer for the S&P 500 from 2008 through 2012, but the leadership role moves back to Finance this year. Finance is on track to produce $198.5 billion in 2013 (19.3% of the total), up from $173.6 billion in 2012 (17.9% of the total), while Tech is expected to produce $183.1 billion this year (17.8% of the total), up from $182.9 billion in 2012 (18.9% of the total).Trends in Estimate Revisions

"
2433,ARNC,"Hard to tell how sustainable the trend will prove to be, but the sector’s revisions ratio for 2013 currently (as of 6/14) stands at 59.6%, the highest level in over 12 months. Some of the stand-out revisions in the sector were industry players like Motorola Solutions (MSI  -  Free Report), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and NetApp (NTAP).
"
2434,ARNC,"Finance continues to be in bullish territory for both this year and next (the blue line). The sector’s revisions ratio currently (as of 6/14) stands at 72% for 2013 and 74% for 2014, signaling good times ahead for the sector.

Peabody Energy (BTU), U.S. Steel (X  -  Free Report), Joy Global (JOY), Freeport-McMoran (FCX  -  Free Report) have all suffered significant negative estimate revisions lately.
"
2437,ARNC,"Fed aside, we have a bunch of housing related data on deck this week, including Housing Starts and Existing Home Sales data. We will also have the Empire State and Philly Fed regional manufacturing surveys and the May CPI numbers this week. But everyone will be looking ahead to the Bernanke press conference on Wednesday afternoon.
"
2438,ARNC,"The market’s focus is justifiably on the Fed this week given the buzz surrounding the ‘Taper’ talk. I don’t expect a categorical statement out of the FOMC on Wednesday, but it would not be unreasonable to expect Bernanke to provide more clarity on his thinking on the QE question in the post-meeting press conference that day.
"
2439,ARNC,"The Fed will no doubt be the big subject this week, but we are getting close to the start of the Q2 earnings season as well. In fact, Q2 earnings season will actually get underway this week with the earning release from such bellwethers as FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) on Wednesday and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) on Thursday.Alcoa (AA) typically gets credited for kicking off each earnings season, but we don’t count Alcoa’s report as the ‘official’ start. In fairness to Alcoa, investors start taking notice of the earnings season only with their release, which for Q2 will happen on July 8th.
"
2440,ARNC,"As has been the case at the start of recent quarterly earnings cycles, expectations for Q2 earnings season remain quite low. Total earnings for companies in the S&P 500 are expected to be up only +0.6% from the same period last year. This is down from +3.9% growth expected in the quarter in early April. Total earnings were up +2.3% in Q1, but the expectation ahead of the start of the Q1 earnings season was for earnings growth to be in the negative territory.

But the trend in the Finance sector continues to be in bullish territory for both this year and next (the blue line). The sector’s revisions ratio currently (as of 6/7) stands at 69% for 2013 and 73% for 2014, modestly down from two weeks back, but nevertheless signaling good times ahead for the sector.

2451,ARNC,"The trend makes perfect sense as higher interest rates may be a hindrance for other industries, but it’s beneficial for the Finance sector’s earnings. Flat net-interest margins have been a permanent feature of the sector’s, particularly banking’s, earnings picture in recent quarters. The charts also show the trend in the Technology sector, the largest in the S&P 500, to spotlight Finance’s improving outlook.
"
2452,ARNC,"The Finance sector’s positive earnings outlook is a function of the rising trend in interest rates. But whether that trend continues or reverses course in the coming days will depend to a large extent on what the Fed does this week. The consensus view is that the Fed may not do anything material in this week’s statement, but Bernanke may shed more light on the prevailing mood within the FOMC at his post-meeting press event.
"
2453,ARNC,"Fed aside, we have a bunch of housing-related data on deck this week, including Housing Starts and Existing Home Sales data. We will also have the Empire State and Philly Fed regional manufacturing surveys and the May CPI numbers this week.

"
2454,ARNC,"(We are reissuing this article to correct a mistake. The original article, issued Friday, Jaune 14, 2013, should no longer be relied upon.)
"
2455,ARNC,"A minor cottage industry of sorts springs into action around this time every quarter to prove that Alcoa’s (AA) results tell us something about how other companies’ results will be in the earnings season. Take all of those comments with a spoonful of salt. Yes, demand for aluminum products now comes from a variety of industries like automotives and aerospace and other. But to claim that Alcoa’s fortunes carry any relevance beyond the mining or even basic materials space is simply misleading.  
"
2456,ARNC,"As such, Alcoa’s strong earnings beat after the close yesterday is relevant only to itself and its own industry – it doesn’t tell us much beyond that. If anything, the earnings reports from FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) that came out before Alcoa carry a lot more informational value about broader earnings picture.  
"
2457,ARNC,"So what should we be looking for this earnings season?  
"
2458,ARNC,"Expectations for Q1 remain low. Total earnings are expected to be down -2.6% from the same period last year. Tough comparisons and weak guidance account for the mediocre growth expectations (2012 Q1 produced the highest quarterly earnings total since the current earnings cycle started in 2009). But since roughly two-thirds of the companies typically beat expectations in a typical quarter, the final earnings growth tall will likely be better than current expectations. My sense is that if Q1 is like any other quarter, then we will see a growth rate close to the flat line – meaning essentially no growth.  
"
2459,ARNC,"What would matter much more than the proportion and level of ‘beats’ will be guidance. And the reason for that is that expectations for the coming quarters, particularly the second half of the year, remain high. Current consensus expectations are for total earnings to be up +2.3% in the second quarter and up +10.9% in the second half of the year. Guidance will determine whether those expectations will hold up or not. My sense is that they wouldn’t hold up and estimates for Q2 will start coming down as the Q1 earnings season gets into high gear.  
"
2460,ARNC,"With economic data already showing signs of renewed weakness, it will be hard for the market to hold its ground in such an earnings background. This is pointing to tougher times for the market in the Spring/Summer day.

2463,ARNC,"A Brief Overview
"
2464,ARNC,"The Metals & Mining industry broadly refers to metals and minerals extraction (mining) and the primary and secondary processing of these metals and minerals. The industry is oligarchic in structure, with a few producers accounting for a lion’s share of the output.
"
2465,ARNC,"With respect to volume, iron and steel commands a majority in the global metal industry, followed by aluminum. The iron and steel industry includes metal ore exploration and mining services as well as iron and steel foundries for smelting, rolling, forging, spinning, recycling, stamping, polishing and plating of iron and steel products.
"
2466,ARNC,"The precious metal and minerals industry comprise companies engaged in the extraction and primary processing of gold, silver, platinum, diamond, semi-precious stones, uranium and other rare minerals and ores as well as cultivation of pearls.
"
2467,ARNC,"The industry is highly cyclical and competitive. Historically, it has suffered from oversupply (excess of supply over demand). Metal producers are subject to cyclical fluctuations in prices, general economic conditions and end-user markets. The tepid global economic growth outlook has emerged as a major headwind for the global metal industry. Notwithstanding these near-term challenges, the group’s long-term dynamics appear attractive.
"
2468,ARNC,"Within the Zacks Industry classification, the industry is broadly grouped in the Basic Materials sector (one of 16 Zacks sectors) and is further sub-divided into three industries at the expanded level: Mining – Gold, Mining – Iron and Mining – Non-Ferrous. All the industries within the Basic Materials sector like chemicals, paper, steel and mining are economically sensitive, but the level of sensitivity and exposure to different stages of the economic cycle vary for each industry.
"
2469,ARNC,"We rank all of the more than 250 industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in each industry. This ranking is available in the Zacks Industry Rank https://www.zacks.com/rank/industry.php.
"
2470,ARNC,"The way to look at the complete list of Zacks Industry Rank for the 250+ companies is that the outlook for the top one-third of the list (Zacks Industry Rank of #85 and lower) is positive, while the outlook for the bottom one-third (Zacks Industry Rank #170 and higher) is negative.
"
2471,ARNC,"For the Mining Industry, Iron Mining barely makes into the top 1/3rd with its Zacks Industry Rank #77, while the Non-Ferrous (aluminum, copper, etc.) and Gold Mining industries are barely in the bottom 1/3rd at Zacks Industry Rank of #187 and #182, respectively. The exact location of the three mining industries on the Zacks Industry Rank aside, one could safely say that the near-term outlook for the group is leaning towards a Neutral outlook.A Detailed Look into Metals: Performance and Outlook
"
2472,ARNC,"Steel
"
2473,ARNC,"The steel industry has steadily recovered from the impact of the global economic downturn, which slashed crude steel production by 9% in 2009. According to the World Steel Association, world crude steel production was a record 1,548 Mt in 2012, outperforming the record set in 2011 by 1.2%. Significant growth in Asia and North America were instrumental for the annual upside, marred somewhat by declines in Europe and South America.
"
2474,ARNC,"During 2012, production in Asia improved 2.7% to 1,012 Mt. China emerged as the leading steel producing country once again, up 3.1% year over year and yielding almost 46% of the global output. Production in Japan, the second largest producer, remained flat year over year. The United States held the third position, producing 88.6 Mt of crude steel, up 2.5% annually and accounting for 6% of the total global output. Production in Europe and South America were a dampener, declining 2.7% and 3.1%, respectively.
"
2475,ARNC,"Let’s have a look at the performance and outlook of the end markets for the industry:
"
2476,ARNC,"The automotive and construction markets have historically been the largest consumers of steel. The automotive sector has been promising in recent times. Auto sales in the U.S. surged 13% to 14.5 million vehicles in Dec 2012, the highest volume attained in the last five years. The seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) in December was 15.4 million vehicles, the second straight month of above 15 million SAAR in 2012. This performance will likely generate solid momentum going into 2013.
"
2477,ARNC,"The robust growth rate in the sector has been fueled by strong pent-up demand, cheap financing, launch of several redesigned and fuel-efficient vehicles and rebound in consumer confidence thanks to a growing belief that the housing market is recovering.
"
2478,ARNC,"Another major market, the construction sector, has so far been a drag on the steel companies’ earnings. However, in 2012, the sector finally started picking up began signaling a recovery evidenced by solid growth in the major indicators.
"
2479,ARNC,"The architecture billing index (ABI), an economic indicator that provides an approximate nine- to twelve-month glimpse into the future of non-residential construction spending activity, climbed back into the positive territory with a score of 50.2 in August after languishing in the negative territory for five consecutive months. Any score above 50 indicates an increase in billings and the score has remained stable till December.
"
2480,ARNC,"The ABI readings in the fourth quarter of 2012, in fact, exhibited the strongest growth since the downturn in early 2008. This momentum is expected to persist and conditions are expected improve, albeit at a slow and steady rate.
"
2481,ARNC,"The American Institute of Architects projects a 5% increase in spending in 2013 for non-residential construction projects, on the back of higher construction of commercial facilities, particularly for hotels followed by industrial construction spending. The spending is expected to shore up to 7.2% in 2014.
"
2482,ARNC,"Meanwhile, the residential housing sector is also showing signs of positive growth with figures at highest levels in more than four years. In 2012, housing starts totaled 780,000, surging 28% from 2011 and housing permits (an indicator of future demand) escalated 30% to 813,000. Both attained their respective highest level since 2008. Housing completions rose 11% to 651,000 in 2012, the highest level since 2010.
"
2483,ARNC,"According to the most recent most issued data, in December housing starts spiked 37% year over year to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 954,000. Building permits were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 903,000, 29% higher than the year-ago figure.
"
2484,ARNC,"In a nutshell, record-low mortgage rates, rising rents and reduced prices of properties are luring buyers. These figures reinforce the belief that U.S. residential construction is finally stabilizing and is on the road to a much awaited recovery.
"
2485,ARNC,"Analyzing the fourth quarter results of the major steel companies in our coverage -- ArcelorMittal (MT  -  Free Report), United States Steel (X  -  Free Report), Nucor (NUE  -  Free Report) and AK Steel (AKS) -- we see revenues were marred by the drop in average steel prices. This does not come as a surprise as oversupply in the U.S. steel industry and increased steel imports in the domestic market affected steel prices, which in turn hurt margins and profits of the steel players. Furthermore, the gloomy macroeconomic condition in Europe is another area of concern as it is the largest market for total U.S. exports.
"
2486,ARNC,"Given the scenario in Europe, ArcelorMittal, the world's largest steelmaker in terms of volume and Europe’s largest steelmaker, recently announced its plans to permanently close its plant in Liege, Belgium owing to the slack demand and weakening European economy. The company also announced the idling of its liquid phase in Oct 2011 due to structural over-capacity in Northern Europe. The production halt at the Liege plant was done to better focus on the company’s downstream activities, operating five core lines and seven flexible lines.
"
2487,ARNC,"However, economic conditions worsened since then and demand for steel in Europe declined another 8%-9% in 2012 and is currently 29% below the pre-crisis levels. The Leige business is heavily dependent on the automotive sector, which faced a major downturn in 2012. Consequently, tepid demand also had a hand in idling of the facility and ArcelorMittal further stated that it will close six production lines at Liege that manufacture finished steel products for the auto industry. It is also closing a coke plant, which produces fuel for blast furnaces.
"
2488,ARNC,"Going into 2013, steelmakers expect profits to be affected by continued increase in steel imports, volatility in steel pricing along with macroeconomic uncertainty stemming from the recessionary conditions in Europe and sluggish growth in the emerging markets.
"
2489,ARNC,"However, the sector will benefit from the strong momentum in the automotive markets. The outlook for other key markets -- transportation, energy, industrial and agricultural sectors also remains favorable. The turnaround in the so-far faltering construction sector will definitely provide a much-needed impetus to the sector.
"
2490,ARNC,"Steelmakers are increasing their consolidation efforts, particularly in China and India, to derive economies of scale and other synergies to remain competitive. A major development in this sector was the recent merger of Japan's largest and the world's sixth-largest steel maker Nippon Steel Corporation with Sumitomo Metal Industries to form the world’s second biggest steel firm -- Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corporation . With a combined capacity of 46.1 million tons, it has replaced China's Hebei Group in the second position, with production of 44.4 million tons. The merger is targeted to generate savings in the face of increasingly intense global competition.
"
2491,ARNC,"China’s recent attempt to bolster its economy by approving 60 infrastructure projects worth more than $150 billion will help bolster the steel sector. Prices could potentially stabilize on the back of a rebound in construction activity in the developing countries, in particular China, India and South Korea. Furthermore, the sector will reap the benefits of the Federal Reserve’s move to boost the U.S economy. However, the European debt crisis and its potential global impact remain headwinds for the industry.Gold
"
2492,ARNC,"As per the World Gold Council, 2011 was a milestone year for gold as global demand for the yellow metal scaled up 0.4% to 4,067.1 tons at an estimated value of $205.5 billion -- the highest tonnage level with a value exceeding $200 billion since 1997. The increase was mainly driven by the investment sector, particularly in India, China and Europe.
"
2493,ARNC,"As per the most recent data available, gold demand stood at 1084.6 tons in third quarter 2012, down 11% from the historic high level in the third quarter of 2011. Strong ETF inflow and higher demand from central banks was offset by declines in demand for jewelry, investment and in the technology sectors due to higher prices. Almost 68% of the decline stemmed from a steep drop in the bar and coin segment.
"
2494,ARNC,"In absolute terms, gold demand in the quarter was valued at $57.6 billion, down 14% from the third quarter of fiscal 2011. Average gold price in the quarter stood at $1,652, down 3% year over year.
"
2495,ARNC,"Central banks remained the primary purchasers of gold, accounting for around 9% of total gold demand at 97.6 tons. Investment demand declined 16%, mainly due to a drop in bar and coin investment. Gold demand in the technology sector was 108.2 tons, a 6% annual decline due to higher gold prices, weak consumer demand, uncertainty in Europe and substitution to more affordable alternatives.
"
2496,ARNC,"Jewelry demand dipped 2% to 448.8 tons due to higher price levels as well as unfavorable economic conditions. China, Saudi Arabia, US and European markets saw declines. On the contrary, jewelry demand was strong in India, a major consumer of gold and accounted for 30% of global demand. Despite record high prices, demand was on the rise thanks to improving sentiment, stock building and positive price expectations.
"
2497,ARNC,"Demand for gold in China, another major market, decreased 5% to 123.8 tons as consumers cut back spending given the slow economic growth. Demand in the U.S market was affected as customers are trending toward lower carat gold, particularly with the penetration of 10-carat and other alternative metals.
"
2498,ARNC,"Mine production dipped 1% to 731.6 tons in the quarter. Mine workers’ strike in South Africa, disappointing results for a number of operations, lower-than-expected growth at new or recovering mines affected production during the quarter. Recycling activity decreased 2% to 460.7 tons, bringing the total supply to 1,188.3 tons, down 2% year over year.
"
2499,ARNC,"Gold prices in 2011 ranged from a low of $1,310 per ounce to a high of $1,895 per ounce, with an average gold price of $1,572 per ounce. The record gold price of $1,895 per ounce was attained in September, 33% higher than the 2010 peak of $1,421 per ounce in November.
"
2500,ARNC,"In 2012, gold prices have has ranged from $1,540 per ounce to $1,791.75 per ounce, with an average of $1,669.03 per ounce. Gold prices had a solid run in the first three quarters of 2012. Continuing concerns about Europe’s financial problems and China’s reduced economic growth forecast led to the climb.
"
2501,ARNC,"Furthermore, the announcement of a third round of quantitative easing led to a surge in gold prices. However, in the fourth quarter, prices fell from $1,776 per ounce to $1,657 per ounce, a 6.7% drop. Despite a weak fourth quarter gold stood at $1657.5 per ounce at 2012 end, up 8.3% and marked the 12th year of annual gains.
"
2502,ARNC,"The official sector is expected to continue to be a net buyer of gold in 2013. However, high gold prices and economic uncertainties will likely keep a check on demand for jewelry. Demand in the technology sector will be dampened due to high prices and the shift toward lower cost substitutes.
"
2503,ARNC,"A climb in gold prices has not always translated into increased revenues for all the gold miners, as they have to deal with increased cash costs and production issues. As prices for gold rise further, gold giants such as Barrick Gold (ABX) and Goldcorp (GG  -  Free Report), being unhedged producers of gold, will enjoy significant leverage to gold prices.
"
2504,ARNC,"The cost increases need to be controlled in order to rake in profits. On the other hand, gold producers like Newmont Mining (NEM  -  Free Report) and Kinross Gold (KGC  -  Free Report) are expected to suffer from lower ore grades that subdue production levels, increase mining costs and negate the benefits of rising gold prices.
"
2505,ARNC,"Ironically, rising gold prices has not had the same effect on the share prices of the gold companies. Investors prefer alternative financial products that allow them to invest in gold rather than investment in gold companies per se. These companies may be entangled in labor issues, escalating cost and other risks.
"
2506,ARNC,"Gold remains a coveted asset given its long-term supply and demand dynamics and influenced by macroeconomic factors. The value and wealth preservation attributes of gold continue to lure investors and consumers, and is considered a safe investment. Concerns regarding economic growth in developed countries have made gold an attractive and safe investment option.
"
2507,ARNC,"Gold prices will continue its rally in 2013, driven by investment and buying of gold by the central banks as a reserve portfolio asset. Strength in Indian markets, which alone consumes nearly 45%−50% of the world’s gold, should also provide support.
"
2508,ARNC,"Furthermore, recovery in China could contribute to the rise in the prices of gold. The Eurozone debt crisis and the geopolitical risks in the Middle East will pose as important drivers for a sustained demand for gold as a safe haven.Aluminum
"
2509,ARNC,"The aluminum industry is highly cyclical, with prices subject to worldwide supply and demand.Alcoa (AA), the world leader in the production of primary aluminum, kicked off the fourth quarter earnings season with a revenue decline of 1.5% due to lower realized metal price. On an adjusted basis, the company reported earnings per share of 6 cents reversing its year-ago loss of 18 cents per share earned in the year ago quarter. The company’s midstream and downstream businesses delivered profits and its cost-cutting measures also supported the results.
"
2510,ARNC,"Alcoa is optimistic for 2013 and expects global demand for aluminum to increase 7%, up from 6% growth in 2012. The company projects 9%-10% global growth in the aerospace sector this year. Its growth forecast for the other markets are -- automotive (1%-4%), commercial transportation (2%-7%), packaging (2%-3%), building and construction (4%-5%) and industrial gas turbine (3%-5%). Alcoa remains firm on the long-term prospects for aluminum and envisions global demand for aluminum to double by 2020.
"
2511,ARNC,"Alcoa’s positive long-term outlook notwithstanding, prices have been under pressure, prompting companies to cut back on production. Alcoa’s results have suffered because of the decline in realized aluminum prices. BHP Billiton (BHP  -  Free Report) and Rio Tinto (RIO  -  Free Report) have either sold or halted development of aluminum projects following a decline in aluminum prices.
"
2512,ARNC,"In 2012, BHP sold its 33.3% stake in the Guinea Alumina joint venture to its partners and also halted bauxite exploration at its Boffa-Santou-Houda site in Guinea. The company also abandoned plans to build a smelter in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Rio is set to divest 13 aluminum assets, including its Gove operations in Australia. Alcoa is looking to buy mines used in the manufacture of aluminium from BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto.
"
2513,ARNC,"Alcoa is aggressively slashing costs and pursuing strategies to move down its cost curves in its upstream businesses. The company remains committed to achieving its target of moving down the cost curve 10 percentage points in smelting and 7 percentage points in refining by 2015. The company completed planned closure or curtailments of 531,000 metric tons, or 12% of its highest-cost system smelting capacity, to enhance its competitive position.
"
2514,ARNC,"This trend will likely continue until aluminum prices recover. Energy prices and other input costs are expected to pose challenges for the aluminum industry, though oil prices have been on the downside lately. In addition to the curtailments, the company will step up activities to reduce the escalating cost of raw materials.
"
2515,ARNC,"In the medium to long term, aluminum consumption is expected to improve on a global basis. The revival is palpable in the automotive and packaging industries, one of the key consumer markets. The automobile market is also becoming increasingly aluminum-intensive, benefiting from its recyclability and light-weight properties. The global push to improve fuel efficiency in vehicles is expected to more than double demand for aluminum in the auto industry by 2025.
"
2516,ARNC,"Further, the surge in copper prices last year has triggered a switch among manufacturers to aluminum. Automobiles, air conditioners and industrial components manufacturers are now shifting their focus to the more economical metal. In response to the upsurge in automotive demand, Alcoa has invested $300 million in expansion projects at its Davenport, Iowa rolled products plant.
"
2517,ARNC,"We expect aluminum demand to increase over the next three years, outstripping supply growth. As a result, the aluminum market is likely to witness deficits for a prolonged period. This provides a backdrop supportive of high alumina and aluminum prices. China and India are witnessing rapid industrialization.
"
2518,ARNC,"The China stimulus plan will also work as positives for underlying aluminum demand. Leading aluminum producers such as Alcoa and Aluminum Corporation of China, or Chalco (ACH) should also benefit from the improving demand outlook.Copper
"
2519,ARNC,"Copper is a major industrial metal with its price strongly depending on the economic growth outlook. The metal’s strong cyclical leverage accounts for its nickname “Dr. Copper.”
"
2520,ARNC,"The metal’s popularity in industrial usage is due to its high ductility, malleability and thermal and electrical conductivity, along with its resistance to corrosion. In terms of consumption, copper holds the third place after iron and aluminum. Construction is the single largest market for copper, followed by electronics and electronic products, transportation, industrial machinery, and consumer and general products.
"
2521,ARNC,"Copper prices witnessed record high levels from 2006 through most of 2008 as limited supplies, growing demand from China and other emerging economies led to the surge in copper prices and low level of inventories. In December 2008, copper prices dipped to a low of $1.26 per pound due to reduced consumption, turbulence in the U.S. financial markets and concerns about the global economy.
"
2522,ARNC,"However, copper prices have since improved based on the strong demand from emerging markets and limited supply. In 2011, London Metal Exchange (LME) spot-copper prices ranged from $3.08 per pound to a record high of $4.60 per pound, with an average of $4.00 per pound.
"
2523,ARNC,"In the first quarter of 2012, LME spot copper prices averaged $3.77 per pound. However, during the second quarter of 2012, LME spot copper prices averaged $3.57 per pound and dipped further to $3.50 in the third quarter. This drop reflected concerns regarding a slowdown in the Chinese economy, Europe’s sovereign debt crisis, and a slowing U.S. economy.
"
2524,ARNC,"During fourth-quarter 2012, LME spot copper prices averaged $3.59 per pound. Overall in 2012, LME spot copper prices averaged $3.61 per pound, a 10% drop from 2011.
"
2525,ARNC,"The drop in price has hurt the results of copper producers like Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold (FCX  -  Free Report) and Southern Copper (SCCO  -  Free Report) and Newmont. Struggling with declining copper prices, Freeport has recently taken a major stride to venture into the U.S. energy space as part of the company’s strategy to diversify from its bread-and-butter copper mining business. The company is set to buy Plains Exploration & Production (PXP) and McMoRan Exploration (MMR) for roughly $9 billion.
"
2526,ARNC,"Freeport’s copper business has been affected by the sluggish global economy. Demand from key end-markets, including construction materials and electronics, remains weak due to the overall economic softness. The buyouts are expected to provide new opportunities for the company.
"
2527,ARNC,"Notwithstanding the current volatility in prices, we have a long-term bullish stance on copper, supported by its widespread use, limited supplies from existing mines and the absence of significant new development projects. Prices will be influenced by demand from China and emerging markets, economic activity in the U.S. and other industrialized countries, the timing of new supplies of copper and production levels of mines and copper smelters. Companies that have a high leverage to copper prices will benefit immensely from the potential demand for the metal in the developing markets.Overall Industry Outlook
"
2528,ARNC,"Cost inflation in the sector is expected to be a headwind for metal and mining companies over the next several years, driven by a number of factors viz. labor, energy, ore grades, currencies, supply constraints and taxes. Global economic uncertainties, softening commodity prices, higher input costs are increasing the pressure on company margins.
"
2529,ARNC,"To combat this, mining and metals companies are reviewing their portfolios to identify underperforming assets and shut down or divest these high cost and non-core assets. Industry consolidation, automation technology, owner-operated mines and investment in energy assets are some of the steps that companies are taking to mitigate the impact of rising costs.
"
2530,ARNC,"Growth in the emerging markets, particularly China and India, was a major driver of metals demand over the last few years. However, of late, demand in China has slowed down. China’s recent $150 billion infrastructure stimulus has helped improve the sentiment somewhat and holds promise for the metals and mining industry going forward.
"
2531,ARNC,"In the developed world, persistent recessionary conditions in Europe will have residual effects elsewhere. The U.S. Federal Reserve also appears to be actively engaged in sustaining the U.S economy’s momentum, which will hopefully jumpstart growth once again.
"
2532,ARNC,"This synchronized global economic slowdown is the biggest headwind for the metals space overall at present. That said, the long-term picture remains a lot more promising as the emerging market economies are expected to get back in shape with the help of expected fiscal and monetary stimuli.
"
2533,ARNC,"Most of my screens focus on fundamental analysis.
"
2534,ARNC,"Today, I want to put the focus on technical analysis, specifically on chart consolidation patterns. 
"
2535,ARNC,"Different chart patterns can be classified into one of two categories: continuation patterns and reversal patterns. Continuation Patterns generally will continue in the direction of the trend. If the trend was up, and then pauses, the expected breakout would be to the upside. If the trend was down, the ensuing breakout would likely be to the downside. Reversal Patterns have a tendency of reversing the trend. These consolidation patterns can signal a reversal in both uptrends and downtrends as well. 
"
2536,ARNC,"Different patterns have different names for them, like Symmetrical Triangles, Ascending Triangles, Head and Shoulders, and more.  
"
2537,ARNC,"But what they all have in common is that they are areas of indecision. The market pauses, and trades in a sideways-type pattern, until there's a catalyst to push prices meaningfully higher or lower in either direction.  
"
2538,ARNC,"The catalysts could be one of many things. The important thing to know is that many of these patterns have high forecasting probabilities. And understanding what they mean can help traders and investors get properly positioned in anticipation of the breakout. Symmetrical Triangles 
"
2539,ARNC,"One of my favorite patterns to trade is the Symmetrical Triangle. These are continuation patterns.  
"
2540,ARNC,"Below is an illustration of what a symmetrical triangle looks like.  
"
2541,ARNC,"Today, we're going to focus in on a bullish pattern.
"
2542,ARNC,"The science behind this pattern is quite simple. The market has gotten a little ahead of itself and it needs to consolidate. Attempts to push higher are met with selling. And attempts to push lower are met with buying. Each new lower high and higher low is shallower than the last, until the chart pattern takes the shape of a right-sided triangle.  
"
2543,ARNC,"Eventually, the triangle resolves itself, and often with an explosive move in the direction of the preceding trend. Screening for Symmetrical Triangles
"
2544,ARNC,"To screen for symmetrical triangle patterns, first define the size of the pattern by the length of time it took to develop. For example, a one-month pattern, or a two-month pattern, etc. Then put in the logic. 
"
2545,ARNC,"Here are the parameters for a 3-month long bullish symmetrical triangle pattern. Moving High over last 90 days greater than Moving High over last 60 days
"
2546,ARNC,"Specifically, this finds stocks whose high price between 90-60 days ago is greater than the high price from 60-30 days ago. This means the first high (point 1 of the triangle pattern) will be higher than the second high (point 3) of the pattern. This 'creates' the top part of the pattern and would be where the descending trendline would be drawn. Moving Low over last 90 Days less than Moving Low over last 30 days 
"
2547,ARNC,"This will find stocks whose low price within the last 90-60 days ago is lower than the low price from 30 days ago. This means that the first low (point 2) of the pattern will be lower than the second low (point 4) of the pattern. This would be the bottom of the pattern and where the ascending trendline would be drawn.  
"
2548,ARNC,"And to make sure your first high point isn't lower than a higher high shortly before that, I'll often add this other expression in: Moving High over last 150 Days less than Moving High over last 90 days 
"
2549,ARNC,"This means that the high price within the last 150-90 days will be lower than the high price within 90-60 days ago. In short, this helps me find stocks with patterns forming near their recent highs and precludes those following a meaningful drop. 
"
2550,ARNC,"This simple screen will find stocks that are in uptrends and that meet the characteristics of a 3-month set-up for a Symmetrical Triangle pattern. To search for smaller patterns over a short-time span, simply shorten the dates. To look for larger patterns, open the date ranges up.  
"
2551,ARNC,"Note: not every stock that comes thru this screen will look like a perfect symmetrical triangle, even though they technically meet the requirements. But it'll put some great looking charts on your radar screen. And that's what it's meant to do.
"
2552,ARNC,"This screen is also available in the Research Wizard so you won't need to set this up as it's already in there. Stocks

2557,ARNC,"Earnings Preview 7/08/11
"
2558,ARNC,"Second quarter earnings season will ""officially"" kick off Monday after the bell when Alcoa (AA) reports.  There will not be a lot of reports this week, the real flood starts next week, but the ones we will get are important ones that the street will be paying lots of attention to, and this week could well set the tone for the entire earnings season.
"
2559,ARNC,"While there will only be 44 firms reporting, 11 of those are in the S&P 500.  The firms reporting this week include:  Alcoa (AA), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), Fastenal (FAST  -  Free Report), Google (GOOG), J.P. Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report) and Marriot (MAR).
"
2560,ARNC,"That is an interesting cross section of U.S. business.  While one of the smaller firms reporting, pay attention to how Fastenal does.  It is the largest producer of fasteners, like rivets, nuts and bolts.  As such, it is a supplier to almost all manufacturing businesses, and thus its results are a good barometer for the health of the overall economy.
"
2561,ARNC,"We have a relatively heavy economic data calendar.  We start out light but the pace of data will pick up as the week goes on.  We start with the Trade Deficit on Tuesday, followed by the Budget Deficit on Wednesday.  We will also get the FOMC minutes on Wednesday, which will provide clues to what the Fed is thinking.  Thursday brings Retail Sales and the Producer Price Index.  Friday will be busy with the Consumer Price Index as well as the Industrial Production/Capacity Utilization report.  
"
2562,ARNC,"MondayNothing of particular interest.
"
2563,ARNC,"TuesdayThe Trade Deficit is expected to rise slightly to $44.0 billion in May from $43.7 billion in April.  Falling Oil prices should help as out oil addiction is responsible for over half of our chronic trade deficit.  Her we will probably see more of that effect in the June numbers than in the May numbers.  The trade deficit is directly responsible for our increasing indebtedness to the rest of the world, not the budget deficit.  A rising trade deficit slows economic growth and job creation.  In the short term, a rising budget deficit increases economic growth, and job creation.  As such, at lest in the short to medium term, the trade deficit is a far more serious economic problem than the budget deficit is.
"
2564,ARNC,"WednesdayThe budget deficit is expected to come in at $45 billion in June, down from $68.4 billion a year ago.  The budget deficit numbers are extremely seasonal, but are not seasonally adjusted, so looking at month to month changes is worse than useless, it is downright misleading.  While the deficit is huge, expected to come in at about $1.5 Trillion this year, running a budget deficit when the economy is weak is a good thing.  Both cutting spending and raising taxes in a slow economy will slow growth.  The notion that cutting spending will not hurt the economy, or would even help it is just flat out wrong.  Not all tax increases are economically damaging.  It depends on which spending is cut, and which taxes are raised.  The obsession in Washington about cutting the deficit fast and hard now is extremely misplaced, and threatens to send the economy back into recession.The minutes to the most recent Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting will be released.  This should give more insight into the thinking at the Fed, and also give the reasons for its recent downgrade of economic growth projections.  Mostly it looks like the Fed will sit on the sidelines for the rest of the year, not changing the Fed Funds rate, nor embarking on QE3, but also not draining the liquidity it has already injected into the system with the first two rounds of large scale asset purchases.ThursdayWeekly initial claims for unemployment insurance come out.  They had a very nice decline early in they year, but then had a few months.  Last week they fell by 14,000 to 418,000.   A slight increase is expected next week, rising to 419,000.     The four week moving average will probably stay well above the 400,000 level, where it has been for the three months.  The sharp rise in initial claims were an early warning of the weak jobs report for June.  Robust job expansion is generally associated with initial claims below the 400,000 level.Continuing claims have also in a downtrend of late, but the road down has been bumpy. Last week they fell by 43,000 to 3.691 million.  That is down 785,000 from a year ago. I would expect a small decline this week.  The consensus is looking for a small increase to 3.700 million.   Some of the longer term decline due to people simply exhausting their regular state benefits which run out after 26 weeks.  Those however, dont last forever either.  Federally paid extended claims fell by 88,000 to 3.847 million, and are down by 758,000 over the last year.    Looking at just the regular continuing claims numbers is a serious mistake.  They only include a little over half of the unemployed now given the unprecedentedly high duration of unemployment figures. A better measure is the total number of people getting unemployment benefits, currently at 7.460 million, which is down 61,000 from last week (there are some timing issues so the change in continuing and existing claims does not match the change in the total).  The total number of people getting benefits is now 1.580 million below year ago levels.  What is not known is how many people have left the extended claims via the road to prosperity, finding a new job, and how many have left on the road to poverty, having simply exhausted even the extended benefits.  Given the differential between job growth and the decline in total people getting benefits, it looks like about 1 million people have simply run out of benefits, and have not found new work.  Make sure to look at both sets of numbers!  Many of the press reports will not, but we will here at Zacks.The Producer Price Index (PPI) is expected to have fallen by 0.3%, down from a 0.2% increase in May.  Most of the decline will be do to lower oil prices.  Stripping out food and energy to get the core PPI, the index is expected to rise 0.2% in June, matching its rise in May.  Those numbers refer to prices for finished goods.  The report will  also give data on price changes further up the production chain, which while more volatile than finished good prices, often indicate the direction prices for finished goods will be moving in a few months.Retail Sales are expected to have fallen by 0.2% in June, matching the decline in May (seasonally adjusted).  This is a broad measure of retail sales, not just activity at the malls.  Most significantly, it includes auto sales.  Excluding autos, retail sales are expected to have been unchanged after rising 0.3% in May.  While the numbers are adjusted for seasonal variations like the number of shopping days, they are not adjusted for inflation.  As such, some of the weakness in retail sales will probably come from gas stations, and not due to a sudden drop in the number of people eating hot dogs off the rollers and drinking 44oz fountain drinks.FridayThe Consumer Price Index is expected to have fallen by 0.1% in June, partially reversing a 0.2% increase in May.  As with the PPI, most of the decline will be due to falling oil prices.  With food and energy prices stripped out, the core CPI is expected to have risen by 0.2%, down from 0.3% in May.  Inflation is not a serious problem right now, and it does not look like it will be any time soon.  To really get inflation going, you need a wage/price spiral.  With job growth extremely anemic, there is no way that wages are going to start to accelerate anytime soon.  The Fed needs to be concentrating on the full employment side of its dual mandate right now, not on inflation.The Empire State Index, one of the regional ""mini-ISM's"" covering New York State is expected to come in at 0.8, indicating very slight expansion of manufacturing activity in New York State in June.  Last month it was much weaker than expected, coming in at -7.8.  Unlike the ISM, zero, rather than 50 is the dividing line between growth and contraction in this survey.Industrial Production is expected to have risen by 0.2% up from a 0.1% increase in May.  This is a broad measure of Industrial Production, covering the output of not just factories, but also of Mines and Utilities as well.  The utility part can lead to weather related distortions.  Thus it is important to look at the Manufacturing only data as well.  Hotter than normal weather in Summer or colder than normal weather in Winter will boost demand for electricity without reflecting a change in overall economic activity.Capacity utilization is expected to have edged up to 76.6% in June from 76.7% in May.  As with the Industrial Production side of this report, utilities can be weather distorted, and that can affect the overall picture.  Thus it is important to look at the manufacturing only data.  This report is much more important than the amount of attention it gets.  As a general rule of thumb a level of 80% is about normal and indicates a healthy economy.  A level of 85% indicates that the economy is overheating and inflation will soon become a serious problem, so the Fed should be lifting interest rates and Congress should be cutting spending and raising spending to cool the economy down.  A level of 75 is what is hit in a normal recession.  The low for this cycle was 67.3%.  Factory utilization generally runs slightly lower than overall utilization. It was at 74.5% in May.  The low for the cycle was 64.4%, the lowest on record.Potential Positive or Negative Surprises
"
2565,ARNC,"Historically the best indicators of firms which are likely to report positive surprises are a recent history of positive surprises and rising estimates going into the report. The Zacks rank is also a good indicator of potential surprises.  Similarly a recent history of earnings disappointments, cuts in the average estimate for the quarter in the month before the report is due and a poor Zacks rank (4 or 5) are often red flags pointing to a potential disappointing earnings report.  Given the small number of firms reporting this week, there are not many candidates for potential positive or negative surprises, and so I will omit this section.

2567,ARNC,"Key Points:4Q earnings season finished, first quarter season starting. So far 32 (6.4%) S&P 500 reports in. Median surprise of 3.67% and surprise ratio of 5.50 for EPS, 0.76% and 2.56 for revenues. Strong growth of 33.4% (16.5% ex-Financials) reported, but slowdown expected for the vast majority yet to report. Just 16.8% (20.9% ex-Financials), down from the 30.6% (19.5%) those firms reported in the 4Q. Quarterly net margins reported rise to 10.54% from 8.40% a year ago, up from 9.73% in fourth quarter. Margins excluding financials rise to 8.30% from 7.82% last year and 7.88% in fourth quarter. Expectations for yet to report firms for margins to rise to 9.77% from 8.67% a year ago, 8.80% in the fourth quarter.Full-year total earnings for the S&P 500 jumps 45.4% in 2010, expected to rise 15.3% further in 2011. Growth to continue in 2012 with total net income expected to rise 13.5%. Financials major earnings driver. Excluding Financials, growth was 27.5% in 2010, and expected to be 15.5% in 2011 and 11.9% in 2012.Total revenues for the S&P 500 rise 8.23% in 2010, expected to be up 4.30% in 2011, and 5.98% in 2012. Excluding Financials, revenues up 9.71% in 2010, expected to rise 7.77% in 2011 and 6.13% in 2012.Annual Net Margins marching higher, from 5.88% in 2008 to 6.40% in 2009 to 8.59% for 2010, 9.50% expected for 2011 and 10.18% in 2012.Major source of earnings growth. Net margins ex-Financials 7.79% in 2008, 7.08% in 2009, 8.22% for 2010, 8.82% expected in 2011 and 9.29% in 2012.Revisions ratio for full S&P 500 at 1.40 for 2011, at 1.86 for 2012, both bullish readings. Ratio of firms with rising to falling mean estimates at 1.35 for 2011, 1.79 for 2012, also very positive readings. Total revisions activity past seasonal low, will rise rapidly.S&P 500 earned $545.1 billion in 2009, rising to $792.1 billion in 2010, expected to climb to $913.5 billion in 2011. In 2012 the 500 are collectively expected to earn $1.037 Trillion.S&P 500 earned $57.13 in 2009, $83.09 in 2010 and $95.81 in 2011 expected bottom up. For 2012, $108.72 expected.  Puts P/E’s at 15.8x for 2010, and 13.7x for 2011 and 12.1x for 2012, very attractive relative to 10-year T-note rate of 3.50%.Top-down estimates $92.70 for 2011 and $100.29 for 2012.We Should Know by Easter
"
2568,ARNC,"While the first quarter earnings season “officially kicked off last week when Alcoa (AA) reported, it was a slow start. We have just 32 (6.4%) first quarter reports in. It will pick up steam this week, when 111 members of the S&P 500 are due to report.
"
2569,ARNC,"This week’s reporters are a virtual who’s who of American business, from Apple (AAPL) to Verizon (VZ) and from Ford (F) to McDonald’s (MCD). While far too early to draw any conclusions, it looks like we are off to a good start in the first quarter, with reported net income growth of 33.4%, actually up slightly from the 32.4% growth those same 32 firms reported in the fourth quarter.This Week Will Tell A Lot
"
2570,ARNC,"By next week we should have a good idea of how the season as a whole will go. The expectations for the remaining firms have been rising, but the hurdle is not particularly high. The consensus is looking for a significant slowdown in growth for the remaining firms, with total net income rising just 16.8%.
"
2571,ARNC,"Financial firms setting aside much less than a year ago for bad debts were a big part of the earnings story for the fourth quarter, and the story so far in the first quarter. Excluding the Financials, total net income is up 16.5%, down from growth of 24.2$ in the fourth quarter.
"
2572,ARNC,"A big part of the deceleration in year-over-year growth has to do with a much higher base, particularly in the Financials in the first quarter of 2010 than in the fourth quarter of 2009. If the Financial sector is excluded, the expected net income growth for the remaining firms is solid at 20.9%, actually up from the 19.5% growth those same firms posted in the fourth quarter.
"
2573,ARNC,"Revenue growth in the fourth quarter was healthy at 8.28%. Looking ahead to the first quarter, though, those firms yet to report are expected to post year-over-year revenue growth of 3.66%, down from 8.19% growth in the fourth quarter. Financials are the key reason for the slowdown in revenue growth, if they are excluded, reported revenue growth is expected to be 7.46%, while that is down from the 8.22% growth posted last quarter, it is not nearly as dramatic. Tougher year-over-year comparisons are a big part of the story. Net Margin Expansion Slowing
"
2574,ARNC,"Net margin expansion has been a driver of earnings growth, but that expansion is slowing down, particularly if one excludes the Financials. Net margins for those yet to report are expected to come in at 9.77% in the first quarter, up from 8.67% a year ago, and from 8.80% in the fourth quarter. However, excluding the Financials, net margins are expected to rise to 9.25% from 8.22% a year ago, and up from 8.78% in the fourth quarter.
"
2575,ARNC,"Among the handful that have already reported for the first quarter, overall net margins are 10.54%, up sharply from 8.40% a year ago and from 9.73% in the fourth quarter. Strip away the Financials that have already reported and the picture is different, rising to 8.30% from 7.82% a year ago and from the 7.88% reported in the fourth quarter.Look to Cyclicals
"
2576,ARNC,"It looks like the more cyclical parts of the economy will be leading the growth charge this quarter. The highest expected growth (among those yet to report) comes from the Construction sector, where earnings are expected to be more than double what they were  last year, but in that case, so what, two times nothing is still nothing. The Industrials, on the other hand, had decent earnings a year ago, but are expected to report total net income that is 77.2% higher than in the first quarter of 2010.
"
2577,ARNC,"Unlike the construction firms, analysts have been raising the expectations for the Industrials, for both 2011 and 2012, while they continue to slash the estimates for the construction firms. The Transports are also expected to see robust growth of 62.9% over last year. They are an interesting case in terms of estimate revisions, with cuts for this year, but lots of increases for next year. I suspect that what analysts are saying is that the underlying business is very strong, but that they face a stiff headwind in the near term from higher energy costs.
"
2578,ARNC,"The Energy sector is also expected to have very strong growth, which is not a shocker if you have filled up your tank lately. Total net income for the quarter is expected to rise 45.2%, and the revisions are strong for both years.
"
2579,ARNC,"The weakest sector by far is expected to be the Conglomerates, with earnings falling 45.5%. Utilities are also expected to have a weak performance, with total income down 9.0% from last year.
"
2580,ARNC,"The Financials are expected to post positive growth, but only of 0.6%. They are a bit of a wild card, in that how good a quarter they have will largely depend on how much the banks can release reserves. Some will have major releases, and others very little at all. The level of releases can be very hard to forecast at any given bank. The quality of earnings growth coming from reserve releases is very low.
"
2581,ARNC,"On an annual basis, net margins continue to march northward. In 2008, overall net margins were just 5.88%, rising to 6.40% in 2009. They hit 8.59% in 2010 and are expected to continue climbing to 9.50% in 2011 and 10.18% in 2012. The pattern is a bit different, particularly during the recession, if the Financials are excluded, as margins fell from 7.78% in 2008 to 7.08% in 2009, but have started a robust recovery and rose to 8.22% in 2010.  They are expected to rise to 8.82% in 2011 and 9.29% in 2012.Expectations for 2011
"
2582,ARNC,"The expectations for the full year are very healthy, with total net income for 2010 rising to $792.1 billion in 2010, up from $545.1 billion in 2009. In 2011, the total net income for the S&P 500 should be $913.5 billion, or increases of 45.4% and 15.3%, respectively. The expectation is for 2012 to have total net income passing the $1 Trillion mark to $1.037 Trillion.
"
2583,ARNC,"That will also put the “EPS for the S&P 500 over the $100 “per share level for the first time at $108.72. That is up from $57.13 for 2009, $83.09 for 2010, and $95.81 for 2011.  In an environment where the 10 year T-note is yielding 3.50%, a P/E of 15.8x based on 2010 and 13.7x based on 2011 earnings looks attractive. The P/E based on 2012 earnings is 12.1x.
"
2584,ARNC,"With far more estimates being raised than being cut (revisions ratio of 1.40), one has to feel confident that the current expectations for 2011 will be hit, and more likely exceeded. Analysts are raising their 2012 projections at an even higher rate, with a revisions ratio of 1.86, or almost two increases for every cut. While a lot can happen between now and the time the 2012 earnings are all in, upward estimate momentum means that the current 2012 earnings are more likely to be exceeded than for them to fall short.The Economy & Politics
"
2585,ARNC,"This provides a strong fundamental backing for the market to continue to move higher. The fact we are in the third year of the presidential cycle (almost always the best of the four, and by a big margin). We have a Democrat in the White House, which has historically meant good things for the stock market, with an average annualized return over the last 50 years more than triple than when the GOP holds the Oval Office.
"
2586,ARNC,"While counting points on the S&P 500 is suspect over long periods of time, the fact remains that on balance, every single point of increase in the S&P 500 over the last 50 years has come with a Democrat in the White House. Those factors should combine to make this a good year for the market.Not All Smooth Sailing
"
2587,ARNC,"That does not mean that all is smooth sailing ahead. We managed to avoid a government shutdown, but only at the cost of large spending cuts that will slow the economy. Those should probably shave at least a half point off of the growth we would have had in 2011, and probably result in hundreds of thousands fewer jobs being created. Fortunately, the economy has some upward momentum, so the cuts will simply slow the economy down, not throw it into reverse.
"
2588,ARNC,"The lower growth will result in lower tax collections, so the impact on the budget deficit will be much less than the amount advertised. Job creation remains sluggish, but is starting to show signs of picking up. We created 230,000 jobs in the private sector in March, down from 240,000 in February, but that is after a big upward revision to the February numbers. However, State and Local governments laid off a total of 15,000 people for the month, on top of 46,000 pink slips the month before.
"
2589,ARNC,"The idea that one can reduce unemployment by cutting jobs is positively Orwellian, and it is hard to believe the advocates of doing so are taken seriously. The household survey has been much more upbeat, showing growth of 291,000 jobs in March, on top of 250,000 gained the month before. The unemployment rate fell to 8.8%, and it was as high as 9.8% as recently as November.
"
2590,ARNC,"The international situation clearly has the potential to abort the recovery as well. The disaster in Japan will clearly slow its economy dramatically in the first quarter, although much of that growth will be made up later in the year as the reconstruction process gets under way. Many U.S. made products have parts which are made in Japan and that is likely to disrupt production here. Still, there appeared to be no impact on Industrial Production in March as manufacturing output climbed 0.7%.
"
2591,ARNC,"The turmoil in the Middle East is not going away, and that is likely to keep oil prices both high and volatile. High oil prices will also act as a depressing force on the economy. The Debt crisis in Europe is not going away with Portugal now also getting bailed out, even as the ECB makes life tougher on the PIIGS by raising rates.
"
2592,ARNC,"On the plus side, the dollar has been weak, and that should improve the trade deficit, and that will be a significant positive for the economy. The foreign operations of U.S. companies will be much more profitable when the results are measured in dollars.  Inflation, other than in food and energy, is well contained, up only 0.1% in March and 1.2% year over year. That should let the Fed stay on Easy Street as far as monetary policy is concerned.Scorecard & Earnings SurpriseFourth quarter season done, and the first quarter season starting. So far, 32 (6.4%) of reports in. Off to a strong start, with year over year growth of 33.4%, a 5.20 surprise ratio, and 3.67% median surprise. The fourth quarter was a somewhat better than “normal earnings season: 30.7% year over year growth, median surprise of 3.61%, and a 3.14 surprise ratio (345 beats, 110 misses), 69.0% of all firms beat expectations.Positive year-over-year growth for 27, falling EPS for 5 firms, 5.40 ratio, 84.4% of all firms reporting have higher EPS than last year.Very early, the percentages and ratios will change dramatically over next few weeks.Discretionary, Industrials and Financials all have double-digit median surprises.
"
2593,ARNC,"Historically, a “normal earnings season will have a surprise ratio of about 3:1 and a median surprise of about 3.0%. Thus in the early going we are doing much better than average on the median front, and about average on the ratio front. Early on the ratios and medians can be very volatile, but it looks like an OK start to things.

2597,ARNC,"The first table below shows the S&P 500 firms with the biggest increases in their FY1 (mostly 2010) mean estimate over the last 4 weeks. The second shows the largest declines. To qualify, there must be more than 3 estimates for FY1, and have a mean estimate of more than $0.50. In addition to the change in the mean estimate, the net percentage of estimates being raised is shown for both FY1 and FY2, as well as the P/E ratios based on each year’s earnings is shown.
"
2598,ARNC,"Note that estimate momentum and value are not mutually exclusive. The most interesting of these firms will be where the net revisions percentage (#up-#dn/Tot) is more than 0.50 but less than 1.00. Big mean estimate changes based on a handful of individual revisions are suspect, but could prove to be the most interesting if other analysts follow suit. On the other hand, if all the analysts have raised their estimates already, the mean estimate is less likely to rise again over the next month.This week’s cut off +/-%Energy dominates the increases list, heavy Financial exposure on the biggest cuts list.Biggest FY1 Revisions(Largest Increases) Company Ticker %ChCurr Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  %ChNext Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  # Up-Dn/Tot%ChCurr Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  # Up-Dn/Tot%ChNext Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  P/E usingCurr FY Est P/E usingNext FY EstDiscover Fin Sv DFS 32.69% 12.44% 1.00 0.81 8.96 9.66Denbury Res Inc DNR 13.74% 15.46% 0.53 0.56 21.86 18.54Anadarko Petrol APC 11.05% 6.31% 0.36 0.23 31.47 22.93Marathon Oil Cp MRO 10.36% 6.40% 0.53 0.35 9.38 8.92Hess Corp HES 10.21% 9.19% 0.38 0.20 10.89 10.00Chevron Corp CVX 10.18% 8.17% 0.63 0.61 9.04 8.67Tesoro Corp TSO 9.36% 9.22% 0.24 0.29 11.51 10.55Conocophillips COP 9.17% 9.59% 0.55 0.58 10.47 9.37Murphy Oil MUR 9.02% 5.80% 0.27 0.15 12.83 10.48Noble Energy NBL 8.40% 6.02% 0.57 0.35 20.40 15.64Occidental Pet OXY 8.38% 6.85% 0.55 0.33 12.86 11.16Utd States Stl X 8.03% 3.28% 0.27 0.20 12.81 8.33Pall Corp PLL 7.97% 8.50% 0.90 0.90 20.74 18.17Exxon Mobil Crp XOM 7.51% 5.90% 0.53 0.32 10.71 9.93Nrg Energy Inc NRG 6.91% 18.44% 0.33 0.25 27.20 29.78Pioneer Nat Res PXD 6.40% 7.53% 0.24 0.24 31.63 21.38Davita Inc DVA 6.20% 4.08% 0.56 0.44 18.77 15.02Micron Tech MU 6.06% 5.51% 0.47 0.29 17.66 8.74Ppg Inds Inc PPG 5.88% 3.59% 0.62 0.62 15.02 13.82Keycorp New KEY 5.87% 2.67% 0.21 0.21 13.19 11.08Cabot Oil & Gas COG 5.83% 6.34% 0.27 0.27 59.88 37.10Bed Bath&Beyond BBBY 5.60% 4.30% 0.95 0.43 15.33 13.61Oracle Corp ORCL 5.08% 3.93% 0.83 0.78 15.93 14.48Biggest FY1 Revisions(Largest Declines) Company Ticker %ChCurr Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  %ChNext Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  # Up-Dn/Tot%ChCurr Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  # Up-Dn/Tot%ChNext Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  P/E usingCurr FY Est P/E usingNext FY EstXl Group Plc XL -33.14% -1.17% -0.88 -0.31 17.79 11.40Motorola Moblty MMI -25.66% -14.52% -0.43 -0.38 45.71 17.18Goodyear Tire GT -18.01% 0.68% 0.10 0.09 26.64 7.94Goldman Sachs GS -16.70% 0.95% -0.64 0.06 11.59 8.35Ace Limited ACE -13.93% -0.13% -0.80 -0.05 10.59 9.01Carnival Corp CCL -11.06% -9.25% -1.00 -1.00 14.43 11.87Morgan Stanley MS -10.88% -2.83% -0.59 -0.40 10.86 8.71Sunoco Inc SUN -6.25% 0.78% -0.13 -0.23 24.76 17.33Adobe Systems ADBE -6.05% -2.96% -0.83 -0.67 18.71 15.77Lennar Corp -A LEN -5.04% -8.86% -0.21 -0.40 32.43 16.60Xilinx Inc XLNX -5.00% -1.70% -0.59 -0.12 15.20 13.17Data in this report, unless stated otherwise, is through the close on Thursday 4/14/2011.

Strong growth of 22.7% (14.6% ex-Financials) reported, but big slowdown expected for the vast majority yet to report. Just 7.71% (9.29% ex-Financials), down from the 30.8% (19.8%) those firms reported in the 4Q.Quarterly net margins reported rise to 7.92% from 7.06% a year ago, up from 7.06% in fourth quarter. Margins excluding financials rise to 7.62% from 6.85% last year and 7.30% in fourth quarter. Expectations for yet-to-report firms for margins to rise to 9.03% from 8.73% a year ago, 8.92% in 4th quarter.Full-year total earnings for the S&P 500 jumps 45.3% in 2010, expected to rise 15.1% further in 2011. Growth to continue in 2012 with total net income expected to rise 13.9%. Financials the major earnings driver. Excluding Financials, growth was 27.4% in 2010, and expected to be 13.9% in 2011 and 12.0% in 2012.Total revenues for the S&P 500 rise 8.18% in 2010, expected to be up 3.90% in 2011, and 5.95% in 2012. Excluding Financials, revenues up 9.70% in 2010, expected to rise 7.33% in 2011 and 6.07% in 2012.  Annual Net Margins marching higher, from 5.88% in 2008 to 6.39% in 2009 to 8.59% for 2010, 9.50% expected for 2011 and 10.21% in 2012.Major source of earnings growth. Net margins ex-Financials 7.79% in 2008, 7.08% in 2009, 8.22% for 2010, 8.82% expected in 2011, and 9.31% in 2012.Revisions ratio for full S&P 500 at 1.32 for 2011, at 1.74 for 2012, both bullish readings. Ratio of firms with rising-to-falling mean estimates at 1.32 for 2011, 1.53 for 2012, also very positive readings. Total revisions activity passing seasonal low.S&P 500 earned $545.1 billion in 2009, rising to $790.4 billion in 2010, expected to climb to $909.5 billion in 2011.

"
2601,ARNC,"The fourth quarter earnings season is over, and now the focus turns to the first quarter. While it “officially kicks off after the bell today when Alcoa (AA) reports, we already have 26 (5.2%) first quarter reports in from the S&P 500.
"
2602,ARNC,"Alcoa, though, like the Master’s -- is but the first of the majors. It will not be the only one in the early going. We will also hear from Google (GOOG), J.P. Morgan (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) this week. Together, they should provide some good clues to the overall direction of earnings season.
"
2603,ARNC,"One firm which is not a household name but we be good to keep an eye on is Fastenal (FAST). It is the number one maker of fasteners -- things like screws and bolts -- which go into all sorts of other things. If it reports strong results, it is a good bet that the rest of the market will, as well.Good Start, but Earnings Growth to Slow
"
2604,ARNC,"While far too early to draw any conclusions, it looks like we are off to a good start on the first quarter, with reported net income growth of 22.7%, down just slightly from the 25.7% growth those same 26 firms reported in the fourth quarter. That, however, is not expected to last. The consensus is looking for a dramatic slowdown in growth for the remaining firms, with total net income rising just 7.71%.
"
2605,ARNC,"Financial firms setting aside much less than a year ago for bad debts were a big part of the earnings story for the fourth quarter, and a big part of the deceleration in year-over-year growth has to do with a much higher base, particularly in the Financials in the first quarter of 2010 than in the fourth quarter of 2009. If the Financial sector is excluded, total net income rose 19.8% from a year ago, in the fourth quarter, and in the first quarter it is expected to slow to 9.3%.Positive Surprises Expected?
"
2606,ARNC,"Given the trend of positive earnings surprises, I would be shocked if the actual growth rate is that low. It is almost certain to be in the double digits again. Revenue growth in the fourth quarter was healthy at 8.28%. Looking ahead to the first quarter, though, those firms yet to report are expected to post year-over-year revenue growth of just 4.14%.
"
2607,ARNC,"Financials are the key reason for the slowdown in revenue growth; if they are excluded, reported revenue growth is expected to be 9.08%. Tougher year-over-year comparisons are a big part of the story.Net Margins to Expand Slightly
"
2608,ARNC,"Net margin expansion has been a driver of earnings growth, but that expansion is slowing down, particularly if one excludes the Financials. Overall, net margins are expected to come in at 9.03% in the first quarter, up from 8.73% a year ago, and from 8.92% in the fourth quarter.  However, excluding the Financials, net margins are expected to only creep up to 8.29% from 8.27% a year ago, and down from 8.81% in the fourth quarter.

2609,ARNC,"Among the handful of S&P 500 companies that have already reported for the first quarter, overall net margins are 7.92%, up sharply from 7.06% a year ago and from 7.06% in the fourth quarter. Strip away the Financials that have already reported and the picture is different, rising to 7.62% from 7.86% a year ago and from the 7.30% reported in the fourth quarter.
"
2610,ARNC,"Do not make too much of the level of reported net margins being significantly lower than the expected net margins. That is due to the reporting firms being very overweighted towards retailers (many have February fiscal period ends), which tend to be lower-margin businesses.
"
2611,ARNC,"On an annual basis, net margins continue to march northward. In 2008, overall net margins were just 5.88%, rising to 6.39% in 2009. They hit 8.59% in 2010 and are expected to continue climbing to 9.59% in 2011 and 10.31% in 2012.  The pattern is a bit different, particularly during the recession, if the Financials are excluded, as margins fell from 7.78% in 2008 to 7.09% in 2009, but have started a robust recovery and rose to 8.24% in 2010.  They are expected to rise to 8.84% in 2011 and 9.37% in 2012.Another Good Year Overall?
"
2612,ARNC,"The expectations for the full year are very healthy, with total net income for 2010 rising to $790.5 billion in 2010, up from $545.1 billion in 2009. In 2011, the total net income for the S&P 500 should be $909.5 billion, or increases of 45.3% and 15.1%, respectively. The expectation is for 2012 to have total net income passing the $1 Trillion mark to 1.036 Trillion.
"
2613,ARNC,"That will also put the “EPS for the S&P 500 over the $100 “per share level for the first time at $108.50. That is up from $57.13 for 2009, $83.16 for 2010, and $95.67 for 2011. In an environment where the 10-year T-note is yielding 3.54%, a P/E of 16.1 based on 2010 and 14.0x based on 2011 earnings looks attractive. The P/E based on 2012 earnings is 12.3x.
"
2614,ARNC,"With far more estimates being raised than being cut (revisions ratio of 1.32), one has to feel confident that the current expectations for 2011 will be hit, and more likely exceeded. Analysts are raising their 2012 projections at an even higher rate, with a revisions ratio of 1.74. While a lot can happen between now and the time the 2012 earnings are all in, upward estimate momentum means that the current 2012 earnings are more likely to be exceeded than for them to fall short.
"
2615,ARNC,"This provides a strong fundamental backing for the market to continue to move higher. The fact we are in the third year of the presidential cycle (almost always the best of the four, and by a big margin). We have a Democrat in the White House, which has historically meant good things for the stock market, with an average annualized return over the last 50 years more than triple that when the GOP holds the Oval Office. Few, if any, binomial variables have as much statistical significance. Those factors should combine to make this a good year for the market.Government Not Shutdown - But At What Cost?
"
2616,ARNC,"That does not mean that all is smooth sailing ahead. We managed to avoid a government shutdown, but only at the cost of large spending cuts that will slow the economy. Those should probably shave at least a half point off of the growth we would have had in 2011, and probably result in hundreds of thousands of fewer jobs being created.   
"
2617,ARNC,"The lower growth will result in lower tax collections, so the impact on the budget deficit will be much less than the amount advertised. Job creation remains sluggish, but is starting to show signs of picking up. We created 230,000 jobs in the private sector in March, down from 240,000 in February, but that is after a big upward revision to the February numbers.
"
2618,ARNC,"However, State and Local governments laid off a total of 15,000 people for the month, on top of 46,000 pink slips the month before. Those jobs count just like private sector jobs, and are a major headwind to bringing down the total number of unemployed. The idea that one can reduce unemployment by cutting jobs is positively Orwellian, and it is hard to believe the advocates of this message are taken so seriously.
"
2619,ARNC,"The household survey has been much more upbeat, showing growth of 291,000 jobs in March, on top of 250,000 gained the month before. The unemployment rate fell to 8.8%, and it was as high as 9.8% as recently as November.International Headwinds Remain
"
2620,ARNC,"The international situation clearly has the potential to abort the recovery as well. The disaster in Japan will clearly slow its economy dramatically in the first quarter, although much of that growth will be made up later in the year as the reconstruction process gets underway. Many U.S. products have parts that are made in Japan, and that is likely to disrupt production here.
"
2621,ARNC,"The turmoil in the Middle East is not going away, and that is likely to keep oil prices both high and volatile. High oil prices will also act as a depressing force on the economy. It is worth noting that many of the S&P 500 firms seeing the largest increases for this year’s earnings are oil companies. Owning some oil company shares can be a great hedge for rising prices at the pump.
"
2622,ARNC,"The debt crisis in Europe is not going away with Portugal now also getting bailed out, even as the ECB makes life tougher on the PIIGS by raising rates. On the plus side, the dollar has been weak, and that should improve the trade deficit, particularly the non-oil side, and that will be a significant positive for the economy.
"
2623,ARNC,"It also means that the foreign operations of U.S. companies will be much more profitable when the results are measured in dollars. Inflation, other than in food and energy, is well contained, and that should let the Fed stay on Easy Street as far as monetary policy is concerned.Scorecard & Earnings SurpriseFourth quarter season done, and the first quarter season starting. So far, 26 (5.2%) of S&P 500 reports in. Off to a strong start, with year-over-year growth of 22.7% -- a 5.67 surprise ratio, and 2.86% median surprise. The fourth quarter was a somewhat better than “normal earnings season: 30.7% year-over-year growth, median surprise of 3.61%, and a 3.14 surprise ratio (345 beats, 110 misses). 69.0% of all firms beat expectations.Positive year-over-year growth for 23 firms, falling EPS for 3 -- a 7.67 ratio; 88.5% of all firms reporting have higher EPS than last year.Very early -- the percentages and ratios will change dramatically over next few weeks.In 4Q, Energy and Materials led in surprises, but Autos, Conglomerates and Tech also had median surprises of over 6%; Transportation, Utilities and Construction relatively disappointing.
"
2624,ARNC,"Historically, a “normal earnings season will have a surprise ratio of about 3:1 and a median surprise of about 3.0%. Thus in the early going we are doing much better than average on the median front, and about average on the ratio front. Early on the ratios and medians can be very volatile, but it looks like an OK start to things. Pay attention to the percent reporting in evaluating the significance of the sector numbers.Scorecard & Earnings Surprise 4Q Reported Income Surprises Yr/YrGrowth %Reported SurpriseMedian EPSSurpPos EPSSurpNeg #GrowPos #GrowNegFinance 481.15% 1.28% 58.49 1 0 1 0Industrial Products 20.41% 4.76% 13.89 1 0 1 0Consumer Discretionary 2.40% 6.25% 8.36 1 1 1 1Consumer Staples 11.61% 11.11% 6.17 3 0 4 0Computer and Tech 25.86% 8.33% 4.26 4 1 5 1Business Service 6.50% 5.26% 2.86 1 0 1 0Retail/Wholesale 10.80% 18.18% 2.07 5 0 8 0Basic Materials 7.64% 4.35% 1.63 1 0 1 0Construction -57.14% 9.09% 0.00 0 0 0 1Transportation 7.11% 11.11% -1.22 0 1 1 0Medical NA NA NA NA NA NA NAAuto NA NA NA NA NA NA NAConglomerates NA NA NA NA NA NA NAAerospace NA NA NA NA NA NA NAOils and Energy NA NA NA NA NA NA NAUtilities NA NA NA NA NA NA NAS&P 500 22.73% 5.20% 2.86 17 3 23 3Sales SurprisesStrong revenue start, revenue growth of 9.50% among the 26 that have reported, median surprise 0.77%, surprise ratio of 2.71.

2627,ARNC,"The first table below shows the S&P 500 firms with the biggest increases in their FY1 (mostly 2010) mean estimate over the last 4 weeks.  The second shows the largest declines. To qualify, there must be more than 3 estimates for FY1, and have a mean estimate of more than $0.50.
"
2628,ARNC,"In addition to the change in the mean estimate, the net percentage of estimates being raised is shown for both FY1 and FY2, as well as the P/E ratios based on each year’s earnings is shown.
"
2629,ARNC,"Note that estimate momentum and value are not mutually exclusive. The most interesting of these firms will be where the net revisions percentage (#up-#dn/Tot) is more than 0.50 but less than 1.00. Big mean estimate changes based on a handful of individual revisions are suspect, but could prove to be the most interesting if other analysts follow suit.

2633,ARNC,"The first quarter earnings season “officially gets underway next week when Alcoa (AA) reports, but it will be a slow start. A total of just 50 firms are due to report. However, eleven of those are members of the S&P 500.
"
2634,ARNC,"The fourth quarter earnings season was a strong one, and this week should start to provide clues if that will be true for the first quarter as well. While few in number, some of the firms that are reporting are very significant ones, and they represent an interesting cross section of the economy. In addition to Alcoa, the firms reporting next week include: Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), Google (GOOG), J.P. Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Mattel (MAT) and Hasbro (HAS).
"
2635,ARNC,"One relatively obscure firm whose earnings are particularly noteworthy is Fastenal (FAST  -  Free Report), because as the premier maker of fasteners, like bolts and screws, which go into a multitude of other products, it is a good barometer of the overall health of the economy.
"
2636,ARNC,"The earnings reports will be few but significant. The economic reports will be both frequent AND significant. We start out with data on both deficits, trade and budget. It is appropriate that the budget deficit data comes out the same week as tax day which finishes up the week.
"
2637,ARNC,"The end of the week will also bring the CPI and data on Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization. We will also get the retail sales and PPI data next week, along with a Fed Beige Book. This schedule is based on the presumption that there will be no government shutdown. If there is one, many of these reports will be delayed until it is over.MondayNothing of particular significance.TuesdayThe Trade deficit is expected to have increased to $45.7 billion in March from $46.3 billion in February. That is very bad news since a rising trade deficit slows economic growth. Most of the increase is likely to have come from higher oil prices. The non-oil trade deficit probably declined due to the effects of a weaker dollar. Oil, however, is responsible for more than half of our total trade deficit, and higher oil prices mean a higher trade deficit. It is the trade deficit, not the budget deficit, that is responsible for our increasing indebtedness to the rest of the world and is a much more serious economic problem, particularly in the short term.The Budget deficit is expected to have jumped to $189.0 billion in February from $65.4 billion a year ago. The budget deficit numbers are extremely seasonal, but are not seasonally adjusted. Thus month to month comparisons are worse than useless. Much of the increase will be attributable to the deal in the lame duck session that continued the high end of the Bush tax cuts and also cut payroll taxes by 2% this year.WednesdayRetail Sales are expected to have increased by 0.5% (seasonally adjusted) in March after rising 1.0%% in February. This is a broad measure of retail sales, not just activity at the malls. Most significantly, it includes auto sales, which while recovering, were weaker in March than they were in February. Excluding autos, retail sales are expected to have been up 0.7% after rising 0.7% in February. While the numbers are adjusted for seasonal variations like the number of shopping days, they are not adjusted for inflation. As such, some of the “strength in retail sales will probably come from gas stations, and not due to a sudden rise in the number of people eating hot dogs off the rollers and drinking 44oz fountain drinks.The Federal Reserve’s Beige Book is due out. It is a collection of mostly anecdotal information from each of the 12 Federal Reserve Districts across the country. It is likely to conclude that the economy is still expanding at a moderate pace, but might warn of pricing pressures from higher commodity prices, especially for energy.Business Inventories are expected to have increased by 0.9% in March, matching the February rise. In the fourth quarter, inventory liquidation significantly slowed economic growth, and it looks like that is likely to reverse in the first quarter. While that will help the headline growth number, growth that comes from inventory gains are very low quality.Thursday Weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance come out. After being extremely erratic over the holidays, they have started to fall significantly, but are still bouncing around a bit. Last week they fell by 10,000 to 382,000, but only after a big upward revision to the previous week. I would expect the downward trend in claims to continue next week. The consensus is looking for initial claims to remain rise slightly to 385,000. We may have another situation where last week is revised higher, but the current week falls. A level of 385,000 seems pretty good compared to the experience of the last few years. After a huge downtrend from mid-April through the end of 2009, initial claims were locked in a tight “trading range for most of 2010. We now appear to have broken out of that trading range to the downside. This could well indicate that the economy is about to start producing a significant number of new jobs. The four-week moving average (which smooths out the week to week noise) was under the 400,000 for the sixth week in a row. Historically that has been an inflection point at which the economy starts to add significant numbers of jobs.Continuing claims have also in a downtrend of late, but the road down has been bumpy. Last week they fell by 9,000 to 3.723 million. That is down 906,000 from a year ago. I would expect a further decline this week. The consensus is looking for a level of 3.700 million. Some of the longer-term decline due to people simply exhausting their regular state benefits which run out after 26 weeks.  Those, however, don’t last forever either. Federally paid extended claims fell by 91,000 to 4.271 million, and are down by 1.467 million over the last year. Looking at just the regular continuing claims numbers is a serious mistake. They only include a little over half of the unemployed now given the unprecedentedly high duration of unemployment figures. A better measure is the total number of people getting unemployment benefits, currently at 8.524 million, which is down 296,000 from last week (there are some timing issues so the change in continuing and existing claims does not exactly match the change in the total). The total number of people getting benefits is now 2.543 million below year ago levels. What is not known is how many people have left the extended claims via the road to prosperity, finding a new job, and how many have left on the road to poverty, having simply exhausted even the extended benefits. Make sure to look at both sets of numbers! Many of the press reports will not, but we will here at Zacks.The Producer Price Index (PPI) is expected to have increased by 1.0% in March, down from the 1.6% increase it posted in February. Most of the increases are likely to come from higher food and especially energy prices. Stripping out those volatile components and the increase is expected to be only 0.2%, matching a 0.2% increase last month. Those numbers are for finished goods. The report also includes data on prices further up the production chain. Most likely the increases at the intermediate and crude levels of production will be higher, indicating potential price pressures down the road. Inflation has generally been higher at the producer level than at the consumer level. In theory, that should indicate some pressure on corporate profit margins, but so far we have seen very little evidence of this happening as net margins continue to rise dramatically. The rapid rise in productivity and falling unit labor costs have more than offset rising input costs.FridayWe get what I think is one of the most important reports of the week, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization. Industrial production is expected to have increased by 0.6% in March, after it declined 0.1% in February. The headline number can sometimes be distorted by the weather, as it includes the output of Utilities. It is thus best to look at what is happening in just manufacturing output as well as the overall number. In February, manufacturing output was up 0.4%.  Capacity Utilization can suffer from the same weather related problems that Industrial Production can. Still, it is a very good gauge of the economy, particularly if one just looks at factory utilization. Since the end of the recession, capacity utilization has staged a dramatic comeback, but that is from disastrously low levels. It is expected to come in at 77.4%, up from the 76.3% level in February (overall, factory only consistently runs slightly below the overall number) is about as low as we got at the bottom of most recessions prior to the Great Recession. There is no consensus estimate for just manufacturing capacity utilization, but last month it rose to 74.3% from 74.1% in January. I would expect continuing slow progress on that front, probably around 74.6%. It indicates that there is still very significant slack in the economy and provides the green light to the Fed to keep the Fed Funds rate pegged at zero and to fully implement the $600 billion QE2 program.The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is expected to rise by 0.3% in March, down from a 0.5% January rise. Inflation has been very tame over the last year. Most of the rise is expected to come from the volatile food and energy components of the index. Stripping them out to get to the core CPI, the increase is expected to be only 0.2%, matching a 0.2% rise in January. Rent and Owners Equivalent Rent together make up over 30% of the overall CPI and more than 40% of core CPI and are likely to be either unchanged or up just 0.1% as they have been for the last year or so, thus keeping the overall increase in inflation very low. Inflation, particularly core inflation, is not a significant economic problem at this point. Efforts to combat it aggressively are misguided, since those measures will tend to make real economic problems, like unemployment, much worse.The University of Michigan Consumer sentiment index is expected to dip to 66.0 from 67.5. That is well off the bottom, but we probably need to see it get much closer to 90 to indicate the economy is back to being healthy. I am not a big fan of this number, or the related Consumer Confidence number. With the Consumer representing over 70% of the economy, theoretically these numbers should be vital. The problem is that what consumers say in these surveys, and what they subsequently do, are often very different.The Empire State Index is likely to fall slightly from its February level of 17.5 to about 15.0. It is sort of a mini-ISM, just covering New York State, only with zero as the dividing line between expansion and contraction. Thus the economy is expected to continue to expand in NY but at a slower pace than last month.Tax day, get them done, or file for the extension.

"
2646,ARNC,"With earnings season just around the corner, here's an options strategy that's perfect for a company about to report.  
"
2647,ARNC,"A straddle involves buying both a call and a put at the same strike price (at-the-money) at the same time.  
"
2648,ARNC,"With options, you buy a call if you expect the market to go up. And you buy a put if you expect the market to go down. A straddle, however, is a strategy to use when you're not sure which way the market will go, but you believe something big will happen in either direction.  
"
2649,ARNC,"For example, let's say you expect a big move to occur, either up or down, based on whether the company reports a positive surprise or a negative surprise. With these strategies, you can make money in either direction without having to worry about whether you guessed correctly or not.  
"
2650,ARNC,"For example: let's say a stock was trading at $100 a few days before their earnings announcement. So you decide to put on a straddle by buying: the $100 strike calland the $100 strike put
"
2651,ARNC,"Because you only plan on being in the trade for a few days (to maybe a few weeks), you decide to get into the soon-to-expire options.  
"
2652,ARNC,"Note: usually, I'll advocate buying more time and getting in-the-money options.  And I still do -- when playing one side of the market.  
"
2653,ARNC,"But when playing both sides of the market simultaneously for an event you expect to take place in the near immediacy, the opposite is best. Why? Because at expiration your profit is the difference between how much your options are in-the-money minus what you paid for them. So if you don't need a lot of time, this keeps the cost down and your profit potential up.   
"
2654,ARNC,"If you paid $150 for an at-the-money call option that will expire shortly and another $150 for an at-the-money put option that will expire shortly, your cost to put on the trade was $300 (not including transactions costs). If that stock shot up $10 as a result of a positive earnings surprise, that call option that you paid $150 for would now be worth $1,000. And that put option would be worth zero ($0).
"
2655,ARNC,"So let's do the math: if the call, which is now $10 in-the-money, is worth $1,000; then subtract the $150 you paid, and that gives you an $850 profit on the call.  
"
2656,ARNC,"The put, on the other hand, is out-of-the-money, and is worth nothing, which means you lost $150 on the put.  
"
2657,ARNC,"Add it all together, and on a $300 investment, you just made a profit of $700. Pretty goodespecially for not even knowing which way the stock would even go.  
"
2658,ARNC,"However, if you paid more for each side of the trade, those would be extra costs to overcome. But by keeping each side's cost as small as reasonably possible, that leaves more profit potential on the winning side and a smaller loss on the losing side. 
"
2659,ARNC,"Moreover, if the stock stays flat (in other words, the big move you expect doesn't materialize, thus resulting in both sides of the trade expiring worthless), your cost of the trade was kept to a minimum.  
"
2660,ARNC,"So buying a straddle by its very nature should be looked at as a short-term trade. If the outcome of the event that prompted you to get into the straddle in the first place now has you strongly believing that a continuation of the upmove or downmove is in order, you could then exit the straddle and move into the one-sided call or put and apply the in-the-money and more-time rules for those.

2664,ARNC,"Overview
"
2665,ARNC,"The Metals & Mining industry encompasses the extraction (mining) as well as the primary and secondary processing of metals and minerals such as aluminum, gold, precious metals, coal and steel. The industry is oligarchic in structure, with a few producers accounting for the lion’s share of the output.
"
2666,ARNC,"The largest segment of the global metals market is iron and steel, followed by aluminum. The iron and steel segment comprises more than half the industry in terms of volume. This industry includes metal ore exploration and mining services, as well as iron and steel foundries for smelting, rolling, forging, spinning, recycling, stamping, polishing and plating of iron and steel products such as pipes, tubes, wire, spring, rolls and bars.
"
2667,ARNC,"The precious metal and mineral industry consists of companies engaged in the extraction and primary processing of gold, silver, platinum, diamond, semi-precious stones, uranium and other rare minerals and ores, along with the cultivation of pearls.
"
2668,ARNC,"Historically, the automotive and construction markets have been the largest consumers of metals, accounting for more than 50% of total demand. Other metal consumers include energy, electrical equipment, agricultural, domestic and commercial equipment and industrial machinery. Large automakers such as General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report), Ford Motor Co. (F  -  Free Report), Toyota Motor Corp (TM  -  Free Report) and Honda Motor Co. Ltd (HMC  -  Free Report) are big consumers of metals, chiefly of steel and aluminum.Overall Outlook
"
2669,ARNC,"The global metal industry is cyclical, highly competitive and has historically been characterized by overcapacity (excess of supply over demand). Metal producers are subject to cyclical fluctuations in London Metal Exchange prices, general economic conditions and end-use markets. Individual company profitability depends on volume and operating efficiency. Large producers with huge resources are able to discover and develop new deposits, thereby boosting reserves, while the smaller ones devote their attention own fewer mines.
"
2670,ARNC,"Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) have historically been a critically important growth strategy for mining companies. 2009 experienced a lull in M&A activity under the impact of the global economic downturn with deal value almost halving compared with 2008. The focus for M&A activity shifted from business growth to business survival, as companies looked to safeguard their teetering balance sheets rather than seeking expansion.
"
2671,ARNC,"However, reversing the trend, 2010 witnessed a surge in mining deals as the rise in commodity prices, economic recovery, demand in developing markets, growing scarcity of resources and refreshed balance sheets spurred merger activity.
"
2672,ARNC,"We expect the momentum in M&A to be maintained in 2011. Armed with healthy balance sheets and with reduced economic uncertainty, we expect the companies in the industry to accelerate deal activity with renewed focus on consolidation. This would ensure raw materials supply and expand the frontiers of such mining companies into growth markets.
"
2673,ARNC,"In an industry plagued with rising energy and raw material costs, increasing productivity and reducing costs are the keys to success. Given the cyclical nature of the metals industry, low-volume, high-cost producers need to generate sufficient cash or ensure a strong borrowing position during market peaks to survive the market troughs.
"
2674,ARNC,"Continuing consolidation supports the sector’s ability to influence the price of input costs and companies can also obtain synergies and economies of scale through the operation of vertically integrated raw materials sources. Expansion in low-cost countries will ensure lower labor costs and also help tap their growth potential.
"
2675,ARNC,"Geographically, the Asia-Pacific region, in particular China and India, is witnessing higher production and consumption of metals. Per capita consumption levels in both these countries are calibrating to U.S./European levels, which could, theoretically at least, double metal demand in the longer term. China is the world’s largest consumer of metals and is expected to remain so. Further, developed regions such as the US and Europe are showing signs of recovery. Overall, we expect global metal demand to improve in the long term with the recovery of user industries.
"
2676,ARNC,"Demand as well as production for industrial metals in Japan has been recently affected as factories have been shut down in the aftermath of the country’s earthquake and Tsunami. Japan is the biggest buyer of aluminum and the second largest buyer of copper ore. We, however, believe that metal demand will be boosted by the construction industry triggered by the country’s reconstruction efforts.A Detailed Look into Metals
"
2677,ARNC,"Steel
"
2678,ARNC,"As the major shareholder (about 60%) of the metals market, the steel industry was severely bruised by the global economic downturn. However, according to the World Steel Association, world crude steel production in 2010 reached a record 1,414 million metric tons (mmt), a 15% increase compared with 2009. All the major steel-producing countries and regions showed double-digit growth in 2010.
"
2679,ARNC,"The U.S. produced 80.6 mmt of crude steel, 38.5% higher than 2009. U.S’s share of world steel production improved to 5.7% from 4.7% in 2009 catapulting the country to the third position in 2010 from the 5th rank in 2009. The growth trend continues in January 2011 with world crude steel production increasing 5.3% to 119 mmt from January 2010 levels. United States crude steel production rose smartly by 9.4% to 6.8 mmt compared with January 2010.
"
2680,ARNC,"Reflecting on 2010 data, we see a sharp increase in revenues and shipments across most companies. Sales of ArcelorMittal (MT  -  Free Report), the world’s largest steel-producing company, increased 28% to $78 billion and a 22% jump in steel shipments. Sales for United States Steel Corp. (X  -  Free Report) soared 57% to $17.4 billion and steel shipments went up 49% to 22 million tons. Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report) recorded sales increase of 42% to reach $15.8 billion with shipments increasing 25%. Steel Dynamics Inc. (STLD  -  Free Report) reported a 59% increase in revenues to generate $6 billion with shipments rising 33% to 5.3 million tons.
"
2681,ARNC,"In terms of profitability, ArcelorMittal stood tall with its fiscal 2010 EPS of $1.93, a substantial improvement over 11 cents in 2009. Nucor and Steel Dynamics reversed their year-ago losses to earn a respective 42 cents and 64 cents per share. United States Steel, though remaining in the loss territory, narrowed its fiscal 2010 loss per share to $3.36 from the year-ago loss of $10.42.
"
2682,ARNC,"The steel industry is emerging from the gloom of the global recession as is evident from the above figures. However, given its economic sensitivity, we expect global steel demand to improve only gradually, in line with the recovery in the user industries, especially automotive and residential construction.
"
2683,ARNC,"Although steel prices have been stabilizing since the latter part of 2009, it is significantly below the pre-crisis level. We believe that a sustained recovery in steel prices remains uncertain in the backdrop of sluggish economic activity.
"
2684,ARNC,"Currently, Steel Dynamics has a Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) for the short-term (1 to 3 months) while U.S. Steel holds a Zacks #2 Rank (Buy). ArcelorMittal currently retains a Zacks Rank #3 Rank (Hold). We maintain our Neutral recommendation in the long term for ArcelorMittal and United Steel while we have recently upgraded our long-term recommendation on Nucor from Neutral to Outperform, given its upbeat first quarter guidance.
"
2685,ARNC,"Gold
"
2686,ARNC,"As per the World Gold Council, gold prices rose for the tenth consecutive year in 2010, ascribed to recovery in key sectors of demand and continued global economic uncertainty. In 2010, gold prices jumped 29%, reaching $1,405 per ounce as of December's end.
"
2687,ARNC,"During 2010, the price of gold rose to record levels on several occasions, trading as high as $1,420 per ounce. Gold’s performance was strong and volatility remained low. The World Gold Council suggests that the increase was not only driven by driven by inflationary forces but was also inflated as both the private and public sectors of India and China rushed into the gold market.
"
2688,ARNC,"Gold demand went up 9% over 2009, showcasing a 10-year high of 3,912.2 tons, driven by the rise in jewelry demand, the revival of the Indian market and strong momentum in Chinese gold demand. Moreover, central banks became net purchasers of gold for the first time in 21 years, hiking the demand for the yellow metal.
"
2689,ARNC,"Major demand came from India and China. India bought 746 tons, a 69% increase over 2009, and China bought 400 tons of gold of jewelry. China bought 179.9 tons of gold in the form of bars and coin, a 70% increase over 2009.
"
2690,ARNC,"Gold remained a coveted asset given its long-term supply and demand dynamics and influenced by macro-economic factors. Concerns regarding economic growth in developed countries made gold an attractive and safe investment option. The European sovereign debt crisis made European investors use gold as a currency hedge. Pressure on the US dollar against various currencies coupled with higher inflation expectations in many countries, including India and China, also pushed up gold prices.
"
2691,ARNC,"The value and wealth preservation attributes of gold continue to attract investors and consumers. Jewelry and investment demand in non-Western markets continues to rebound while industrial demand has started to recover in response to an improvement in economic conditions. India, which alone consumes nearly 45%−50% of the world gold production, should drive demand for gold along with China. Chinese gold demand is expected to double in 10 years.
"
2692,ARNC,"Even though gold price dropped 7% in January this year, it again recorded a rise in February. We believe gold demand and prices will strengthen in 2011. As China and India continue to grow rapidly, their demand for gold will also rise in tandem.
"
2693,ARNC,"Higher prices bode well for gold producers, which should benefit giants such as Barrick Gold Corporation (ABX  -  Free Report), Agnico-Eagle (AEM  -  Free Report) and Goldcorp Inc. (GG). However, gold producers like Newmont Mining (NEM) and Kinross Gold Corporation (KGC  -  Free Report) suffer from lower ore grades that subdue production levels, increase mining costs and offset the benefits of rising gold prices.
"
2694,ARNC,"Overall, the stock prices of gold producers are not expected to benefit much from this favorable commodity-price backdrop. This is reflected in our overall long-term neutral view on the space. As major economies continue to recover, investors’ confidence will be restored to invest in stock markets, which could cause gold prices to fall. However this is not going to happen in the near future. We have a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) on Barrick Gold, Agnico-Eagle, Goldcorp and Kinross Gold Corporation. However, Newmont Mining has a Zacks #4 Rank (Sell).Aluminum
"
2695,ARNC,"The aluminum industry is highly cyclical, with prices subject to worldwide supply and demand forces along with other influences. The global economic downturn had a historic, negative impact on the aluminum industry, leading to an unprecedented decline in LME-based aluminum prices, weak end markets, fall in demand, increased global inventories, and higher costs of borrowing and diminished credit availability. The economy has however recovered from the crisis of the economic downturn.Alcoa Inc. (AA), the world leader in the production and management of primary aluminum, in response to the global economic downturn implemented a number of operational and financial actions to improve its cost structure and liquidity, including curtailing production, halting non-critical capital expenditures, accelerating new sourcing strategies for raw materials, divesting non-core assets, reducing global headcount, suspending its share repurchase program, reducing its quarterly common stock dividend and resorting to other liquidity enhancements.
"
2696,ARNC,"In the first half of 2011, Alcoa plans to restart certain idled potlines at three smelters. These restarts are expected to increase Alcoa’s aluminum production by 137 kmt during 2011 and by 204 kmt on an annual basis thereafter. Such measures are surely to meet anticipated growth in aluminum demand.
"
2697,ARNC,"Alcoa expects demand for aluminum to grow 12% this year. China, India, Brazil and Russia are all expected to register double-digit increases in aluminum demand. Market conditions for aluminum products in all global markets are expected to improve, particularly in aerospace, automotive and industrial gas turbine. On the cost side, however, energy prices and currency movements are expected to keep posting challenges. Overall, Alcoa believes that the long-term prospects for aluminum remain bright and envisions that global demand for aluminum will double by 2020.
"
2698,ARNC,"Since the sudden decline from peak prices in mid-2008, aluminum prices have increased over the last 2 years. In 2010, global aluminum prices have increased 13%. Alcoa increased its fiscal 2010 profit on the back of higher prices and continued strengthening in most end markets. Aluminum Corporation of China, or Chalco (ACH) swung back to profit in 2010 after posting a loss in 2009, attributable to increased global aluminum prices.
"
2699,ARNC,"In the medium-to-long term, aluminum consumption will improve globally with improving automotive and packaging industries, one of the key consumer markets. Aluminum is widely used for packaging, beverage cans, food containers and foil products. The automobile market is also becoming increasingly aluminum intensive, benefiting from the recyclability and the light weight of the metal.
"
2700,ARNC,"Further, the surge in copper price this year is triggering a switch among manufacturers aluminum. Automobiles, air conditioners and industrial components manufacturers are now shifting toward the much economical aluminum.
"
2701,ARNC,"We expect aluminum demand to increase in the long term, outstripping supply growth with the improving end-markets. China and India are undergoing rapid industrialization. Both these factors are positive for underlying aluminum demand. Leading aluminum producers such as Alcoa, Paramount Gold and Silver Corporation (PZG) and Aluminum Corporation of China should benefit from the improving demand outlook.
"
2702,ARNC,"Currently, Alcoa, Paramount Gold and Silver all hold a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) supported by our long-term Neutral recommendation.Copper
"
2703,ARNC,"Copper prices have shown a rising trend in 2010 benefitting copper producers like Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) and Southern Copper Corporation (SCCO). Although copper demand was down 10% year over year in 2009, global copper demand is seen to be growing again.
"
2704,ARNC,"Chinese demand for copper was still robust and imports of the metal were rebounding, which was supported by steady construction and infrastructure activity in the country. The improvement in copper prices would be supported by limited supply and increased demand from China.
"
2705,ARNC,"With copper prices at near all-time highs, outlook for copper prices is still strong. Not denying volatility in prices that are bound to remain, we have a bullish stance on copper prices, long term. However, as discussed earlier, manufacturers might now resort to aluminum as a substitute. Market conditions are expected to be positive for copper in the next couple of years due to higher consumption of the metal in the developing nations. Companies that have a high leverage to copper prices will benefit immensely from the potential demand for the metal in the developing markets.
"

2707,ARNC,"Key Points:4Q earnings season going strong, with 312 reports in, median surprise of 4.39% and surprise ratio of 3.42 for EPS, 1.44% and 2.48 for revenues.Reported (312 firms) fourth quarter earnings growth of 29.3%, expected (188 firms) year over year growth of 26.7% for the firms yet to report. On Revenue side, 8.50% growth reported, but decline of 1.74% expected for those yet to report.Reported net margins (312 firms) rise to 9.79% from 8.22% a year ago, down from 10.01% in third quarter. Margins excluding financials rise to 8.69% from 7.85% last year and 8.71% in third quarter.Net margins expected (188 firms) to expand to 7.18% (among yet to report) from 5.56% a year ago, and from 6.97% in third quarter. Excluding Financials, margins expected to rise to 6.53% from 6.45% a year ago, but down from 7.04% in the third quarter.Full-year total earnings for the S&P 500 expected to jump 43.7% in 2010, 14.8% further in 2011. Growth to continue in 2012 with total net income expected to rise 12.2%.Total revenues for the S&P 500 expected to rise 5.75% in 2010, 5.76% in 2011, and 4.99% in 2012. Excluding Financials, revenues expected to be up 9.33% in 2010, 7.06% in 2011 and 5.22% in 2012.Net Margins marching higher, from 5.88% in 2008 to 6.42% in 2009 to 8.73% expected for 2010, 9.48% expected for 2011 and 10.12% in 2012. Major source of earnings growth. Net margins ex-Financials 7.79% in 2008, 7.13% in 2009, 8.23% expected for 2010, 8.76% in 2011 and 9.35% in 2012.Revisions ratio for full S&P 500 at 1.88 for 2011, at 1.83 for 2012, both very bullish readings. Ratio of firms with rising to falling mean estimates at 1.88 for 2011, 1.66 for 2012, also very positive readings. Total revisions activity expanding rapidly, making the revisions ratios more significant.S&P 500 earned $544.3 billion in 2009, expected to earn $785.3 billion in 2010, $901.7 billion in 2011. In 2012, the 500 are collectively expected to earn $1.0113 Trillion.S&P 500 earned $57.71 in 2009: $82.93 in 2010 and $95.20 in 2011 expected, bottom up. For 2012, $106.79 expected in early read. Puts P/Es at 15.8x for 2010, and 13.7x for 2011 and 12.2x for 2012.Another Impressive Season
"
2708,ARNC,"The 4th quarter earnings season is more than halfway done. We now have 312, or 62.4%, of the S&P 500 reports in. However, the early reporting firms tend to be a bit bigger and more profitable than the stragglers, and those 312 firms actually represent 75.3% of the total expected net income. That, of course, presupposes that all the remaining firms report exactly as expected, which is unlikely. But it shouldn’t be too far off as those 206 firms also represented 74.9% of all the net income a year ago.
"
2709,ARNC,"The reports are encouraging, with total net income for those firms rising 29.3% over a year ago. The early median surprise of 4.39% is also fairly strong, although the ratio of positive to negative surprises is only somewhat above normal at just 3.42. The total net income growth of the reporting firms is a slight slowdown from the 32.2% growth those same firms posted in the third quarter.Big Profits Report Early
"
2710,ARNC,"It seems the higher growers reported early. The expectations are that the remaining 188 firms will post total net income that is 26.9% than a year ago. That is a big acceleration from the year-over-year growth of the third quarter of 7.47%. It now looks like the final year-over-year growth will be 28.7%, up from the implied level of 25.8% as of last week.
"
2711,ARNC,"Given that positive earnings surprises almost always outnumber disappointments, that number implies that the remaining firms would have a median surprise of 0.00 and a surprise ratio of 1.00, which is also highly unlikely. Thus growth will be close to 30% when all is said and done for the quarter. At the very start of earnings season, the expected growth was under 20%.Revenues Expected Lighter
"
2712,ARNC,"Revenue growth though is expected to slow down significantly, actually falling 1.74%, down from positive growth of 8.18% those 188 firms reported in the third quarter. On the other hand, revenue growth among those that have reported is very healthy at 8.50%, actually higher than the 8.12% growth those 312 firms reported in the third quarter.
"
2713,ARNC,"Looking ahead to the first quarter, though, those firms are expected to post year-over-year revenue growth of just 5.12%. If the Financials are excluded, reported revenue growth is 8.98%, up from 8.39% in the third quarter, and slowing to 5.31% in the first quarter. Tougher year-over-year comparisons are a bigger part of the story. However, as I mentioned above, revenue surprises have been quite strong so far, with a median revenue surprise of 1.44%.Net Margin Expansion
"
2714,ARNC,"Thus, the stellar earnings growth is mostly due to the continued expansion of net margins. Much of the year over year margin expansion is due to the Financials, were the whole concept of revenues is a bit different from most companies, and thus the concept of net margins is also a bit different.
"
2715,ARNC,"Much of the earnings growth in the Financials has come from firms setting aside less for bad debts than they did last year. One should be a bit on the doubtful side about the quality of those earnings, particularly in the absence of mark to market accounting.
"
2716,ARNC,"Among those that have reported, net margins are 9.79%, or 8.69% if one excludes the Financials, up from 8.22% (7.85% excluding Financials) a year ago, but down from 10.01% (8.71% excluding Financials) in the third quarter. The expected net margin for the remainder is 7.18% (6.53% excluding Financials) up from 5.56% (6.45% ex-Financials) last year.
"
2717,ARNC,"Net margins continue to march northward on a yearly basis. In 2008, overall net margins were just 5.88%, rising to 6.42% in 2009. They are expected to hit 8.73% in 2010 and continue climbing to 9.48% in 2011 and 10.12% in 2012. The pattern is a bit different, particularly during the recession if the Financials are excluded, as margins fell from 7.78% in 2008 to 7.13% in 2009, but have started a robust recovery and are expected to be 8.23% in 2010, 8.76% in 2011 and 9.35% in 2012.
"
2718,ARNC,"A Look Ahead to Fiscal 2011 & Beyond
"
2719,ARNC,"The expectations for the full year are very healthy, with total net income for 2010 expected to rise to $785.3 billion in 2010, up from $544.3 billion in 2009. In 2011, the total net income for the S&P 500 should be $901.7 billion, or increases of 43.7% and 14.8%, respectively.
"
2720,ARNC,"The early expectation is for 2012 to have total net income passing the $1 Trillion mark to $1.0113 Trillion. That will also put the “EPS for the S&P 500 over the $100 “per share level for the first time at $106.79. That is up from $57.71 for 2009, $82.93 for 2010, and $95.20 for 2011. In an environment where the 10-year T-note is yielding 3.63%, a P/E of 15.8x based on 2010 and 13.7x based on 2011 earnings looks attractive. The P/E based on 2012 earnings is 12.2x.
"
2721,ARNC,"With almost two 2011 estimates being raised for each one being cut (revisions ratio of 1.88), one has to feel confident that the current expectations for 2011 will be hit, and more likely exceeded. Analysts are raising their 2012 projections at almost the same rate, with a revisions ratio of 1.83. While a lot can happen between now and the time the 2012 earnings are all in, upward estimate momentum means that the current 2012 earnings are more likely to be exceeded than for them to fall short.
"
2722,ARNC,"This provides a strong fundamental backing for the market to continue to move higher. The bullish argument is further boosted by such historical factors such as being in the third year of the presidential cycle (almost always the best of the four) and having a Democrat in the White House and the GOP at least partially in charge at the other end of Pennsylvania Ave. While there is not a huge sample size of years with that political alignment, those that exist were very good ones for the stock market.A Few Caveats
"
2723,ARNC,"On the other hand there is a very real prospect of total political gridlock, which would greatly raise uncertainty about governmental policy and the strength of the economy that could undermine confidence. As Shakespeare said: “Beware the ides of March."" That is approximately when the U.S. will hit its current debt ceiling.
"
2724,ARNC,"If it is not raised, the U.S. government could go into at least a technical default on its debt, and the government would probably have to shut down (not immediately as there are a few games that can be played, but if it were to last for more than a few weeks, shutdown and default is likely). That is hardly something that will inspire confidence in the markets.
"
2725,ARNC,"While it is inconceivable that it will not eventually be passed, it is an opportunity for major political theater, and there is a chance that there will be a delay between the debt ceiling being hit and when it gets raised.
"
2726,ARNC,"The economy does seem to have made a slow turn towards recovery. However, job creation remains very sluggish. That is particularly true if one goes by the establishment survey, which has shown only 157,000 jobs created over the last two months. The household survey has been much more upbeat, showing growth of 414,000 jobs over the same period, and the largest two month drop in the unemployment rate since 1958.
"
2727,ARNC,"Most of the real growth in the economy has come from higher productivity, not more hours being worked. Those productivity gains are accruing to capital, not labor. That was seen again in the fourth quarter productivity report where productivity rose at 2.6% while unit labor costs dropped 0.6%. This is a major reason behind the rising net margins, and resulting strong earnings growth.  
"
2728,ARNC,"Record Levels by Mid-Next Year?
"
2729,ARNC,"Companies are expected to continue growing their earnings nicely, and the 14.8% expected growth for 2011, if achieved, means that the total earnings for the S&P 500 should hit a new record by the middle of next year. Solid growth of 12.2% is expected to continue into 2012. With analysts, on balance, raising estimates for 2011 and 2012, increases the odds that that growth will be achieved.
"
2730,ARNC,"Growth of 14.8% is not exactly awful. Even on the revenue side the expected growth in 2011 of 5.75%, or 9.33% if one excludes the Financial sector is very solid. Clearly the analytical community is not expecting the economy to turn south again.Scorecard & Earnings SurpriseSo far, 312 firms (62.4%) have reported. So far, so good. Median surprise of 4.39%, and a 3.42 surprise ratio (222 beats, 65 misses), 71.2% of all firms beat expectations.More than half of all reports in for 13 sectors, more than three quarters in for five sectors.Positive year-over-year growth for 240, falling EPS for 71 firms (a 3.38 ratio), 76.9% of all firms reporting have higher EPS than last year.Total net income up 29.3% among those that have reported. Materials and Energy both have double-digit median surprises, Conglomerates and Construction also strong. Autos and Utilities in negative territory.
"
2731,ARNC,"Historically, a “normal earnings season will have a surprise ratio of about 3:1 and a median surprise of about 3.0%. Thus in the early going we are doing much better than average on the median front, and about average on the ratio front.
"
2732,ARNC,"Early on the ratios and medians can be very volatile.

Excluding Financials, revenues expected rise 5.22% year over year in the fourth quarter. Slowdown from the 7.22% growth posted in the third quarter.Four sectors expected to post lower revenues than a year ago, twelve higher. Revenue for the Financials is a major source of the revenue slowdown. Low interest rates depress interest income, which is a major part of financials revenue, but also reduce interest expense. As a result, revenues at Financials are notoriously flakey.Final year-over-year revenue growth now projected at 5.11%. So far 69.1% of total expected revenues reported.The numbers on this table (and expected earnings and margin tables) exclude the results of all firms that have already reported.

"
2737,ARNC,"The first table below shows the S&P 500 firms with the biggest increases in their FY1 (mostly 2010) mean estimate over the last 4 weeks. The second shows the largest declines. To qualify there must be more than 3 estimates for FY1, and have a mean estimate of more than $0.50. In addition to the change in the mean estimate, the net percentage of estimates being raised is shown for both FY1 and FY2, as well as the P/E ratios based on each year’s earnings is shown.
"
2738,ARNC,"Note that estimate momentum and value are not mutually exclusive. The most interesting of these firms will be where the net revisions percentage (#up-#dn/Tot) is more than 0.50 but less than 1.00. Big mean estimate changes based on a handful of individual revisions are suspect, but could prove to be the most interesting if other analysts follow suit. On the other hand if all the analysts have raised their estimates already, the mean estimate is less likely to rise again over the next month.Largest DeclinesBiggest FY1 Revisions(Largest Increases) Company Ticker %ChCurr Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  %ChNext Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  # Up-Dn/Tot%ChCurr Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  # Up-Dn/Tot%ChNext Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  P/E usingCurr FY Est P/E usingNext FY EstUtd States Stl X 31.13% 8.14% 0.67 0.56 15.57 10.66Alcoa Inc AA 21.59% 11.68% 0.40 0.33 12.24 10.69Keycorp New KEY 19.46% 7.08% 0.68 0.20 14.15 11.71Apple Inc AAPL 18.33% 15.45% 0.96 0.71 14.73 12.98Adv Micro Dev AMD 15.71% 2.82% 0.55 0.23 14.28 10.74Western Digital WDC 15.67% 8.05% 0.72 0.38 11.30 9.03Wynn Resrts Ltd WYNN 12.76% 17.31% 0.61 0.53 42.46 31.81Baker-Hughes BHI 12.11% 9.30% 0.77 0.46 18.57 14.62Anadarko Petrol APC 11.87% 7.35% 0.41 0.25 31.84 22.01Forest Labs A FRX 11.85% 5.49% 0.96 0.83 7.35 7.22Marathon Oil Cp MRO 11.81% 7.03% 0.85 0.47 9.28 8.45Rockwell Automt ROK 11.54% 11.66% 0.91 0.83 17.77 15.28Comerica Inc CMA 10.79% -8.53% 0.45 -0.36 19.52 14.67E Trade Finl Cp ETFC 10.06% 4.59% 0.07 -0.15 28.03 16.91Largest DeclinesBiggest FY1 Revisions(Largest Declines) Company Ticker %ChCurr Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  %ChNext Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  # Up-Dn/Tot%ChCurr Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  # Up-Dn/Tot%ChNext Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  P/E usingCurr FY Est P/E usingNext FY EstNoble Corp NE -25.38% -12.12% -0.66 -0.50 14.17 9.07Hudson City Bcp HCBK -17.93% -14.50% -0.87 -0.43 14.40 12.68Goodyear Tire GT -16.46% -0.09% -0.09 0.00 10.44 6.05Radioshack Corp RSH -14.92% -17.20% -0.95 -0.75 8.36 7.79Supervalu Inc SVU -12.88% -18.76% -1.00 -0.80 5.72 6.15Boeing Co BA -11.11% -2.97% -1.00 -0.30 16.94 12.66Textron Inc TXT -6.93% -4.04% -0.40 -0.15 22.46 14.08Bank Of Amer Cp BAC -6.33% -3.82% -0.40 -0.17 9.85 7.14El Paso Corp EP -6.14% -2.96% -0.33 -0.10 15.38 12.74Southwest Air LUV -5.80% -6.49% -0.54 -0.50 13.71 12.36Northern Trust NTRS -5.24% -3.30% -0.50 -0.06 16.91 13.74Owens-Illinois OI -5.12% -4.75% -0.64 -0.27 10.08 8.41Data in this report, unless stated otherwise, is through the close on Thursday 2/03/2011.

2739,ARNC,"We use the convention of referring to the next full fiscal year to be completed as 2010, not all firms are on December fiscal years, this can cause discontinuities in the data, particularly around this time of year. The data is based on FY1, not based on 2011, even though I may call it 2011 in the report. All numbers, including historical ones, reflect the current composition of the S&P 500, thus some historical numbers may differ from those reported by S&P which are based on the composition of the index at the time of the reports.                    
"
2740,ARNC,"Key Points:4Q earnings season off to strong start, with 206 of the S&P 500 reports in, median surprise of 4.28% and surprise ratio of 3.73 for EPS, 1.53% and 2.94 for revenues.Reported (206 firms) fourth quarter earnings growth of 31.2%, expected (294 firms) year-over-year growth of 19.5% for the vast majority of firms yet to report. On the Revenue side, 7.88% growth reported, but decline of 1.37% expected for those yet to report.Reported net margins (206 firms) rise to 10.95% from 9.00% a year ago, down from 11.21% in third quarter. Margins excluding Financials rise to 9.46% from 8.83% last year and 9.59% in third quarter.Net margins expected (294 firms) to expand to 7.31% (among yet to report) from 6.03% a year ago, and from 7.26% in third quarter. Excluding Financials, margins expected to rise to 6.77% from 6.43% a year ago, but down from 7.22% in the third quarter.Full-year total earnings for the S&P 500 expected to jump 43.3% in 2010, 14.7% further in 2011.  Growth to continue in 2012 with total net income expected to rise 12.0%Total revenues for the S&P 500 expected to rise 6.09% in 2010, 4.77% in 2011, and 4.89% in 2012. Excluding Financials, revenues expected to be up 8.99% in 2010, 5.97% in 2011 and 5.45% in 2012.Net Margins marching higher, from 5.88% in 2008 to 6.42% in 2009 to 8.67% expected for 2010, 9.50% expected for 2011 and 10.13% in 2012. Major source of earnings growth. Net margins ex-Financials 7.79% in 2008, 7.13% in 2009, 8.23% expected for 2010, 8.83% in 2011 and 9.39% in 2012.Revisions ratio for full S&P 500 at 1.98 for 2011, at 1.82 for 2012 -- both very bullish readings.  Ratio of firms with rising to falling mean estimates at 2.05 for 2011, 1.66 for 2012, also very positive readings. Total revisions activity expanding rapidly, making the revisions ratios more significant.S&P 500 earned $544.3 billion in 2009, expected to earn $782.9 billion in 2010, $898.1 billion in 2011. In 2012, the 500 are collectively expected to earn $1.0057 Trillion.S&P 500 earned $57.68 in 2009: $82.62 in 2010 and $94.77 in 2011 expected, bottom-up. For 2012, $106.17 expected in early read. Puts P/Es at 15.7x for 2010, and 13.7x for 2011 and 12.2x for 2012.
"
2741,ARNC,"The 4th quarter earnings season is in full swing. We now have 206 or 41.2% of the S&P 500 reports in. However, the early reporting firms tend to be a bit bigger and more profitable than the stragglers, and those 206 firms actually represent 56.3% of the total expected net income.
"
2742,ARNC,"That, of course, presupposes that all the remaining firms report exactly as expected, which is unlikely. But it shouldn’t be too far off -- those 206 firms also represented 54.0% of all the net income a year ago.
"
2743,ARNC,"The reports are encouraging, with total net income for those firms rising 31.2% over a year ago. The early median surprise of 4.28% is also fairly strong, although the ratio of positive-to-negative surprises is only somewhat above normal at just 3.73. Total net income of the reporting firms is 31.24% higher than a year ago, a slight slowdown from the 34.45% growth those same firms posted in the third quarter.
"
2744,ARNC,"Big Earners Report First
"
2745,ARNC,"It seems the higher growers reported early. The expectations are that the remaining 294 firms will post total net income that is just 19.45% higher than a year ago. That is an acceleration from the year-over-year growth of the third quarter (13.49%). It now looks like the final year-over-year growth will be 25.8% -- up from the implied level of 23.4% as of last week.
"
2746,ARNC,"Given that positive earnings surprises almost always outnumber disappointments, that number implies that the remaining firms would have a median surprise of 0.00 and a surprise ratio of 1.00, which is highly unlikely. Thus growth will probably be well over to 25% again when all is said and done for the quarter. At the very start of earnings season, the expected growth was under 20%.Revenues Slow
"
2747,ARNC,"Revenue growth, though, is expected to slow down significantly, actually falling 1.37% -- down from positive growth of 8.91% in the third quarter. On the other hand, revenue growth among those that have reported is very healthy at 7.88%.
"
2748,ARNC,"The financials are a big part of the overall revenue growth slowdown, but not the entire story. Excluding them, revenue growth is expected to slow to 2.71% year over year from 8.57% in the third quarter. That is in marked contrast to those that have already reported, where revenue growth is up from 7.17% growth in the third quarter.
"
2749,ARNC,"Tougher year-over-year comparisons are a bigger part of the story. However, as I mentioned above, revenue surprises have been quite strong so far, with a median revenue surprise of 1.53%.Net Margin Expansion
"
2750,ARNC,"Thus, the stellar earnings growth is mostly due to the continued expansion of net margins. Much of the year-over-year margin expansion is due to the Financials, where the whole concept of revenues is a bit different from most companies, and thus the concept of net margins is also a bit different. Much of the earnings growth in the Financials has come from firms setting aside less for bad debts than they did last year.
"
2751,ARNC,"One should be a bit on the doubtful side about the quality of those earnings, particularly in the absence of mark-to-market accounting. Among those that have reported, net margins are 10.95%, or 9.46% if one excludes the Financials, up from 9.00% (8.83% excluding financials) a year ago, but down from 11.21% (9.59% excluding Financials) in the third quarter.  The expected net margin for the remainder is 7.31% (6.77% excluding Financials) up from 6.03% (6.43% ex-Financials) last year.
"
2752,ARNC,"Net margins continue to march northward, on a yearly basis. In 2008, overall net margins were just 5.88%, rising to 6.42% in 2009. They are expected to hit 8.67% in 2010 and continue climbing to 9.50% in 2011 and 10.13% in 2012. The pattern is a bit different -- particularly during the recession -- if the Financials are excluded, as margins fell from 7.78% in 2008 to 7.13% in 2009, but have started a robust recovery and are expected to be 8.23% in 2010, 8.83% in 2011 and 9.39% in 2012.Full Year Expectations
"
2753,ARNC,"The expectations for the full year are very healthy, with total net income for 2010 expected to rise to $782.9 billion in 2010, up from $544.3 billion in 2009. In 2011, the total net income for the S&P 500 should be $898.1 billion, or increases of 43.3% and 14.7%, respectively.
"
2754,ARNC,"The early expectation is for 2012 to have total net income of just over the $1 Trillion mark. That will also put the “EPS for the S&P 500 over the $100 “per share level for the first time at $106.17. That is up from $57.68 for 2009, $82.62 for 2010 and $94.77 for 2011. In an environment where the 10-year T-note is yielding just 3.39%, a P/E of 15.7x based on 2010 and 13.7x based on 2011 earnings looks attractive.
"
2755,ARNC,"With almost two 2011 estimates being raised for each one being cut (revisions ratio of 1.98), one has to feel confident that the current expectations for 2011 will be hit, and more likely exceeded. This provides a strong fundamental backing for the market to continue to move higher. The bullish argument is further boosted by such historical factors such as being in the third year of the presidential cycle (almost always the best of the four) and having a Democrat in the White House and the GOP at least partially in charge at the other end of Pennsylvania Ave.
"
2756,ARNC,"While there is not a huge sample size of years with that political alignment, those that exist were very good ones for the stock market. Just having a Democrat in the White House has historically meant good things for the stock market. In fact, in the 50 years since JFK “asked not what your country can do for you, the S&P 500 has advanced by a total of 1220 points (from 59.96 to 1280.26 on 1/20/11). Of those, more than all of them (1455) have come with a Democrat in the Oval Office (22 years), while the market has lost a total of 234 points with a GOP President. (Of course, a point gained under Kennedy or Nixon was a bigger percentage move than a point gained or lost under G.W. Bush or Obama).
"
2757,ARNC,"Political Gridlock an Obstacle
"
2758,ARNC,"On the other hand, there is a very real prospect of total political gridlock, which would greatly raise uncertainty about governmental policy and the strength of the economy that could undermine confidence. As Shakespeare said: “Beware the ides of March. That is approximately when the U.S. will hit its current debt ceiling. If it is not raised, the U.S. Government could go into at least a technical default on its debt, and the Government would probably have to shut down (not immediately, as there are a few games that can be played, but if it were to last for more than a few weeks, shutdown and default is likely).
"
2759,ARNC,"That is hardly something that will inspire confidence in the markets. While it is inconceivable that it will not eventually be passed, it is an opportunity for major political theater, and there is a chance that there will be a delay between the debt ceiling being hit and when it gets raised.
"
2760,ARNC,"The economy does seem to have made a slow turn towards recovery. However, job creation remains very sluggish. Most of the real growth in the economy has come from higher productivity, not more hours being worked. Those productivity gains are accruing to capital, not labor and are a major reason behind the rising net margins, and resulting strong earnings growth.Overall, Earnings a Major Positive
"
2761,ARNC,"Still, companies are expected to continue growing their earnings nicely, and the 14.7% expected growth for 2011, if achieved, means that the total earnings for the S&P 500 should hit a new record by the middle of next year. The fact that analysts are, on balance, still raising estimates for 2011, increases the odds that that growth will be achieved.
"
2762,ARNC,"Growth of 14.7% is not exactly awful. Even on the revenue side the expected growth in 2011 of 4.77%, or 5.97% if one excludes the Financial sector, is still pretty solid. Clearly the analytical community is not expecting the economy to turn south again.Scorecard & Earnings SurpriseSo far, 206 of S&P 500 firms (41.2%) have reported -- that is a big enough sample to suggest this will be another strong earnings season.So far, so good. Median surprise of 4.28%, and a 3.73 surprise ratio (149 beats, 40 misses); 72.3% of all firms beat expectations.Positive year-over-year growth for 160, falling EPS for 46 firms, 3.48 ratio, 77.7% of all firms reporting have higher EPS than last year.Total net income up 31.2% among those that have reported.Materials and Conglomerates both have double-digit median surprises, Energy and Industrials also strong. Autos and Utilities in negative territory.
"
2763,ARNC,"Historically, a “normal earnings season will have a surprise ratio of about 3:1 and a median surprise of about 3.0%. Thus in the early going we are doing much better than average on the median front, and about average on the ratio front.
"
2764,ARNC,"Early on, the ratios and medians can be very volatile, but it looks like an OK start to things.

These firms expected to slow to 9.76% growth in the first quarter.Sequential earnings growth is 2.34%. Sequential decline of 3.40% expected for first quarter.Massive growth for Financials, mostly due to lower loss provisions; earnings quality questionable. Industrials, Materials and Energy all reporting over 30% growth.Autos and Aerospace post lower total net income than last year, six sectors positive, but only in single-digit growth.While 41.2% of the companies have reported, they represent 56.3% of all the expected net income, provided that the unreported all report in line with expectations. Projected final year-over-year growth of 25.8%.Refer back to the percent reporting in evaluating sector numbers, for many the expected growth table is still much more significant. For example, the Auto numbers are based on the results of only two companies.Quarterly Growth: Total Net Income Reported Income Growth ""SequentialQ1/Q4 E"" ""SequentialQ4/Q3 A"" Year over Year 4Q 10 A Year over Year 1Q 11 E Year over Year 3Q 10 AFinance 10.60% -4.51% 172.59% 4.73% 60.30%Industrial Products -14.25% 1.38% 94.01% 59.78% 61.78%Basic Materials 62.94% 16.10% 38.19% 15.82% 32.79%Oils and Energy 8.49% 2.07% 30.55% 26.79% 46.49%Computer and Tech -23.18% 23.37% 27.11% 18.70% 51.00%Transportation -12.04% -10.90% 24.59% 29.19% 67.96%Consumer Discretionary -6.94% -38.19% 18.69% 6.64% 21.47%Retail/Wholesale 11.93% 0.38% 13.43% 4.97% 16.25%Construction -25.63% -39.19% 7.79% -1.24% 1920.00%Conglomerates -12.96% 7.69% 7.58% 22.23% 8.13%Medical 1.54% -5.83% 5.04% -3.02% 2.90%Utilities 15.58% -19.73% 2.94% 1.02% 5.04%Business Service 19.53% 7.74% 2.18% 5.41% 0.63%Consumer Staples -15.72% 4.99% 1.34% 0.06% 1.42%Aerospace -20.52% 15.08% -4.45% 6.01% 253.42%Auto 45.26% -32.57% -15.54% 0.50% 97.87%S&P -3.40% 2.34% 31.24% 9.76% 34.45%

Excluding Financials, revenues expected rise 2.71% year over year in the fourth quarter. Significant slowdown from the 8.57% growth posted in the third quarter.Four sectors expected to post lower revenues than a year ago, twelve higher. Revenue for the Financials is a major source of the revenue slowdown. Low interest rates depress interest income, which is a major part of financials revenue, but also reduce interest expense. As a result, revenues for Financials are notoriously flakey.Final year-over-year revenue growth now projected at 2.70%. So far, 46.2% of total expected revenues reported.The numbers on this table (and expected earnings and margin tables) exclude the results of all firms that have already reported. Week-to-week changes will reflect changes in the mix more than changes in the expectations for the remaining firms.Quarterly Growth: Total Revenues Expected Sales Growth Sequential Q1/Q4 E  Sequential Q4/Q3 E Year over Year4Q 10 E Year over Year1Q 11 E Year over Year3Q 10 AAuto -0.36% 0.00% 16.21% 25.60% 20.73%Industrial Products -3.73% 2.33% 15.43% 1.99% 16.26%Utilities -10.53% 0.00% 14.60% -8.14% 7.70%Transportation -5.16% 0.00% 11.02% 9.54% 14.25%Oils and Energy -0.07% 0.00% 9.97% 8.38% 13.70%Basic Materials 1.06% 0.00% 8.87% 10.51% 14.23%Computer and Tech -0.10% -0.56% 8.28% 6.28% 14.58%Business Service -5.17% 0.72% 6.09% 6.22% 7.43%Medical 0.42% -0.04% 4.71% 3.04% 12.16%Consumer Discretionary -9.52% -0.89% 3.26% 3.57% 1.63%Aerospace -1.40% 0.00% 1.80% 3.10% 1.26%Conglomerates -9.14% 0.00% 0.54% -2.03% -3.11%Construction -5.88% 0.00% -2.64% 5.49% 4.85%Consumer Staples -7.79% 0.21% -3.64% -4.63% 5.00%Retail/Wholesale 10.88% -11.02% -8.20% 12.90% 2.63%Finance -11.43% 0.00% -35.10% -40.10% 11.76%S&P 500 -0.50% -2.67% -1.37% 0.98% 8.91%Excl Financials 0.34% 2.56% 2.71% 5.88% 8.57%Quarterly Net Margins ReportedSector and S&P net margins are calculated as total net income for the sector divided by total revenues for the sector.Net margins for S&P 500 expand to 10.95% from 9.00% a year ago, but down from 11.21% in the third quarter.

2768,ARNC,"The first table below shows the S&P 500 firms with the biggest increases in their FY1 (mostly 2010) mean estimate over the last four weeks. The second shows the largest declines. To qualify there must be more than three estimates for FY1, and have a mean estimate of more than $0.50.

"
2770,ARNC,"Note that estimate momentum and value are not mutually exclusive. The most interesting of these firms will be where the net revisions percentage (#up-#dn/Tot) is more than 0.50 but less than 1.00. Big mean estimate changes based on a handful of individual revisions are suspect, but could prove to be the most interesting if other analysts follow suit.

Puts P/Es at 15.5x for 2010, and 13.4x for 2011 and 12.1x for 2012.
"
2775,ARNC,"The 4th quarter earnings season is now in full swing. It is still on the early side, with just 81, or 16.2%, of the S&P 500 reports in. However, history does suggest that by the time you have about 15% of the sample, you can have a pretty good feel for how the rest of the earning season will go.
"
2776,ARNC,"The early reports are encouraging, with total net income for those firms rising a stunning 63.3% over a year ago. The early median surprise of 6.56% is also quite strong, although the ratio of positive to negative surprises is only somewhat above normal at just 3.69. However, those numbers are always extremely volatile in the early going.
"
2777,ARNC,"Most of the focus should be on the expectations for those who have yet to report. It seems pretty clear that we got a big batch of the highest growers out of the way early. The expectations are that the remaining 419 of the S&P 500 firms will post total net income that is just 12.26% than a year ago. That is a slowdown from the year over year growth of the third quarter (20.2%).
"
2778,ARNC,"The firms that have reported are somewhat bigger/more profitable than those that have yet to report, on average. If all the remaining firms were to report exactly as expected, then 27.4% of the total earnings expected for the quarter are in. The implied total growth is 23.4%. Given that positive earnings surprises almost always outnumber disappointments, one does not need an overly active imagination to envision that growth will be over to 25% again when all is said and done for the quarter.Revenue Growth Expected to Fall
"
2779,ARNC,"Revenue growth, though, is expected to slow down significantly, actually falling 0.33% from positive growth of 9.01% in the third quarter. On the other hand, revenue growth among those companies that have reported is very healthy at 7.54%.
"
2780,ARNC,"The financials are a big part of the overall revenue growth slowdown, but not the entire story. They are also somewhat over-represented in the early going, responsible for 34.8% of all the net income reported so far. Excluding them, revenue growth is expected to slow to 2.50% year over year from 8.85%.
"
2781,ARNC,"Tougher year-over-year comparisons are a bigger part of the story. However, as I mentioned above, revenue surprises have been quite strong so far, with a median revenue surprise of 1.50%.Net Margin Expansion
"
2782,ARNC,"Thus the stellar earnings growth is mostly due to the continued expansion of net margins. Much of the year-over-year margin expansion is due to the financials, where the whole concept of revenues is a bit different from most companies, and thus the concept of net margins is also a bit different.
"
2783,ARNC,"Much of the earnings growth in the financials has come from firms setting aside less for bad debts than they did last year. One should be a bit on the doubtful side about the quality of those earnings, particularly in the absence of mark-to-market accounting.
"
2784,ARNC,"Among those that have reported, net margins are 11.97%, or 11.56% if one excludes the financials, up from 7.88% (9.93% excluding financials) a year ago, and 11.71% (10.69% excluding financials) in the third quarter. The expected net margin for the remainder is 8.12% (7.72% excluding financials) up from 7.21% (7.56% ex-financials) last year.
"
2785,ARNC,"Net margins continue to march northward on a yearly basis. In 2008, overall net margins were just 5.88%, rising to 6.42% in 2009. They are expected to hit 8.80% in 2010 and continue climbing to 9.68% in 2011 and 10.19% in 2012. The pattern is a bit different, particularly during the recession if the financials are excluded, as margins fell from 7.78% in 2008 to 7.13% in 2009, but have started a robust recovery and are expected to be 8.25% in 2010, 8.93% in 2011 and 9.36% in 2012.
"
2786,ARNC,"Full-Year Expectations and Beyond
"
2787,ARNC,"The expectations for the full year are very healthy, with total net income for 2010 expected to rise to $782.6 billion in 2010, up from $544.3 billion in 2009. In 2011, the total net income for the S&P 500 should be $907.0 billion, or increases of 43.2% and 15.9%, respectively.
"
2788,ARNC,"The early expectation is for 2012 to have total net income of just over the $1 Trillion mark. That will also put the “EPS for the S&P 500 over the $100 “per share level for the first time at $105.81. That is up from $57.67 for 2009, $82.60 for 2010, and $95.54 for 2011. In an environment where the 10-year T-note is yielding just 3.45%, a P/E of 15.5x based on 2010 and 13.4x based on 2011 earnings looks attractive.
"
2789,ARNC,"With almost two 2011 estimates being raised for each one being cut (revisions ratio of 1.91), one has to feel confident that the current expectations for 2011 will be hit, and more likely exceeded. This provides a strong fundamental backing for the market to continue to move higher.Historical/Political Factors
"
2790,ARNC,"The bullish argument is further boosted by such historical factors such as being in the third year of the presidential cycle (almost always the best of the four) and having a Democrat in the White House and the GOP at least partially in charge at the other end of Pennsylvania Ave. While there is not a huge sample size of years with that political alignment, those that exist were very good ones for the stock market.
"
2791,ARNC,"On the other hand, there is a very real prospect of total political gridlock, which would greatly raise uncertainty about governmental policy and the strength of the economy that could undermine confidence. As Shakespeare said: “Beware the ides of March. That is approximately when the U.S. will hit its current debt ceiling.
"
2792,ARNC,"If the debt ceiling is not raised, the U.S. government would go into at least a technical default on its debt, and the government would probably have to shut down. That is hardly something that will inspire confidence in the markets. And while it is inconceivable that a higher debt ceiling will not eventually be passed, it is an opportunity for major political theater, and there is a chance that there will be a delay between the debt ceiling being hit and when it gets raised.The (Slow) Road to Recovery
"
2793,ARNC,"The economy does seem to have made a slow turn towards recovery. However, job creation remains very sluggish. Most of the real growth in the economy has come from higher productivity, not more hours being worked. Those productivity gains are accruing to capital, not labor and are a major reason behind the strong earnings growth.
"
2794,ARNC,"Still, companies are expected to continue growing their earnings nicely, and the 15.9% expected growth for 2011, if achieved, means that the total earnings for the S&P 500 should hit a new record by the middle of next year. The fact that analysts are, on balance, still raising estimates for 2011, increases the odds that that growth will be achieved.
"
2795,ARNC,"Growth of 15.9% is not exactly awful. Even on the revenue side the expected growth in 2011 of 5.36%, or 6.09% if one excludes the financial sector, is still pretty solid. Clearly the analytical community is not expecting the economy to turn south again.
"
2796,ARNC,"Scorecard & Earnings SurpriseOnly 81 of S&P 500 firms (16.2%) have reported, but that is a big enough sample to suggest this will be another strong earnings season.Off to a good start with a median surprise of 6.56%, and a 3.69 surprise ratio (59 beats, 16 misses), 72.8% of all firms beat expectations.Positive year-over-year growth for 68, falling EPS for 13 firms -- a 5.23 ratio, 84.0% of all firms reporting have higher EPS than last year.Total net income up 63.3% among those that have reported.Six sectors have only a single report in, pay attention to the percent reported when evaluating sector data.
"
2797,ARNC,"Historically, a “normal earnings season will have a surprise ratio of about 3:1 and a median surprise of about 3.0%. Thus in the early going we are doing much better than average on the median front, and about average on the ratio front. Early on, the ratios and medians can be very volatile, but it looks like an OK start to things. Pay attention to the percent reporting in evaluating the significance of the sector numbers.Scorecard & Earnings Surprise 4Q Reported Income Surprises Yr/YrGrowth %Reported SurpriseMedian EPSSurpPos EPSSurpNeg #GrowPos #GrowNegConstruction - to +   9.09% 466.67 1 0 1 0Medical 17.77% 6.38% 33.63 3 0 3 0Conglomerates 17.28% 10.00% 12.50 1 0 1 0Basic Materials 57.03% 26.09% 10.57 6 0 6 0Oils and Energy 42.47% 2.63% 10.39 1 0 1 0Aerospace 25.83% 10.00% 10.34 1 0 1 0Computer and Tech 37.59% 22.86% 9.86 14 1 15 1Consumer Discretionary 16.03% 12.12% 8.93 3 1 3 1Industrial Products 73.33% 10.00% 7.51 2 0 1 1Business Service 6.35% 5.26% 5.71 1 0 1 0Finance 201.90% 33.33% 3.84 17 7 21 5Retail/Wholesale 13.31% 24.44% 2.90 6 4 9 2Auto 30.21% 16.67% 1.85 1 0 1 0Consumer Staples -2.98% 7.89% 0.00 1 1 1 2Transportation 20.93% 33.33% 0.00 1 1 2 1Utilities 6.91% 2.33% -2.86 0 1 1 0S&P 63.29% 16.20% 6.56 59 16 68 13Sales SurprisesSales Surprise ratio at 3.47, median surprise 1.499% -- a very strong showing; 72.8% of all firms do better than expected on top line.Growing Revenues outnumber falling revenues by ratio of 2.52, 71.6% of firms have higher revenues than a year ago.Revenue growth very healthy at 7.54% but still greatly lags earnings growth, pointing to net margin expansion (see net margin tables below).

"
2804,ARNC,"The table below shows the S&P 500 firms with the biggest increases in their FY1 (mostly 2010) mean estimate over the last 4 weeks. To qualify there must be more than 3 estimates for FY1, and have a mean estimate of more than $0.50. In addition to the change in the mean estimate, the net percentage of estimates being raised is shown for both FY1 and FY2, as well as the P/E ratios based on each year’s earnings is shown.
"
2805,ARNC,"Note that estimate momentum and value are not mutually exclusive. The most interesting of these firms will be where the net revisions percentage (#up-#dn/Tot) is more than 0.50 but less than 1.00. Big mean estimate changes based on a handful of individual revisions are suspect, but could prove to be the most interesting if other analysts follow suit. On the other hand, if all the analysts have raised their estimates already, the mean estimate is less likely to rise again over the next month.Biggest FY1 Revisions Company Ticker %ChCurr Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  %ChNext Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  # Up-Dn/Tot%ChCurr Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  # Up-Dn/Tot%ChNext Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  P/E usingCurr FY Est P/E usingNext FY EstAk Steel Hldg AKS 18.23% -0.95% 0.27 0.00 25.44 12.22Utd States Stl X 16.24% 3.89% 0.55 0.25 18.84 11.29Jabil Circuit JBL 14.49% 12.75% 1.00 0.88 10.90 9.38Alcoa Inc AA 12.93% 10.84% 0.31 0.27 13.19 10.61Freept Mc Cop-B FCX 11.62% 16.27% 0.53 0.33 10.29 9.98Murphy Oil MUR 9.27% 4.87% 0.50 0.25 11.74 10.90Newmont Mining NEM 8.75% 10.57% 0.41 0.21 11.10 11.11Adobe Systems ADBE 7.94% 8.30% 1.00 0.50 17.41 15.24Marathon Oil Cp MRO 7.35% 2.60% 0.50 0.29 9.21 8.39Consol Energy CNX 6.77% -0.04% 0.48 0.00 17.01 11.15Nvidia Corp NVDA 6.68% 18.78% 0.42 0.59 38.97 27.15Wynn Resrts Ltd WYNN 6.56% 8.73% 0.26 0.22 47.29 36.35Anadarko Petrol APC 6.36% -2.10% 0.21 0.21 36.22 24.51Massey Egy Cpy MEE 6.33% 12.56% 0.10 0.37 15.23 10.83Apollo Group APOL 5.61% -1.16% 0.70 -0.18 9.13 9.47Motorola Solutn MSI 5.30% -15.00% 0.33 0.17 12.67 10.86Oracle Corp ORCL 5.27% 4.89% 0.94 0.93 15.60 14.02Hess Corp HES 5.21% 11.52% 0.29 0.08 13.00 11.39

"
2807,ARNC,"We use the convention of referring to the next full fiscal year to be completed as 2010, but because not all firms are on December fiscal years, this can cause discontinuities in the data, particularly around this time of year. The data is based on FY1, not based on 2011, even though I may call it 2011 in the report. All numbers, including historical ones, reflect the current composition of the S&P 500, thus some historical numbers may differ from those reported by S&P which are based on the composition of the index at the time of the reports.

2808,ARNC,"Key Points:4Q earnings season off to good start, but it's still very early. Median surprise of 6.07% and surprise ratio of 2.50 for EPS, 0.625% and 2.29 for revenues.Strong earnings season for third quarter -- a median EPS surprise of 5.00%, and a 3.78 surprise ratio. While those numbers are down from earlier in the reporting season, they are still very good. Total of 359 positive surprises and just 95 disappointments. Positive year-over-year growth for 379, falling EPS for 117 firms, 3.24 ratio. 71.8% of all reporting firms do better than expected, 75.8% report positive year over year growth. Total net income reported up 25.3%.Third quarter Sales Surprise ratio at 1.50, median surprise 0.79%; 56.6% of all firms do better than expected on top line. Revenue growth healthy at 8.12%.Reported fourth quarter earnings growth of 25.4%, expected year-over-year growth of 19.8% for the vast majority of firms yet to report. On the Revenue side, 10.1% reported, but just 3.0% expected for those yet to report.Net margins expected to expand to 8.85% (among yet to report) from 7.38% a year ago, but down from 9.11% in third quarter. Excluding Financials margins expected to rise to 8.20% from 7.97% a year ago, but down from 8.80% in the third quarter.Full-year total earnings for the S&P 500 expected to jump 42.9% in 2010, 15.1% further in 2011. Growth to continue in 2012 with total net income expected to rise 12.0%Total revenues for the S&P 500 expected to rise 4.03% in 2010, 5.38% in 2011 and 5.58% in 2012.

Ratio of firms with rising to falling mean estimates at 1.62 for 2011, 1.61 for 2012, also positive readings. Total revisions activity near seasonal lows and will expand dramatically over the next few weeks.  Current sample size is very thin.S&P500 earned $544.3 billion in 2009, expected to earn $778.5 billion in 2010, $896.4 billion in 2011. Major milestone expected for 2012 as the total earnings for the S&P 500 are expected to top the $1 Trillion mark of the first time at 1.003 Trillion.S&P 500 earned $57.64 in 2009: $82.18 in 2010 and $95.06 in 2011 expected bottom up.

"
2809,ARNC,"With the strong third quarter earnings season now well behind us, the focus turns to the fourth quarter season which kicks off this week when Alcoa (AA), Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and J.P. Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report) report. We have already had a handful (24) of S&P 500 firms report, but they were mostly firms with November fiscal period ends, with a high proportion of retailers in the mix.
"
2810,ARNC,"While far from a representative sample, the early reports are encouraging, with total net income for those firms rising 25.4% over a year ago. The early median surprise of 6.07% is also quite strong, although the ratio of positive to negative surprises is a bit weaker than normal at just 2.50%. However, those numbers are always extremely volatile in the early going and it is far too early to draw any real conclusions about the quarter.Positive Expectations
"
2811,ARNC,"Most of the focus should be on the expectations for those who have yet to report. There the expectations are also positive, particularly on the earnings front. Total net income is expected to rise 19.8% over year-ago levels. While that is a slowdown from the year-over-year growth of the third quarter (25.1%), it is well above the growth that was expected for the third quarter just before the third quarter reporting season really got underway (15.5%).
"
2812,ARNC,"Given that positive earnings surprises almost always outnumber disappointments, one does not need an overly active imagination to envision that growth will be close to 25% again when all is said and done for the quarter. Revenue growth, though, is expected to slow down significantly to an actual slight decline of 0.09% from positive growth of 8.01% in the third quarter. On the other hand, revenue growth among the handful that have reported is very healthy at 10.1%.
"
2813,ARNC,"The financials are a big part of the overall revenue growth slowdown, but not the entire story. Excluding them, revenue growth is expected to slow to 3.02% year over year from 9.12%. Tougher year-over-year comparisons are a bigger part of the story.Net Margin Expansion
"
2814,ARNC,"Thus, the stellar earnings growth is mostly due to the continued expansion of net margins. Much of the year-over-year margin expansion is due to the financials, were the whole concept of revenues is a bit different from most companies, and thus the concept of net margins is also a bit different.
"
2815,ARNC,"However, even if the financials are excluded, net margins continue to march northward, at least year over year. For the S&P 500 as a whole, net margins are expected to be 8.85% in the fourth quarter, up from “just 7.38% a year ago, but down from 9.11% in the third quarter. If the financials are excluded, margins are expected to rise to 8.20% from 7.97% a year ago but down from 8.80% a year ago. Those numbers are for the vast majority that have yet to report.
"
2816,ARNC,"The reported net margins among the 24 early birds are 3.56%, up from 3.14% a year ago but down from 3.76% in the third quarter. Fully one third of all the companies that have reported are retailers, however, and retailers tend to have low margins.Forecasts for 2010 & 2011
"
2817,ARNC,"The expectations for the full year are very healthy, with total net income for 2010 expected to rise to $778.5 billion in 2010, up from $544.3 billion in 2009. In 2011, the total net income for the S&P 500 should be $896.4 billion, or increases of 42.9% and 15.1%, respectively.
"
2818,ARNC,"If the early expectations for 2012 prove to be correct, that year will mark two significant milestones. Total net income is expected to reach $1.0036 Trillion, marching passed the $1 Trillion level for the first time ever. That will also put the “EPS for the S&P 500 over the $100 “per share level for the first time at $106.15. That is up from $57.64 for 2009, $82.18 for 2010, and $95.06 for 2011.
"
2819,ARNC,"In an environment where the 10-year T-note is yielding just 3.32%, a P/E of 15.5x based on 2010 and 13.4x based on 2011 earnings looks attractive. Much of the $600 billion in newly created money from QE2 is likely to eventually find its way into the equity market (not directly, but eventually).
"
2820,ARNC,"Historically, the year after mid-term elections has almost always been a good one for the stock market. The extension of unemployment benefits and the one-year cut in the payroll tax should be stimulative to the economy (the extension of the high-end tax cuts is only slightly stimulative relative to letting them expire, and certainly does not provide any fresh stimulus to the economy). A stronger economy should allow earnings to continue to rise.A Few Caveats
"
2821,ARNC,"On the other hand, there is a very real prospect of total political gridlock, which would greatly raise uncertainty about governmental policy and the strength of the economy that could undermine confidence. As Shakespeare said: “Beware the ides of March. That is approximately when the U.S. will hit its current debt ceiling. If it is not raised, the U.S. Government would go into at least a technical default on its debt, and the government would probably have to shut down.
"
2822,ARNC,"That is hardly something that will inspire confidence in the markets. While it is inconceivable that it will not eventually be passed, it is an opportunity for major political theater, and there is a chance that there will be a delay between the debt ceiling being hit and when it gets raised.
"
2823,ARNC,"The economy does seem to have made a slow turn towards recovery. However, job creation remains very sluggish. Most of the real growth in the economy has come from higher productivity, not more hours being worked. Those productivity gains are accruing to capital, not labor, and are a major reason behind the strong earnings growth.Earnings Growth to Power Forward
"
2824,ARNC,"Still, companies are expected to continue growing their earnings nicely, and the 15.1% expected growth for 2011, if achieved, means that the total earnings for the S&P 500 should hit a new record by the middle of next year. The fact that analysts are, on balance, still raising estimates for 2011, increases the odds that that growth will be achieved. Growth of 15.1% is not exactly awful.
"
2825,ARNC,"Even on the revenue side the expected growth in 2011 of 5.38%, or 5.88% if one excludes the financial sector, is still pretty solid. Clearly the analytical community is not expecting the economy to turn south again.Scorecard & Earnings SurpriseOnly 24 firms (4.8%) have reported, and most of those have November fiscal period ends.Off to a good start with a median surprise of 6.07%, and a 2.50 surprise ratio (15 beats, 6 misses), 62.3% of all firms beat expectations.Positive year-over-year growth for 19, falling EPS for 5 firms, 3.80 ratio, 79.2% of all firms reporting have higher EPS than last year.Total net income up 25.43% among those that have reported.Seven sectors have yet to have any firms report -- five more have only a single report in.
"
2826,ARNC,"Historically, a “normal earnings season will have a surprise ratio of about 3:1 and a median surprise of about 3.0%. Thus in the early going we are doing much better than average on the median front, and about average on the ratio front. Early on the ratios and medians can be very volatile, but it looks like an OK start to things. Pay attention to the percent reporting in evaluating the significance of the sector numbers.Scorecard & Earnings Surprise 4Q Reported Income Surprises Yr/YrGrowth %Reported SurpriseMedian EPSSurpPos EPSSurpNeg #GrowPos #GrowNegBasica Materials 176.92% 4.35% 100.00 1 0 1 0Finance 306.98% 1.28% 52.38 1 0 1 0Computer and Tech 39.90% 8.57% 8.45 4 1 6 0Industrial Products -6.67% 5.00% 8.11 1 0 0 1Consumer Discretionary 24.12% 6.06% 6.25 1 1 2 0Business Service 6.35% 5.26% 5.71 1 0 1 0Retail/Wholesale 15.00% 17.78% 4.39 5 2 7 1Consumer Staples -2.98% 7.89% 0.00 1 1 1 2Transportation -17.97% 11.11% -11.45 0 1 0 1Medical na 0.00% na Na Na na NaAuto na 0.00% na Na Na na NaConstruction na 0.00% na Na Na na NaConglomerates na 0.00% na Na Na na NaAerospace na 0.00% na Na Na na NaOils and Energy na 0.00% na Na Na na NaUtilities na 0.00% na Na Na na NaS&P 25.43 4.80% 6.07 15 6 19 5Sales SurprisesSales Surprise ratio at 2.29, median surprise 0.652%, 66.6% of all firms do better than expected on top line.Growing Revenues outnumber falling revenues by ratio of 3.80, 79.2% of firms have higher revenues than a year ago.Revenue growth very healthy at 10.1% but still greatly lags earnings growth pointing to net margin expansion (see net margin tables below).

I would pencil in year-over-year earnings growth of closer to 25% by the time all is said and done.Quarterly Growth: Total Net Income Expected Income Growth ""SequentialQ1/Q4 E"" ""SequentialQ4/Q3 E"" Year over Year 4Q 10 E Year over Year 1Q 11 E Year over Year 3Q 10 AFinance -0.58% 0.77% 187.43% -5.85% 28.72%Industrial Products 11.93% -15.52% 44.51% 41.70% 53.07%Transportation -12.72% -3.59% 33.08% 28.25% 60.83%Oils and Energy 5.77% 4.47% 28.29% 14.11% 36.66%Basic Materials 37.87% -7.94% 19.97% 33.48% 44.11%Auto 8.18% -8.20% 13.64% 8.55% 90.75%Construction -3.90% -27.28% 9.59% 4.60% 1148.57%Computer and Tech -11.95% 3.15% 8.88% 8.94% 43.85%Business Service 5.34% 3.77% 8.31% 19.85% 15.95%Consumer Staples -2.59% -9.74% 2.92% 4.92% 5.83%Medical 10.47% -8.65% 2.17% 1.09% 10.96%Consumer Discretionary -7.68% 1.20% 2.06% 0.80% 16.06%Utilities 25.50% -29.47% 0.76% 0.47% 6.37%Conglomerates 2.22% -11.45% -6.68% 18.59% 6.20%Aerospace -5.80% -0.56% -11.53% 8.13% 144.50%Retail/Wholesale 25.99% 2.52% -19.26% 31.56% 8.72%S&P 3.43% -3.98% 19.83% 7.55% 25.07%Quarterly Growth: Total Revenues ReportedEarly Revenue growth very strong at 10.1%, but that is down from the 11.2% growth the same firms posted in the third quarter.Sequentially revenues 3.1% lower than in the third quarter.Still a very thin sample, especially at the individual sector level.Quarterly Growth: Total Revenues Reported Sales Growth ""SequentialQ1/Q4 E"" ""SequentialQ4/Q3 A"" Year over Year 4Q 10 A Year over Year4Q 10 E Year over Year 3Q 09 AComputer and Tech 10.77% 6.93% 38.12% 26.60% 49.52%Transportation 6.14% 1.85% 12.05% 10.87% 18.08%Consumer Discretionary 7.60% -13.14% 9.55% 8.19% 7.43%Basic Materials 84.10% -6.30% 7.84% 4.06% 3.94%Retail/Wholesale 1.32% -7.49% 7.09% 5.67% 7.05%Industrial Products 1.39% 1.41% 5.88% 5.10% 3.59%Business Service 0.98% -1.16% 3.02% 3.74% 3.60%Consumer Staples -6.37% 13.58% -0.55% 1.75% -1.94%Finance -48.60% 28.24% -23.31% -42.11% -16.69%Medical na na na na naAuto na na na na naConstruction na na na na naConglomerates na na na na naAerospace na na na na naOils and Energy na na na na naUtilities na na na na naS&P 6.96% -3.13% 10.10% 7.70% 11.21%Quarterly Growth: Total Revenues ExpectedTotal revenue for the remaining S&P 500 firms expected be essentially flat in the fourth quarter relative to a year ago. That marks a very significant slowdown from the 8.0% growth posted by these firms in the third quarter.Five sectors expected to post lower revenues than a year ago, eleven higher. Revenue for the financials is the principal source of the revenue slowdown. Low interest rates depress interest income, which is a major part of financials revenue, but also reduce interest expense. As a result, revenues at financials are notoriously flakey.Excluding financials, total revenues expected to grow 3.02%, down from 9.12% in the third quarter.Three sectors expected to post double-digit revenue growth in the third quarter. All of which also posted double-digit growth in the second quarter and are expected be among the leaders again in the first quarter.Quarterly Growth: Total Revenues Expected Sales Growth ""SequentialQ1/Q4 E"" Sequential Q4/Q3 E Year over Year4Q 10 E Year over Year1Q 11 E Year over Year3Q 10 AIndustrial Products -3.09% 1.23% 20.77% 11.75% 23.60%Transportation -3.48% 0.00% 12.33% 9.29% 16.29%Computer and Tech -6.79% -0.22% 10.08% 7.86% 18.37%Basic Materials 4.85% 0.00% 9.46% 10.39% 17.80%Oils and Energy 3.28% 0.00% 7.74% 9.07% 16.11%Utilities 0.59% 0.00% 7.39% 1.06% 5.59%Business Service -3.29% 0.63% 5.92% 6.49% 7.34%Consumer Discretionary -9.85% -0.78% 3.76% 2.27% 2.49%Medical -0.10% -0.03% 2.40% 3.19% 8.56%Conglomerates -10.48% 0.00% 1.37% 0.15% -0.11%Aerospace -7.59% 0.00% 1.23% 3.57% 2.36%Consumer Staples -7.33% 0.16% -3.92% -4.35% 3.99%Construction -4.13% 0.00% -3.95% 3.91% 3.06%Retail/Wholesale 8.28% -9.84% -6.32% 12.51% 3.16%Auto 0.24% 0.00% -6.86% 2.20% 5.02%Finance 0.16% 0.00% -18.40% -22.33% 1.93%S&P 500 -0.44% -1.54% -0.09% 1.57% 8.01%Excl Financials -0.52% 1.99% 3.02% 5.98% 9.12%Quarterly Net Margins ReportedSector and S&P net margins are calculated as total net income for the sector divided by total revenues for the sector.Net margins for S&P 500 expand to 3.56% from 3.14% a year ago, but down from 3.76% in the third quarter.

"
2829,ARNC,"The table below shows the S&P 500 firms with the biggest increases in their FY1 (mostly 2010) mean estimate over the last 4 weeks. To qualify there must be more than 3 estimates for FY1, and have a mean estimate of more than $0.50. In addition, to the change in the mean estimate, the net percentage of estimates being raised is shown for both FY1 and FY2, as well as the P/E ratios based on each year’s earnings is shown.
"
2830,ARNC,"Note that estimate momentum and value are not mutually exclusive. The most interesting of these firms will be where the net revisions percentage (#up-#dn/Tot) is more than 0.50 but less than 1.00. Big mean estimate changes based on a handful of individual revisions are suspect, but could prove to be the most interesting if other analysts follow suit. On the other hand, if all the analysts have raised their estimates already, the mean estimate is less likely to rise again over the next month.Biggest FY1 Revisions Company Ticker %ChCurr Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  %ChNext Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  # Up-Dn/Tot%ChCurr Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  # Up-Dn/Tot%ChNext Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  P/E usingCurr FY Est P/E usingNext FY EstJabil Circuit JBL 14.49% 12.75% 1.00 0.88 10.76 9.26Ak Steel Hldg AKS 12.52% 3.40% 0.27 0.17 27.65 12.11Utd States Stl X 10.38% 3.35% 0.36 0.13 20.37 11.65Newmont Mining NEM 8.15% 14.12% 0.29 0.15 11.85 11.85Adobe Systems ADBE 7.94% 8.30% 1.00 0.50 16.51 14.45Hcp Inc HCP 7.90% 17.59% 0.63 0.83 14.90 13.23Murphy Oil MUR 7.47% 2.01% 0.43 0.25 11.71 10.46Pall Corp PLL 6.80% 6.25% 1.00 0.90 19.04 16.77Hess Corp HES 6.46% 7.06% 0.24 0.00 12.85 11.64Tesoro Corp TSO 6.33% -0.76% 0.35 0.25 12.61 9.16Oracle Corp ORCL 5.72% 5.41% 0.94 0.93 15.46 13.89Discover Fin Sv DFS 5.62% 7.30% 0.38 0.25 9.81 8.79Motorola Solutn MSI 5.30% -14.40% 0.17 0.00 12.88 10.96First Solar Inc FSLR 5.19% 4.32% 0.55 0.29 14.91 11.97Freept Mc Cop-B FCX 5.18% 1.92% 0.29 0.09 11.14 11.45Data in this report, unless stated otherwise, is through the close on Thursday 1/06/2011.

"
2847,ARNC,"• Top-down estimates: $57.45 for 2009, $74.24 for 2010, 84.33 for 2011Welcome to the new Earnings Trends. We have decided to start focusing our analysis of the S&P 500 based on Zacks' own sector groupings rather than the S&P GICS sectors. There are 16 Zacks sectors and only 10 GICS sectors, so the new groupings will result in better granularity of the data. The old way simply grouped too many very different companies together. In addition, we for the first time are presenting top-line as well as bottom-line expectations and surprise information. We are now going to be focusing on 2010 earnings as being FY1 and 2011 being FY2. Keep that in mind if you are looking at this report and comparing it to previous editions of it. Also keep in mind that while we use the convention of referring to the next full fiscal year to be completed as 2010, not all firms are on December fiscal years, and this can cause discontinuities in the data, particularly around this time of year. The data is based on FY1, not based on 2010, even though I may call it 2010 in the report.While the “official start of earnings season was last week, only a handful of firms have their results for the fourth quarter in, and most of those are firms with November fiscal period endings. Only 6.0% of all S&P 500 firms had reported by the cut-off for this report.This week, things really start to gain momentum as 61 more S&P firms, or 12.2%, will report. Things are off to a solid start, even with the high profile miss by Alcoa (AA). Positive earnings surprises so far are outpacing disappointments by a ratio of 6.25 to 1, and the median surprise is 6.32%. Year-over-year earnings growth so far (total net income) is a massive 167.7%. That, however, says far more about what happened a year ago than what is going on today.The earnings growth number should come down as the earnings season progresses, but will remain the highest in recent memory by a very large margin. If we look at the expectations for the 94% of firms that have yet to report, their earnings are expected to be up 80%. Combined with the ones that have already come in, and the propensity for positive surprises, it means that to total net income for the S&P 500 in the fourth quarter of 2009 was probably roughly double that of the fourth quarter of 2008.Looking at full-year earnings, total net income is still expected to be lower than that of 2008, but just by 9.4%, a much smaller decline than the 22.2% plunge in 2008. Next year will be one of earnings recovery, with growth of 26.7% expected, but note that that will still leave earnings below 2007 levels.While the data is still relatively thin for 2011, and thus should be taken with a grain of salt, further growth of 20.4% is expected for total earnings in 2011. In 2010, the percentage growth numbers will be not really meaningful for the Auto and Construction sectors, since they will be going from negative total earnings to positive total earnings.In 2009, the losses were much lower than the losses in 2008. Among the larger sectors, Basic Materials and the Financials are expected to be the growth leaders for the year (Financials did the negative-to-positive thing in 2009). Energy is also expected to see a large rebound in its total profits. Together, Finance and Energy will account for more than half of all the incremental earnings in both 2010 and 2011, even though together they account for only slightly over 25% of the total market capitalization of the index. However, in the absence of mark-to-market rules, the quality of the earnings in the Financials is suspect.Cost-cutting has been the major force driving earnings and earnings surprises. However, the costs to one company are either the revenues of another company or someone’s paycheck, which is then spent to create revenues for firms. The bottom-up data coming out of all these individual firms seems to confirm what we have been getting from the macro statistics from the government: the economy is growing due to increases in productivity; higher GDP with fewer workers.While clearly companies cannot continue to grow earnings forever based only on cost-cutting, it does mean that when they do start to see revenue growth, earnings growth could be explosive as the greater operating leverage kicks in. That will sure be the case in the fourth quarter, as revenue is expected to increase by just 1.67%, as earnings double -- talk about net margin expansion!The revisions ratios for both 2010 and 2011 are strong, and should give us confidence that those growth rates will actually be achieved, if not exceeded (although it's still very early for 2011). The S&P 500 is selling for 15.1x consensus expectations for 2010, or an earnings yield of 6.62%, or almost twice the yield on the 10-year Treasury note. The S&P is selling for just 12.6x consensus expectations for 2011, although that consensus is still very thin. Stocks look very attractive, at least relative to bonds, at this point.Scorecard & Earnings Surprise

"
2853,ARNC,"•    Year-over-year Earnings Growth Ratio (# Positive Growth/# Negative Growth) at 1.00In evaluating the data presented here, keep the percentage reported in mind. For some sectors, the sample size is extremely small. The move to the 16 Zacks sectors means that even when all reports are in, some of the sectors will still have relatively few firms in them. For firms with only a few reports in, the median surprise will be very volatile as new firms are added to the sample. This is particularly true now as only a handful of firms (mostly with November fiscal periods) have reported so far.Among the sectors with more than just a single report in, Tech and Retail are looking very strong -- each with 8 positive surprises and no disappointments. Finance has the highest earnings growth so far, at 322.1%, although only two have reported (JPM came in after the cutoff).Scorecard & Earnings Surprise Income Surprises Yr/YrGrowth %Reported SurpriseMedian EPSSurpPos EPSSurpNeg #GrowPos #GrowNegConstruction 42.50% 10.00% 53.57 1 0 1 0Consumer Discretionary -18.85% 6.45% 10.69 2 0 1 1Computer and Tech 131.72% 10.71% 8.33 8 0 4 5Retail/Wholesale 18.22% 17.02% 7.38 8 0 4 4Consumer Staples -28.92% 11.36% 6.21 4 1 4 1Transportation -30.02% 10.00% 2.80 1 0 0 1Industrial Products -16.67% 4.55% -7.14 0 1 0 1Finance 322.05% 2.60% -8.34 1 1 1 1Basic Materials 104.07% 4.76% -80.00 0 1 0 1Medical na 0.00% na na na na naAuto na 0.00% na na na na naConglomerates na 0.00% na na na na naAerospace na 0.00% na na na na naOils and Energy na 0.00% na na na na naUtilities na 0.00% na na na na naBusiness Service na 0.00% na na na na naS&P  167.71% 6.00% 6.32 25 4 15 15Sales Surprises

"
2928,ARNC,"• Top-down estimates: $57.45 for 2009, $74.24 for 2010, 84.33 for 2011Welcome to the new Earnings Trends. We have decided to start focusing our analysis of the S&P 500 based on Zacks' own sector groupings rather than the S&P GICS sectors. There are 16 Zacks sectors and only 10 GICS sectors, so the new groupings will result in better granularity of the data. The old way simply grouped too many very different companies together. In addition, we for the first time are presenting top-line as well as bottom-line expectations and surprise information. We are now going to be focusing on 2010 earnings as being FY1 and 2011 being FY2. Keep that in mind if you are looking at this report and comparing it to previous editions of it. Also keep in mind that while we use the convention of referring to the next full fiscal year to be completed as 2010, not all firms are on December fiscal years, and this can cause discontinuities in the data, particularly around this time of year. The data is based on FY1, not based on 2010, even though I may call it 2010 in the report.While the “official start of earnings season was last week, only a handful of firms have their results for the fourth quarter in, and most of those are firms with November fiscal period endings. Only 6.0% of all S&P 500 firms had reported by the cut-off for this report.This week, things really start to gain momentum as 61 more S&P firms, or 12.2%, will report. Things are off to a solid start, even with the high profile miss by Alcoa (AA). Positive earnings surprises so far are outpacing disappointments by a ratio of 6.25 to 1, and the median surprise is 6.32%. Year-over-year earnings growth so far (total net income) is a massive 167.7%. That, however, says far more about what happened a year ago than what is going on today.The earnings growth number should come down as the earnings season progresses, but will remain the highest in recent memory by a very large margin. If we look at the expectations for the 94% of firms that have yet to report, their earnings are expected to be up 80%. Combined with the ones that have already come in, and the propensity for positive surprises, it means that to total net income for the S&P 500 in the fourth quarter of 2009 was probably roughly double that of the fourth quarter of 2008.Looking at full-year earnings, total net income is still expected to be lower than that of 2008, but just by 9.4%, a much smaller decline than the 22.2% plunge in 2008. Next year will be one of earnings recovery, with growth of 26.7% expected, but note that that will still leave earnings below 2007 levels.While the data is still relatively thin for 2011, and thus should be taken with a grain of salt, further growth of 20.4% is expected for total earnings in 2011. In 2010, the percentage growth numbers will be not really meaningful for the Auto and Construction sectors, since they will be going from negative total earnings to positive total earnings.In 2009, the losses were much lower than the losses in 2008. Among the larger sectors, Basic Materials and the Financials are expected to be the growth leaders for the year (Financials did the negative-to-positive thing in 2009). Energy is also expected to see a large rebound in its total profits. Together, Finance and Energy will account for more than half of all the incremental earnings in both 2010 and 2011, even though together they account for only slightly over 25% of the total market capitalization of the index. However, in the absence of mark-to-market rules, the quality of the earnings in the Financials is suspect.Cost-cutting has been the major force driving earnings and earnings surprises. However, the costs to one company are either the revenues of another company or someone’s paycheck, which is then spent to create revenues for firms. The bottom-up data coming out of all these individual firms seems to confirm what we have been getting from the macro statistics from the government: the economy is growing due to increases in productivity; higher GDP with fewer workers.While clearly companies cannot continue to grow earnings forever based only on cost-cutting, it does mean that when they do start to see revenue growth, earnings growth could be explosive as the greater operating leverage kicks in. That will sure be the case in the fourth quarter, as revenue is expected to increase by just 1.67%, as earnings double -- talk about net margin expansion!The revisions ratios for both 2010 and 2011 are strong, and should give us confidence that those growth rates will actually be achieved, if not exceeded (although it's still very early for 2011). The S&P 500 is selling for 15.1x consensus expectations for 2010, or an earnings yield of 6.62%, or almost twice the yield on the 10-year Treasury note. The S&P is selling for just 12.6x consensus expectations for 2011, although that consensus is still very thin. Stocks look very attractive, at least relative to bonds, at this point.Scorecard & Earnings Surprise
"
2929,ARNC,"•    Just a handful of reports in, half of all sectors have none in
"
2930,ARNC,"•    Earnings Surprise Ratio (#beat/#miss) at 6.25, close to 3Q level
"
2931,ARNC,"•    Growth in scorecard is only for those firms that have reported, at 167.7% so far yr/yr, but that says more about a year ago than today
"

"
2933,ARNC,"•    Median Earnings Surprise 6.32%, a very strong reading
"
2934,ARNC,"•    Year-over-year Earnings Growth Ratio (# Positive Growth/# Negative Growth) at 1.00In evaluating the data presented here, keep the percentage reported in mind. For some sectors, the sample size is extremely small. The move to the 16 Zacks sectors means that even when all reports are in, some of the sectors will still have relatively few firms in them. For firms with only a few reports in, the median surprise will be very volatile as new firms are added to the sample. This is particularly true now as only a handful of firms (mostly with November fiscal periods) have reported so far.Among the sectors with more than just a single report in, Tech and Retail are looking very strong -- each with 8 positive surprises and no disappointments. Finance has the highest earnings growth so far, at 322.1%, although only two have reported (JPM came in after the cutoff).Scorecard & Earnings Surprise Income Surprises Yr/YrGrowth %Reported SurpriseMedian EPSSurpPos EPSSurpNeg #GrowPos #GrowNegConstruction 42.50% 10.00% 53.57 1 0 1 0Consumer Discretionary -18.85% 6.45% 10.69 2 0 1 1Computer and Tech 131.72% 10.71% 8.33 8 0 4 5Retail/Wholesale 18.22% 17.02% 7.38 8 0 4 4Consumer Staples -28.92% 11.36% 6.21 4 1 4 1Transportation -30.02% 10.00% 2.80 1 0 0 1Industrial Products -16.67% 4.55% -7.14 0 1 0 1Finance 322.05% 2.60% -8.34 1 1 1 1Basic Materials 104.07% 4.76% -80.00 0 1 0 1Medical na 0.00% na na na na naAuto na 0.00% na na na na naConglomerates na 0.00% na na na na naAerospace na 0.00% na na na na naOils and Energy na 0.00% na na na na naUtilities na 0.00% na na na na naBusiness Service na 0.00% na na na na naS&P  167.71% 6.00% 6.32 25 4 15 15Sales Surprises

"
3020,ARNC,"While there has been a trickle of early reports for the first quarter, mostly from firms which have fiscal periods ending in February. The flood of reports really starts this week.
"
3021,ARNC,"While there have been some very high profile early misses, such as Alcoa (AA) and General Electric (GE  -  Free Report), there are still more positive surprises than disappointments. We would note that the GE report came in after the deadline for the data discussed in this report.
"
3022,ARNC,"The early reports look fairly solid from a median EPS growth point of view with a median year-over-year growth rate is 6.2%. However, that represents just 6.2% of the firms in the S&P and is far from a representative sample.
"
3023,ARNC,"Things are going well on the surprise front as well, with the surprise ratio coming in at a very healthy 3.7:1. In the early going this ratio is likely to jump around quite a bit, so it will take a few weeks yet to get a clear picture of how the quarter is going. The same is true for the median surprise. That being said: so far so good.
"
3024,ARNC,"At this point it is far more important to look at the expectations rather than the actual reports. There things still look pretty good, with a median EPS growth expectation of 10.2%. Thus if we have more positive than negative surprises (as is usually the case) growth will be positive by double digits. As discussed below, there is a marked contrast between the expectations for median year-over-year EPS growth and the expectations for total net income growth. Keep in mind what the median measures. It is a gauge of what the ""normal"" firm will report in terms of EPS. It is not influenced significantly by extreme data points, and implicitly treats the results from Exxon (XOM  -  Free Report) and Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) as being just as important as the results for Murphy Oil (MUR), Manitowoc (MTW  -  Free Report) and Big Lots (BIG  -  Free Report). Changes in shares outstanding, due to buybacks or new issuance also affect the results in this measure, while they do not when measuring total net income.
"
3025,ARNC,"Still some of the same basic contours exist. The sector facing the most challenges is the Financials, with the Materials and Consumer Discretionary sectors also expected to be weak. Energy is expected to be the strongest sector, posting growth of 26.5%. Utilities, Tech, Health Care and Telecom are all expected to show growth of 16% or better.

"
3027,ARNC,"While the median EPS numbers so far are healthy, the total net income numbers are not. Thus far, the 31 firms that have reported have in total come in with total net income that is 22.9% below what they reported in the first quarter of 2007.
"
3028,ARNC,"The Financials are off to a rocky start, with net income just a little bit more than half the levels of a year ago. Granted this is a big improvement over what those same firms reported for the fourth quarter, when their earnings were down 86%, it is still hard to spin it as good news.
"
3029,ARNC,"The Consumer Discretionary sector has also been slammed, with total net income 23.2%. On the other hand, the Consumer Staples sector is currently in the lead with 14.2% growth. Materials shows up well, but that is based on just two reports, one good Monsanto (MON), and one bad, Alcoa (AA). The miss at AA was counter-intuitive given the high price of aluminum (along with other base metals), but the high price of energy really hurt there.
"
3030,ARNC,"Things should perk up a bit going forward, with the total net income for the firms yet-to-report expected to be up 2%. Less than inflation has been running, which puts it negative in real terms, but at least in the positive column in nominal terms. That could prove to be optimistic, since many analysts are not sure how much of the write-offs in the financial sector will be taken as part of operating earnings (and thus in their forecasts) and how much in the form of extraordinary items (and thus excluded).
"
3031,ARNC,"The 24.8% decline expected for the remaining Financials is a remarkable improvement over their showing in the fourth quarter when they were deeply in the red. Looking forward to the second quarter the sector is expected to continue on the downside, with earnings 26.1% below a year ago. However, then the comps start getting much easier, and for the full year positive growth of 14.6% is expected. The disaster that was the second half of 2007 makes the second half of 2008 look easy. Still, even with very strong growth of 31.5% expected for 2009, overall earnings in 2009 are still forecasted to be below 2006 levels. When combined with the results that have already come in, the Financial sector is expected to have total net income that is 27.3% below last year in the first quarter. But we would also point to the massive estimate cutting that is going on in the sector which would also indicate that the current levels are probably overly optimistic.
"
3032,ARNC,"The Consumer Discretionary sector is also expected to have a rough time, although the out look for the remaining firms is not quite as bad as the results seen so far, with net income down 12.4% for the remaining firms versus down 23.2% for the already reported. On a combined basis, earnings are expected to be down 13.7%.
"
3033,ARNC,"Energy, which has yet to have any firms report, is expected to be the big winner for the quarter with total net income climbing by 32.8%. Keep in mind that this growth is coming off of very tough comps. A year ago, the level of Energy sector profits was high enough to prompt Congressional hearings.
"
3034,ARNC,"The Industrial sector is also expected to be a big winner with combined growth of 22.6%. However, the big miss by General Electric (will be reflected in next reports numbers) means that this number will also come down. Last year, GE was responsible for 18.6% of the total net income for the sector.

"
3036,ARNC,"To help gauge the direction of the market, we take note of what analysts are thinking. By tallying their EPS changes, we can determine our revisions ratio. This ratio simply divides the total number of positive estimate revisions by the total number of estimate cuts. Thus, a high ratio is a bullish indicator and a low ratio is bearish. For the S&P 500 as a whole, a number below 0.80 or above 1.25 is generally significant. For individual sectors the distance from 1.0 should be greater for the numbers to be significant.
"
3037,ARNC,"The revisions ratio remains very weak, with more than twice as many estimates for 2008 earnings being cut as increased. Fortunately, we are in a low part of the quarterly cycle for total revisions. Over the last four weeks there have been 1,440 changes in estimates: 473 up and 967 down, up 7.9% from 1335: 455 up and 880 down last week. We are near the quarterly low for total estimate changes. Look for the number to almost triple over the next four or five weeks as the analysts react to the first quarter reports.
"
3038,ARNC,"Only three sectors, Energy, Consumer Staples and Materials are solidly in positive territory and one more, Utilities being roughly neutral. Six sectors saw more than two cuts for every increase, and three more than a 3:1 ratio.
"
3039,ARNC,"In Energy, the Exploration and Production firms such as Anadarko (APC  -  Free Report), XTO Energy (XTO) and EOG Resources (EOG  -  Free Report) were noteworthy for their strength. The independent refiners like Tesoro (TSO) and Valero (VLO  -  Free Report) bucked the trend and were weak. As angry as people are about prices at the pump, this is strong evidence that it is the price of crude, not huge downstream profits that are the heart of the problem.
"
3040,ARNC,"The Financial sector continues to get slammed with estimate cuts, currently running at almost five times as many as estimate increases. Banks, Brokers and Insurance companies were all slammed with cuts, and there seemed few places to hide. However, the sector is not alone.
"
3041,ARNC,"In Tech more than three times as many estimates were chopped than increased. The weakness there is most noticeable among the Semiconductors like Advanced Micro (AMD), Intel (INTC) and Micron (MU).

"
3043,ARNC,"The 2009 revisions story is similar to the 2008 story. The revisions ratio is identical at 0.49, down from 0.50 last week, and 0.63 two weeks ago. Analysts seem to be suspecting that the period of earnings weakness stemming from the soft economy could last quite a while.
"
3044,ARNC,"The most strength comes from the commodity sensitive Energy and Materials sectors. Materials posted a very impressive revisions ratio of 2.64, or more than five increase for every two cuts. However, the total number of revisions was just 51 (37 up and 14 down), so take that number with a pinch of salt, especially since one company, Monsanto (MON) was responsible for 11 of the increases. The strength in Energy, while not as dramatic in terms of the revisions ratio (1.94) was much more widespread and robust. But heck with Oil persistently over $100 a barrel, even if face of U.S. economic weakness, it is easy to see good times ahead for the sector.
"
3045,ARNC,"Staples improved significantly this week to a revisions ratio of 1.76, largely due to strength at General Mills (GIS). The Telecom sector has awful revisions ratio of 0.12, or over eight cuts for each increase, but that is also partly a function of a very low number of revisions (19 total, 2up and 17 down).
"
3046,ARNC,"The revisions picture for the Financial sector is no brighter for 2009 than it is for 2008, coming in at 0.18. Revisions like these will eat away at the robust earnings rebound seen for 2009 (unless 2008 gets cut faster). We do not seem to be getting out of the woods on the Financial sector front.
"
3047,ARNC,"However, the total number of revisions for the whole S&P 500 for 2009 is still relatively light, and like 2008, are near the lows for the quarter. There were a total of 1,067 revisions: 349 up and 718 down. This is up 4.5% from 980 (328 up and 652 down) last week. As with the 2008 revisions, this number is likely to climb dramatically over the next few weeks. Keep in mind that the numbers for some of the individual sectors are still very light. However, the ratio of firms with rising mean estimates to falling mean estimates is 0.68, somewhat stronger than the revisions ratio, but still very much in negative territory.

"
3049,ARNC,"When making investment decisions, growth should always be looked at in conjunction with how much you are paying for a stock. Thus, it makes sense to look at the total earnings expected for a sector, relative to that sectors total market capitalization. This is basically a variation on looking at the P/E.
"
3050,ARNC,"The chart below shows the share of total earnings for 2007, 2008 and 2009, as well as the share of total market capitalization for each sector (the final bar shown). Since the S&P 500 is a market cap weighted index, this is the same as its index weight. On the chart below, the difference between the sizes of the first three bars shows if a sector is gaining or losing ""earnings share"". The difference between the final bar and the first three bars shows if the sector is selling for an above or below market P/E. If the final bar is smaller than the other bars, the sector is selling for a below market P/E. However, as opposed to just showing the sector P/Es, it also shows the relative importance of the sectors to the overall index.
"
3051,ARNC,"Despite their current problems, the Financials are still a very significant influence on the market, accounting for a much larger slice of the earnings in each year than any other sector. Even with all the disasters in the sector, for 2007, the Financials accounted for 22.1% of the total net income for the S&P 500. In 2008, that is currently expected to decline to 19.3% before rebounding to 21.8% in 2009. However, in recent years the sector has accounted for well over a quarter of all earnings. Thus even though the sector is at a substantial discount on P/E basis to the overall market it is still the biggest total market cap sector, at 16.47%. That may not last for long as the Tech sector is nipping at its heels at 16.13%.  Given the on going massive cuts in estimates, please take the P/E on the Financials with a bag of rock salt. The true earnings are likely to be far lower than current estimates now suggest.
"
3052,ARNC,"For many years Financials were clearly the dominate factor in the overall market. Based on 2008 earnings, the Financials have a P/E of 12.3x and based on 2009, only 9.5x. However given the pace of estimate cuts in the sector, the true P/E is probably higher since the actual earnings will be significantly lower.
"
3053,ARNC,"Energy has just taken the throne as the cheapest based on 2008 earnings, trading at 11.4x, and 10.9x based on 2009 expectations. If current forecasts come to pass the Financials well regain the title of the cheapest based on 2009 earnings. But keep your eyes on the revisions. Unless the spreading of economic weakness to the rest of the world causes oil prices to plunge (and the recent trends are very much in the other direction), you can have much more confidence in Energy earnings forecasts actually being achieved (or exceeded) than is true with the Financials. While Energy accounts for only 13.28% of the total market cap of the S&P 500, it was responsible for 15.8% of 2007 earnings and is expected to be the source of 16.8% of 2008 earnings (falling to 15.3% in 2009). This is almost a mirror image of Tech which has a 16.13% weight in the index but was responsible for only 11.7% of 2007 earnings. However, Techs earnings share is expected to rise to 12.8% in 2008 and 12.9% in 2009.
"
3054,ARNC,"The S&P 500 as a whole is trading for 14.5x and 12.5x, 2008 and 2009 earnings, respectively. Based on 2008 earnings that translates to a 6.90% earnings yield, which looks extremely cheap relative to a 3.48% ten year T-note. Even against the AA-corporate bond yield of 5.71% it looks attractive. However, the current level of expectations for corporate earnings still imply that profits will stay well above their historical averages as a share of GDP. That would be an exceedingly rare occurrence during a recession.  The comparison between the earnings yield on the S&P and the 10 year T-note is in my opinion more a reflection of the extreme unattractiveness of long term T-notes at this point than stocks looking particularly cheap in general, however there are attractive stocks out there. It appears that the flight to quality has caused a massive bubble in the price of T-notes. The prices are hard to justify given the risk that the massive injections of liquidity by the Fed to ameliorate the credit crunch will end up fueling the fires of inflation.

"
3057,ARNC,"April can be a volatile month for weather and I expect it also to be volatile for the equity markets. The major indexes are in a broad trading range and daily direction is being influenced by the news du jour. Given the ongoing credit crunch, sputtering economy and probable poor first-quarter earnings reports from financial companies, the most logical prediction is that investors are in for more of the same in terms of stock price movement.
"
3058,ARNC,"Moving on to the week at hand, just 47 companies are scheduled to release results. This very small group will include S&P 500 members Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report), Constellation Brands (STZ  -  Free Report), Family Dollar (FDO), Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report) and Monsanto (MON).
"
3059,ARNC,"The reason for so few reports is that first-quarter earnings season will not ""officially"" start until Apr 7, when Alcoa (AA) reports. There will be a sharp rise in the number of earnings reports starting in the second half of the month.

3069,ARNC,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings Surprises during the Week of Mar 31 - Apr 4Monsanto (MON) recently raised its guidance. Citing market share gains and strong performance by Roundup and other herbicides, MON believes it will report ongoing EPS of $1.75 for the fiscal second-quarter. Brokerage analysts, who collectively had been expecting profits of $1.34 per share, quickly boosted their projections to match the company's guidance. A positive surprise is very possible, however, as the company has exceeded expectations for five consecutive quarters. MON is scheduled to report on Wednesday, Apr 2, before the start of trading.

"
3071,ARNC,"Two of the 20 covering brokerage analysts lowered their fiscal second-quarter profit expectations on Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report) during the past seven days. The cuts likely reflect concerns about a lack of pricing power. The consensus earnings estimate calls for a loss of 35 cents per, one cent worse than a week ago. The most accurate estimate is more bearish at a loss 43 cents per share. The semiconductor company has missed expectations three times during the past four quarters. Micron is scheduled to report on Wednesday, Apr 2, after the close of trading.

3077,ARNC,"Fourth-quarter earnings season will ""officially"" start on Wednesday afternoon with the release of Alcoa's (AA) numbers. Joining AA will be seven other members of the S&P 500: Apollo Group (APOL), Constellation Brands (STZ  -  Free Report), Family Dollar (FDO), KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), M&T Bank (MTB  -  Free Report), MGIC Investment (MTG  -  Free Report) and Supervalu (SVU  -  Free Report).
"
3078,ARNC,"This earnings season should be more challenging because of the credit crisis and the slowing economy. We still expect positive surprises to outnumber negative surprises and continued growth in corporate profits, though forecasts are clouded by the ever-growing number of mortgage-related write-downs. Nonetheless, the median company within the S&P 500 should deliver per share profit growth in the high-single digits.
"
3079,ARNC,"The economic calendar will be fairly light. November consumer credit will be released on Monday afternoon. Tuesday brings November pending home sales. November wholesale trade numbers will be published on Thursday. Friday features December import prices and the November trade balance.
"
3080,ARNC,"The New Hampshire primary will be held on Tuesday night and is likely to further narrow the field of presidential hopefuls.
"
3081,ARNC,"So how will this all impact the markets? The presidential primary is unlikely to have any effect and there is nothing on the economic calendar that should materially alter expectations for a rate cut at the late-January Fed meeting. Alcoa could have some impact on trading direction, since it is a Dow component.
"
3082,ARNC,"The most important factor is whether bargain hunters step in. On Friday morning, the Dow and the S&P 500 were near the bottom of their eight-month trading ranges. A break below these levels would set up a critical test of the levels set last February; however, there should be strong support and a rebound is not out of the question.
"
3083,ARNC,"Regardless, investors should use the current market volatility to redouble their stock research efforts. The current turbulence is creating buying opportunities in several stocks.

"
3085,ARNC,"No single company on the weekly earnings calendar stands out as being particularly likely to issue a positive surprise. This is not a bearish sign, but rather a factor of the recent holiday season (fewer estimate revisions were made because of analysts being on vacation) and the relatively small number of scheduled reports.
"
3086,ARNC,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings Surprises during the Week of Jan 7 - 11
"
3087,ARNC,"Declining aluminum prices have caused multiple brokerage analysts to lower their profit projections for Alcoa's (AA) fourth-quarter. The consensus earnings estimate of 38 cents is 15 cents below the average forecast of a month ago. The most accurate estimate is more bearish at 29 cents per share. AA has missed expectations for two consecutive quarters. Alcoa is scheduled to report on Wednesday, Jan 9, after the close of trading.
"
3088,ARNC,"Ruby Tuesday (RT) warned a few weeks ago that it would likely report a fiscal second-quarter loss of 18 to 21 cents per share. Same-store restaurant sales dropped across the chain, partially due to the current economic environment. At the same time, the company is remodeling locations, revamping its menu and relying on more promotional pricing. The consensus estimate calls for the company to have lost 20 cents per share. The bar and grill restaurant has missed expectations during three out of the past four quarters. Ruby Tuesday is scheduled to report on Wednesday, Jan 9, after the close of trading.

"
3094,ARNC,"First-quarter earnings season will officially start on Wednesday, Jan 9, with the release of Alcoas (AA) numbers. Thousands of companies will report over the next six weeks.
"
3095,ARNC,"Earnings season can provide investors with multiple trading opportunities, particularly when a companys earnings are better than expected. A positive surprise can result in an immediate reaction in a stocks price, as many of you are probably aware. A surprise can also result in tail, meaning that the reaction to the earnings announcement is not just limited to the 24-hour period following the release of quarterly results.
"
3096,ARNC,"The reason is that the surprise alters the perceived valuation of the company. For example, if investors believe a stock is fairly valued at a P/E of 20x earnings and the company has earned 80 cents per share over the past four quarters (20 cents per quarter), then the stock should trade at $16 (20 x .80). However, if the company reports 30 cents per share than 20 cents per share, then the ""E"" in the P/E multiple becomes .90 (.20+.20+.20+.30) instead of .80 (.20+.20+.20+.20). As a result, a P/E of 20 means the stock should trade at $18 (20 x .90) rather than $16 (20 x .80). Institutional investors will then buy the stock all the way up to $18, based solely off of the surprise.
"
3097,ARNC,"The buying does not stop there, however. The positive earnings surprise could lead to positive revisions in earnings estimates for future quarters, making the stock look even cheaper. Since there is a lag between the time an earnings report is released, analysts adjust their models and institutional investors buy more shares. This process creates situations where stock can continue to rise in price for several days and even weeks after an earnings surprise. Bluntly put, the initial jump in a stocks price after an earnings surprise is often just the beginning of an upward move.
"
3098,ARNC,"Zacks Surprise Trader uses our proprietary Price Response Indicator (PRI) to identify stocks most likely to rise in reaction to an earnings surprise. This service triggers an alert after an earnings surprise has been issued and holds onto the stock for a period of about two weeks - the prime period for taking advantage to an earnings surprise.
"
3099,ARNC,"As an example, here are some of the recent trades made in the Surprise Trader portfolio:
"
3100,ARNC,"Analogic (ALOG) exceeded expectations by 17 cents on Dec 6 when it reported fiscal first-quarter profits of 52 cents per share. The stock was added to the portfolio the same day, even as shares of ALOG had jumped significantly. We kept the stock in the portfolio until Dec 27 and benefited from an additional 3.4% rise in ALOGs price.
"
3101,ARNC,"Blyth (BTH) reported its third-quarter results on Dec 5. The company earned 24 cents per share, double what analysts had predicted. The stock was added to the Surprise Trader portfolio at the end of the same day and held onto until Dec 20 for a gain of 2.58%.
"
3102,ARNC,"Stage Stores  exceeded expectations by a penny with third-quarter profits of six cents per share. The stock was added to the portfolio on the same day of its earnings report, Nov 20, and held onto until Dec 4 for a 1.7% gain.
"
3103,ARNC,"Bob Evans (BOBE) generated fiscal second-quarter profits of 45 cents per share, six cents above expectations. The positive surprise created an immediate, positive reaction the following day, Nov 13, sending the stock notably higher. BOBE was added to the portfolio at the close of Nov 13. The stock continued to rise for several more days, netting the portfolio a short-term gain of 6.76% by the time it was sold on Nov 27.
"
3104,ARNC,"Surprise Trader is designed to identify multiple trading opportunities. Though the gains for any one single trade are not likely to be large, the combination of multiple, small gains results in impressive annual portfolio returns. For example, a 3.5% per month gain will compound into 51.1% return over a 12-month period.
"
3105,ARNC,"On average, the service will generate 4-7 trades per month. Approximately 60% of the trades will be profitable, with the size of the average gain exceeding the size of the average loss. The subscribers who have the most success with the service are those who closely follow the portfolio as opposed to picking and choosing which stocks to trade and which to pass. The reason is that cumulatively, the winning trades will result in large, annual portfolio returns.
"
3106,ARNC,"Zacks Surprise Trader is one several trading services that Zacks offers:
"
3107,ARNC,"Zacks/Schaeffers Options Trader: The timeliness of Zacks #1 Rank stocks combined with the options expertise of Schaeffers Investment Research.
"
3108,ARNC,"Zacks Breakout Trader: Get in on a turnaround stock before Wall Street does and maximize its price increase. This service helps investors find the best of the best of the Zacks #1 Rank stocks.

3109,ARNC,"Zacks Momentum Trader: This new breakthrough combines technical analysis with the fundamental power of the Zacks Rank.

3110,ARNC,"Zacks Value Trader: An investment portfolio focused on stocks with strong fundamentals and low valuations.
"
3111,ARNC,"Matt Thurmond is writing Earnings Trends this week for Dirk van Djik, who is out.
"
3112,ARNC,"The final stretch is here and its looking like another season of double-digit growth. So far, over 75% of the companies in the S&P 500 index have reported and median third-quarter growth stands at 11.3%. If the remaining companies to report post similar analyst surprise levels, the total S&P index will achieve median growth of 11.2%. This is slightly below current levels but would continue a double-digit quarterly growth streak which has now been running for five years. Not a bad way to start out the holiday season.
"
3113,ARNC,"Strong analyst surprise levels continue to boost previously expected growth rates. The median analyst EPS surprise thus far has been just over 3%. The ratio of companies with positive surprises to those with negatives stands at 2.71:1. The median surprise is unchanged from a week ago. The surprise ratio is up slightly from last weeks recording of 2.68 :1.
"
3114,ARNC,"Looking at individual sectors, Consumer Staples is this weeks standout performer. While Healthcare leads by the key median growth metric, the Staples have scored top marks by nearly every other measure. The sector boasts the highest surprise ratio, at a whopping 6.7 :1. Not a lot of disappointments so far. Based on both the median growth rate and the median analyst surprise, the sector ranks third among its peers. Also noteworthy, analysts are aggressively bumping up EPS expectations for the sector. The Staples now have the highest estimate revisions ratio, which we discuss in greater detail later in this report.
"
3115,ARNC,"The laggard sector this week remains the Financials. No surprise here. The subprime fallout continues to weigh on the group. Over 90% of the sectors firms have reported and median growth is just slightly over 5%. The surprise metrics have inched upward slightly but still rank among the lowest. The median surprise is just under 1% and the surprise ratio is 1.3:1. The fourth quarter isnt looking any better. The median firm in the sector is expected to report less than 4% comparable growth and analyst continue to revise full-year 2007 estimates lower.

"
3117,ARNC,"Along with EPS growth, we also like to balance our earnings analysis out by considering total reported growth. The two tables below show growth calculated for the S&P 500 index based on as-reported net income numbers. The tables below have very similar data sets to the first two EPS-based tables shown above. The total tables below however, are as of the market close on Friday, Nov 2. The tables above are as of the close on Thursday, Nov 1. This has a minimal impact on underlying data set. The first table below displays growth metrics for only the S&P 500 firms that have reported third-quarter results. The second table shows the growth rates of firms that have yet to report.
"
3118,ARNC,"There are three important items to note when considering the income-based growth picture below. First, the calculations are size-weighted. Mega-firms have a larger effect on the growth rates. Sector and index totals are calculated by simply adding up net income numbers so the size of earnings is directly proportional to the impact. Exxon Mobil (XOM  -  Free Report) for example makes up just over 30% of the energy sectors earnings and nearly 5% of the indexs total expected earnings for 2007. In contrast, the EPS tables above have Exxons results equally-weighted with those of other firms. The second item to note in the tables below is that share-buybacks have no effect on growth rates since the tables are based on income rather than EPS.
"
3119,ARNC,"Finally, reported extraordinary gains or losses have a considerable effect on the growth rates. Since the numbers are as-reported, any asset write-downs or other one-time items flow through to earnings. For example, Merrill Lynchs (MER) massive third-quarter mortgage write-downs are included in the first table shown below. Merrill reported a net-loss of $2.2 billion compared to a $3.0 billion profit in the prior-year period. Net of the write-downs, Merrill would have shown much more favorable comps and the third-quarter financial sector growth rate would be 10% higher.

"
3121,ARNC,"To help gauge the direction of the market, we take note of what analysts are thinking. By tallying their EPS changes, we can determine our revisions ratio. This ratio simply divides the total number of positive estimate revisions by the total number of estimate cuts. Thus, a high ratio is a bullish indicator and a low ratio is bearish. For the S&P 500 as a whole, a number below 0.80 or above 1.25 is generally significant. For individual sectors the distance from 1.0 should be greater for the numbers to be significant.
"
3122,ARNC,"The revisions ratio for 2007 rose to 1.12 this week, a sharp increase from 0.93 last week but down from the 1.43 seen comparably during the second-quarter reporting period. Total revisions over the past month were 3,312: 1,750 upward and 1,562 downward. This revisions level is up 30% from the 2,556 recorded last week. Negative sentiment surrounding the Financial sector continues to hold the ratio back. This sector has seen the largest number of negative 2007 revisions over the last four weeks. The subprime fallout and the turnover in housing is clearly taking its toll. The leading laggards in the sector, in terms of total negative revisions, were BB&T (BBT  -  Free Report) and Wachovia (WB). Remove this underperforming sector from the total and the revisions ratio would have come in nearly 20% higher this week. On a total number of firms basis, the EPS revisions picture was more positive. About 20% more companies saw full-year 07 estimate increases than decreases.
"
3123,ARNC,"The Consumer Staples sector boasts the highest 2007 revisions ratio at 1.97. This is a sharp upswing from last weeks 1.61. The sector does not shine as favorably based on our other key metric though. The ratio of firms with EPS estimate upgrades to those with downgrades is essentially flat. Retailers Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) and Costco (COST  -  Free Report) have seen the highest number of upward revisions recently for the sector.
"
3124,ARNC,"Turning our eye toward a laggard other than the Financials, the Materials sector is at rock bottom with a ratio of 0.60. While this is up slightly from last week, the sector is still showing five negative revisions for every three positives. Alcoa (AA) and Allegheny Tech (ATI  -  Free Report) were the sector firms hit hardest with negative revisions over the past four weeks.

As in the 2007 calculation, the financial sector had a major negative impact on the overall revisions ratio and accounted for over 30% of total negative revisions over the last four weeks. If this sectors impact is netted out, the 2008 revisions ratio would be a much more favorable 1.10.

"
3128,ARNC,"On a full-year2 basis, median earnings growth for the S&P 500 is expected to remain healthy. On a total basis however, growth is expected to slump into the high single digits for 2007 and then rebound in 2008.
"
3129,ARNC,"There are a couple of technical points which are affecting the expected growth rates. Recently firms have been pumping enormous, and unprecedented, sums into share repurchases. In 2006, over $432 billion was spent by S&P 500 firms to buy back their own stock. These buybacks amount to 3.4% of the S&P 500s year-end 2006 value and have the effect of increasing 2006/2005 EPS growth rates by approximately 3.5%. All indications are that buybacks will have a similar effect on 2007 earnings growth.
"
3130,ARNC,"On a total earnings basis, growth is expected to show a far sharper deceleration in 2007 than on a median earnings basis. Total earnings are expected to be 7.4% in 2007, following 16.2% growth in 2006. Next year, total earnings growth is expected to rebound to 13.0%. On a median earnings basis, growth in 2007 is expected to be 12.1%. Median earnings growth in 2008 is expected to accelerate slightly to 12.6%. All four of the sectors which posted greater than 20% growth in 2006 on a total earnings basis are expected to see growth fall to the single digits.
"
3131,ARNC,"Only three sectors are expected to post total earnings growth of greater than 10% in 2007, down from seven double-digit growth sectors in 2006. Interestingly the total earnings growth for those sectors is very close to the median growth expected for those sectors. Looking forward to next year, the Consumer Discretionary sector is expected to post a big snap back, to 21.9% growth from only 1.2% growth this year. This is mostly from hopes of a turnaround in the homebuilding industry. Count us as dubious on that proposition. The total expected earnings growth for the energy sector for this year is 7.1% which is a bit below that of the overall market; however, it has been growing steadily over the course of the year. Six months ago, the total earnings for the sector were expected be up only 1.0% in 2007.

"
3133,ARNC,"When making investment decisions, growth should always be looked at in conjunction with how much you are paying for a stock. Thus, it makes sense to look at the total earnings expected for a sector, relative to that sectors total market capitalization. This is basically a variation on looking at the P/E.
"
3134,ARNC,"The chart below shows the share of total earnings for 2006, 2007 and 2008, as well as the share of total market capitalization for each sector (the final bar shown). Since the S&P 500 is a market cap weighted index, this is the same as its index weight. On the chart below, the difference between the sizes of the first three bars shows if a sector is gaining or losing earnings share. The difference between the final bar and the first three bars shows if the sector is selling for an above or below market P/E. If the final bar is smaller than the other bars, the sector is selling for a below market P/E. However, as opposed to just showing the sector P/Es, it also shows the relative importance of the sectors to the overall index.
"
3135,ARNC,"Clearly the Financials are the biggest influence on the market, comprising 18.4% of the total market capitalization of the S&P 500. The credit crunch and mortgage woes have had an effect on the sector. Four months ago it comprised just over 20% of the market capitalization of the index. The Financials sector is relatively cheap on an earnings basis, and serves to hold the overall P/E of the index down. In other words, Financials deserve to be the biggest influence on the market, since they contribute 27.0 % of the total expected earnings for 2007 and 26.4% of the expected earnings for 2008. The Financials are the cheapest sector in the market followed Energy on a P/E basis. However, given recent events in the credit markets there have to be serious questions about how real the earnings are for many of the firms in the sector.
"
3136,ARNC,"Energy looks to be under represented in its influence on the market since it is expected to provide 13.7% of the total earnings for 2007, but represents only 10.6% of the total market capitalization of the index. While its earnings share is currently expected to decline to approximately 12.6% in 2008, even on this basis it is still much cheaper than the overall market. Tech on the other hand represents 16.2% of the total market capitalization, but only 11.2% of the 2007, and 12.2% of the 2008 total earnings.
"
3137,ARNC,"In more conventional terms, the Energy sector is trading for 13.7x 2007 and 12.6x 2008 earnings. The Financials are trading for 12.1x 2007 and 11.0x 2008 earnings. The S&P is trading for 16.1x and 14.4x, respectively. Tech continues to be the most expensive sector trading at 23.2x and 19.1x 2007 and 2008 earnings, respectively. On a blended basis (three-fourths 2008, one-fourth 2007), the P/E for the overall market translates to an earnings yield of 6.80%, which is far more attractive than the 4.34% level available on a 10 year T-Note. However, keep in mind that these earning are after several years of very robust growth and corporate profits are near a record high percentage of GDP. If firms were to return to more normal levels of profitability, they would be much less attractively valued. The second chart below shows the sector P/Es ranked from lowest to highest based on estimated 2007 P/E ratios.

3139,ARNC,"Data in this report, unless stated otherwise, is through the close on Thursday 11/1/2007
"
3140,ARNC,"1The growth rates for the scorecard and the yet to report tables are based on median year-over-year EPS growth. The growth rates for the total earnings table are based on year-over-year growth in net income. Thus changes in shares outstanding (i.e. buybacks) can significantly affect the year-over-year growth in the scorecard, but would not affect the growth shown in the total earnings table.
"
3141,ARNC,"2We follow the convention of referring to the most recently completed full fiscal year as ""2006"", and the next full fiscal year to be reported as 2007. It is thus possible for the ""actual 2006"" numbers to change as non-calendar fiscal year companies report their full year earnings. These changes can be particularly significant near mid year given the relatively large number of companies with June fiscal year ends.

3143,ARNC,"Third-quarter earnings ""officially"" starts after the close of trading on Tuesday, with Alcoa's (AA) third-quarter report. As I'll explain below, it may not be a very good start, however, given that earnings estimates for the Dow component have been falling.
"
3144,ARNC,"Joining Alcoa in reporting will be 32 other companies, eight of which are also in the S&P 500: Costco Wholesale (COST  -  Free Report), Host Hotels & Resorts (HST), Monsanto (MON), M&T Bank (MTB  -  Free Report), PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report), Progressive (PGR  -  Free Report), Safeway (SWY) and Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report). Outside of AA's direct impact in the Dow, none of these stocks are likely to move the markets in any notable direction, though positive (or negative reports) could still influence overall sentiment.
"
3145,ARNC,"The only economic reports that could have any true impact on market direction will by the September PPI and the advanced retail sales data. The ideal spin on both reports will be contained inflation and just enough weakness to increase the odds of a rate cut at the October meeting. Joining these two reports on Friday will be the preliminary University of Michigan consumer confidence index and August business inventories. Prior to these four reports will be August wholesale trade (Wednesday) and August trade deficit (Thursday).
"
3146,ARNC,"What could influence market direction are the minutes from the September Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which should be released on Tuesday afternoon. The key question will be whether the market believes the Fed understands the severity of the credit crunch and is willing to do whatever is necessary to prevent a recession from occurring. A 25-basis point rate cut at the October meeting seems likely and anything suggesting that this won't happen will not be taken lightly. I don't anticipate any surprises in the Fed minutes, but it is important for investors to understand that in this case, perception is reality. And, in the case of the Fed minutes, perception could be a two-way sword.
"
3147,ARNC,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings Surprises during the Week of Oct 8 - 12
"
3148,ARNC,"A few weeks ago, Monsanto (MON) raised its fiscal 2007 profit guidance to approximately $2 per share from $1.75 to $1.80 per share. The company cited an effective tax rate of 30%, sustained strength in corn seeds and the ability to charge more for Roundup herbicides. The revised forecast led five of the covering brokerage analysts to improve their forecasts for the fiscal fourth-quarter. The current consensus estimate now calls for a fiscal fourth-quarter loss of 22 cents per share, 12 cents narrower than the average projection of a month ago. The most accurate consensus is more bullish at a loss of 16 cents per share. MON has topped expectations for three consecutive quarters, most recently by a margin of two cents per share. Monsanto is scheduled to report on Wednesday, Oct 10, before the start of trading.
"
3149,ARNC,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings Surprises during the Week of Oct 8 - 12
"
3150,ARNC,"More than half of the covering brokerage analysts have cut their third-quarter profit forecasts on Alcoa (AA) during the past 30 days. The cuts follow an August drop in aluminum prices that sent the metal from $1.20 to below $1.10; the metal has yet to recover. The current consensus estimate of 68 cents per share is 10 cents below the forecast of a month ago. The most accurate consensus is even more bearish at 65 cents per share. AA has missed expectations twice during the past four quarters. As stated above, Alcoa is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Oct 9, after the close of trading.
"
3151,ARNC,"Brokerage analysts were quick to lower their forecasts after Progressive (PGR  -  Free Report) released its August results. The property and casualty insurer said net premiums written fell by 4%. The announcement caused 10 brokerage analysts to cut their forecasts, resulting in a four-cent decline in the consensus estimate to 39 cents per share. The most accurate consensus is more bearish at 37 cents per share. PGR previously missed second-quarter expectations by six cents per share. Progressive is scheduled to report earnings on Thursday, Oct 10.

"
3157,ARNC,"Alcoa  (AA) kicked off the official start of earnings season this week, but through the close of Thursday, June 12, relatively few firms had reported.  A total of 36 companies in the S&P 500 have reported, or 7.2% of the total. The median results continue to be so-so, though it is still far too early to jump to any conclusions. With a small sample size, each new report can swing the numbers dramatically, as we get further along in the season the numbers should stabilize.
"
3158,ARNC,"The median year-over-year growth rate of those that have reported stands at 8.98%, (first table) this is slightly higher than the expected growth rate of 8.30% (second table) for those S&P 500 firms that have yet to report. Thus at first glance it appears that the total year-over-year median growth rate should fall slightly as more companies report. However, given the tendency for more companies to report earnings above expectations, it seems likely that growth could again be in the double digits. Looking at the small sample of those that have already reported, the ratio of positive to negative surprises (3:1) is very much in line with where previous quarters have ended up, the same is true for the median surprise (3.45%). However, in previous quarters, the surprise ratio started out significantly higher, and then drifted down as the reporting season progressed.
"
3159,ARNC,"This quarter in addition to tracking the median year-over-year growth, we will be tracking the total net income growth for each sector. This data is included in the third table below and includes only the 36 firms that have already reported. The median implicitly equally weights the firms in a sector, while tracking total net income growth puts more weight on the larger firms. Another reason for the discrepancy is the use of actual earnings versus earnings after non-recurring items. Calculations in the Total Earnings table utilize the former while the Scorecard showcases the latter. Therefore, look to the totals table for a clear picture of how each sectors firms are performing in aggregate.
"
3160,ARNC,"In the small sample of already reported firms, the total earnings growth is lower than the median growth rate. In the second quarter, those 38 firms posted total growth of 5.47%. While the total sample size is small, it does not appear to be particularly biased. If we look at the total growth expectation of those companies for the full year, it is 8.51%, which is very similar to the total growth expectations for the S&P 500 as a whole for 2007, which stand at 8.75%.

"
3162,ARNC,"To help gauge the direction of the market, we take note of what analysts are thinking. By tallying their EPS changes, we can determine our revisions ratio. This ratio simply divides the total number of positive estimate revisions by the total number of estimate cuts. Thus, a high ratio is a bullish indicator and a low ratio is bearish. For the S&P 500 as a whole, a number below 0.80 or above 1.25 is generally significant. For individual sectors the distance from 1.0 should be greater for the numbers to be significant.
"
3163,ARNC,"For fiscal 2007, the revisions ratio stands at 0.90, down slightly from 0.91 last week. Over the last four weeks, there were 631 upward EPS revisions and 701 downward, for 1,332 revisions total. This was a 7.9% increase in total revisions from last week. As more companies report, the total number of estimate revisions should increase dramatically.. With in a month, it is likely that the total number of revisions will triple. Remember that these ratios are moving four week totals, so last weeks reading is not totally independent from this weeks (three weeks of overlap). When the focus is shifted away from the number of estimates changed, to the number of firms with rising mean estimates to falling estimates, the ratio is a fairly healthy 1.16.
"
3164,ARNC,"With a relatively small number of revisions, the revisions ratios for the individual sectors can move fairly dramatically from week to week and that certainly happened this week. The revisions ratios were lower than last week for seven of the ten sectors, but were above 1.0 for seven sectors as well (same as last week). The three that were below 1.0 last week remained there this week. Consumer Staples posted the most significant jump, rising to 3.48 to lead the standings, from a middling 1.93 last week. Energy and Financial Services both remained well above 1.0 but showed significant declines in their revisions ratios from last week. Consumer Discretionary and Industrials had the worst showings. Consumer discretionary had more than three times as many cuts as increases.

3166,ARNC,"The 2008 revisions ratio is 1.16, down from 1.20 last week and still higher than the 2007 ratio. There were 603 upward revisions and 521 cuts for 2008, making the total number of FY2 revisions over the last month 1,124, up 6.7 from last week.  As with 2007, Consumer Staples leads the pack with almost four increases for every cut. Compared to the 2007 revisions, the performance of the Materials sector really stands out. There were almost four increases for every cut for 2008 in the sector. The Consumer Discretionary and Utilities sectors were the weakest. However, with Utilities, the cuts were more concentrated, as there were actually more firms with rising than falling mean estimates for the year, despite more than twice as many cuts as increases in the individual estimates. For the S&P 500 overall, the ratio of firms with rising mean estimates to falling mean estimates for 2008 was a very healthy 1.44, a significantly better showing than the revisions ratio.

"
3168,ARNC,"On a full-year1 basis, median earnings growth for the S&P 500 is expected to remain healthy. On a total basis however, growth is expected to slump into the high single digits for 2007 and then rebound in 2008. 
"
3169,ARNC,"There are a couple of technical points which are affecting the expected growth rates. Recently firms have been pumping enormous, and unprecedented, sums into share repurchases. In 2006, over $432 billion was spent by S&P 500 firms to buy back their own stock. These buybacks amount to 3.4% of the S&P 500s year-end 2006 value and have the effect of increasing 2006/2005 EPS growth rates by approximately 3.5%. All indications are that buybacks will have a similar effect on 2007 earnings growth. 
"
3170,ARNC,"On a total earnings basis, growth is expected to show a far sharper deceleration in 2007 than on a median earnings basis. Total earnings are expected to be 8.75% in 2007, following 16.4% growth in 2006. Next year total earnings growth is expected to rebound to 11.66%. On a median earnings basis, growth in 2007 is expected to match the 12.0% posted in 2006. All three of the sectors which posted greater than 20% growth in 2006 on a total earnings basis are expected to see growth fall to the single digits. Two sectors, Consumer Staples and Technology, are expected to see noteworthy earnings acceleration in 2007 that is expected to carry over into 2008. In the Materials and Energy sectors, growth measured on a median basis is far healthier than if measured on a total earnings basis, which is in large part due to the concentration of a high percentage of the total earnings for the sector in a few firms in those sectors. Only three sectors are expected to post total earnings growth of greater than 10% in 2007, down from seven double digit growth sectors in 2006.

"
3172,ARNC,"When making investment decisions, growth should always be looked at in conjunction with how much you are paying for a stock. Thus, it makes sense to look at the total earnings expected for a sector, relative to that sectors total market capitalization. This is basically a variation on looking at the P/E.
"
3173,ARNC,"The chart below shows the share of total earnings for 2006, 2007 and 2008, as well as the share of total market capitalization for each sector (the final bar shown). Since the S&P 500 is a market cap weighted index, this is the same as its index weight. On the chart below, the difference between the sizes of the first three bars shows if a sector is gaining or losing earnings share. The difference between the final bar and the first three bars shows if the sector is selling for an above or below market P/E. If the final bar is smaller than the other bars, the sector is selling for a below market P/E. However, as opposed to just showing the sector P/Es, it also shows the relative importance of the sectors to the overall index. 
"
3174,ARNC,"Clearly the Financials are the biggest influence on the market, comprising 20.0% of the total market capitalization of the S&P 500. However, that sector is also relatively cheap on an earnings basis, and thus serves to hold the overall P/E of the index down. In other words, Financials deserve to be the biggest influence on the market, since they contribute approximately 27.1% of the total expected earnings for 2007. Recently the Financials claimed the title as the cheapest sector in the market from Energy.
"
3175,ARNC,"Energy however, still looks to be under represented in its influence on the market since it is expected to provide 13.8% of the total earnings for 2007, but represents only approximately 10.8% of the total market capitalization of the index. While its earnings share is currently expected to decline to approximately 12.7% in 2008, even on this basis it is still much cheaper than the overall market. 
"
3176,ARNC,"In more conventional terms, the Energy sector is trading for 12.8 x 2007 and 12.5x 2008 earnings. The Financials are trading for 12.1x 2007 and 11.1x 2008 earnings. The S&P is trading for 16.4x and 14.7 x, respectively. Tech continues to be the most expensive sector trading at 23.9x and 19.7x 2007 and 2008 earnings, respectively. On a blended basis, the P/E for the overall market translated to an earnings yield of 6.43%, which is far more attractive than the 5.10% level available on a 10 year T-Note. Even if Energy and Financials are excluded, the earnings yield falls to 5.61%, still more attractive than the yields on T-notes. The second chart below shows the sector P/Es ranked from lowest to highest based on estimated 2007 P/E ratios. 
"
3177,ARNC,"Matt Thurmond contributed significantly to this report.1 We follow the convention of referring to the most recently completed full fiscal year as 2006, and the next full fiscal year to be reported as 2007. It is thus possible for the actual 2006 numbers to change as non-calendar fiscal year companies report their full year earnings. These changes can be particularly significant near midyear given the relatively large number of companies with June fiscal year ends.
"
3178,ARNC,"With Alcoas (AA) earnings announcement after the close on Monday, the second-quarter earnings season is officially underway. We are still very much in the early stages and through the close of Jul 10, only 33 of the S&P 500 had reported, most of which are non calendar fiscal year firms which reported May quarter results. So far positive surprises are leading disappointments by almost 3:1 with a median surprise of 2.7%. That is slightly worse than what we have seen when all is said and done in previous quarters, and far worse than what we have seen at comparable stages of recent quarters.

However, dont read too much into the rankings at this early date, with a small sample size each new report could cause the standings to vary widely. After all, only one Health Care firm has reported, not exactly a robust sample. Even within a sector, the early results may not be representative. For example, all of the Financial Services stocks that have reported are Investment Bankers, and the dynamics for that group are likely to be very different than the dynamics of Regional Banks and Insurance Firms. 
"
3180,ARNC,"It is useful then to compare the results of those that have reported in each sector to those firms which have yet to report. Clearly the whole of Health Care is expected to do much better than that one company (Biomet (BMET)) that did report. Conversely, the four Financial Services firms that have reported hardly look like a representative sample, and the results for the vast majority of the firms in the sector are expected to be far weaker than for those four that have reported. Relative to where the scorecard stands now, look for results to improve for Tech and Industrials, and deteriorate for Materials and Consumer Staples. Of course there are also three sectors which have not had any companies report yet. If all goes according to analysts expectations, the Health Care, Materials and Industrial sectors should have the best year-over-year growth. Telecom should be the only sector where more firms report declining earnings than increasing year-over-year earnings. Utilities, Energy and Consumer stocks should report anemic year-over-year growth. However, keep in mind that the lower the hurdle is set, the easier it is to get over it, thus some of the low expectation sectors may be best positioned to exceed expectations. Given the recent trends in estimate revisions, Energy maybe the best positioned to exceed expectations, even considering very tough year ago comparisons.

3185,ARNC,"Second-quarter earnings season officially starts on Monday afternoon with Alcoas (AA) second-quarter report. The aluminum maker is projected to have earned 86 cents per share. Four brokerage analysts cut their forecasts during the past seven days, resulting in a one-cent drop in the consensus forecast, but, expectations are essentially unchanged from 60 days ago. Investors should note that despite its status as being the company to officially kick-off earnings season, AA does not provide a good proxy of how corporate earnings will actually perform.
"
3186,ARNC,"Preseason performance is also not representative, because of the limited number of companies. Just 54 S&P 1500 (S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400 and S&P SmallCap 600) companies reported second-quarter profits during June. Positive surprises are leading negative surprises by a ratio of 4:1. Median company growth has run at 12.5%. 
"
3187,ARNC,"Consensus estimates are calling for the median company in the S&P 1500 to have generated second-quarter growth of 6.3%. Growth among large-caps should be better with the median S&P 500 company expected to report growth of 8.4%. On an index-weighted basis, forecasts call for S&P 500 growth of 6.7%. I expect the actual numbers to be better given the propensity of companies to surprise to the upside, a proportionate lack of earnings estimate cuts over the past several weeks and what appears to be an acceleration in economic growth during June. (Employment growth was decent and both ISM surveys signaled positive.)
"
3188,ARNC,"The first official week of earnings season tends to the calm before the storm and the week of July 9 will be no different. Just 30 companies are expected to report, with Alcoa, Marriot (MAR  -  Free Report) and Yum Brands (YUM  -  Free Report) representing the S&P 500.
"
3189,ARNC,"The economic calendar will not provide much excitement either. May consumer credit will be released on Monday afternoon. Tuesday features May wholesale trade data. May trade deficit figures will be published on Thursday. The week ends with June import and retail sales numbers, the University of Michigans initial July consumer confidence index and May business inventories.
"
3190,ARNC,"Volume could pick up a bit as traders and institutional investors come back from vacation.  The favorable economic backdrop should provide a tailwind for stocks, though with the bulk of earnings reports yet to come, it is questionable whether there will be enough momentum to keep the Dow at new highs, assuming a breakout occurs early in the week. Plus, the weather is likely to generate some chatter on trading floors with a heat wave expected to hit the East Coast.
"
3191,ARNC,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings Surprises during the Week of July 9  13Emmis Communications  has missed expectations for three consecutive quarters. One brokerage analyst has cut his forecast within the past few weeks, ahead of the media companys fiscal first-quarter report. As a result of the cut, the Most Recent Consensus now calls for a loss of 11 cents per share, versus the average forecast of a loss of nine cents per share. Emmis Communication is scheduled to report on Tuesday, July 10, before the start of trading.
"
3192,ARNC,"The consensus estimate for Sealy (ZZ) have been adjusted down by a penny over the past 30 days. Brokerage analysts now expect the company to have earned 22 cents per share during its fiscal second quarter. Not a big revision, but the mattress manufacturers fiscal first-quarter expectations were below forecasts. Sealy is scheduled to report on Tuesday, July 10, after the close of trading.

"
3197,ARNC,"If the government releases an employment report and no one is around to read it, does it still have an impact?
"
3198,ARNC,"June employment numbers will be released on Friday, July 6, and combined with Mondays (July 2) ISM manufacturing survey will provide updated information about the strength of the economy. The problem is that many financial professionals could be out on vacation. One fund manager proclaimed at a recent luncheon that she didnt know who would be working during the week of the Fourth. With a federal holiday smack in the middle of the week and kids out of school, it does seem likely that quite a few people will be taking some time off. (For the record, there will be a number of us, including myself, who will be at our desks.)
"
3199,ARNC,"If volume is lower than average, then trading could be choppy. Second-quarter earnings season will not start until July 9, with Alcoas (AA) report; however, the bulk of profit news wont start being released until the latter half of the month.
"
3200,ARNC,"Earnings news during the holiday week will be very limited, with just five companies scheduled to report. The largest of the group is Laidlaw International (LI), which has a market capitalization of about $2.7 billion.
"
3201,ARNC,"On the economic front, May factory orders and pending home sales data will be released on Tuesday.

"
3210,ARNC,"Corporate profits for the second quarter look to be the slowest in quite some time. Earnings for the S&P 500 are expected to rise just 6.2%. On a company specific basis, the numbers look somewhat better with the median company expected to achieve 8.4% growth. Obviously, not every member of the S&P 500 has the same weighting in the index, hence the difference in growth rates.
"
3211,ARNC,"Continuing a trend that occurred in the first quarter, growth is projected to be stronger among large-cap companies than among mid- and small-cap companies. The median company in the S&P 1500 (which is comprised of the S&P 500, the S&P MidCap 400 and the S&P SmallCap 600) will be 6.3%. The disparity may be partially explained by greater proportion of large-cap companies that have foreign exposure and have active share repurchase programs. Bigger companies also tend to be more diversified.
"
3212,ARNC,"There have been second-quarter reports from 30 companies in the S&P 1500 so far. The numbers are running above expectations, with 17 positive surprises and five negative surprises (the remainder have matched expectations). Median growth is at 12.7%, but I would caution against reading anything into this. The sample used for these numbers is far too small to draw any trends from. Nonetheless, it does represent a positive preseason. 
"
3213,ARNC,"Second-quarter earnings season will ""officially"" start on July 9 with Alcoa's (AA) report. The aluminum company is expected to have earned 87 cents per share, a penny higher than what it earned a year prior. The lackluster earnings forecast is fairly typical of what is likely to be reported by many metals companies. Brokerage analysts expect the median metals company to have generated 5.2% growth in the second-quarter. A rally in prices last year is setting up tough comps. 
"
3214,ARNC,"However, earnings will vary by company, however, For example, Comercial Metals (CMC  -  Free Report) gave a bullish report last week. The company earned 82 cents per share during its fiscal third-quarter, 32% above year prior profits. Sales rose 15% to $2.3 billion. Higher volumes of scrap processed and favorable conditions in Europe helped to counterbalance the effect of volatile steel prices.
"
3215,ARNC,"Investors who are looking for growth may want to focus on aerospace, container, medical and oil machinery and services companies.
"
3216,ARNC,"Aerospace enjoyed strong growth in the first quarter and momentum appears to have carried over to the second-quarter. Defense spending by the U.S. government certainly helps, but the commercial side is the primary driver, a reflection of the ongoing worldwide economic expansion. Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) in particular is expected to show strong growth with profits of $1.14 per share following a year prior loss of 21 cents per share. The Dow component is also about to premiere its first new jetliner in 13 years, the 787 Dreamliner. Aerospace component companies Goodrich (GR) and Precision Castparts (PCP) are also expected to report strong growth.
"
3217,ARNC,"Packaging company Ball Corporation (BLL  -  Free Report) has benefited from the strength in aerospace as well. The bigger driver for the company, however, has been rising sales of metal beverage packaging, both domestically and abroad. Food packaging is also a key driver for Sealed Air (SEE  -  Free Report), which is enjoying higher sales in Latin America and Asia.
"
3218,ARNC,"Multiple medical-related companies should deliver double-digit growth. The Part D prescription drug benefit is continuing to help attract new enrollees to health insurers such as WellCare (WCG  -  Free Report) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report). The growth for medical device companies, such as Zimmer (ZMH), reflects more company-specific issues than industry-specific issues. It should be noted, however, that the demographics of the U.S. will lead to higher spending on healthcare in the future.
"
3219,ARNC,"Finally, oil machinery and service companies are benefitting from the same thing that has been helping them for multiple quarters now - crude's ability to stay at elevated prices. High oil prices make it worthwhile for major oil companies, refiners and exploration and production companies to invest in maintenance and new projects. All of this turn creates more business for likes of National Oilwell (NOV  -  Free Report), Smith International (SII) and Cameron International  (CAM).
"
3220,ARNC,"The number of estimate revisions continues to drop for stocks within the Zacks Rank universe. Using a four-week rolling period, a total of 3,523 estimates were revised last week (1,703 positive revisions and 1,820 negative revisions). This compares to the peak of 13,077 estimate revisions during first-quarter earnings season. 
"
3221,ARNC,"I expect this trend of fewer estimate revisions to continue until about mid-July when second-quarter earnings report start to be released en masse. Brokerage analysts have been less likely to adjust their forecasts between earnings seasons. This is a trend that has been amplified during the past two quarters and given the continuing uncertainty about the pace of economic growth, there is little reason not to expect this trend to continue.
"
3222,ARNC,"What does this mean for the markets? Simply, the lack of positive estimate revisions is one less catalyst to move stocks higher. This is part of the reason the equity markets have been reacting to the sharp rise in treasury bond yields.

"
3226,ARNC,"Alcoas (AA) first-quarter report, scheduled for Tuesday afternoon, will officially kickoff first-quarter earnings season. The aluminum producer is expected to report profits of 75 cents per share, though the Most Recent Consensus calls for 76 cents per share.
"
3227,ARNC,"Joining Alcoa during the week of Apr 9 will be 32 other companies with earnings repots, including S&P 500 members: Bed, Bath & Beyond (BBBY  -  Free Report), General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) and MGIC Investment (MGIC  -  Free Report). 
"
3228,ARNC,"As I recently stated on our blog, first-quarter earnings for the S&P 500 appear to be on track for another quarter of double-digit growth. The consensus estimate calls for operating earnings to total $22.48 versus $20.75 a year prior. This equates to first-quarter year-over-year growth of 8.3%. If actual earnings are just 1.5% better than analysts expect, first-quarter growth will hit 10%. Given the propensity of CFOs to beat earnings expectations, a double-digit growth rate is within the realm of probabilities.
"
3229,ARNC,"The economic calendar is light. Minutes from the March Fed meeting should be released on Wednesday afternoon. Thursday brings March import prices and weekly initial jobless claims.

"
3231,ARNC,"Six brokerage analysts have raised their fiscal fourth-quarter estimates on Research in Motion (RIMM) over the past 30 days. The revisions were not material enough to move the consensus estimate (we have forecasts from 26 analysts for RIMM), but the Most Recent Consensus, which reflects these revisions, is bullish. The Most Recent Consensus (the average of forecasts published over the past 30 days) calls for earnings of $1.01 per share versus the consensus estimate (the average of all published forecasts) of 98 cents per share. Investors should note, however, that RIMMs fiscal third-quarter earnings were a penny below expectations. Research in Motion is scheduled to report preliminary results on Wednesday, Apr 11, after the close of trading.

3233,ARNC,"MGIC Investment Corporation (MTG) missed estimates last quarter by seven cents. Ahead of the companys first-quarter report, brokerage analysts are lowering their forecasts. During the past 30 days, three of the 13 covering analysts have cut their projections. These cuts have caused the consensus estimate to fall four cents to $1.78 per share. The Most Recent Consensus is more bearish at $1.77 per share. MGIC Investment is scheduled to report on Thursday, Apr 12, before the start of trading.

3238,ARNC,"There isn't much on the calendar for next week. 
"
3239,ARNC,"Just 56 companies are confirmed to be report earnings. Seven of these are in the S&P 500. While we hope Tiffany & Co. (TIF  -  Free Report) gives its shareholders a little blue box, the only company likely to have any influence on market direction is homebuilder Lennar (LEN  -  Free Report). Even then, it's hard to imagine what the company could say that would sway current attitudes about the housing market. 
"
3240,ARNC,"First-quarter earnings season will not ""officially"" start until Apr 10, when Alcoa (AA) is scheduled to report. Nonetheless, 41 companies in the Zacks Rank universe1 have reported first-quarter results. Positive surprises are leading negative surprises by a margin of about 2:1 and earnings growth is running at 9.8%. A decent start, but given the small size of the group, investors should refrain from drawing any conclusions.
"
3241,ARNC,"Economic data next week will feature consumer confidence (Conference Board on Tuesday and University of Michigan on Friday), durable goods orders (Wednesday), final fourth-quarter GDP (Thursday), personal income and spending (Friday) and Chicago PMI (Friday).
"
3242,ARNC,"Sorry baseball fans, but opening day is still nine days away.
"
3243,ARNC,"So what will move the markets next week? Look for daily news (e.g. mergers) and sentiment to move stocks prices. The tail end of the quarter may bring some earnings preannouncements, but the number of earnings estimate revisions has been dropping significantly over the past several weeks.
"
3244,ARNC,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings Surprises During the Week of Mar 26 - 30
"
3245,ARNC,"A.G. Edwards (AGE) has given shareholders a positive earnings surprise during three out of the past four quarters. Most recently, the brokerage firm's fiscal third-quarter earnings were 12 cents above forecasts. Heading into AGE's fiscal fourth-quarter report, analysts are raising their projections. Over the past 30 days, the consensus estimate has been revised upwards by two cents to $1.04 per share. The Most Recent Consensus is more bullish at $1.06 per share. A.G. Edwards is scheduled to report on Thursday, Mar 29, before the start of trading.
"
3246,ARNC,"CarMax (KMX), which recently completed a 2-1 stock split, has topped analysts expectations by an average margin of 10 cents per share over the past four quarters. Ahead of the car dealer's fiscal fourth-quarter report, one analyst raised his forecast. The revision pushed the consensus estimate up by a penny to 41 cents per share. The Most Recent Consensus is more bullish at 42 cents per share. CarMax is scheduled to report on Thursday, Mar 29, before the start of trading.
"
3247,ARNC,"Three analysts have raised their fiscal fourth-quarter profit forecasts on Red Hat (RHT  -  Free Report) within the past 30 days, causing the consensus estimate to rise to eight cents per share (a one-cent increase). The open source software provider topped third-quarter expectations by a penny after matching estimates the past two quarters. The one caveat that investors should note, however, is that two analysts have lowered their forecasts within the past 30 days - so the signal for a positive surprise is not as strong as I prefer. Red Hat is scheduled to report on Thursday, Mar 29, after the close of trading.

"
3252,ARNC,"2Some of the companies listed in the earnings calendar may not be in the Zacks Rank universe. 
"
3253,ARNC,"With almost 97% of the S&P 500 reported, fourth-quarter earnings season is effectively complete.  Over the next several weeks many of the remaining companies should report, a portion of which have been held up due to options related restatements.  Going in this season, median fourth-quarter growth was expected at around 10%.  Companies, however, were able to post nearly 13% growth instead, compared to the same quarter a year ago.  Positive analyst surprises have outnumbered negatives by nearly 3:1 and six out of 10 sectors were able to post double-digit growth.  
"
3254,ARNC,"The Materials sector was the growth leader during the fourth quarter and remains head and shoulders above the Industrial sector, which posted the next highest year-over-year growth.  In Materials, as with many sectors, the current growth rate is expected to drop sharply in the first quarter.  For Materials, growth in the first quarter is expected to be less than half what it was in the fourth, but that is still higher than any other sector.  Large expected comparable decliners are Alcoa (AA), International Paper (IP  -  Free Report), and Phelps Dodge (PD).  Note that these companies all reported triple digit growth last quarter and only IP is expected to achieve that same feat in the first.
"
3255,ARNC,"Lagging firms during the fourth quarter were centered in the Utility and Telecom sectors.  The median utility has posted flat fourth-quarter comps and is expected to recover slightly in the first quarter, to a 5.5% growth rate.  Telecom is the only sector in the red this quarter, with negative comps of over 10%.  Energy, which was the leader in the first three quarters of 2006 is showing only slight year-over-year growth, but then again it has some very difficult post-hurricane comparables.   Looking forward to the first quarter, every sector is currently expected to post positive growth, but only three are expected to make it into the double-digits.  
"
3256,ARNC,"Looking ahead, the S&P 500 is expected to post first-quarter median growth of 8.3%.  With a similar surprise ratio to that of the last couple of quarters, the growth could again make it into double-digits.

"
3258,ARNC,"To help gauge the direction of the market, we take note of what analysts are thinking. By tallying their EPS changes, we can determine our revisions ratio. This ratio simply divides the total number of positive estimate revisions by the total number of estimate cuts. Thus, a high ratio is a bullish indicator and a low ratio is bearish.  For the S&P 500 as a whole, a number below 0.80 or above 1.25 is generally significant.  For individual sectors the distance from 1.0 should be greater for the numbers to be significant.
"
3259,ARNC,"For fiscal 2007, the ratio has dropped slightly below equality.  Over the last four weeks, there were 844 upward revisions and 881 downward, yielding a total revisions ratio of 0.96.  This is down from last weeks 1.10.  For comparison, the third-quarter ratio was much higher, at approximately 1.4 with a similar number of S&P 500 companies reported.  Comparisons with prior quarters are not as telling however, since the years have rolled over and our FY1 revisions are now for 2007.  In past quarters, a positive surprise translated directly into a current year (2006) upward revision.  Currently however, a fourth-quarter report only effects 2007 revisions through forward guidance or other forward looking indicatorsnot directly through higher reported EPS numbers.  Thus, the 2007 revisions we are seeing represent an analysts viewpoint on the true full-year estimates.     
"
3260,ARNC,"Given the collapse in oil prices earlier this year, it is not surprising that the Energy sector is leading the revisions decline, with nearly two cuts for every increase.  In fact, if the sector is stripped out, the overall ratio improves to 1.18.  The ratio of firms up to firms down stands at 1.13, but excluding Energy it is at 1.18.  Even in Energy, however, the revisions ratio has improved substantially over the last month, up from an abysmal 0.12.  With the recent rebound in Oil prices we would not be surprised to see the Energy sector improve in coming weeks.   With the current implosion in the sub-prime mortgage market, it is somewhat surprising that the Financial sector has the second highest revisions ratio.

3265,ARNC,"On a full-year basis, median earnings growth for the S&P 500 is expected to remain healthy. On a total basis however, growth is expected to slump into the high single-digits for 2007 and then rebound in 2008. Median growth for the current (2007) and next (2008) fiscal years is expected to be 11.3% and 12.3%, respectively. On a total earnings basis, the growth rates are expected to show a sharp deceleration from 14.8% in 2006 to 7.9% in 2007.  A rebound is then expected to 10.8% in 2008.  It is still very much in the early days with respect to 2008 expectations.  Those growth rates are interesting to look at, but dont rely on them too much at this point. 
"
3266,ARNC,"We would point to a couple of technical points which are affecting the expected growth rates. The rates are based on the forecasts of EPS and then multiplied by current shares outstanding to get total earnings. Recently firms have been pumping enormous, and unprecedented, sums into share repurchase. In the first half of 2006, over $216 billion was spent by S&P 500 firms to buy back their own stock. This shrinks the number of shares outstanding and boosts the EPS growth rate. Add in dividends paid out and over 80% of earnings were returned to shareholders rather than reinvested by the companies. In 2006, growth was restrained in many cases by companies starting to expense stock options. While expensing of options provides a level of earnings that is much closer to economic reality than not expensing them, doing so in the numerator (2006) and not in the denominator (2005) depresses the growth rate. For 2007, all firms should be on an apples-to-apples basis.

"
3268,ARNC,"When making investment decisions, growth should always be looked at in conjunction with how much you are paying for a stock. Thus, it makes sense to look at the total earnings expected for a sector, relative to that sectors total market capitalization. This is basically a variation on looking at the P/E.
"
3269,ARNC,"The chart below shows the share of total earnings for 2006, 2007 and 2008, as well as the share of total market capitalization for each sector (the final bar shown). Since the S&P 500 is a market cap weighted index, this is the same as its index weight. On the chart below, the difference between the sizes of the first three bars shows if a sector is gaining or losing earnings share. The difference between the final bar and the first three bars shows if the sector is selling for an above or below market P/E. If the final bar is smaller than the other bars, the sector is selling for a below market P/E. However, as opposed to just showing the sector P/Es, it also shows the relative importance of the sectors to the overall index. 
"
3270,ARNC,"Clearly the Financials are the biggest influence on the market, with a weight of 21.4%. However, that sector is also relatively cheap on an earnings basis, and thus serves to hold the overall P/E of the index down. In other words, Financials deserve to be the biggest influence on the market, since they contribute 26.9% of the total expected earnings for 2007.
"
3271,ARNC,"Energy looks to be under represented in its influence on the market since it is expected to provide 13.5% of the total earnings for 2007, but represents only 9.5% of the total market capitalization of the index. While its earnings share is currently expected to decline to 12.5% in 2008, even on this basis it is still much cheaper than the overall market.  If Energy and Financials are excluded, the S&P 500 is trading for 17.6x 2007 expected earnings.
"
3272,ARNC,"In more conventional terms, the Energy sector is trading for 10.7x 2007 and 10.4x 2008 earnings. The S&P is trading for 15.2x and 13.7x, respectively. The second chart below shows the sector P/Es ranked from lowest to highest based on estimated 2007 P/E ratios.
"
3273,ARNC,"Matt Thurmond contributed significantly to this report.1 We follow the convention of referring to the most recently completed full fiscal year as 2006, and the next full fiscal year to be reported as 2007.
"
3274,ARNC,"With over 95% of the S&P 500 reported, fourth-quarter earnings season is effectively complete.  Over the next several weeks many of the remaining companies should report, a portion of which have been held up due to options related restatements.  Going in this season, median fourth-quarter growth was expected at around 10%.  Companies, however, were able to post nearly 13% instead, compared to the same quarter a year ago.  Positive analyst surprises have outnumbered negatives by nearly 3:1 and six out of 10 sectors were able to post double digit growth.  
"
3275,ARNC,"The Materials sector was the growth leader during the fourth quarter and remains head and shoulders above the Industrial sector, which posted the next highest year over year growth.  In Materials, as with many sectors, the current growth rate is expected to drop sharply in the first-quarter.  For Materials, growth in the first-quarter is expected to be less than half what it was in the fourth, but that is still higher than any other sector.  Large expected comparable decliners are Alcoa (AA), International Paper (IP  -  Free Report), and Phelps Dodge (PD).  Note that these companies all reported triple-digit growth last quarter and only IP is expected to achieve that same feat in the first.
"
3276,ARNC,"Lagging firms during the fourth quarter were centered in the Utility and Telecom sectors.  The median utility has posted flat fourth-quarter comps and is expected to recover slightly in the first-quarter, to a 5.5% growth rate.  Telecom is the only sector in the red this quarter, with negative comps of over 10%.  Energy, which was the leader in the first three quarters of 2006 is showing only slight year-over-year growth, but then again it has some very difficult post-hurricane comparables.   
"
3277,ARNC,"Looking ahead, the S&P 500 is expected to post first-quarter median growth of 8.3%.  With a similar surprise ratio to that of the last couple of quarters, the growth could again make it into double digits.

"
3279,ARNC,"To help gauge the direction of the market, we take note of what analysts are thinking. By tallying their EPS changes, we can determine our revisions ratio. This ratio simply divides the total number of positive estimate revisions by the total number of estimate cuts. Thus, a high ratio is a bullish indicator and a low ratio is bearish.  For the S&P 500 as a whole, a number below 0.80 or above 1.25 is generally significant.  For individual sectors the distance from 1.0 should be greater for the numbers to be significant.
"
3280,ARNC,"For fiscal 2007, the ratio has recently broken above equality, 1.0, and has stayed above this level for a third week now.  Over the last four weeks, there were 1,244 upward revisions and 1,135 downward, yielding a total revisions ratio of 1.10.  This is down slightly from last weeks 1.16.  For comparison, the third-quarter ratio was much higher, at approximately 1.4 with a similar number of S&P 500 companies reported.
"
3281,ARNC,"Comparisons with prior quarters are not as telling however, since the years have rolled over and our FY1 revisions are now for 2007.  In past quarters, a positive surprise translated directly into a current year (2006) upward revision.  Currently however, a fourth-quarter report only effects 2007 revisions through forward guidance or other forward looking indicatorsnot directly through higher reported EPS numbers.  Thus, the 2007 revisions we are seeing represent an analysts viewpoint on the true full-year estimates.     
"
3282,ARNC,"Given the collapse in oil prices earlier this year, it is not surprising that the Energy sector is leading the revisions decline, with over two cuts for every increase.  In fact, if the sector is stripped out, the overall ratio improves to 1.25.  The ratio of firms up to firms down stands at 1.1, but excluding Energy it is at 1.19.  Even in Energy, however, the revisions ratio has improved substantially over the last month, up from an abysmal 0.12.  With the recent rebound in Oil prices we would not be surprised to see the Energy sector improve in coming weeks.  Three sectors currently enjoy more than twice as many upward revisions as estimate cuts: Industrials, Health Care and Consumer Staples.

For comparison however, the third quarter ratio was much higher, at approximately 1.5 with a similar number of S&P 500 companies reported.
"
3304,ARNC,"Comparisons with prior quarters are not as telling however, since the years have rolled over and our FY1 revisions are now for 2007.  In past quarters, a positive surprise translated directly into a current year (2006) upward revision.  Currently however, a fourth-quarter report only effects 2007 revisions through forward guidance or other forward looking indicatorsnot directly through higher reported EPS numbers.  Thus, the 2007 revisions we are seeing represent an analysts viewpoint on the true full-year estimates.     
"
3305,ARNC,"Given the collapse in oil prices so far this year, it is not surprising that the Energy sector is leading the revisions decline, with over three cuts for every increase.  In fact, if the sector is stripped out, the overall ratio improves to 1.35.  The ratio of firms up to firms down stands at 1.04, but excluding Energy it is at 1.16.  Even in Energy, however, the revisions ratio has improved substantially over the last three weeks, up from an abysmal 0.12.  With the recent rebound in Oil prices we would not be surprised to see the Energy sector improve in coming weeks.  Four sectors currently enjoying more than twice as many upward revisions as estimate cuts.  Interestingly they include both Cyclical sectors (Materials and Industrials) and defensive sectors (Health Care and Staples).

"
3308,ARNC,"The pattern of sectors with positive (above 1.0) and negative (below 1.0) revisions ratios is quite similar for both 2007 and 2008.  Health Care and Materials are near the top while Energy and Utilities lag behind.

"
3310,ARNC,"On a full-year1 basis, median earnings growth for the S&P 500 is expected to remain healthy. On a total basis however, growth is expected to slump into the high single digits for 2007 and then rebound in 2008. Median growth for the current (2007) and next (2008) fiscal years is expected to be 11.8% and 12.3%, respectively, actually a slight acceleration from the 11.7% expected/posted for 2006. On a total earnings basis, the growth rates are expected to show a sharp deceleration from 15.0% in 2006 to 7.9% in 2007.  A rebound is then expected to 10.6% in 2008.  It is still very much in the early days with respect to 2008 expectations.  Those growth rates are interesting to look at, but dont rely on them too much at this point. 
"
3311,ARNC,"We would point to a couple of technical points which are affecting the expected growth rates. The rates are based on the forecasts of EPS and then multiplied by current shares outstanding to get total earnings. Recently firms have been pumping enormous, and unprecedented, sums into share repurchase. In the first half of 2006, over $216 billion was spent by S&P 500 firms to buy back their own stock. This shrinks the number of shares outstanding and boosts the EPS growth rate. Add in dividends paid out and over 80% of earnings were returned to shareholders rather than reinvested by the companies. In 2006, growth was restrained in many cases by companies starting to expense stock options. While expensing of options provides a level of earnings that is much closer to economic reality than not expensing them, doing so in the numerator (2006) and not in the denominator (2005) depresses the growth rate. For 2007, all firms should be on an apples-to-apples basis.
"
3312,ARNC,"Unlike the growth rates in our Earnings Scorecard, the numbers in the table below represent the expected growth for all of a sectors firms. Below, we now give a glimpse of 2008 expectations. On a median basis, earnings growth is expected to slow for Materials and improve slightly for Energy as both sectors enter 2008. On a total earnings basis, 2008 growth for these commodity based sectors is expected to be in the low single digits. On a median basis, Telecom is expected to have a slight acceleration in earnings growth for 2007, but a significant deceleration on a total earnings basis.  Mergers played a very significant role in the high total earnings growth for the sector in 2006.  Consumer Discretionary is expected to have the highest acceleration in 2008 on a total earnings basis.  Tech is expected to be the fastest grower in 2008 on both a median and total earnings basis.

"
3314,ARNC,"When making investment decisions, growth should always be looked at in conjunction with how much you are paying for a stock. Thus, it makes sense to look at the total earnings expected for a sector, relative to that sectors total market capitalization. This is basically a variation on looking at the P/E.
"
3315,ARNC,"The chart below shows the share of total earnings for 2006, 2007 and 2008, as well as the share of total market capitalization for each sector (the final bar shown). Since the S&P 500 is a market cap weighted index, this is the same as its index weight. On the chart below, the difference between the sizes of the first three bars shows if a sector is gaining or losing earnings share. The difference between the final bar and the first three bars shows if the sector is selling for an above or below market P/E. If the final bar is smaller than the other bars, the sector is selling for a below market P/E. However, as opposed to just showing the sector P/Es, it also shows the relative importance of the sectors to the overall index. 
"
3316,ARNC,"Clearly the Financials are the biggest influence on the market, with a weight of 21.7%. However, that sector is also relatively cheap on an earnings basis, and thus serves to hold the overall P/E of the index down. In other words, Financials deserve to be the biggest influence on the market, since they contribute 26.5% of the total expected earnings for 2007.
"
3317,ARNC,"Energy looks to be under represented in its influence on the market since it is expected to provide 13.5% of the total earnings for 2007, but represents only 9.4% of the total market capitalization of the index. While its earnings share is currently expected to decline to 12.5% in 2008, even on this basis it is still much cheaper than the overall market.
"
3318,ARNC,"In more conventional terms, the Energy sector is trading for 11.0x 2007 and 10.7x 2008 earnings. The S&P is trading for 15.8x and 14.2x, respectively. The second chart below shows the sector P/Es ranked from lowest to highest based on estimated 2007 P/E ratios.

3320,ARNC,"Fourth-quarter earnings season officially kicks off on Tuesday with Alcoas (AA) results. The aluminum company is projected to report profits of 69 cents per share, though, as I state below, the Most Recent Consensus is more bearish at 67 cents per share.
"
3321,ARNC,"The bulk of earnings reports will not start being released for another 10 days. For companies within the S&P 500, profit growth in the low double-digit range seems possible given current estimates and the prospensity of companies to exceed expectations. 
"
3322,ARNC,"Within the broader Zacks Rank universe1, there have been fourth-quarter numbers from 88 companies so far. Positive surprises are outnumbering negative surprises by an approximate 2:1 margin (51 versus 24). This is a good start, but given the size of the group, I would suggest refraining from reading too much into the numbers. 
"
3323,ARNC,"The economic calendar is pretty light next week and should not materially influence market direction. November consumer credit will be released on Monday afternoon. November trade deficit and wholesale inventory numbers are scheduled for Wednesday morning. As always, initial jobless claims will be released on Thursday. Friday brings December retail sales data and December import price information.
"
3324,ARNC,"Companies That Could Surprise During the Week of Jan 8-12
"
3325,ARNC,"Genentech (DNA) has delivered two large quarterly surprises in row, topping expectations by nine and 10 cents, respectively. This is a tough act to repeat, but the current trend in estimate revisions is bullish. The consensus estimate for the fourth quarter has been revised upwards by a penny over the past 30 days to 52 cents per share. The Most Recent Consensus is more optimistic at 56 cents per share. Investors may also want to note that DNA announced, yesterday, positive results from a Phase II study combining petruzumab with gemcitabine to treat women with fallopian tube cancer. Genentech will report on Wednesday, Jan 10, after the close of trading.
"
3326,ARNC,"Alcoas (AA) third-quarter earnings were less than desirable at 62 cents per share; analysts had projected profits to total 80 cents per share. Estimates for the fourth-quarter are basically unchanged, though the Most Recent Consensus is two cents below the current consensus estimate of 69 cents per share. Aluminum prices have fallen recently, pulling back from a double-top formation  a bearish pattern. To be fair, earlier this week, AA announced what it described as major contract wins in Japan. Alcoa will report on Tuesday, Jan 9, probably after the close of trading.
"
3327,ARNC,"The Greenbrier Companies (GBX  -  Free Report) cut its fiscal first-quarter guidance in late December. Citing production difficulties with the introduction of railcars, lower gains on equipment sales and other factors, the company cut its guidance for operating earnings to 10 to 13 cents per share. Three of the four covering analysts responded by slashing their estimates, resulting in a 41-cent drop in the consensus estimate to 13 cents per share. GBX missed fiscal fourth-quarter estimates by nine cents with profits of 53 cents per share. The Greenbrier Companies will report on Tuesday, Jan 9, before the start of trading.

3336,ARNC,"Out of the 20 companies on deck, the only one that appears likely to surprise is Monsanto (MON). The consensus earnings estimate for the companys fiscal first-quarter has been increased by a penny over the past 30 days to 10 cents per share. The most recent consensus is more bullish at 12 cents per share. There has not been any guidance from the company as of late, though Monsanto did say at the end of November that it is seeing unprecedented early order activity for triple-stack corn seed. In addition, about two weeks later, the company raised its quarterly dividend to 12.5 cents per share from 10 cents per share  a sign of fiscal strength and optimism about the future. MON missed earnings expectations last quarter, but had a history of positive surprises previously. Monsanto should report on Thursday, Jan 4, before the start of trading.

"
3343,ARNC,"While Alcoas (AA) negative surprise last Tuesday got the official beginning of the third-quarter earnings season on a sour note, most of the news has been positive. To date, 42 companies out of the S&P 500 have reported and the results have been overwhelmingly positive. Positive EPS surprises have outnumbered negatives by 6:1 and the median surprise is an impressive 3.7%. With the Dow hitting new highs and energy prices continuing to trend downward, the market seems to be shrugging off fears of a near-term recession. As reports ramp up however, it will be much easier to see how corporate earnings performance matches up with the markets renewed bullishness. 
"
3344,ARNC,"So far, the sectors seeing the largest number of companies reporting have been Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary. Firms with double digit upside surprises include Circuit City (CC), Mccormick (MKC  -  Free Report), and Supervalu (SVU  -  Free Report). No firms in either sector reported a negative surprise. The Tech sector has also seen excellent EPS performance thus far with a median surprise of nearly 9.4%. The surprise ratio stands at 5:1. Adobe and Tektronix lead the charge, with 13.6% and 14.3% respective EPS surprises. 
"
3345,ARNC,"For the full S&P 500, analysts are expecting 8.6% median third-quarter growth. If this growth rate proves accurate, it will be much lower than the 12.9% growth seen last quarter. However, going into each of the last two quarters, growth was expected to be much lower than it later proved to be. Much of the shortfall is due to Energy. This cooling sector was able to post 65.6% growth last quarter but is only expected to deliver 21.2% growth in the third quarter. Much of the shortfall is obviously due to the difference in comparable energy prices caused by last years hurricane season. Fourth-quarter growth estimates for the sector are expected to be even lower, at 8.3%. For the full S&P 500 however, fourth-quarter comparable growth rates are expected to tick slightly upward, to 11.1% for the median firm.

"
3347,ARNC," The total number of 2006 earnings revisions over the past month was 1,379. This is down from the 3,243 at the peak of the second-quarter reporting season, a level we will most likely ramp up to over the next month. At the current time, it is clear that there is less new data for analyst to work with and thus, fewer EPS revisions. 
"
3348,ARNC,"Over the last four weeks, there were 704 upward revisions and 675 downward. This makes for a total revisions ratio of 1.04, up from last weeks 0.90. The uptrend has continued now for several weeks and the 2006 revisions ratio is once again above 1. Continued positive EPS surprises could boost the ratio back to levels we saw during the peak of Q2 earnings reports. Six weeks ago, for example, the ratio was 1.35. 
"
3349,ARNC,"Looking more closely at individual revisions ratios, Energys ratio is at the bottom of the barrel, at 0.33. Two weeks ago, energys ratio was 1.15. Negative revisions were across the board here, from the super majors  Exxon Mobil (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhilips (COP  -  Free Report)  to the independents (Devon Energy (DVN  -  Free Report) to the drillers and refiners (Rowan (RDC  -  Free Report) and Valero (VLO  -  Free Report)).
"
3350,ARNC,"The weakness in oil and gas prices is clearly to blame for the sharp slide in the sector. On the upside of the revisions story, the Financials sector once again saw a sharp week-to-week ratio increase, from 1.60 to 1.91. Behemoth investment banks like Lehman (LEH), Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), and Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report)each had double-digit positive revisions following strong third-quarter reports. Other financials, such as Allstate (ALL) and XL Capital ((XL  -  Free Report)) also boasted strong double digit analyst revisions.

"
3352,ARNC,"Looking ahead to next year, the revisions ratio is notably lower, at 0.89. This is slightly higher than the 0.80 reported last week. Less than two months ago however, the ratio was 1.26. If the ratio stays at its current level as the total number of revisions picks up in the Q3 earnings season, I would start to get very concerned. Conversely, if the ratio rises back above one in the heart of the reporting season, I will become much more positive about the outlook for both the economy and the market. However, slightly more firms enjoyed upward revisions than suffered a decline over the last month. 
"
3353,ARNC,"The bright point this week regarding 2007 revisions is clearly Utilities. The sectors ratio is a sky-high 3.0. Though this ratio is based on a paltry 22 revisions, the positive numbers are spread evenly across the sectors firms. Revisions across the board from companies like KeySpan (KSE) and TXU (TXU) have helped loft the sector forward. The longer fossil fuel prices stay low, the more likely utilities are to negotiate favorable supply contracts and secure higher forward margins.

3355,ARNC,"On a full-year  basis, earnings growth for the S&P 500 is expected to remain solid. Double-digit gains are expected on both a median firm and total net income basis. On a median basis, growth for the current and next fiscal year is expected to be 13.1% and 12.9%, respectively. This growth rate has stayed relatively stable over the last several weeks. On a total earnings basis, the growth rates are more skewed towards this year, at 15.1% versus 10.4% next year. While the total growth rate is certainly predicted to slow, by no means is a 10.4% year-over-year growth rate tantamount to predicting a near-term recession. On the other hand, if the recent trend toward more downward revisions than upward revisions continues, those expected growth rates will deteriorate.
"
3356,ARNC,"We would point to a couple of technical points which are affecting the expected growth rates. The rates are based on the forecasts of EPS, and then multiplied by current shares outstanding to get total earnings. Recently firms have been pumping enormous, and unprecedented, sums into share repurchase. In the first half, over $216 billion was spent by S&P 500 firms to buy back their own stock. The shrinks the number of shares outstanding and boosts the EPS growth rate. Add in dividends paid out and over 80% of earnings were returned to shareholders rather than reinvested by the companies. As mentioned above, stock options expensing counteracts this effect, and depresses the 2005 versus 2006 EPS comparisons. 
"
3357,ARNC,"Unlike the growth rates in our Earnings Scorecard, the numbers in the table below represent the expected growth for all of a sectors firms. Energy is expected to post rock-solid growth for both years on a median basis, with earnings climbing over 34% this year and over 20% next year. However, there is a real disparity for 2007 in the Energy sector, where it is at the front of the pack on a median firm basis but near the back on a total earnings basis. The key to that difference is that a handful of giant super majors (XOM, CVX, COP) account for over half of the sectors total expected earnings. Their earnings are currently expected to be flat to slightly down in 2007 relative to 2006, while the oil service and many of the E&P firms are expected to continue growing at a rapid clip. The Materials sector shows a similar disparity for 2007. Going the other way, total earnings growth in 2006 is much higher than median growth from the Financial Services sector. This is largely due to the very large insurance losses in 2005 due to the storms. The Financial Services sector has more firms in it, and accounts for more of the S&Ps total earnings than the Energy and Health Care sectors combined.

"
3359,ARNC,"When making investment decisions, growth should always be looked at in conjunction with how much you are paying for a stock. Thus, it makes sense to look at the total earnings expected for a sector, relative to that sectors total market capitalization. This is basically a variation on looking at the P/E.
"
3360,ARNC,"The chart below shows the share of total earnings for 2005, 2006 and 2007, as well as the share of total market capitalization for each sector (the final bar shown). Since the S&P 500 is a market cap weighted index, this is the same as its index weight. On the chart below, the difference between the sizes of the first three bars shows if a sector is gaining or losing earnings share. The difference between the final bar and the first three bars shows if the sector is selling for an above or below market P/E. If the final bar is smaller than the other bars, the sector is selling for a below market P/E. However, as opposed to just showing the sector P/Es, it also shows the relative importance of the sectors to the overall index. 
"
3361,ARNC,"Clearly the Financials are the biggest influence on the market, with a weight of 21.7%, it has more influence than the Consumer Staples, Utilities, Materials and Telecom sectors combined. However, that sector is also relatively cheap on an earnings basis, and thus serves to hold the overall P/E of the index down. In other words, Financials deserve to be the biggest influence on the market, since they contribute 26.3% of the total expected earnings for 2006, or more than the total earnings of the Tech, Industrial and Utility sectors combined.
"
3362,ARNC,"Energy looks to be under represented in its influence on the market since it is expected to provide 14.5% of total earnings for 2006, but represents only 8.9% of the total market capitalization of the index. While its earnings share is currently expected to decline to 14.0% in 2007, even on this basis it is still much cheaper than the overall market. Clearly at 8.9%, Energy is far from being in a bubble phase. Frankly, I find the notion of an Energy stock bubble to be absurd. Even though the NASDAQ is at only 40% of its early 2000 peak, a much stronger case could be made for Tech being bubbly than for Energy.
"
3363,ARNC,"Looked at another way, Energy will provide 20.5% of the total incremental earnings in the S&P 500 this year, while that is down from the 43.8% of the total it provided last year, it is still far above its weight in the index. In more conventional terms, the Energy sector is trading for 9.7x 2006, and 9.0x 2007 earnings. Tech on the other hand is trading for 22.4x 2006 and 19.1x 2007 earnings. The S&P is trading for 15.7x and 14.2x, respectively. The P/E for 2007 equates to an earnings yield of 7.0% which is very attractive relative to a 10 year t-note yield of 4.8%. The second chart below shows the sector P/Es ranked from lowest to highest based on estimated 2007 P/E ratios.

3366,ARNC,"Earnings season is off to a positive start with 90 companies issuing positive surprises and only 30 companies issuing negative surprises, a 3:1 ratio1. Estimate revisions in response to earnings reports have been flat, on average, for both 2006 and 2007 full-year profits2.
"
3367,ARNC,"These numbers show why Alcoa (AA) is not a good proxy for earnings season, despite being tapped as the company that officially starts earnings season. As I stated last week, third-quarter estimates were falling ahead of the report and AA has a history of issuing as many negative surprises as positive surprises. On Tuesday, AA missed third-quarter expectations, resulting in a drop in the stocks price. Alcoa is the second-worst performer in the Dow this year. (Intel (INTC) is the worst performing Dow component, year-to-date.)

3369,ARNC,"Companies That Could Surprise During the Week of Oct 16-20
"
3370,ARNC,"The Allstate Corporation (ALL) could be one of many property and casualty companies to provide bullish third quarter reports. The comparably calm hurricane season, favorable premium environment and bullish financial markets are providing positive business conditions for these companies. In the specific case of Allstate, nine analysts have raised their third-quarter estimates within the past 30 days, with two revisions occurring this week. Cumulatively, these revisions have resulted in a 32-cent increase in estimates to $1.70 per share. The most recent consensus estimate is even more bullish at $1.82 per share. During the past two quarters, ALL has surprised to the upside by an average margin of 25.7%. Allstate will report on Thursday, Oct 19, before the bell.
"
3371,ARNC,"Truckload carrier Celadon Group (CLDN) preannounced fiscal first-quarter earnings earlier this week. The company anticipates profits to total between 28 and 30 cents per share versus the previous consensus estimate of 27 cents per share. Two analysts raised their forecasts in response, with the higher revision calling for profits of 29 cents per share. (The current consensus estimate calls for fiscal first-quarter profits of 28 cents per share.) CLDN has topped expectations for three consecutive quarters. Celadon Group will report on Friday, Oct 20, before the bell.
"
3372,ARNC,"A few weeks ago, Reliant Steel & Aluminum (RS  -  Free Report) upped its third-quarter earnings guidance to between $1.35 and $1.40 per share, from between $1.15 and $1.20 per share. CEO David Hannah said the reasons for the increase were the impact of a recent acquisition and stronger than expected business conditions. Four of the five covering analysts adjusted their forecasts, as a result, causing the consensus estimate to reach $1.39 per share. Notably, analysts have also upwardly revised their projections for both 2006 and 2007 full-year earnings. RS has easily surpassed expectations during each of the four previous quarters. Reliant Steel will report on Thursday, Oct 19, before the bell.
"
3373,ARNC,"Sandisk (SNDK) has topped expectations three times during the past four quarters. One of the covering analysts believes another positive surprise could be forthcoming. Earlier this week, the analyst raised his forecast from 43 cents per share to 54 cents per share. By means of comparison, the consensus estimate had been at 45 cents per share; it is now at 48 cents per share. Sandisk will report on Thursday, Oct 19, after market close. 
"
3374,ARNC,"AMR (AMR) makes this weeks report as a company that could miss expectations. American Airlines load factor, a key indicator for the airline industry, decreased by 0.7 basis points to 75.5% in September from the same period a year ago. Analysts had been lowering their expectations for third-quarter results prior to the release of the September numbers, but cut their projections even more this week. The current consensus estimate of 52 cents per share is 12 cents below the forecast of a week ago and 27 cents below the forecast of a month ago. AMR last missed expectations during the third quarter of 2005. AMR will report on Wednesday, Oct 18, with a conference call scheduled for 2pm ET.

"
3380,ARNC,"Third-quarter earnings season officially kicks off next week with Alcoas (AA) report on Tuesday. Unfortunately, current trends are negative for the aluminum company. The third-quarter consensus estimate has been eroding over the past 60 days. Earlier this week, two analysts lowered their forecasts, resulting in the consensus estimate falling to 80 cents. Two months ago, analysts were forecasting profits of 83 cents per share. Notably, projections for 2006 and 2007 earnings have also been on the decline.
"
3381,ARNC,"Alcoa is not a reliable proxy for determining how good, or bad, overall corporate profits are going to be. Although AA has topped expectations for two consecutive quarters, it missed fourth quarter expectations by three cents. Over the past eight quarters, Alcoa has topped estimates four times and missed four times.
"
3382,ARNC,"Alcoas report may be regarded as the official start to earnings season, but AA is not the first company to report. Through Thursday evening, there have been 86 third-quarter reports from companies within the Zacks Rank universe1. These are companies who operate on fiscal years that end in a month other than December.
"
3383,ARNC,"The early results are encouraging. Positive surprises have outnumbered negative surprises by a margin of 4.6:1. Adjustments to full-year earnings estimates are slightly negative for 2006 (average revision of -0.6%), but positive for 2007 (average revision of 2.1%)2.
"
3384,ARNC,"Companies That Could Surprise
"
3385,ARNC,"Recent changes to analyst forecasts suggest that these companies could surprise when they report next week.
"
3386,ARNC,"Host Hotels & Resorts (HST  -  Free Report) has been the recipient of some recent analyst optimism. The current third-quarter forecast of 28 cents per share is a penny higher than the month-old forecast. Projections for 2006 earnings are unchanged, but projections for 2007 have slowly been rising. HST matched expectations in the second quarter and topped expectations in the first quarter. Host Hotels & Resorts will report on Wednesday, before the open.
"
3387,ARNC,"First Niagara Financial Group (FNFG) has missed expectations twice during the past three quarters. Ahead of the companys third-quarter report, the consensus estimate has been lowered by a penny to 22 cents per share. First Niagara Financial Group will report on Friday, before the open.
"
3388,ARNC,"Gannett (GCI) has missed once during the past four quarters. Over the past 30 days, nine of the 14 covering analysts have revised their forecasts for third-quarter earnings. These cuts have caused the consensus estimate to fall by two cents to $1.11 per share. Forecasts for 2006 earnings are down by five cents over the same period to $4.91 per share. Gannett will report on Wednesday, before the open.
"
3389,ARNC,"Genentech (DNA) has met expectations twice and beat expectations twice over the past four quarters. The current consensus estimate for third-quarter earnings of 46 cents is unchanged from 30 days ago, but one thing that caught my eye was the most recent consensus. The most recent consensus, which reflects the average of recently issued revisions, is 43 cents  three cents below the overall consensus estimate. Genentech will report on Tuesday, after the close.

"
3395,ARNC,"With almost 94% of S&P 500 companies reported, the summer earnings season is all but complete and the results have been surprisingly positive.  The median second quarter reported growth rate is an impressive 13.2% and positive surprises have outnumbered disappointments by almost 4:1.  
"
3396,ARNC,"The top-performing sector for the second quarter was Energy, with a median year-over-year EPS gain of over 65%.  From here however, growth in the sector is expected to slow, with analysts expecting median earnings growth for all of 2006 to be just over 30%.  Much tougher comparisons due to the anniversary of last years storms are the cause of the growth slowdown.  Looking into 2007, analysts are expecting median growth for the sectors companies of 16.2%.  No tree grows to the sky, but this is still very impressive given the gains of the last few years in the sector.  This would push Energy just under the Tech sector, where analysts are expecting an ambitious 18% median growth rate for 2007. 
"
3397,ARNC,"The Industrials, Telecom and Materials sectors also performed well in the quarter, with 19%, 17%, and 15% median earnings growth, respectively.  For the Material, metals producers like Alcoa (AA) and Nucor (NUE  -  Free Report) lead the charge, with EPS growth rates of 87% and 43% respectively.  Growth in this sector, unlike in Energy, is expected to hold strong for the remainder of the year.  For 2007 however, analysts are expecting a slight cool down, with median EPS growth for the sectors companies expected to be just under 13%.
"
3398,ARNC,"In terms of the positive-to-negative surprise ratio, Telecom was the sector that fared best.  Out of the nine companies that report in this tiny sector, only one company, Sprint, disappointed.  The Consumer Discretionary and Industrials sectors also impressed, both with ratios of over 5:1.  Companies in the Consumer Staples sector also had favorable earnings surprise results, though median Q-over-Q growth was a paltry 5%.  As we move into the second half of the year, continued upside surprises by the likes of Conagra (CAG  -  Free Report), McCormick (MKC  -  Free Report), and Coors (SYY  -  Free Report) could spark higher comps to boost this sectors lagging growth outlook. 
"
3399,ARNC,"Overall, third-quarter comparable growth rates are expected to be less than those posted in the second quarter.  Median earnings growth is expected to come in at 9.28%, which would be a drop-off of over 390 basis points sequentially.  In eight of the 10 S&P sectors, growth is expected to slow.  However, we have seen this before, in both of the first two quarters, growth was origionally expected to slow to single digits, only to see the combination of estimate increases and positive surprises push the actual growth well into the teens.  With a year-to-date gain of only 2.1%, and a 2006 P/E of less than 15, the S&P 500 isnt exactly priced for perfection.  The earnings yield on the S&P 500 of 6.67% looks very favorable relative to the 10-year T-note yield of 4.78%.  The underlying companies need only report modest results going forward for the index to continue building up fundamental investment value.

"
3401,ARNC,"The total number of 2006 earnings revisions over the past month stands at 2,702, which is markedly down from the 3,721 reported at this time last week. This is a normal seasonal slowdown as earnings season winds down.  For 2006, positive estimate revisions have outnumbered negatives, with 1550 up and 1152 down, a ratio of 1.35:1, or about four estimates raised for every three cut.  This is a significant slowdown from last weeks 1.57, but is still a very healthy number. The upward movement of estimates was widespread, with all but two sectors having more upward than downward revisions.  Three sectors however, Consumer Staples, Tech and Utilities, had more firms with estimate downgrades than upgrades.  At press time last week, only the Utilities sector was listed in this unfavorable category.  Regarding the total upward to downward revisions ratio, Telecom lead the pack with a healthy 2.36:1, while the Tech and Utilities sectors were at the opposite end of the spectrum, with ratios of 0.85 and 0.63 respectively. 
"
3402,ARNC,"Energy, began showing more negative revisions as earnings season unfolded, but its ratio remains healthy at 1.35:1, inline with the rest of the index.  The Consumer Staples sector, despite showing previous signs of upward-revision strength, now shows a revisions ratio of just 1.05:1.
"
3403,ARNC,"Note below that the outlier for the Average 4wk. 2006 estimate change was Tech.  The 9.73% estimate boost posted was due completely to upward revisions related to Electronic Arts (ERTS).  Four revisions for the company averaged 738% higher than they were previously.  Remove this company and the four-week revision change for Tech drops to a minuscule 0.15%.  This illustrates the danger of placing too much emphasis on the change in the average estimate and why we tend to focus on the revisions index and the ratio of firms with rising to falling estimates.

"
3405,ARNC,"Looking ahead to next year the story is much the same, although the ratio is 1.26, which while comfortably above one, is moderately below the ratio for the current year.  As well, the ratio of firms with rising mean estimates to falling mean estimates is lower for 2007 than it is for 2006.   Technology and Utilities are the revision ratio laggards regarding next years estimates, despite the fact that Tech is expected to be the overall growth leader in 2007.  Of course if these revisions trends persist, Techs standing as the expected growth leader is unlikely to be maintained.  At the end of 2005, Tech was expected to trail only Consumer Discretionary in total net income growth for 2006, it now languishes in 7th place among the 10 sectors (Consumer Discretionary has fallen to sixth place by the way).

"
3407,ARNC,"Earnings growth for the S&P 500 is expected to remain solid for both this year and next, on both a median firm basis and on a total net income basis.  On a median basis, growth for both the current year and for 2007 is expected at 12.80%.  On a total earnings basis, the growth rates are more skewed towards this year, at 15.2% versus 10.5% next year.  While the total growth rate is certainly predicted to slow, by no means is declaring a 10.5% year-over-year growth rate tantamount to predicting a near-term recession.  
"
3408,ARNC,"Note that unlike the growth rates in the Earnings Scorecard above, the numbers below represent the expected growth for all of a sectors firms, not just those which have already reported.   Energy is expected to post rock-solid growth for both years on a median basis, with earnings climbing almost 34% this year and over 16% next year.  However, there is a real disparity for 2007 in the Energy sector, where it is near the front of the pack on a median firm basis but near the back on a total earnings basis.  The key to that difference is that a handful of giant super majors  Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX) and ConocoPhilips (COP)  account for over half of the sectors total expected earnings.  Their earnings are currently expected to be flat to slightly down in 2007 relative to 2006, while the oil service and many of the E&P firms are expected to continue growing at a rapid clip.    However, its a bit of a moving target for the super majors, as estimates for both years are being revised upward.  The Materials sector shows a similar disparity for 2007.

"
3410,ARNC,"When making investment decisions, growth should always be looked at in conjunction with how much you are paying for a stock. Thus, it makes sense to look at the total earnings expected for a sector, relative to that sectors total market capitalization.  This is basically a variation on looking at the P/E.
"
3411,ARNC,"The chart below shows the share of total earnings for 2005, 2006 and 2007, as well as the share of total market capitalization for each sector (the final bar shown). Since the S&P 500 is a market cap weighted index, this is the same as its index weight. On the chart below, the difference between the sizes of the first three bars shows if a sector is gaining or losing earnings share. The difference between the final bar and the first three bars shows if the sector is selling for an above or below market P/E. If the final bar is smaller than the other bars, the sector is selling for a below market P/E. However, as opposed to just showing the sector P/Es, it also shows the relative importance of the sectors to the overall index. 
"
3412,ARNC,"Clearly the Financials are the biggest influence on the market, with a weight of 21.6%, it has more influence than the Consumer Staples, Utilities, Materials and Telecom sectors combined. However, that sector is also relatively cheap on an earnings basis, and thus serves to hold the overall P/E of the index down. In other words, Financials deserve to be the biggest influence on the market, since they contribute 26.3% of the total expected earnings for 2006, or more than the total earnings of the Tech, Industrial and Utility sectors combined.
"
3413,ARNC,"Energy looks to be under represented in its influence on the market since it is expected to provide 14.7% of total earnings for 2006, but represents only 10% of the total market capitalization of the index. While its earnings share is currently expected to decline to 14.1% in 2007, even on this basis it is still much cheaper than the overall market. Clearly at 10%, Energy is far from being in a bubble phase.  Frankly, I find the notion of an Energy stock bubble to be absurd.  Even though the NASDAQ is at only 40% of its early 2000 peak, a much stronger case could be made for Tech being bubbly than for Energy.
"
3414,ARNC,"Looked at another way, Energy will provide 21.9% of the total incremental earnings in the S&P 500 this year, while that is down from the 43.3% of the total it provided last year, it is still far above its weight in the index.  In more conventional terms, the Energy sector is trading for 10.2x 2006, and 9.7x 2007 earnings.  Tech on the other hand is trading for 20.7x 2006 and 17.6x 2007 earnings.  The S&P is trading for 15.0x and 13.6x, respectively.

3418,ARNC,"Last week, three of the largest investment banking firms reported fiscal second-quarter results: Lehman Brothers (LEH), Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and Bear Stearns (BSC). The results topped expectations, but the prices of the three stocks ended the week slightly down after some modest volatility. 
"
3419,ARNC,"There was not a single explanation as to why. LEH topped estimates by nine cents with profits of $1.69 per share. The results were six cents below the blowout first-quarter numbers, however, which sparked some concern among investors. Other traders wanted to see what Goldman was going to report the following day. GS topped expectations by 62 cents with profits of $4.78 per share. The quality of earnings were questioned somewhat because of a one-time sale of a power generation facility that resulted in a $700 million gain. BSC said on Thursday that it generated profits of $3.72 per share, 62 cents above expectations.
"
3420,ARNC,"The overall state of the equity markets played a role. Stocks were down early last week before rallying on Wednesday and Thursday. LEH and GS reported on down days, while BSC was lucky enough report in the middle of a two-day, 300-point rally. The inability Lehman and Goldman Sachs to top extremely strong first-quarter results caused a bit of disgruntlement. There were also worries about the impact that market volatility and rising interest rates would have on the investing banking sector as a whole.
"
3421,ARNC,"On the other hand, earnings estimates for all three firms were raised for this year and next  a very bullish sign in the face of lackluster price action. The latest consensus forecast for LEH calls for fiscal 2006 earnings of $6.46 per share and fiscal 2007 earnings of $6.71. These estimates represent one-week increases of three cents for both forecasts. In regards to GS, the consensus estimates are $16.67 for fiscal 2006 and $16.07 for fiscal 2007. These new projections represent increases of 39 cents and 20 cents, respectively. Estimates for BSC now stand at $12.78 for fiscal 2006 and $13.38 for fiscal 2007, representing increases of 13 cents and 17 cents, respectively.
"
3422,ARNC,"Astute investors will notice that the revisions do not fully reflect the magnitude of the fiscal second-quarter surprises. This is partially due to the fact that not all of the covering analysts have adjusted their forecasts. Consensus estimates for both the third and fourth quarters have been ratcheted up, however, implying that analysts expect the positive earnings momentum to continue.
"
3423,ARNC,"Second quarter earnings season does not officially kick off until July 10, when Alcoa (AA) is expected to report. One analyst raised his forecast on the aluminum company last week. The recent change and two other positive revisions within the past 30 days have caused the quarterly estimate to rise by a cumulative three cents to 80 cents per share. Alcoa belongs to the Mining-Non Ferrous group, which has a Zacks Industry Rank of 1.57.
"
3424,ARNC,"Another company with recent revisions in estimates is CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report), a Zacks #1 Rank stock. Two of the 10 covering analysts have raised their quarterly and full-year estimates over the past 30 days, with one analyst adjusting his estimate within the past seven days. The current second-quarter forecast calls for profits of $1.12 per share  a penny above the month-old estimate. The current full-year forecast calls for profits of $4.34 per share, five cents above the month-old estimate.
"
3425,ARNC,"CSX belongs to the Transportation-Rail group, which has a Zacks Industry Rank of 2.30. This group also contains five Zacks #2 Rank stocks: Canadian National Railway (CNI  -  Free Report), Florida East Coast Industries (FLA), Genesee & Wyoming (GWR  -  Free Report), Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) and Union Pacific (UNP  -  Free Report). As I have stated previously, the railroads are benefiting from both sustained economic expansion and high energy prices. Elevated fuel prices have resulted in a shift of market share from trucks to rail. 
"
3426,ARNC,"Ethanol and coal are also helping the rail industry. On Friday afternoon, UNP issued a press release stating that it set a new all-time record for carloadings in a seven-day period. This was the first-time that the company has set such a record outside of its peak season. UNP is handling a 57% increase in ethanol shipments and is experiencing record coal volumes.

"
3430,ARNC,"^Net percentage of total estimates for this fiscal years earnings (primarily 2006) that have been revised upwards. This number is calculated by subtracting the number of estimates revised downwards over the past four weeks from the number of estimates revised upwards over the past four weeks and dividing this total by the total number of next fiscal year estimates.
"
3431,ARNC,"Last week, three of the largest investment banking firms reported fiscal second-quarter results: Lehman Brothers (LEH), Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and Bear Stearns (BSC). The results topped expectations, but the prices of the three stocks ended the week slightly down after some modest volatility. 
"
3432,ARNC,"There was not a single explanation as to why. LEH topped estimates by nine cents with profits of $1.69 per share. The results were six cents below the blowout first-quarter numbers, however, which sparked some concern among investors. Other traders wanted to see what Goldman was going to report the following day. GS topped expectations by 62 cents with profits of $4.78 per share. The quality of earnings were questioned somewhat because of a one-time sale of a power generation facility that resulted in a $700 million gain. BSC said on Thursday that it generated profits of $3.72 per share, 62 cents above expectations.
"
3433,ARNC,"The overall state of the equity markets played a role. Stocks were down early last week before rallying on Wednesday and Thursday. LEH and GS reported on down days, while BSC was lucky enough report in the middle of a two-day, 300-point rally. The inability Lehman and Goldman Sachs to top extremely strong first-quarter results caused a bit of disgruntlement. There were also worries about the impact that market volatility and rising interest rates would have on the investing banking sector as a whole.
"
3434,ARNC,"On the other hand, earnings estimates for all three firms were raised for this year and next  a very bullish sign in the face of lackluster price action. The latest consensus forecast for LEH calls for fiscal 2006 earnings of $6.46 per share and fiscal 2007 earnings of $6.71. These estimates represent one-week increases of three cents for both forecasts. In regards to GS, the consensus estimates are $16.67 for fiscal 2006 and $16.07 for fiscal 2007. These new projections represent increases of 39 cents and 20 cents, respectively. Estimates for BSC now stand at $12.78 for fiscal 2006 and $13.38 for fiscal 2007, representing increases of 13 cents and 17 cents, respectively.
"
3435,ARNC,"Astute investors will notice that the revisions do not fully reflect the magnitude of the fiscal second-quarter surprises. This is partially due to the fact that not all of the covering analysts have adjusted their forecasts. Consensus estimates for both the third and fourth quarters have been ratcheted up, however, implying that analysts expect the positive earnings momentum to continue.
"
3436,ARNC,"Second quarter earnings season does not officially kick off until July 10, when Alcoa (AA) is expected to report. One analyst raised his forecast on the aluminum company last week. The recent change and two other positive revisions within the past 30 days have caused the quarterly estimate to rise by a cumulative three cents to 80 cents per share. Alcoa belongs to the Mining-Non Ferrous group, which has a Zacks Industry Rank of 1.57.
"
3437,ARNC,"Another company with recent revisions in estimates is CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report), a Zacks #1 Rank stock. Two of the 10 covering analysts have raised their quarterly and full-year estimates over the past 30 days, with one analyst adjusting his estimate within the past seven days. The current second-quarter forecast calls for profits of $1.12 per share  a penny above the month-old estimate. The current full-year forecast calls for profits of $4.34 per share, five cents above the month-old estimate.
"
3438,ARNC,"CSX belongs to the Transportation-Rail group, which has a Zacks Industry Rank of 2.30. This group also contains five Zacks #2 Rank stocks: Canadian National Railway (CNI  -  Free Report), Florida East Coast Industries (FLA), Genesee & Wyoming (GWR  -  Free Report), Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) and Union Pacific (UNP  -  Free Report). As I have stated previously, the railroads are benefiting from both sustained economic expansion and high energy prices. Elevated fuel prices have resulted in a shift of market share from trucks to rail. 
"
3439,ARNC,"Ethanol and coal are also helping the rail industry. On Friday afternoon, UNP issued a press release stating that it set a new all-time record for carloadings in a seven-day period. This was the first-time that the company has set such a record outside of its peak season. UNP is handling a 57% increase in ethanol shipments and is experiencing record coal volumes.

3443,ARNC,"^Net percentage of total estimates for this fiscal years earnings (primarily 2006) that have been revised upwards. This number is calculated by subtracting the number of estimates revised downwards over the past four weeks from the number of estimates revised upwards over the past four weeks and dividing this total by the total number of next fiscal year estimates.
"
3444,ARNC,"In the weeks leading up to the Federal Reserves interest rate decision, both the bond and stock markets actively discounted the expected quarter point interest rate increase. The bond market did so by moving long term interest rates higher, and the stock market by rotating to new sector leadership, away from the more interest sensitive names. In reaction, the Experts are looking toward earnings, fundamental economic trends and relative strength rankings to discern their proper sector and industry exposure. Read on to discover how to allocate your portfolio and the stocks you should own within those sectors.Out of Tech
"
3445,ARNC,"Price Headley is an ETF specialist and editor of Sector Trends Adviser , which focuses on the relative strength of sectors in response to one another. On the back of lowered guidance from Computer Associates (NYSE: (CA  -  Free Report) ) and Siebel Systems (NASDAQ: SEBL ) as well as expectations that were merely met, rather than exceeded, by Yahoo! (NASDAQ: YHOO ) Headley decided to look closer. In fact, technology industries comprise 9 Headleys 10 weakest industry funds.
"
3446,ARNC,"According to Headleys research, the weakest market sectors are software and semiconductors. The iShares Semiconductors Index Fund (AMEX: IGW ) and the ML Semiconductor HOLDRS (AMEX: SMH ) are each down more than 15% over the last three months. Similarly, the iShares OS Software Index Fund (AMEX: (IGV  -  Free Report) ) is down 11% over the last three months. 
"
3447,ARNC,"Headley thinks the weakness in these sectors is a continuation of the post-bubble trends when earnings growth was driven mostly through belt-tightening rather than demand growth. The belt-tightening created very slim inventories and responses in outlooks are very quickly felt throughout the business model and by customers and clients. Headley thinks that the only plays that should be made in the sector should be based around bounces off the bottom or short selling positions taken in these stocks. Otherwise, Headley recommends extreme caution when strolling through tech land.No Home for Housing
"
3448,ARNC,"Home prices have risen consistently for the last several years, and investors and analysts predicted that a bubble was forming. As soon as interest rates began increasing in the anticipation of the Fed Funds increase the rush was on to lock in mortgage rates before they rose along with interest rates. In fact, May saw record sales of both new and existing homes. Since June 30, though, home-builders have been under significant pressure as rising rates and slowing appreciation of new home prices. Further, slowing retail sales and disappointing employment numbers have created the perception that investors should not create a home for housing in their portfolios.
"
3449,ARNC,"Gregory Spear, editor of The Spear Report: Professional Edition expects a final capitulation in home-building stocks, which have experienced a tough go of it for a while now. However, unlike many other experts, he strongly recommends accumulating select homebuilders on that final trip into Hades. Even in a world in which demand for home-building plummets by 20%, Spear thinks that DR Horton Inc. (NYSE: (DHI  -  Free Report) ) and a couple of other stocks that meet his requirements for Consensus recommendations will offer strong values. Many of the stocks have single digit valuations and PEGs that remain below 0.5. Compelling Sectors
"
3450,ARNC,"By and large, most of the Experts commodity based sectors as offering the best growth prospects. Inflation and a global economic boom are driving many commodities-based stocks higher. Headley currently likes iShares Goldman Sachs Natural Resources Index Fund (AMEX: (ICF  -  Free Report) ). energy heavyweights like Exxon Mobil (NYSE: (XOM  -  Free Report) ) and Schlumberger (SLB) as well as basic materials firms such as Alcoa (NYSE: AA ), all of which stand to benefit from rising energy and commodity prices. 75% of this ETF is made up equity in oil and oil services firms  which should continue to prosper as oil costs still hover well above $30 per barrel, and in fact closer to $40 per barrel at this writing  the remaining 25 percent of this fund is spread among metals and mining, paper products and natural gas stocks. Across the board, these sectors should continue to well as election-year trends continue to favor demand for the basic building blocks of economic growth.
"
3451,ARNC,"Headley also likes international exposure and is buying the iShares MSCI Pacific Ex-Japan (AMEX: (EPP  -  Free Report) ). Asian markets have rebounded strongly in recent weeks after being spooked first by the prospects for an engineered soft landing for the Chinese economy, then by the prospects for higher interest rates in the U.S. As it now stands, these fears may well have been overblown. Finally, the multi-country nature of this ETF means youll enjoy diverse exposure, with big holdings in Australian financial and media concerns, basic materials firms, as well as equity in Hong Kong and other South Asian markets. The fund is a good way to play continued growth in Asian economies, without the volatility found in single-country funds.Sectors Preferred

3452,ARNC,"The international and commodity themes receive high marks from a number of the Experts. When constructing your portfolio, industry and sector allocations will be more critical than ever. In spite of economic strength, sector performance will remain uneven. In next weeks issue, we will further explore the international investment picture and scour the Experts recommendations for top performing industrial stocks.

3456,ARNC,"The insatiable appetite for metals in this country and around the world has been the strong point for the industry, but its very cyclical nature has historically been its weakness.  The space seems symbiotically tied to consumer goods, which means that as demand for products such as automobiles and major appliances decline, so too does the industry's prospects.  That has been bad news for much of the 21st century, but might be the seed of its revitalization moving forward.  The metals industry might be entering into a prosperous period that hasn't been seen in a while, and some of its many facets have begun showing up at the higher end of the Zacks Industry Rank.  That includes metal production distributors, which currently have a rank of 2.50 on Nick Raich's  ""Weekly Earnings and Sector Update,""  placing it 17th out of more than 200 industries. 
"
3457,ARNC,"Mark Parr is a managing director at McDonald's Investments, Inc., A KeyCorp Company.  The 5-star analyst highlights three factors that are spearheading the industry's performance.  First, there is clear evidence of end demand recovery from a variety of areas, including, but not limited to, automotive, construction, electrical and capital goods.  Secondly, inventories are at decade lows.  This means that metals companies might have to manufacture more to keep up with demand.  Lastly, demand for industrial materials is extremely high right now.  Such factors have all combined to spearhead a rapid rise in commodity prices.   
"
3458,ARNC,"However, a good portion of the demand for industrial materials isn't coming from the United States, but instead from China.  China is a growing industrial giant, and to many American and Canadian companies it is an Eden-like reservoir of possibilities.  This growing company is in need of commodities and scrap metal as it makes an industrial leap in this young century, and many companies at this end of the globe are happy to comply.  Many metals companies are already forming ambitious plans for relationships in Asia, and especially China.  While the growing global presence of the country makes some in the U.S. nervous, particularly since outsourcing has become such a touchy subject, the fact of China's emergence cannot be disputed and will likely continue.   
"
3459,ARNC,"After being under pressure for so long, the metals industry's rise has only been underway for a short while, and there remains some uncertainty for the future.  ""It's too early too tell how sustainable this is,"" said Parr, ""but the outlook certainly suggests a significant improvement over the past decade.""  When looking over the industry, Parr likes to see a company with a seasoned management team that has a solid record of execution.  Also, it's important that operational strategies are aligned with presented opportunities.  
"
3460,ARNC,"Given the cyclical nature of the metals industry, the insights of analysts become all the more important.  Investors need to know about consumer trends both domestically and internationally before making an investment, since these are the buttresses that support the space.  Furthermore, it's equally crucial to pick out companies best suited to take advantage of such potential.  If done the right way, the metals industry could be a boon for your portfolio.  What Do the All Stars Recommend?

3462,ARNC,"Below are some of the top ranked stocks recommended by the most  5-star  analysts in the machinery industry.  All of them have been beneficiaries of improving economic trends.  They are also searching for ways to expand their business in new areas.  Read the following profiles to get a better sense of their capabilities and advantages.  Alcoa Inc.  (NYSE:  AA ) is one of the world's leading producers of primary aluminum, fabricated aluminum and alumina and a major participant in all segments of the industry: mining, refining, smelting, fabricating and recycling. Alcoa serves customers worldwide primarily in the packaging, transportation (including aerospace, automotive, rail and shipping), building and industrial markets with a great variety of fabricated and finished products.  Yesterday, Alcoa was named the ""Most Admired Metals Company"" by Fortune for the ninth consecutive time.  The company was tops in each key attributed measured by the publication in its field, including innovativeness, employee talent, use of corporate assets, social responsibility, quality of management, financial soundness, long-term investment value and quality of products and services.   
"
3463,ARNC,"In its fourth quarter, Alcoa reported earnings per share that surpassed both the year-ago performance and the consensus, and sales improved year-over-year by +9% to $5.5 billion.  The result was up +4% sequentially thanks to strong alumina shipments and higher aluminum prices, which overcame slightly lower volumes in markets that typically experience weakness in the fourth quarter.  Alcoa had to face several challenges throughout the year, such as cost increases for raw materials, energy, benefits, and the impact of the weakened dollar.  However, the company stated that it offset such factors through improved productivity, managed capital, and by working every lever in its control.  ""The result was consistently improving profitability, a considerably stronger balance sheet, and a company that is well positioned for future growth as world markets continue to strengthen,"" said Alain Belda, Chairman and CEO of Alcoa.  More recently, the Chief laid down the latest company-wide, three-year cost savings challenge, which calls for a reduction of $1.2 billion in annual expenditures by the end of 2006.  Upon completion of this program, which is its third three-year cost savings challenge, Alcoa will have eliminated more than $3.3 billion in costs.  To further research Alcoa, click  AA .  Alcan  (NYSE:  AL ) is the parent company of an international group involved in most aspects of the aluminum industry. Through subsidiaries, joint ventures and related companies around the world, the activities of Alcan include bauxite mining, alumina refining, power generation, aluminum smelting, manufacturing and recycling as well as research and technology.  Alcan reported operating earnings, which exclude items, of 42 cents per common share in its fourth quarter, which was 4 cents better than the year-ago performance and more than +10% over the consensus.  The company achieved record cash from operating activities of $1.8 billion for the year, even in the face of challenging conditions, such as a soft economic environment, turbulent currency markets and cost pressures.   
"
3464,ARNC,"Perhaps the biggest news of Alcan's quarter was its undertaking of a major acquisition; namely the French aluminum and packaging group Pechiney.  Earlier this month, Alcan reported that as of February 6th it acquired all Pechiney shares, Bonus Allocation Rights and OCEANEs it did not already own.  Therefore, Pechiney became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alcan.  In its fourth quarter report, Alcan President and CEO Travis Engen stated that the transaction is a significant achievement, and it is now activity working to ensure a smooth transition and to capture synergies.  The Pechiney acquisition will put Alcan in a better position to compete with Alcoa.  To further research Alcan, click  AL .  Inco, Ltd.  (NYSE:  N ) is one of the world's premier mining and metals companies, and the world's second largest producer of nickel.  Its world-class mineral reserve and resource base is among the best in the global nickel industry.  It is also an important producer of copper, cobalt and precious and platinum-group metals and a major producer of specialty nickel-based products.  Earlier this month, Inco posted adjusted net earnings of 57 cents per share on a diluted basis, which marked a substantial improvement from last year's 10-cent total, while also beating the consensus by more than +72%.  As for 2003, adjusted net earnings reached $1.29 per share on a diluted basis, compared to 75 cents in the previous year.  Inco benefited from nickel prices hitting 14-year highs, ending the year up by +135% from the end of 2002.  Strong nickel prices were helped by tight supply and increasing demand, especially from ongoing growth in Asian stainless steel production and the lack of new supply sources.  Inco's strategy for several years now was to build a strong presence on the ground across Asia, and especially in China.  Besides nickel, the company's fourth quarter results were also helped by higher prices for copper and cobalt.  To further research Inco, Ltd., click  N .  The Timken Company  (NYSE:  TKR ) is a leading global manufacturer of highly engineered bearings and alloy steels, and a provider of related products and services with operations in 29 countries.  As part of its transformation into a more focused and competitive global leader, the Timken Company completed its largest acquisition in history last February with the addition of the Torrington Company.  The acquisition creates the world's third-largest bearing company with about $3.8 billion in sales, and expands its portfolio of automotive and industrial bearings-based products and service solutions.  At the time, Chairman W.R. Timken, Jr. stated, ""With this acquisition, we are increasing the size of our company by almost 50%.  And, we are continuing to concentrate on what we do best by buying a company in an industry where we have a leadership position built on decades of expertise.""  
"
3465,ARNC,"The Torrington acquisition played a big part in Timken's fourth quarter and annual results.  For the quarter, the company posted adjusted net income of 26 cents per diluted share, which bettered the year-ago performance of 19 cents while beating the consensus by more than +136%.  Sales jumped +58% to $1 billion.  Excluding the impact of Torrington, earnings per diluted share came in at a penny per share while sales improved +10%.  Timken believes it has built a solid foundation in 2003 and plans to build on it this year.  It expects improved performance in 2004 across all of its segments.

3467,ARNC,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Arconic Inc. (ARNC  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 17.1% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is ARNC due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Arconic's Earnings and Sales Beat Estimates in Q1Arconic reported net income of $143 million or 29 cents per share for the first quarter of 2018, down from $322 million or 65 cents a year ago.  Barring one-time items, adjusted earnings came in at 34 cents per share for the reported quarter, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 32 cents.Arconic reported revenues of $3,445 million, up around 7.9% year over year, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,329.6 million.Segment HighlightsEP&S: Revenues from the division came in at $1.5 billion for the first quarter, up 4% year over year. Organic revenues for the segment rose 2% supported by growth in aerospace engines, defense and industrial, which more than offset the continued slump in the industrial gas turbine market and challenges in aerospace airframe production mix, related to fastening systems.Operating profit for the segment fell 10.5% year over year owing to unfavorable product mix, higher input costs and performance shortfalls in Rings and Disks, which more than offset the strength in aerospace engines.GRP: The division recorded sales of $1.4 billion in the quarter, up 9% year over year.Operating profit for the segment, however, declined 17.6% year over year due to unfavorable aerospace wide-body production mix and higher aluminum prices, partly offset by higher automotive volume.  TCS: The segment logged sales of $537 million, up 18% year over year.Operating profit was down 1.4% as favorable foreign currency swings, higher volume in commercial transportation and building and construction and net cost savings were more than offset by unfavorable product price and mix and higher aluminum prices.Financial PositionArconic ended the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of roughly $1,205 million, down around 52.8% year over year.Long-term debt fell 21.6% year over year to $6,309 million.OutlookArconic provided updated full-year 2018 guidance. The company now expects revenues for 2018 in the range of $13.7 billion to $14 billion (up from $13.4-$13.7 billion projected earlier). It now expects adjusted earnings to be in the range of $1.17-$1.27 per share (down from $1.45-$1.55) and free cash flow to be around $250 million (down from prior guidance of roughly $500 million). How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been four revisions lower for the current quarter. In the past month, the consensus estimate has shifted downward by 23.4% due to these changes.Arconic Inc. Price and Consensus Arconic Inc. Price and Consensus | Arconic Inc. QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, ARNC has a subpar Growth Score of D, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the top 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.The company's stock is suitable solely for value based on our styles scores.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise ARNC has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.
"
3468,ARNC,"A successful investor understands the importance of exiting certain underperformers at the right time to maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.Arconic Inc. (ARNC  -  Free Report) is one such stock that you may want to consider dropping given its significant price decline year to date along with the earnings estimate revisions going downhill for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms Arconic’s weak position in the market.Shares of Arconic have lost around 31.6% year to date. The company has also underperformed its industry’s decline of roughly 6.6%.  Let’s explore the aspects that are responsible for the downslide faced by this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock.Tariff Challenges:The company faces pricing pressure due to imposition of tariff on aluminium imports leading to higher input costs. According to the company, aluminum prices have shot up driven by LIFO (last-in, first-out) method of inventory accounting. It is adversely affecting Arconic's operating margins. Although the duration of the tariff effect is unknown, it is expected to end eventually.Aluminum prices also rose 20% in the most recent quarter hurting operating margin by $37 million. The prices are rising sharply in the wake of aluminum tariffs and Russian sanctions. The company expects to face an unfavorable impact of $45-$55 million from elevated aluminum prices in second-quarter 2018. It also currently sees an unfavorable impact of $100 million in 2018. Arconic has reduced its earnings guidance for 2018 factoring in headwinds from higher aluminum prices.Market Instability:Arconic is exposed to softness across certain end-use markets. The company is seeing lower sales in industrial gas turbine market due to weak market conditions. The heavy-duty truck and trailer market in North America, although recovered somewhat of late, remains affected by lower build rates. Arconic is also seeing softness in the packaging market. It is ramping down production at its Tennessee packaging business and plans to exit that business in 2018. The company expects its industrial markets to be flat in 2018.Leverage Concerns:The company is concerned about the high leverage. The company is carrying essentially all of Alcoa Corporation’s (AA  -  Free Report) debt, following the business separation. While the company is taking actions to cut debt, it still has substantial long-term debt of roughly $6.3 billion as against cash and cash equivalents of roughly $1.2 billion.Downward Estimate RevisionFor the full year, we have seen four estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This has caused the consensus estimate, going from $1.49 a share a month ago to its current level of $1.24. The downward trend in earnings estimate revisions indicate that the odds in favor of an upside in the near term are slim.For the current quarter, Arconic has seen four downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate for earnings down to 30 cents a share from 40 cents over the past 30 days.  Other Bearish ReadingsReturn on Capital (ROC) of Arconic is 5.1% compared with 7.8% for the industry. Arconic’s trailing 12-month ROE undercuts its growth potential. The stock’s current ROE stands at 11.4% compared with the industry’s ROE of 16.6%.The debt-to-equity ratio is a good indicator of the financial well-being of a company. To this end, Arconic seems to be a highly leveraged stock with a reading of 54.4% compared with 47.1% for the industry.Furthermore, the stock has a VGM Score of D, which dampens its appeal. Here, V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Arconic Inc. Price and Consensus Arconic Inc.

3472,ARNC,"U.S. stock markets ended in negative territory on Monday as a broad-based decline pushed all three major indexes in red. Slide into the healthcare and industrial stocks more than offset gains from several merger and acquisitions (M&A) except a telecom mega deal. Moreover, strong first quarter earnings results also failed to uplift investor’s sentiment.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) closed at 24,163.15, declining 0.6% or 148.04 points. The S&P 500 Index (INX) decreased 0.8% to close at 2,648.05. The Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 7,066.27, decreasing 0.8%.

The index recorded 22 new 52-week highs and 11 new 52-week lows.The Nasdaq Composite lost 0.8%.  The index recorded 55 new 52-week highs and 46 new 52-week lows.Healthcare, Metal and Industrial Stocks Pull Down the MarketHealthcare, metal and industrials sectors were the worst performers in the last day of trading in April. These three sectors led a broad-based market decline.Shares of Celgene Corp. (CELG  -  Free Report) declined 4.5% after a Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) report stated that the company will require one-to-three years more to resubmit its applications for the U.S. approval of the company’s critical drug ozanimod in relapsing multiple sclerosis.Shares of Allergen plc (AGN  -  Free Report) plunged 5.2% after its Chairman and CEO Brent Saunders expressed his view’s that he is opposed to any changes of the company’s fundamental business structure.

Net earnings came in at $0.09 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.03. Revenues generated $1,659 million exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,549 million. Investors were expecting more especially after President Trump imposed 25% tariffs on imported steel.Concern on Telecom Mega Deal Overshadows Slew of M&AsA number of M&As announcements helped markets advance in the initial hours of trading. Shares of Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) increased 1.3% after the retail giant’s U.K. arm, ASDA Group Ltd., agreed to merge with British supermarket chain J Sainsbury plc. Likewise, shares of ILG Inc. (ILG  -  Free Report) rose 4.5% after Marriot Vacations Worldwide Corp.

The Dow and S&P 500 each increased by 0.3%, while the Nasdaq composite gained 0.1%. Year to date, Nasdaq Composite is trading in the green while both Dow 30 and S&P 500 are in red.Strong earnings results by most of the large U.S. corporates failed to enthuse investors. Disappointing guidance by Taiwan Semiconductor TSM, the largest contract chipmaker worldwide, led to losses for tech majors, especially Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report). Moreover, Caterpillar Inc.’s (CAT  -  Free Report) forecast that economic growth might decelerate later this year also resulted in a broad-based market decline.  Rising bond yields also dented investors’ confidence. In April, the 10-year Treasury yield briefly hit the psychological 3% mark for the first time since January 2014.Additionally, stock markets fluctuate due to the fear about a global trade war and geopolitical tensions related to Syria.Stocks That Made HaedlinesBP Posts Strong Q1 Earnings on Record Upstream BusinessBP plc (BP  -  Free Report) reported strong first-quarter 2018 results as oil price has started to recover from the slump witnessed nearly four years back.

3475,ARNC,"Arconic Inc. (ARNC  -  Free Report) is slated to release its first-quarter 2018 results before the bell on Apr 30.Arconic’s adjusted earnings of 31 cents per share for the fourth quarter of 2017 topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 24 cents, translating into a 29.2% positive surprise.Revenues rose around 10% year over year to $3,271 million in the quarter, driven by improved volumes across all segments and higher aluminum prices. Sales also beat Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,070.5 million.Arconic has underperformed the industry it belongs to over the past six months. The company's shares have declined around 10% over this period, compared with roughly 9.3% gain recorded by the industry. Its shares were hit hard following the release of the fourth-quarter results on its downbeat earnings and cash flow guidance for 2018. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayArconic, in its fourth-quarter call, said that it expects revenues for 2018 in the range of $13.4-$13.7 billion. It also expects adjusted earnings in the range of $1.45-$1.55 per share and free cash flow to be around $500 million. Arconic also initiated portfolio and strategy review, which is expected to be completed by the end of this year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for Arconic for the first quarter stands at $3,330 million, reflecting a year over year growth of 4.1%.Arconic is focusing on cost reduction and productivity improvements across its businesses, which should lend support to its bottom line. The company achieved net cost saving of 2.1% of revenues in the last reported quarter and is expected to continue to benefit from its cost actions in the March quarter.Arconic is also seeing strong momentum in automotive, driven by the transition of the auto industry to lightweighting. The company saw a 22% growth in the automotive end-market in 2017 and expects 15-20% growth this year.Moreover, Arconic is witnessing healthy demand trends in the aerospace market and is actively pursuing its aerospace expansion strategy. It is well placed to gain from major contract wins in aerospace. Arconic is witnessing strong momentum in commercial aero engines with sales rising 8% year over year in 2017. The momentum in aerospace is expected to continue in the first quarter.  The company sees a 4-6% growth in aerospace and defense end-market in 2018, higher than 2% in 2017.However, Arconic is exposed to headwind from charges associated with higher aluminum prices, driven by LIFO (last-in, first-out) method of inventory accounting, increased processing costs and metal lag. Higher aluminum prices led to a negative impact of $42 million in the fourth quarter and $84 million for full-year 2017 on its EBITDA margin and may pose some headwinds in the March quarter.  Arconic is also seeing weak sales in industrial gas turbine market due to soft market conditions. The market was down 7% in 2017 and the company expects at least 40% decline in 2018. The company also expects pricing pressure to continue in many of its markets, especially aerospace, and also sees higher raw material prices in 2018.Arconic Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Arconic Inc.

3477,ARNC,"Arconic Inc. (ARNC  -  Free Report) could be a stock to avoid from a technical perspective, as the firm is seeing unfavorable trends on the moving average crossover front. Recently, the 50 Day Moving Average for ARNC broke out below the 200 Day Simple Moving Average, suggesting short-term bearishness.This has already started to take place, as the stock has moved lower by 1.3% in the past four weeks. And with the recent moving average crossover, investors have to think that more unfavorable trading is ahead for ARNC stock.If that wasn’t enough, ARNC isn’t looking too great from an earnings estimate revision perspective either. It appears as though many analysts have been reducing their earnings expectations for the stock lately, which is usually not a good sign of things to come.Consider that in the last 30 days, 1 estimate has been reduced, while none has moved higher. Add this in to a similar move lower in the consensus estimate, and there is plenty of reason to be bearish here.That is why we currently have a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) on this stock and are looking for it to underperform in the weeks ahead.

The Dow was down 1,500 points at one point during late-afternoon trading, and today marks the worst single-day point drop ever for the widely-watched index.The VIX, an index which many investors look to in order to gauge market volatility, reached an astounding 35.02, up over 100%, at market close. This marks the largest one-day percentage increase ever for the index.Fingers are pointing to a few things for this latest market decline. On Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released strong wage data, with unemployment remaining steady at 4.1% and 200,000 new jobs created last month. However, this good news had markets bracing for a potentially aggressive hike in interest rates from the Federal Reserve in the next year.Additionally, the 10-year Treasury yield to hit a four-year high on Friday to 2.85% after it fell to a record low just 18 months ago. Today, the 10-year closed near 2.73%Overall, it looks like the major indexes have hit the restart button on 2018 after a hot start. The S&P 500, in particular, is now down about flat on the year after reaching an all-time high last month, erasing all of its gains and breaking below its 50-day moving average.Earlier in the day, after opening in the red, the market managed to gain back some of its losses and settle back into green territory, but that was only for a brief moment.Some of the biggest stock movers in the Dow included oil giants ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report), which ended the day down 5.7% and about 5%. Top decliners in the S&P 500 included Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) and Arconic (ARNC  -  Free Report).The tech-heavy Nasdaq, an index which has still managed to keep some gains this year thanks to a great January, saw companies like NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report), Vodafone (VOD  -  Free Report), and Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) slip 8.49%, 6.25%, and 6.57%, respectively, at market close.Today’s dramatic stock market activity even caught the attention of the White House, and in a statement, the Trump administration said that “We’re always concerned when the market loses any value, but we’re also confident in the economy’s fundamentals.”Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

3481,ARNC,"A series of curious events occurred last Friday morning, which continued — Rube Goldberg-like — throughout the day and, it may be argued, even into this morning’s pre-market trading action. Friday’s Dow closed down 673 points, or -2.57%, while the Nasdaq and S&P 500 hived off roughly 2% each. The Down looks to open down another triple digits, although we’ve seen some early buying back from how low we started this morning.The first thing to have happened was the non-farm payroll report Friday morning, which posted another very strong month for employment gains (+200K). Average Hourly Earnings also gained another third of a percent, meaning wage growth is showing signs of adding to overall inflation in the U.S. And talk of a fourth interest rate hike in the next 12 months from the Fed when incoming Chairman Jay Powell takes over added to the already +50% likelihood of three rate hikes, beginning next month.From there we saw the 10-year bond yield spike up past 2.8%. As Zacks Strategist Tracey Ryniec remarked in real time on Friday, “A strong economy and inflation means no more free money.” Zacks’ Dave Bartosiak reacted, “Perhaps this is the bond market telling the US, ‘We’re a little concerned with that debt situation you’ve got now that you’ve cut those tax rates.’” And Senior Strategist Kevin Cook looked at the VIX and said, “Volume still looks tame, no huge fear. Spot VIX is acting like 1% moves could be normal again. Futures are hardly panicked.”Cook also points out that last week was the worst week… of one of the best two-year rallies we’ve ever seen. Markets are up 65%, so this correction is a mere pittance by comparison. Especially considering — if you can remember back to January 2016, not all that long ago — we saw a sell-off of 6.2%. Right now, even with Monday futures again in sell-off mode, we’re only looking at around -5%. Not really in the same ballpark, at least not yet.Earnings Estimates Going UpIf you’re still concerned about markets swooning to start this new week, a good tonic for you might be Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian’s latest Earnings Preview, where he points out not only is Q4 earnings season the best we’ve seen in years, but future earnings guidance is shooting up for future quarters. So while we do see some near-term pressure on valuations — which outgoing Fed Chair Janet Yellen did mention was somewhat of a concern going forward — the name of the game is still earnings, and those are only pointing north.Q4 Earnings RoundupLast week saw a host of marquee names posting quarterly earnings reports, with mostly good results. In fact, the only bottom-line misses we saw stemmed from tax-related write-downs, which are essentially near-term in nature, and not a result of missed expectations (Apple’s [(AAPL  -  Free Report)] lower-than-anticipated iPhone X sales notwithstanding). This week, we see just as many reports hitting the tape, even if they are not quite the same household names as last week.Foodservice giant Sysco (SYY  -  Free Report) beat estimates on both its top- and bottom-lines this morning, with 78 cents per share on $14.41 billion surpassing the 65 cents per share and $14.19 billion in revenues expected. Earnings results for the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company rose 34.5% year over year. For more on SYY’s earnings, click here.British pharma major Bristol Myers (BMY  -  Free Report) also topped expectations, beating on the bottom line by a penny to 68 cents per share, and quarterly sales of $5.45 billion outpaced the $5.31 billion in the Zacks consensus estimate. Guidance was ratcheted up a bit, but still within the Zacks consensus. For more on BMY’s earnings, click here.And Arconic (ARNC  -  Free Report), the engineered products segment that formerly belonged to aluminum giant Alcoa (AA), easily outperformed both sales and earnings estimates. The company saw 31 cents per share on $3.27 billion in revenues, ahead of the 24 cents per share and $3.07 billion we had been expecting.

3485,ARNC,"Arconic Inc. (ARNC  -  Free Report), a global leader in multi-material, precision engineered products and solutions for a variety of industries, is slated to release its fourth-quarter 2017 results before the bell on Feb 5.Arconic saw lower profits in the third quarter of 2017, hurt by costs related to higher aluminum prices. Adjusted earnings of 25 cents per share for the quarter lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 27 cents.Revenues rose around 3% year over year to $3,236 million in the third quarter, driven by improved volumes across all segments. Sales topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,129 million.Arconic’s shares have gained around 19.3% over a year, modestly outperforming the roughly 18.7% gain recorded by the industry it belongs to. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayArconic, in October 2017, reaffirmed its full-year 2017 adjusted earnings guidance of $1.15-$1.20 per share. However, the company updated its revenue and capital expenditure outlook for 2017.The company raised its revenue expectations for 2017 to the range of $12.6-$12.8 billion from $12.3-$12.7 billion expected earlier. Arconic also revised its capital expenditure forecast for the year to roughly $600 million from its prior view of up to $650 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for Arconic for the fourth quarter stands at $3,070 million, reflecting a year over year growth of 3.5%.Arconic is focusing on cost reduction and productivity improvements across its businesses, which should lend support to its bottom line in the fourth quarter. The company achieved net cost saving of 1.5% of revenues in the last reported quarter and is expected to continue to benefit in the December quarter.In particular, the company expects its selling, general administrative, and other expenses (SG&A) to be lower by around $40 million in the December quarter. For the full year, the company sees a $100 million year over year reduction in SG&A.Arconic is also seeing healthy demand trends in the aerospace market and is actively pursuing its aerospace expansion strategy. It is well placed to gain from major contract wins in aerospace. Arconic is witnessing strong momentum in commercial aero engines with sales rising 9% year over year in the third quarter.  The company expects commercial aero engine revenues to be up 5% in the fourth quarter on a sequential comparison basis.However, Arconic faces headwind from charges associated with higher aluminum prices, driven by LIFO (last-in, first-out) method of inventory accounting, increased processing costs and metal lag. Charges of around $60 million hurt Arconic's profits in the third quarter and remain a headwind in the fourth, albeit to a lesser extent. The company sees an unfavorable impact of around $90 million from these charges (LIFO and metal lag) for 2017. Arconic, in December 2017, said that it is divesting its Latin America Extrusions (LAE) business, a part of its Transportation and Construction Solutions segment. The divestment of the LAE business is part of the company’s sustained initiatives to streamline its business portfolio, focus on its higher-margin products, reduce complexity and drive profitable growth.Arconic noted that the ownership of the business will be transferred to a subsidiary of Hydro Extruded Solutions AS following customary regulatory and anti-trust reviews. The transaction is expected to consummate in first-half 2018.Per the deal terms, Arconic will get roughly $10 million in cash for the LAE business, subject to working capital and other adjustments. The company will recognize a restructuring-related charge representing the loss on sale of roughly $40 million (post-tax) or 8 cents per share in fourth-quarter 2017. The charge is mainly associated with the non-cash impairment of the net book value of the LAE business.Arconic Inc. Price and Consensus  Arconic Inc. Price and Consensus | Arconic Inc. QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Arconic is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below:Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Arconic is 0.00% as both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 24 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks Rank: Arconic currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a 0.00% ESP, makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies in the basic materials space you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: Huntsman Corporation (HUN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.27% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (AEM  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +18.99% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.

3487,ARNC,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Arconic Inc. (ARNC  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 2.4% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Arconic's Q3 Earnings Trail, Sales Beat EstimatesArconic logged profit, as reported, of $119 million or 22 cents per share for the third quarter of 2017, down from $166 million or 33 cents per share a year ago. The results in the reported quarter include special items including restructuring charges. Profit was hurt by $60 million of costs related to higher aluminum prices, driven by LIFO method of accounting, metal lag and increased processing costs.Barring one-time items, earnings came in at 25 cents per share for the reported quarter. The results missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 27 cents.Arconic reported revenues of $3,236 million, up around 3% year over year. Sales topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,129 million. Revenues were driven by improved volumes across all segments and higher aluminum prices.Arconic remains focused on cost reduction and delivered net cost savings of 1.5% of revenues in the reported quarter.Segment HighlightsEPS – Revenues from the division came in at $1.5 billion in the third quarter, up 5% year over year. Adjusted EBITDA rose 5% year over year to $312 million in the quarter, as improved aerospace volume and cost savings more than offset unfavorable price and mix.GRP – The division recorded sales of $1.2 billion in the quarter, down 4% year over year. Adjusted EBITDA fell 2% year over year to $140 million, as lower aerospace wide-body build rates, airframe destocking and pricing pressure more than offset cost savings.TCS – The segment logged sales of $517 million, up 15% year over year. Adjusted EBITDA increased around 9% to $83 million in the quarter on the back of increased volumes and cost savings that more than offset headwinds including unfavorable price and mix.Financial PositionArconic ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of roughly $1.8 billion. Long-term debt was around $6.8 billion at the end of the third quarter. OutlookArconic reaffirmed its full-year adjusted earnings guidance of $1.15–$1.20 per share.

3488,ARNC,"Arconic Inc. (ARNC  -  Free Report) declared plans to set up a new horizontal heat treat furnace at its Davenport Works facility, Iowa.Heat treatment is a necessary stage in the production of certain high-strength products. It is essential for products intended for large industrial and aerospace applications.The furnace will allow Arconic to heat treat thicker and longer plate, including materials for thick plate stretcher, which started commercial production this year and is the largest thick plate stretcher in the world.As demand for composite wings (made with monolithic thick plate wing ribs) is increasing, need for thick aluminum plate is also on the rise. According to Arconic, the new capability will address the increasing demand for plate used for aircraft wing skins, ribs and other structural components, mainly in single-aisle builds. Moreover, the investment also creates growth opportunity in other markets including injection molding for automotive applications and semi-conductors for consumer electronics.  Financial assistance from the Iowa Department of Economic Development and the City of Riverdale will support the $137-million investment. The assistance will include financing, tax and R&D credits along with training grants for the workforce at Davenport, once the contract has been finalized.Construction of the project is anticipated to start in late 2017 while commercial production expected to commence in 2019.Shares of Arconic have declined 2.3% in the last three months, underperforming the industry’s 0.5% growth. Arconic logged profit, as reported, of $119 million or 22 cents per share for the third quarter of 2017, down from $166 million or 33 cents a year ago.

Despite global concerns adding an element of uncertainty to the outlook lately, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the industrial metals industry over the long term.Here we discuss some of the key reasons and what investors in the industrial metals sector can look forward to in the coming months and years:Automotive & Aerospace to Fuel GrowthOn the demand side, aluminum consumption is anticipated to improve on a global basis, spurred on by the automotive and packaging industries — the key end markets. The automobile market is becoming increasingly aluminum-intensive, given the metal's recyclability and light-weight properties.Automakers consumed a record amount of aluminum last year as plummeting prices and technological breakthroughs made it a viable alternative to steel. The global push to improve fuel efficiency in vehicles is projected to more than double the demand for aluminum in the auto industry by 2025.Arconic (ARNC  -  Free Report) is well positioned to capture the growing demand for aluminium sheet due to the transition of the North American auto industry to lightweighting. It is the market leader in providing aluminium sheet to the North American automotive market. The company leverages its breakthrough Micromill technology that manufactures the most advanced aluminium sheet on the market.The Micromill process produces an aluminium alloy that has 40% greater formability and 30% greater strength than the current automotive aluminium. Arconic expects its automotive sheet revenues to grow to $1.3 billion in 2018 from $76 million in 2010.The airline industry is also anticipated to boost demand for the metal. Arconic has a long-term agreement with Boeing to supply multi-material aerospace parts, its fourth multi-year contract with the aerospace giant in a series of recentdeals. Arconic also has big aerospace deals with Airbus and Lockheed Martin.Arconic also has a multi-year supply contract with Brazil-based leading commercial jets maker Embraer, worth around $470 million. The company also sealed a contract valued roughly $1 billion for the supply of proprietary alloys and plate products for every Airbus platform.Construction Remains a Pillar of StrengthThe housing and construction sector is the largest consumer of steel today and consequently, of iron ore. The construction sector is the second most rapidly growing sector after transportation in terms of aluminum usage. Building construction (pipes and wires) is also the largest market for copper.An uptrend has been noticed in real estate activity, like new home initiatives and construction spends, in the United States in the past few quarters. Long-stalled construction projects are being renewed. Requirement for emerging projects, such as education facilities and government buildings, is also creating demand in the sector.In the long term, as the urban population increases worldwide, so will the need for steel with the need to build skyscrapers and public transport infrastructure. Emerging economies will also continue to be major catalysts to support increasing urbanization and industrialization. Naturally, a rebound in construction bodes well for the iron ore and copper industries.Rectifying the Demand — Supply ImbalanceAfter aluminum prices bore the brunt of chronic surplus, the global aluminum industry underwent substantial changes to correct the supply-demand picture. This will eventually lead to firm prices. RUSAL had resorted to aluminum production cuts in the past few years. Likewise, Arconic has undertaken a number of restructuring measures (including closure of smelters) in the last few years, apart from aggressively pursuing cost-cutting actions.Additionally, curtailments in China are expected to create aluminum deficit this year. Further, faced with smog in major cities, China is clamping down on polluting industries. With its high energy intensity and reliance on coal, aluminum could be in the forefront if Chinese government does take steps against polluting industries.Similarly, China’s policy to clean up and consolidate the domestic steel industry is also working in favor of iron ore.Much Hope Pinned on TrumpThe industrial metals space has benefited from the Trump win. Trump’s promise to revive American infrastructure means commodities used to build everything from airports to bridges will gain under his presidency.Pickup in Economic Activity to Drive Copper DemandCopper is a major industrial metal playing a particularly important role in emerging countries. Given its varied applications, the trends in the copper market are often considered useful indicators of the state of the global economy.Developments in the world economy are strongly correlated with movements in copper prices. Given that China accounts for the largest share of global copper consumption as well as having a large share in the total production of pure copper, it’s no surprise that there is a strong correlation of the metal with ups and downs in its economy.For the long haul, expectations are for a rising middle class in Asia, particularly in India and China, who are likely to spend more on consumer goods such as air conditioners and refrigerators in the coming years. This will stimulate demand for copper. Chinese demand for the metal is also likely to grow to comprise 46% of the worldwide copper consumption by 2018.India to Support Demand Going AheadPer the World Steel Association, India’s prospects look bright due to consumption-boosting reforms and favorable policies to improve infrastructure and manufacturing output. Also, International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) projects India’s GDP growth to rise to 6.7% this year and 7.4% in the next year. Given that India's consumption of metals has almost doubled in the past 20 years, it will be a major consumer in the years to come.Renewed Optimism in ChinaChina reported third-quarter GDP growth of 6.8%, a tad lower than the second quarter's 6.9% expansion. The IMF forecast for growth in China is pegged at 6.8% for 2017. It is perceived that with an inflation-adjusted growth of 6.9% in the first half, China’s economy is on track to meet or likely exceed Beijing’s full-year target of around 6.5%.Copper Demand from Electric VehiclesThe booming market for electric vehicles will significantly impact demand for copper over the next decade. Electric vehicles use a substantial amount of copper in their batteries, as well as in the windings and copper rotors used in electric motors. The metal is also required for busbars, used to connect modules and cells in battery packs, and in charging infrastructure. Big players like BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP  -  Free Report) and Glencore are likely to capitalize on the spike in demand in the future.Bottom LineAs you can see, there is no reason for not being optimistic about the industrial metals industry over the long haul.

The company’s shares have gained around 44.7% over this period, compared with roughly 37.9% gain recorded by the industry. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayArconic, in July, revised its full-year guidance on the back of higher volumes, higher aluminium prices and stronger net cost savings. The company now expects revenues in the range of $12.3–$12.7 billion (up from earlier view of $11.8–$12.4 billion) and adjusted earnings of $1.15–$1.20 per share (up from $1.10–$1.20 per share expected earlier) for 2017.Arconic is focusing on cost reduction and productivity improvements across its businesses, which should continue to lend support to its bottom line in the third quarter. Arconic achieved net cost savings of around 2% of revenues in first-half 2017.Arconic holds strong positions in attractive markets. The company is seeing healthy demand trends in the aerospace market and is actively pursuing its aerospace expansion strategy. It is well placed to gain from major contract wins in aerospace. Arconic is seeing strong momentum in commercial aero engines and sees a year over year increase in sales in second-half 2017.Arconic is also well placed to capture the growing demand for aluminum sheet stemming from the transition of the North American automotive industry to lightweighting. The company leverages its breakthrough Micromill technology that manufacture the most advanced aluminum sheet on the market.The company’s Global Rolled Products (GRP) segment is expected to continue to gain from strong automotive volumes in the to-be-reported quarter. Growth trend in automotive sheet is expected to sustain in the third quarter. However, Arconic is seeing lower sales in industrial gas turbine market due to weak market conditions.

Never fear, though — there are plenty of other firms pushing out Q2 earnings results in the meantime:Oil field services provider Halliburton (HAL  -  Free Report) posted 23 cents per share on quarterly revenues of $4.96 billion. Both numbers easily topped expectations of 19 cents per share and $4.84 billion in sales. Improved performance in both North and South America were cited as improvements in the company’s Q2, as was operating income in its Completion & Production segment, which swung to $397 million from a loss of $32 million this time a year ago. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is trading up 2.5% in today’s pre-market.Stanley Black & Decker (SWK  -  Free Report) also beat the Zacks consensus estimates on both top and bottom lines: $2.01 per share and $3.23 billion in revenues outperformed the $1.96 and $3.17 billion expected, respectively. This marks at least the fifth straight positive earnings surprise for the Zacks Rank #3 company, which also bumped up its guidance range for fiscal 2017 by a dime on both top and bottom ends.Toy-making giant Hasbro (HAS  -  Free Report) reported a mixed Q2 report this morning, beating the bottom-line estimate by 7 cents to 53 cents per share. Quarterly sales, however, narrowly missed the $973 million expected in the Zacks consensus. Yet franchise brand sales were up 21% year over year (these include popular brand names such as Monopoly, Transformers and My Little Pony), on quarterly sales up 10.6%.

Strength in the company’s largest brands — among them Wrangler jeans, The North Face, Timberland and Nautica — boosted the company’s fortunes in the quarter. VF Corp. also announced Executive Chairman Eric Wiseman will be stepping down as of late October, to be replaced by President & CEO Steven Rendle.Finally, a Q2 beat for Arconic (ARNC  -  Free Report) in both earnings and sales has come out this morning, reporting a 6-cent beat to 32 cents per share and $3.23 billion topping the $3.18 billion in revenues anticipated. The spin-off from Alcoa (AA  -  Free Report) in Q4 2016 also bumped up its 2017 EPS guidance from $1.15 per share to $1.20. The company appears to be on fairly sound footing considering the shakeup not only regarding the spin-off but the sudden departure of former CEO Klaus Kleinfeld this past spring.

The company has kept attributable copper production forecast for 2017 unchanged from the previous guidance of 40,000–60,000 tons.Newmont remains focused on investing in projects, explorations and transactions which can improve the company’s resources, reserves and margin. Its effort to reduce debt will also increase efficiency and cash flows. It will also provide the company with financial flexibility to fund high margin projects. The company is making a notable progress with its growth projects including the Tanami Expansion in Australia, and Subika Underground and Ahafo mill expansion in Africa.Newmont should also gain from its acquisition of Cripple Creek & Victor (CC&V) gold mine, which provides an opportunity for it to improve mine life. Also, the company believes that with this buyout it can add profitable gold production and save direct mining costs by up to 10% through enhanced productivity and optimization. Newmont expects gold production from CC&V to be between 400,000 and 450,000 ounces in 2017, at all-in sustaining costs (AISC) in the range of $730–$780.Newmont is also making notable progress with its cost and efficiency improvement programs, which should lend support to its June quarter results. Strong operational performance is also allowing the company to generate positive free cash flow.However, Newmont is exposed to a volatile gold price environment. An expected increase in unit costs in 2017 as reflected by the company’s guidance is also a concern. While Newmont reduced its gold AISC by 2% year over year to $912 per ounce in 2016, the company expects AISC to increase this year to between $940 and $1,000 per ounce. The increase is partly due to a shift in the allocation of cost between copper and gold production and higher investment in advanced project and exploration.Newmont Mining Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Newmont Mining Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Newmont Mining Corporation QuoteStocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies in the basic materials space you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Arconic Inc.

3500,ARNC,"Arconic Inc. (ARNC  -  Free Report), a global leader in multi-material, precision engineered products and solutions for a variety of industries, is slated to release its second-quarter 2017 results before the bell on Jul 24.Arconic’s adjusted earnings of 33 cents per share for the first quarter rose year over year and topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 25 cents. The company gained from its cost-saving actions in the quarter that more than offset unfavorable price and mix.Revenues went up 4.5% year over year to $3,192 million, also coming ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,017 million. Sales were driven by improved volumes across all segments.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Arconic is likely to beat estimates this quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.   Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Arconic is +11.11% as the Most Accurate Estimate is currently at 30 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 27 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Arconic holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Arconic Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Arconic Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Arconic Inc. QuoteFactors to ConsiderArconic’s shares got battered last month on reports that the company supplied flammable panels used at London's Grenfell Tower, the high-rise where at least 80 people died in a deadly fire that occurred on June 14. The company, on June 26, said that it is discontinuing the sales of the product, Reynobond PE, for use in high-rise applications in light of the tragedy. Its shares tumbled around 9% a day after the news, taking their total losses since the Grenfell Tower disaster to around 21%.Nevertheless, Arconic has outperformed the Zacks categorized Mining-Non Ferrous industry year to date. The company’s shares have gained around 35.5% over this period, compared with roughly 15.3% gain recorded by the industry.Arconic, in April, backed its guidance for full-year 2017. The company sees revenues in the range of $11.8 billion to $12.4 billion and adjusted earnings of $1.10 to $1.20 per share for 2017.The company also noted that it will remain focused on capital efficiency, growth actions, cost cutting and improving margin in 2017. Moreover, Arconic said that it is well placed in the aerospace market that is continuing its transition to new platforms.Arconic is focusing on cost reduction and productivity improvements across its businesses, which should continue to lend support to its bottom line in the second quarter. Arconic is targeting gross productivity of 4.5% to 5.5% of revenues and net savings of around 2% of revenues in 2017.Arconic holds strong positions in attractive markets. The company is seeing healthy demand trends in the aerospace market (accounts for roughly 40% of the company’s total revenues) and is actively pursuing its aerospace expansion strategy. It is well placed to gain from major contract wins in aerospace.Arconic is also well placed to capture the growing demand for aluminum sheet stemming from the transition of the North American auto industry to lightweighting. The company leverages its breakthrough Micromill technology that manufacture the most advanced aluminum sheet on the market. The company’s Global Rolled Products (GRP) segment is expected to continue to gain from strong automotive volumes in the June quarter. However, Arconic is witnessing softness across certain end-use markets. The company is seeing lower volumes in the heavy-duty truck and trailer market in North America that is affected by lower build rates. Weakness in this market is hurting commercial transportation revenues. The company’s move to ramp down production at its Tennessee packaging business may also have some impact on its revenues. Arconic plans to exit that business in 2018.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other companies in the basic materials space you may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Westlake Chemical Corporation (WLK  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +5.04% and a Zacks Rank #1.

The company should also gain from favorable demand for paint and coatings in most domestic markets.Last month, Sherwin-Williams wrapped up its $11.3 billion acquisition of Valspar, creating a premier global paints and coatings company.The Valspar acquisition allows Sherwin-Williams to reinforce its position as a leading paints and coatings provider globally leveraging highly complementary offerings, strong brands and technologies.Valspar is a strategic fit and the merger expands Sherwin-Williams’ brand portfolio and customer relationships in North America and bolsters its global finishes business. The buyout also significantly enhances Sherwin-Williams’ competitive profile.Sherwin-Williams expects to achieve $320 million in annual synergies within three years following the deal closure.

"
3504,ARNC,"It is perhaps way too early to draw any meaningful conclusions from the Q1 reports thus far. But relative to the low levels to which estimates had fallen ahead of the start of this earnings cycle, the actual reports are turning out to be less bad. It appears that the accelerated drop in earnings estimates over the last few months had conditioned market participants for a very weak showing this reporting cycle. And the actual results at this admittedly early stage are turning out to be simply ‘weak’, not ‘very weak’. This view explains the market’s favorable reaction to the otherwise underwhelming reports from J.P. Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Alcoa (AA), CSX Corp. (CSX  -  Free Report) and others.
"
3505,ARNC,"Including this morning’s reports, we now have Q1 results from 32 S&P 500 members. Total earnings for these 32 index members are down -6.8% from the same period last year on +0.9% higher revenues, with 71.9% beating EPS estimates and 53.1% coming ahead of top-line expectations.
"
3506,ARNC,"This is weaker earnings and revenue growth from these 32 index members than we have seen these same companies come out with in other recent reporting cycles. But we knew that already – no one expected growth to be anything but problematic in Q1; earnings growth was expected to be in the negative for the 4th quarter in a row. That said, positive surprises are relatively more numerous, though that could very well be either a function of depressed estimates or a small and unrepresentative sample size at this stage.
"
3507,ARNC,"The reporting cycle ramps up materially in the coming days, with a 100 S&P 500 index members reporting results next week, as you can see in the chart below of weekly schedule of Q1 results.
"
3508,ARNC,"For the 2016 Q1 earnings season as a whole, here are the 3 key points to keep in mind.
"
3509,ARNC," First, Q1 estimates followed the by-now familiar pattern of coming down as the quarter unfolded. Total S&P 500 earnings for the quarter are expected to be down -10.3% from the same period last year on -0.6% lower revenues, a sharp drop from what was expected at the start of the period. The chart below shows how growth expectations for the quarter have evolved since the start of the quarter.Second, not only is the magnitude of negative revisions that Q1 estimates suffered the largest compared to other recent quarters, but they are also broad-based and not just a function of Energy sector issues. The Energy sector’s estimates have unsurprisingly suffered the most, but the reality is that estimates for 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors have come down since the start of the period.
"
3510,ARNC,"The chart below reproduces the above revisions chart that shows the index’s Q1 earnings growth with and without the Energy sector.Third, the growth challenge is expected to continue into the following quarter as well, with total 2016 Q2 earnings for the S&P 500 index also currently expected to be in the negative. We know on past history that Q2 estimates will be coming down as companies report Q1 results share their outlook with analysts. As you can see in the chart below, all of this year’s growth is dependent on estimates for the back-half of the year.
"
3511,ARNC,"Part of the back-half improvement reflects an end to the Energy sector’s drag due to easier comparisons for that sector and consensus expectations of stabilization in oil prices going forward. But it’s not unusual for Wall Street analysts to be optimistic about the outer periods; they start out with a positive tone and start getting realistic only as the period gets nearer. If history is any guide, then we should see those back-half estimate start coming down in the coming months.

3525,ARNC,"Alcoa (AA) may no longer be as relevant to the U.S. economy and the stock market as it may have been at some stage in its long life. But the company’s name gets plenty of sunshine from the widely-held belief that its earnings report kick-stars each quarterly reporting cycle. Many in the market even see the company’s earnings report as a leading indicator of what to expect from the rest of corporate America. But that is most likely overstating the company’s bellwether status, notwithstanding aluminum’s significance to the automotive, aircraft manufacturing and construction end markets.
"
3526,ARNC,"The bottom line is that the relevance of Alcoa’s results and outlook is fairly limited; it doesn’t tell us much beyond what may be useful for the broader industrial metals space. Results the day after Alcoa’s report from railroad operator CSX Corp (CSX  -  Free Report) and industrial nuts-and-bolts supplier Fastenal (FAST  -  Free Report) have a lot more relevance to the economically sensitive parts of the U.S. economy. In total, we will get results 14 S&P 500 members this week, including all the money center banks.
"
3527,ARNC,"The chart below shows the weekly calendar of Q1 earnings reports for the S&P 500 index.
"
3528,ARNC,"Here are this week’s key earnings reportsMonday (4/11): Alcoa is the key report today after the close, with the company expected to earn 2 cents in EPS on $5.3 billion in revenues. Estimates have been under pressure given the commodity price headwinds, with the current EPS estimates one-third of what was expected three months back. The stock has responded negatively to recent earnings releases irrespective of whether the surprises were positive or otherwise.Tuesday (4/12): Fastenal is the key report in the morning while CSX Corp will report after the close. Fastenal is expected to earn 44 cents on $975 million in revenues compared to EPS of 43 cents on $953 million in revenues in the year-earlier quarter. CSX is expected to report 37 cents in EPS on $2.7 billion in revenues vs. 45 cents EPS on $3.02 billion in revenues in the year-earlier quarter. Estimates and the stock have been under pressure lately given headwinds from the weakness in coal and overall soft demand backdrop from the manufacturing sector.Wednesday (4/13): J.P. Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report) will report results before the market’s open, with the bank expected to earn $1.26 in EPS on $23.9 billion in revenues, which will compare to $1.45 in EPS on $24.1 billion in revenues in the 2015 quarter. J.P. Morgan shares are down almost -12% year to date on the back of the broadly unfavorable backdrop for the major banks (Finance has been the weakest performing sector of the market year to date).
"
3529,ARNC,"J.P. Morgan and its peers have been weighed down by the flattening yield curve, a weak capital markets and investment banking business as a result of heightened market volatility and rising estimates of provision expenses as a results of the Energy sector’s deteriorating credit profile. J.P. Morgan’s Q1 EPS estimate of $1.26 is down -17% from what was expected two months back. For the Finance sector as a whole, total Q1 earnings are expected to be down -10.7% on -4.7% lower revenues.Thursday (4/14): Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) are the key reports in the morning, while Delta Airlines (DAL  -  Free Report) reports after the close. Delta is expected to earn $1.29 in EPS on $9.24 billion in revenues vs. EPS of 44 cents on $9.4 billion in revenues in the year-earlier period.Friday (4/15): Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) is the key report in the morning, with the bank expected to earn $1.04 in EPS on $17.7 billion in revenues vs. $1.39 in EPS on $19.7 billion in revenues in the March 2015 period.
"
3530,ARNC,"Here are four key points to know about the Q1 earnings season.First, Q1 estimates fell sharply over the last three months and are continuing to come down. Total earnings for the quarter are expected to be down -11.1% on -2.3% lower revenues. Earnings growth is expected to be negative for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors, including Technology and Finance, the two largest in the index.Second, the negative earnings growth in Q1 will be the fourth quarter in a row of earnings declines for the S&P 500 index. The headwinds remain unchanged from other recent periods, essentially a combination of Energy sector weakness, the dollar strength and global growth constraints. Please note that Q1 earnings growth would still be in the negative even on an ex-Energy basis.Third, the magnitude of negative revisions that Q1 estimates suffered over the last three months has been the highest of all recent quarters in the comparable periods. Fresh weakness in oil prices at the start of the period was no doubt a big driver of pushing estimates down. But Energy isn’t the only sector that suffered negative revisions. In fact, estimates fell for 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors since the start of the period, with only two sectors (Utilities & Retail) experiencing modest positive revisions.  Fourth, the growth challenge isn’t restricted to Q1 or the preceding few quarters; it is actually no better for the current and following quarters either. Total 2016 Q2 earnings are currently expected to be down -5.5% on -2.1% lower revenues, a growth pace that will go down more in the coming days as companies report Q1 results and guide lower for Q2. All of this year’s growth has effectively evaporated, with the modest positive growth for 2016 as a whole entirely a function of current expectations for the last quarter of the year.The Ever Falling Estimates
"
3531,ARNC,"Estimates for 2016 Q1 started coming down at an accelerated pace as companies predominantly guided lower on the 2015 Q4 earnings calls, consistent with the trend we have been seeing for more than two years now. Total Q1 earnings for companies in the S&P 500 are currently expected to be down -11.1% from the same period last year, a material decline from the -1.1% decline expected at the start of the quarter.
"
3532,ARNC,"The table below presents the summary picture for 2016 Q1 contrasted with what companies actually reported in the 2015 Q4 earnings season.
"
3533,ARNC,"The chart below shows how estimates for 2016 Q1 have evolved since the quarter got underway. Please note that the magnitude of negative revisions for Q1 is the highest we have seen at comparable periods in other recent quarters, with the Energy sector as the biggest drag.
"
3534,ARNC,"The chart below shows current quarterly earnings growth expectations for the index 2016 Q1 and the following four quarters contrasted with actual declines in the preceding two quarters. As you can see, growth is expected to be negative in 2016 Q2 and barely in positive territory in the following quarter.Q1 Earnings Scorecard
"
3535,ARNC,"Alcoa’s claim to be the kick-starter of the earnings reporting cycle notwithstanding, the Q1 earnings season has already been underway for the last few weeks. The tally totals 22 S&P 500 members with fiscal quarters ending in February that have reported results already. Total earnings for these 22 index members are down -6.2% from the same period last year on +3.5% higher revenues, with 86.4% beating EPS estimates and 59.1% beating revenue estimates.
"
3536,ARNC,"The table below shows the current scorecard for these companies
"
3537,ARNC,"The charts below compare the results thus far with what we have been seeing from the same group of 22 index members in other recent periods.
"

3539,ARNC,"The 2016 Q1 earnings season takes center stage with Alcoa’s (AA) release after the close on Monday. Alcoa isn’t the overall first to report Q1 results, though it is the first S&P 500 member with a fiscal March quarter to come out with results. Companies with fiscal quarters ending in February have been reporting in recent days, with 15 such S&P 500 members having reported results already. All of these results form part of our 2016 Q1 tally.
"
3540,ARNC,"In fairness to Alcoa, market participants see the aluminum producer’s earnings report as the starting point of each reporting cycle even though the list of early reporters such bellwethers as FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report), Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) and others have already reported. In total, we will see results from 7 S&P 500 members the rest of this week, with 13 index members on deck to report results next week. The chart below shows the weekly calendar of Q1 earnings reports for the S&P 500 index.
"
3541,ARNC,"Here are four key points to know about this earnings season.First, estimates remain low, having fallen sharply over the last three months. Total earnings for the quarter are expected to be down -10.3% on -2% lower revenues and modestly higher margins. Earnings growth is expected to be negative for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors, including Technology and Finance, the two largest in the index.Second, the negative earnings growth in Q1 will be the fourth quarter in a row of earnings declines for the S&P 500 index. The headwinds remain unchanged from other recent periods, essentially a combination of Energy sector weakness, the dollar strength and global growth constraints. Please note that Q1 earnings growth would be in the negative even on an ex-Energy basis.Third, the magnitude of negative revisions that Q1 estimates suffered over the last three months has been the highest of all recent quarters in the comparable periods. Fresh weakness in oil prices at the start of the period was no doubt a big driver of pushing estimates down. But Energy isn’t the only sector that suffered negative revisions. In fact, estimates fell for 15 of the 16 Zacks sectors since the start of the period.  Fourth, the growth challenge isn’t restricted to Q1 or the preceding few quarters; it is actually no better for the current and following quarters either. Total 2016 Q2 earnings are currently expected to be down -5.4% on -2.1% lower revenues, a growth pace that will go down more in the coming days as companies report Q1 results and guide lower for Q2. All of this year’s growth has effectively evaporated, with the modest positive growth for 2016 as a whole entirely a function of current expectations for the last quarter of the year.The Ever Falling Estimates
"
3542,ARNC,"Estimates for 2016 Q1 started coming down at an accelerated pace as companies predominantly guided lower on the 2015 Q4 earnings calls, consistent with the trend we have been seeing for more than two years now. Total Q1 earnings for companies in the S&P 500 are currently expected to be down -10.3% from the same period last year, a material decline from the -1.1% decline expected at the start of the quarter.
"
3543,ARNC,"The table below presents the summary picture for 2016 Q1 contrasted with what companies actually reported in the 2015 Q4 earnings season.
"
3544,ARNC,"The chart below shows how estimates for 2016 Q1 have evolved since the quarter got underway. Please note that the magnitude of negative revisions for Q1 is the highest we have seen at comparable periods in other recent quarters, with the Energy sector as the biggest drag.
"
3545,ARNC,"The chart below shows current quarterly earnings growth expectations for the index 2016 Q1 and the following four quarters contrasted with actual declines in the preceding two quarters. As you can see, growth is expected to be negative in 2016 Q2 and barely in positive territory in the following quarter.Q1 Earnings Scorecard
"
3546,ARNC,"As mentioned earlier, we have seen Q1 results from 15 S&P 500 members already (all of these companies have fiscal quarters ending in February). Total earnings for these 15 index are members are down -8.1% from the same period last year on +2.3% higher revenues, with 86.7% beating EPS estimates and 60% beating revenue estimates.
"
3547,ARNC,"The table below shows the current scorecard for these companies.
"
3548,ARNC,"The charts below compare the results thus far with what we have been seeing from the same group of 15 index members in other recent periods.

"
3551,ARNC,"The ramp up of the Q4 earnings season in the coming days will put the spotlight on the weak state of corporate profitability. Total earnings for the S&P 500 index expected to be below the year-earlier level in Q4 – the third quarter in a row of earnings declines. The Energy sector is again the big drag, but there is not much offsetting growth elsewhere either, with earnings growth expectations for 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors in the negative for the quarter.
"
3552,ARNC,"The New Year has brought back the market’s China fears, which was a growth market for many U.S. and European companies. We will likely hear a lot about China on the Q4 earnings calls, particularly from companies are heavily dependent on that market for growth.
"
3553,ARNC,"Our takeaway on this question, at the end of the Q3 earnings season, was that quality consumer-oriented operators didn’t seem to have much problems in China; we saw that with Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report), Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) and others. Given recent doubts about Apple’s growth, it will be interesting to hear what they have to say about China, which has become a growing piece of their revenue stream lately. Also related to the China question is the outlook for oil and other commodity markets that have really been suffering lately. On top of these headwinds, we have the U.S. dollar issue, which has been a recurring theme in recent earnings seasons and will most likely be making another appearance this earnings season well.
"
3554,ARNC,"The only positive in this otherwise unsettling backdrop is the U.S. economic outlook, which has started showing a lot more momentum in the areas that really matter – consumers and households. The very strong December jobs report and positive revisions to the prior two-month’s data, not to mention steady improvements in wages, gives the economy’s core enough thrust to offset the ongoing weakness in the manufacturing and export sectors. While this is a net positive for the consumer-facing sectors, it also means that the Fed will likely come up with the next hike in its ‘gradual’ tightening cycle during the March meeting.Q4 Earnings Calendar
"
3555,ARNC,"The Q4 earnings season has actually gotten underway, with results from 21 S&P 500 already out (all of these companies have fiscal quarters ending in November that form part of our Q4 tally). Alcoa (AA) is the first index member with the more common December fiscal quarter to report quarterly results; it reports after the close on Monday January 11th. Overall, we have 12 index members reporting Q4 results next week, which includes J.P. Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and others.  
"
3556,ARNC,"The chart below shows weekly schedule for how Q4 results will come out.Expectations for Q4 & Beyond
"
3557,ARNC,"Total S&P 500 earnings in Q4 are expected to be down -7.4% from the same period last year on -4.7% lower revenues in Q4, with 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to see an earnings decline from the year-earlier period. Earnings growth for the index would still be in the negative even if exclude the Energy sector drag from the aggregate picture.
"
3558,ARNC,"Estimates came down as the quarter unfolded, in-line with the trend that we have been seeing quarter after quarter for almost three years now. But the magnitude of negative revisions to Q4 earnings estimates was greater than what we saw in the comparable periods for the preceding two quarters.

3559,ARNC,"The chart below shows what has happened to 2015 Q4 earnings estimates for S&P 500 companies since the start of the quarter.
"
3560,ARNC,"The picture isn’t expected to improve in any meaningful way in the coming quarters either, with 2016 Q1 earnings growth currently expected to be down -1.5% from the same period last year. But as we have seen in other recent periods, including in Q4, we will likely see those growth expectations go down further in the coming days as companies report Q4 results and provide weak guidance for Q1 and beyond.
"
3561,ARNC,"The growth picture is expected to improve notably in the second half of the year, with the growth pace accelerating towards the end of the year. Part of the back-half improvement reflects an end to the Energy sector’s drag due to easier comparisons for that sector. But it’s not unusual Wall Street analysts to be optimistic about the outer periods; they start out with a positive tone and start getting realistic only as the period gets nearer. If history is any guide, then we should see those back-half estimates start coming down in the coming months.The Q4 Earnings Season Gets Going

3562,ARNC,"The Alcoa report typically gets the credit for kick-starting each earnings cycle. But the reporting season actually gets underway weeks prior to the Alcoa release. That is the case for the Q4 earnings season as well, with earnings reports from 21 S&P 500 members already on the books. All of these 21 reports are from companies that have fiscal quarters ending in November, which we count as part of our Q4 tally. In fairness to Alcoa, it is the first index member with a calendar fiscal quarter to come out with earnings results.

But the reporting cycle will really ramp up the following week with more than 40 index members coming out with quarterly results.
"
3587,ARNC,"The chart below shows the weekly summary reporting calendar for companies in the S&P 500 index.
"
3588,ARNC,"Here are some of next week’s key earnings reportsAlcoa (AA): After the market’s close on Monday January 11th, Alcoa is expected to report 4 cents in EPS on $5.2 billion in revenues, which would compare to 33 cents in EPS on $6.4 billion in revenues in the year-earlier quarter. Estimates have been under pressure given the commodity price headwinds, with the current EPS estimates one-third of what was expected three months back.CSX Corp (CSX  -  Free Report): CSX Corp. is expected to report after the close on Tuesday January 12th, with the railroad operator expected to report 46 cents in EPS on $2.9 billion in revenues vs. 49 cents EPS on $3.19 billion in revenues in the year-earlier quarter. Headwinds from weakness in coal and an overall soft demand backdrop from manufacturing has put pressure on the stocks estimates of late.J.P. Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report): J.P. Morgan will report Q4 results before the market’s open on Thursday January 14th, with the bank expected to earn $1.30 in EPS on $23.1 billion in revenues, which will compare to $1.19 in EPS on $22.5 billion in revenues in the 2014 quarter. The largest and best-run bank remains well positioned to the long-awaited improvement net-interest margins following the Fed lift-off.Intel (INTC  -  Free Report): Intel reports after the market’s close on Thursday January 14th, with the company expected to earn 63 cents in EPS on $14.8 billion in revenues vs. 66 cents in EPS on $14.7 billion in revenues in the December 2014 quarter. Intel shares underperformed the Technology sector in 2015 as the company continued to struggle to due to headwinds in the PC business, offsetting momentum in the data-center group. The stock has responded favorably the last few positive earnings surprises, but management’s outlook for these core businesses will set the stage for its performance in 2016.Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) will be reporting before the market’s open on Friday January 15th. Of the two reports, the Citi report will be more interesting given easy comparisons and the room for positive surprises.What is expected for Q4?
"
3589,ARNC,"Total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be down -7.3% from the same period last year on -4.6% lower revenues, the third straight quarter of earnings declines for the index.
"
3590,ARNC,"While Energy remains the big drag, as it has been in other recent quarters, the weakness is broad-based, with 13 of the 16 sectors expected to suffer earnings declines. Total earnings for the Energy sector are expected be down -67.4% on -37.1% lower revenues. Excluding Energy, earnings growth for the S&P 500 would still be in the negative (down -2% on -0.3% lower revenues).
"
3591,ARNC,"The table below provides a summary picture of Q4 expectations contrasted with what was actually achieved in the preceding quarter.
"
3592,ARNC,"Please note that the growth picture is actually even weaker once Finance’s respectable-looking +6.5% growth in Q4 is adjusted for the easy comparisons at Citigroup. Excluding Citigroup, the Finance sector’s growth effectively becomes flat.Bigger Drop in Q4 Estimates
"
3593,ARNC,"As has been the practice in recent quarters, the overwhelmingly negative tone of company guidance drove down expectations for the quarter. The chart below does a good job of showing the evolving Q4 earnings expectations over the last few months.
"
3594,ARNC,"The trend of negative revisions to Q4 estimates is right along the lines of what we have been seeing repeatedly in other recent periods. But the magnitude of negative revisions that Q4 estimates suffered is bigger than what we saw in other recent quarters in the comparable period. In other words, estimates for Q4 fell more in the three months since the start of the quarter than the comparable periods of other recent periods.What could be behind the acceleration in the negative revisions trend for Q4?
"
3595,ARNC,"A big part of the explanation comes from the Energy sector, with oil prices making a fresh move down since October 1st. The weakness in oil (as well as natural gas) prices have been weighting on Energy sector earnings estimates since the start of the quarter, with earnings for the sector now expected to be down –67.4%, which compares to the –62.5% decline expected on October 1st.
"
3596,ARNC,"Other factors weighing on the earnings picture this year - from the strong U.S. dollar to global growth worries - remained in place in Q4 as well.  Looking Beyond 2015 Q4

3598,ARNC,"As you can see above, the negative growth trend carries into the first quarter of the New Year, with total earnings for the quarter currently expected to be down -0.7% from the same period last year. Going by recent history, we can say with a lot of confidence that the -0.7% decline in Q1 will most likely get bigger in the coming days as companies report Q4 results and guide lower; the -7.3% decline in Q4 earnings is down from -1.1% decline expected at the start of the quarter in early October.
"
3599,ARNC,"The growth trend is expected to pick up in the back half of the year, with growth really accelerating in the last quarter of the year. The relatively optimistic looking expectations for the outer periods aren’t unusual – Wall Street analysts always tend to be more optimistic about the future. But estimates start coming down as the period in question comes closer. The erosion of 2015 growth estimates was driven largely by what happened to the Energy sector. But estimates for other sectors came down as well……………and we will likely see something similar to current 2016 estimates too.

"
3602,ARNC,"Earnings growth has been fairly weak in recent quarters. In fact, earnings growth was negative for the S&P 500 index in each of the last two earnings seasons. The picture isn’t expected to improve in the Q4 earnings season either, with current Q4 growth expectations the weakest of any other recent period at the comparable stage. The chart below compares current Q4 growth expectations with what was expected for the preceding four quarters at the start of each reporting cycle.
"
3603,ARNC,"A big part of the weakness has no doubt been a result of developments in the oil segment. Yet, the growth challenge isn’t solely due to just the Energy sector, there is not much offsetting growth momentum from other sectors either.
"
3604,ARNC,"Total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be down -7.3% from the same period last year on -3.3% lower revenues in Q4, with 12 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to see earnings decline from the year-earlier period. Earnings growth for the index would still be in the negative even if exclude the Energy sector drag from the aggregate picture.
"
3605,ARNC,"Estimates came down as the quarter unfolded, in-line with the trend that we have been seeing quarter after quarter for almost three years now. But the magnitude of negative revisions to Q4 earnings estimates is greater than what we seen in the comparable periods for the preceding two quarters.

"
3625,ARNC,"    Industrial metals are the building blocks of an economy. Remember, Alcoa Inc. (AA) symbolically kick-starts the earnings season every quarter. At present, even though concerns over China’s future growth have added an element of uncertainly to the outlook, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the industrial metals industry over the long term.
"
3626,ARNC,"    Here we discuss some of the key reasons and what investors in the industrial metals sector can look forward to in the coming months and years:Strong Demand in Automotive & Aerospace
"
3627,ARNC,"    On the demand side, aluminum consumption is expected to improve on a global basis, spurred by the automotive and packaging industries, the key end-markets. The automobile market is becoming increasingly aluminum-intensive, given the metal's recyclability and light-weight properties. Automakers consumed a record amount of aluminum last year as plummeting prices and technological breakthroughs made it a viable alternative to steel.
"
3628,ARNC,"    The global push to improve fuel efficiency in vehicles is expected to more than double the demand for aluminum in the auto industry by 2025. In line with this, Alcoa has completed an expansion at its Tennessee facility dedicated to supplying aluminum sheet to automakers like Ford Motor Co. (F  -  Free Report), General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. (FCAU  -  Free Report).
"
3629,ARNC,"    The airline industry is also expected to boost demand for the metal. Alcoa recently clinched two multi-year supply contracts with The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) worth more than $2.5 billion. Under one contract, which is Alcoa's largest fastener deal ever, the company will supply multi-material fastening systems for every Boeing platform including 777X and 787 Dreamliner.
"
3630,ARNC,"    Under the second deal, Alcoa will supply ready-to-install titanium seat track assemblies for the entire 787 Dreamliner family of airplanes. The agreements build on Alcoa's 2014 aluminum sheet and plate deal with Boeing worth more than $1 billion. With that landmark deal, Alcoa became Boeing’s sole supplier of wing skins on all of its metallic structure airplanes.
"
3631,ARNC,"    Alcoa also has big aerospace deals with Airbus and Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report), both inked in Oct 2015. Alcoa cut a $1 billion deal with the French aircraft manufacturer Airbus to supply titanium, steel and nickel-based superalloy aerospace fastening systems. Alcoa also won a contract worth roughly $1.1 billion to supply titanium for Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (“JSF”) program. The contract makes Alcoa the titanium supplier for airframe structures for all three variants of the F-35 from 2016 through 2024.
"
3632,ARNC,"    To capitalize on the lucrative aerospace market, Alcoa acquired RTI International, which broadened its titanium offerings and added advanced technologies and materials to its portfolio. Moreover, the buyout of U.K.-based leading jet engine components maker Firth Rixson has placed Alcoa to capture additional growth in the growing aerospace market through a broad spectrum of high-growth, value-add jet engine components.
"
3633,ARNC,"    In addition, the acquisition of Germany-based leading provider of titanium and aluminum structural castings – Tital – has strengthened Alcoa’s position to leverage strong growth in the commercial aerospace sector and capture rising demand for advanced jet engine components made of titanium.
"
3634,ARNC,"    Following China, which accounts for over 40% of the global aluminum consumption, India holds promise given its current low level of aluminum consumption and high urban population growth. With demand being strong and the industry pulling the reins on supply, the aluminum market is likely to witness supply deficits for a prolonged period, thereby creating a supportive backdrop for high aluminum prices.
"
3635,ARNC,"     Pickup in Economic Activity to Drive Copper Demand
"
3636,ARNC,"    Copper is a major industrial metal playing a particularly important role in emerging countries. Given its varied applications, the trends in the copper market are often considered useful indicators of the state of the global economy.
"
3637,ARNC,"    Developments in the world economy are strongly correlated with movements in copper prices. Trends in Chinese GDP growth and world trade play a major role. Given that China accounts for the largest share of global copper consumption (around 46%) by far, and also has a large share in the total production of pure copper (around 34%), correlation of the metal with China is a key factor.
"
3638,ARNC,"    The near-term outlook for China has been an overriding concern for the global markets and the situation isn’t expected to stabilize in the near term. But in the long run, expectations of a rising middle class in Asia, particularly in India and China, who will spend more on consumer goods such as air conditioners and refrigerators in the years to come, will spur demand for copper. Rio Tinto plc (RIO  -  Free Report) and BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP  -  Free Report) are planning to mine millions of additional tons of copper, despite the threat of an oversupplied market for the next few years.
"
3639,ARNC,"    The economic outlook for 2015 is upbeat for the U.S. while the European economy is recovering slowly on the back of stimulus. In China, the authorities renewed their pledge to arrest the decline in the economy and stimulate growth. Overall, as the global economic scenario improves, copper as well as other industrial metals will move in tandem.Rebound in Construction
"
3640,ARNC,"    The housing and construction sector is the largest consumer of steel today and consequently of iron ore. Building construction (pipes and wires) is also the largest market for copper. An uptrend has been noticed in real estate activity, like new home starts and construction spends, in the U.S. over the past few quarters.
"
3641,ARNC,"    The U.S. Architecture Billings Index (ABI), an economic indicator that provides an approximately nine-to-twelve-month glimpse into the future of non-residential construction spending activity, is reflecting healthy and sustained demand for design services in nearly all non-residential project types. The American Institute of Architects (AIA) has remained above 50 for most part of 2015, which indicates an increase in billings.
"
3642,ARNC,"    Long-stalled construction projects are being renewed. Moreover, easier access to credit from lending institutions along with an increasing comfort level in the overall economy has helped revitalize the commercial real estate sector in recent months. Requirement for emerging projects, such as education facilities and government buildings, is also creating demand in the sector.
"
3643,ARNC,"    In the long term, as the urban population increases worldwide, so will the need for steel to build skyscrapers and public-transport infrastructure. Emerging economies will also continue to be major demand drivers to support increasing urbanization and industrialization. The demand for iron ore is thus expected to remain strong in the years to come. Hence, a rebound in construction bodes well for the iron ore and copper industries.Rectifying the Aluminum Demand-Supply Imbalance
"
3644,ARNC,"    After aluminum prices bore the brunt of chronic surplus, the global aluminum industry went underwent substantial changes to correct the supply-demand picture. This will eventually lead to firm prices. The world’s second largest aluminum producer, RUSAL’s production fell 7% year on year to a record low of 3.6 million metric tons in 2014 as the company reduced production at seven smelters during the year in an attempt to improve the global supply and demand balance. RUSAL is considering further aluminium capacity production cuts of some 200,000 tons in 2015.
"
3645,ARNC,"    Likewise, Alcoa undertook a number of restructuring measures (including closure of smelters) in the past two years and is aggressively pursuing cost-cutting actions. Alcoa plans to curtail 373,000 metric tons of smelting capacity in the U.S. Alcoa has been aggressively reshaping its Upstream portfolio as part of a successful multi-year strategy to position itself as a low-cost global leader in alumina and aluminum production. The company is on track to meet its 38th percentile target on the global aluminum cash cost curve in 2016.Bottom Line
"
3646,ARNC,"    As you can see, there is no reason for not being optimistic about the industrial metals industry over the long haul. But what about investing in the space right now?
"
3647,ARNC,"    Check out our latest Industrial Metals Outlook here for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective, and how the trend is shaping up for this sector going forward.
"
3648,ARNC,"    For the industrial metals industry, demand will remain strong in the years to come given their varied uses. While industrial metals would gain from healthy momentum in Automotive and recovery in the Construction space, the industry remains saddled by a number of headwinds.
"
3649,ARNC,"    Below, we have discussed some of the key reasons and what investors in the industrial metals sector should be wary of in the coming months as well as over the long term:
"
3650,ARNC,"     The Perennial Problem of the Industry – OversupplyIron: The threat of oversupply continues to plague the industry as major iron ore producers, Rio Tinto plc (RIO  -  Free Report), BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP  -  Free Report), Vale S.A (VALE  -  Free Report) and Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. have ramped up production. They intend to continue exploring for iron ore in Australia despite lower growth forecasts from China and weaker iron ore prices, betting on continued strength in iron ore demand over the long term. Hence, Australia, the world's top exporter of iron ore, will rev up its shipments.
"
3651,ARNC,"    The surging output is already overwhelming Chinese demand growth, leading to a supply glut. Iron exports from Brazil, the second largest exporter, have risen as a result of Vale increasing its production. Vale, which alone contributes almost 85% of Brazil’s iron ore, will continue to increase its iron output.
"
3652,ARNC,"    In case this excess supply is not matched by adequate demand, it will expose the market to a risk of further price declines. Excess supply over demand, economic downturn in China and severe rivalry between mining giants will keep iron ore prices subdued. Weakening market prices of iron ore continue to hurt miners’ aggregate revenues and margins.Aluminium: Alcoa Inc. (AA) now expects global aluminum markets to be in a surplus of 551,000 tons in 2015. Rusal raised its forecast for a global aluminium surplus this year to 373,000 tons from an earlier estimate of 277,000 tons.Copper: The International Copper Study Group (ICSG) expects the market should remain balanced, while in 2016 a small deficit of around 130,000 tons is likely as demand growth outpaces production growth. Earlier, at its April meeting, ICSG had guided a surplus of 360,000 tons and 230,000 tons for 2015 and 2016, respectively. Although a downward revision has been made to global usage in view of lower–than-anticipated growth in China, larger downward adjustments have been made to production as a result of recent announcements of production cuts.
"
3653,ARNC,"    While some companies are announcing production cuts, Rio Tinto and BHP (separately and in joint ventures) plan to mine millions of additional tons of copper. They are amassing vast copper holdings to capture a greater chunk of the $140 billion global market in a bid to eventually squeeze out high-cost producers just as they did in the global iron ore business.Slowdown in China
"
3654,ARNC,"    Demand in China that alone accounts for a major portion of the industrial metal demand has slowed down due to the country's tepid property market and weaker infrastructure investment growth. China’s economic growth has cast a shadow on investors' view of commodities demand and, as a result, brought down demand for metals, leading to price weakness.
"
3655,ARNC,"    China’s GDP in the third quarter slowed down to a six-year low to 6.9%, lower than the 7% growth in the first half of the year despite repeated interest rate cuts and other stimulus measures. It was the slowest since the 6.2% recorded in the first quarter of 2009 during the global recession. Analysts have slashed their forecasts for China's growth over the next three years amid broadening pessimism over the health of the world's second largest economy.
"
3656,ARNC,"    The Caixin Manufacturing PMI in China was at 48.6 in November this year, up from 48.3 in October. Even though the reading was the highest since April, it remained below 50 for the ninth straight month. In November, output stabilized and ended its sixth month sequence of reduction while total new business declined at the same pace as in the prior month.
"
3657,ARNC,"     Eurozone Worries Persist
"
3658,ARNC,"    The European economy has not recovered enough, as evident from meager Eurozone GDP growth. GDP in the euro area expanded 0.3% in the third quarter of 2015 compared with 0.4% expansion in the previous period, the lowest performance in a year. Germany and France, which together make up a significant part of Eurozone's GDP, grew 0.3% each. GDP growth rate in the euro area averaged 0.36% from 1995 until 2015.
"
3659,ARNC,"     A Stronger U.S. Dollar
"
3660,ARNC,"    Base metals, as commodities, move in opposite directions to the dollar. Both markets remain closely linked to each other as every turn in the dollar is either followed by, or coincides with, a turn in the price of commodities. The strengthening of the dollar has led to a drop in industrial metals’ prices. The interest rate hike has made the dollar stronger which does not bode well for industrial metal prices.
"
3661,ARNC,"     Falling Oil Prices
"
3662,ARNC,"    The slump in oil prices to five-year lows had a visible impact on industrial metal prices. A sharp and sustained drop in oil is generally associated with declining sales and prices of other commodities. The entire commodities sector may be impacted negatively in the wake of the current oil price carnage.Bottom Line
"
3663,ARNC,"    Global uncertainties and oversupply conditions of base metals are some of the sector’s worst detractors.  But what about investing in the space right now; are there opportunities for short-term investors overriding the headwinds?
"
3664,ARNC,"    Check out our latest Industrial Metals Industry Outlook here for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective, and how the trend is looking for this important sector of the economy now.
"
3665,ARNC,"2015 will go down in history as one of the worst years for industrial metals, which are trading near their multiyear lows. The slowest pace of economic growth in 25 years in China, the world’s top metals consumer, has dragged the industrial metals market along with it.
"
3666,ARNC,"Moreover, the interest rate hike gave a boost to the dollar, which makes dollar-denominated commodities like base metals expensive, bringing them lower. To stay afloat, mining companies have been cutting costs, slashing dividends and production, and selling assets.Iron
"
3667,ARNC,"Iron ore prices have been in a free fall, losing 43% so far this year. This was due to a weaker Chinese steel market and surging supplies from big miners like BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP  -  Free Report), Rio Tinto plc (RIO  -  Free Report) and Vale S.A. (VALE  -  Free Report). Prices of the metal sank below the level of $40 in December for the first time since spot prices were introduced in 2008.
"
3668,ARNC,"BHP Billiton posted its worst underlying profit in a decade, Vale reported a loss per share of 19 cents for the third quarter while Rio Tinto suffered an unceremonious drop of 42.9% in underlying earnings for the first half of fiscal 2015. Macroeconomic issues such as the recession in China, Greece debt negotiations and weak prices of commodities in the global mining industry were responsible for dismal results across the board.
"
3669,ARNC,"Notwithstanding low prices, Vale reported record iron ore production in the third quarter and aspires to mine between 340 million and 350 million metric tons of iron next year. BHP Billiton’s iron ore production for the September quarter increased 7% to a record 61 metric tons and its guidance for fiscal 2016 remains at 247 metric tons. Rio Tinto hiked its production in the quarter by 12% and expects to ship around 340 million tons of iron from its operations in Australia and Canada.Aluminum
"
3670,ARNC,"Falling oil prices took a toll on aluminum prices as the metal belongs to an energy intensive industry. Further, growing exports from China and oversupply in different regions exerted pressure on aluminum prices. In the third quarter, London Metals Exchange (“LME”) aluminium price tumbled to a six-year low of $1,589 per ton.
"
3671,ARNC,"Alcoa Inc.’s (AA) profits for the third quarter sank roughly 70% year over year while Russian aluminium giant RUSAL reported an 11% drop in third-quarter core earnings, hurt by lower metal prices. Alcoa reiterated its expectation of 6.5% global aluminum demand growth for 2015. RUSAL cut its 2015 demand growth forecast to 5.6% due to weaker-than-expected demand in some emerging markets.
"
3672,ARNC,"The aluminum price rout has also triggered Alcoa’s move to separate its smelting and refining business from those that cater to rapidly growing aerospace and automotive markets. The transaction, which is subject to specific conditions including final approval by Alcoa’s board, is expected to close in second-half 2016.Copper
"
3673,ARNC,"Concerns about Chinese economic growth rates, apprehensions surrounding Europe, continued U.S. dollar strength and weakness in commodity prices put pressure on copper prices during 2015. Demand in China, which accounts for over 45% of copper consumption, has been affected by soft export demand for electronics, a weak construction market and slow progress on implementing investment in electric grid infrastructure. Copper prices are hovering around its worst levels since 2009.
"
3674,ARNC,"After suffering its third straight quarterly loss, copper miner, Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX  -  Free Report), announced plans to defer investments in various long-term projects and also trimmed capital spending to $1.8 billion in 2016 and $1.2 billion in 2017. Moreover, Freeport has suspended its annual dividend to save cash amid a weak commodity price environment.
"
3675,ARNC,"In the wake of low prices, Freeport plans to reduce copper production by 350 million pounds, mainly due to the closure of its Sierrita mine in Arizona. Glencore Plc (GLNCY  -  Free Report) stated that it would reduce its copper production by 455,000 tons by the end of 2017. Anglo-American Plc (AAUKY) is undergoing a major restructuring by selling assets and closing mines. Meanwhile, Codelco has restated it would push ahead with its annual target of producing 1.6 million to 1.7 million metric tons this year and the next.Industry Ranking & Outlook – Positive on Iron, Neutral on Aluminium, Copper
"
3676,ARNC,"Within the Zacks Industry classification, the iron mining and non-ferrous mining industries (aluminum, copper, etc.) are grouped under the Basic Materials sector (one of 16 Zacks sectors). We rank the 257 industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in each industry. This ranking is available on the Zacks Industry Rank page.
"
3677,ARNC,"The way to align the ranking and outlook from the complete list of Zacks Industry Rank for the 257+ companies is that the outlook for the top one-third of the list (Zacks Industry Rank of #86 and lower) is positive, the middle one-third (Zacks Industry Rank between #87 and #173) is neutral, while the outlook for the bottom one-third (Zacks Industry Rank #174 and higher) is negative.
"
3678,ARNC,"The iron mining industry features in the top tier with a Zacks Rank of #60, garnering a positive outlook while the non-ferrous mining industry is in the mid tier with a Zacks Rank of #100, indicating a neutral outlook.Sector Level Earnings TrendQ3 Earnings Scorecard, Projection for Future Quarters
"
3679,ARNC,"Performance of the Basic Materials sector was disappointing with an 18.5% decline in the third quarter. Though the sector is expected to somewhat recover in the fourth quarter, it will remain in negative territory with a 7.5% drop.
"
3680,ARNC,"The scenario will remain stagnant in the first half of 2016, with a 7.7% decline projected for the first quarter, which will worsen further to a drop of 13.3% in the second quarter. However, a dramatic improvement is prophesied for the third with 19.4% growth. (For a detailed look at the earnings outlook for this sector and others, please read our Earnings Trends report.)
"
3681,ARNC," What’s in Store?Iron: The threat of oversupply remains for the iron ore industry as major producers continue to ramp up production. Per the World Steel Association, global apparent steel use is expected to slow considerably, with a decline of 1.7% projected for 2015 and meager growth of 0.7% for 2016. Chinese steel use will decline 3.5% in 2015 and 2% in 2016.
"
3682,ARNC,"China is the largest consumer of iron ore, accounting for around 60% of the global seaborne market. Thus, the mismatch between excess supply and demand will keep iron ore prices subdued and analysts apprehend that prices for the steel-making ingredient will stay under $40 a ton for the next few years.Aluminum: Aluminum prices will remain under pressure given the oversupply of the metal in the market. However, the automotive, packaging and airline industries are expected to support demand. India appears promising given its current low level of aluminum consumption and high urban population growth. With demand being strong, the industry needs to pull the reins on supply, which will lead to deficits for a prolonged period and create the ground for higher aluminum prices going forward.Copper: Major low-cost producers continue to sell even as prices fall, in a bid to force the high-cost producers out of the market, as prices of copper fall below their cost of production. Eventually, when the markets will recover, the dominant producers, given their increased market share, will be in a position to make even more profits during the next bull market.
"
3683,ARNC,"A weak global economic landscape, increased supply and a strong dollar are all contributing to the persistent bearishness in the copper market. Notwithstanding the current volatility in prices, we have a long-term bullish stance on copper, supported by its widespread use in transportation, manufacturing and construction, limited supplies from existing mines and the absence of new significant development projects.To Sum Up
"
3684,ARNC,"Overall, industrial metal prices will remain depressed until the supply glut is eased by production cuts. Moreover, a stronger dollar will keep prices in check. We expect slashing of capital expenditure, suspension of operations and cost saving initiatives to be in the cards. All of these factors, along with a recovery in the Chinese economy, will revive the industry.

3687,ARNC,"With the Q3 earnings season now effectively behind us, the focus will shift in the coming days to the 2015 Q4 earnings season as companies with fiscal quarters ending in November start coming out with results. This week’s earnings reports from AutoZone (AZO  -  Free Report), Costco (COST  -  Free Report) and Adobe (ADBE  -  Free Report) all fall in this category and will form part of the initial Q4 earnings tally. In fact, by the time Alcoa (AA) reports on January 11th, we will have seen Q4 results from about two dozen S&P members that have fiscal quarters ending in November.
"
3688,ARNC,"Estimates for the current period have come down quite a bit since the quarter got underway, in-line with the trend that we have been seeing quarter after quarter for almost three years now. Total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be down -6.5% from the same period last year, the third straight quarter of earnings declines for the index. The current -6.5% decline in Q4 earnings is down from an expected decline of -1.1% in mid-September. The magnitude of negative revisions to Q4 earnings estimates is greater than what we saw in the comparable periods for the preceding two quarters.
"
3689,ARNC,"The chart below shows what has happened to 2015 Q4 earnings estimates for S&P 500 companies since the start of the quarter.
"
3690,ARNC,"The chart below shows the current Zacks consensus earnings growth expectations for the coming 4 quarters as well as the same for 2015 Q3 (shaded orange), and the actual growth achieved in the first two quarters of the year. As you can see, this year’s growth has effectively evaporated, with growth momentum expected to pick up in 2016 Q2 and accelerate in the following quarters.
"
3691,ARNC,"Part of the stronger looking growth in the second half of 2016 reflects an end to the Energy sector’s drag due to easier comparisons for that sector. But hopes remain high for actual growth as well, particularly from the Finance and some of the economically sensitive sectors. It is reasonable to be skeptical of next year’s optimistic looking expectations given how the 2015 estimates evaporated in front of our eyes over the last two quarters. May be it will be different this time. But judging from what we have heard from management teams on the Q3 earnings calls in recent days, it is more than reasonable not to buy into these estimates.The Q3 Scorecard
"
3692,ARNC,"Results from three S&P 500 index members are still awaited at this stage, but total earnings for those that have reported are down -2.4% on -3.9% lower revenues, with 65.1% beating EPS estimates and only 39.2% coming ahead of top-line expectations. Excluding Energy, total earnings for the rest of the index members that have reported would be up +4.1% on +1.1% higher revenues.
"
3693,ARNC,"The charts below compare the Q3 growth rates and beat ratios for these companies with what this same group of companies reported in other recent quarters.
"
3694,ARNC,"Any way you look at it, this is a weak performance from these index members relative to what we have seen from this same cohort in other recent periods. Please note that the earnings growth rate is actually even lower once the easy comparisons at Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) are taken into account.
"
3695,ARNC,"The charts below present the growth picture after stripping out the Energy and Bank of America results from the aggregate numbers.
"
3696,ARNC,"As you can see, the growth picture modestly improves once the Energy sector is excluded from the index, but it is still weaker relative to other recent periods. The top-line weakness is particularly notable, both with respect to growth rate as well as beat ratios.
"
3697,ARNC,"The lack of revenue growth didn’t come as much of surprise given the well-known macro headwinds like global growth worries and the strong U.S. dollar. But the fact that so few companies have been able to beat the lowered top-line estimates has been a big disappointment.

"
3712,ARNC,"Global growth worries have been a recurring theme in market discourse lately. But the focus of these worries was primarily on uncertainty about China and other emerging economies. Even the Fed cited these global growth challenges as a key reason for not announcing interest rate increases at the last FOMC meeting. While questions remained about the timing of the first interest rate increase, which a number of Fed officials indicated will arrive at the one of the two remaining meetings this year, there was no doubt about the state of the U.S. economy. In the consensus narrative, the U.S. economy stood as a pillar of strength and stability in an otherwise unsettled world.
"
3713,ARNC,"That favorable narrative about the U.S. economy took a body blow with the September non-farm payroll report that shows the economy losing steam during the Summer months. Estimates for third quarter GDP growth have been steadily coming down lately, with the Atlanta Fed’s (almost) real-time measure of the economy currently pegging Q3 GDP growth at only +0.9% -- and that was prior to the jobs disappointment.
"
3714,ARNC,"It could all be just a temporary setback caused by inventory unwind (heavy inventory build in Q2 needs to be worked through in Q3) and weak trade numbers as a result of global weakness. But the fact is that we don’t know – we simply don’t know how enduring or otherwise this period of soft data will turn out to be. What is less uncertain is the fact that the Fed proved itself quite prescient in taking a pass on raising interest rates at the last meeting. The market’s Fed expectations have shifted materially following the weak jobs reading, with many now seeing the first rate increase sometime early next year.
"
3715,ARNC,"The Fed and the state of the economy will remain the market’s primary preoccupation through the rest of this year, but this week’s start of the Q3 earning season will put a spotlight on the weak corporate earnings picture as well.
"
3716,ARNC,"We know that the growth picture was quite bad in Q2, with total earnings for the S&P 500 index down -2.2% from the same period last year on -3.5% lower revenues. The Energy sector was the primary reason for the aggregate decline – the growth picture improves once the Energy sector is excluded from the aggregate numbers. Excluding Energy, total earnings for the S&P 500 index would have been up +5.1% in Q2 on +1.2% higher revenues.  
"
3717,ARNC,"The growth picture isn’t expected to improve in Q3 either, with total earnings for the S&P 500 index expected to be down -5.6% from the same period last year on -5.5% lower revenues. The headwinds from Q2 are at play in Q3 as well, with a combination of Energy sector weakness, dollar strength and global growth uncertainties weighing on the outlook. Excluding the drag from the Energy sector (Energy sector earnings expected to be down -65.4% year over year), total earnings for the index would be up +1.6% on -0.5% lower revenues.
"
3718,ARNC,"Including the Alcoa (AA) report on Thursday, we will be seeing Q3 results from a total 24 companies, of which 5 are S&P 500 members. The chart below shows the weekly reporting calendar for companies in the S&P 500 index.Stand-out Sectors in Q3
"
3719,ARNC,"Energy stands out for the wrong reasons, as briefly mentioned earlier, but it is hardly the only one with negative earnings growth in Q3. In fact, 8 of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to have lower earnings in 2015 Q3 relative to the year-earlier period, with Industrial Products (earnings decline of -23.4%), Conglomerates (-15.2%), Basic Materials (-18.4%), and Consumer Staples (-5.6%) as the big decliners.
"
3720,ARNC,"On the positive side, the Finance sector is expected to have another good quarter, with total earnings for the sector expected to be up +7.5% after the +7.2% gain in the preceding quarter. A big part of the Finance sector gains this quarter are due to easy comparisons at Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report). Excluding Bank of America, the sector’s growth drops to less than 1%. Other sectors with positive earnings growth in Q3 include Transportation (earnings growth of +17.0%), Autos (+21.2%), Construction (+7.5%) and Medical (+8.0%). Total earnings for the Technology sector are expected to be up +1.7% from the same period last year, but the sector’s growth rate drops into negative territory once Apple’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) strong contribution is excluded from the numbers.
"
3721,ARNC,"The table below presents the summary picture for Q3 contrasted with what companies actually reported in the 2015 Q2 earnings season.Looking Beyond Q3
"
3722,ARNC,"The chart below shows current consensus earnings growth expectations for the coming quarters contrasted with what is expected for Q3 and what was actually achieved in Q2. As you can see, this year has effectively been washed out, with growth expected to resume early next year and accelerate from there onwards. Total earnings for the S&P 500 index are effectively flat this year, but are expected to be up in double-digits next year.
"
3723,ARNC,"Economists define two back-to-back quarters of negative GDP growth as a recession. If the Q3 earnings growth rate stays in the negative territory as currently projected, then we will be well within out rights to call it an earnings recession. As you can see in the above chart, analysts expect the earnings growth picture to start turning around next year and really accelerate towards the back-half of 2016.
"
3724,ARNC,"The relatively optimistic looking expectations for the outer periods aren’t unusual – Wall Street analysts always tend to be more optimistic about the future. But estimates start coming down as the period in question comes closer. The erosion of 2015 growth estimates was driven largely by what happened to the Energy sector. But estimates for other sectors came down as well……………and we will likely see something similar to current 2016 estimates as well.Note: Want more articles from this author?

"
3726,ARNC,"As of late, the market has been preoccupied with, global growth worries, and the Fed. But these macro issues will likely take a bit of back seat in the coming days as the Q3 earnings season takes the spotlight.
"
3727,ARNC,"Investors tend to start paying attention to the earnings season when Alcoa (AA) reports, which will come out October 8th. But the earnings season has gotten underway, with results from 15 S&P 500 members already out. These early reporters include such industry leaders as Nike (NKE  -  Free Report), FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) and others – all of them have fiscal quarters ending in August, which we count as part of our 2015 Q3 tally. We have more reports on deck this week, with a total 20 companies reporting results, including 4 S&P 500 members.
"
3728,ARNC,"The chart below shows the weekly reporting calendar for companies in the S&P 500 index.Will the Earnings Growth Picture Improve?
"
3729,ARNC,"We know that the growth picture was quite bad in Q2, with total earnings for the S&P 500 index down -2.2% from the same period last year on -3.5% lower revenues. The Energy sector was the primary reason for the aggregate decline – the growth picture improves once the Energy sector is excluded from the aggregate numbers. Excluding Energy, total earnings for the S&P 500 index would have been up +5.1% in Q2 on +1.2% higher revenues.  
"
3730,ARNC,"The growth picture isn’t expected to improve in Q3, with total earnings for the S&P 500 index expected to be down -5.9% from the same period last year on -3.9% lower revenues. The headwinds from Q2 are at play in Q3 as well, with a combination of Energy sector weakness, dollar strength and global growth uncertainties weighing on the outlook. Excluding the drag from the Energy sector (Energy sector earnings expected to be down -65.3% year over year), total earnings for the index would be up +1.4% on +1.4% higher revenues.
"
3731,ARNC,"Estimates for the quarter came down over the last couple of months, following a trend that has now been well entrenched for quite some time. The chart below shows the evolution of Q3 earnings growth estimates since the start of the period in early July.
"
3732,ARNC,"Please note that while the revisions trend has been negative and along the lines of what we are used to seeing in the recent past, the magnitude of revisions has been less than what we experienced in the comparable periods in other recent quarters. In other words, estimates for Q3 are down, but they aren’t down as much as was the case in the last few quarters.  Stand-out Sectors in Q3
"
3733,ARNC,"Energy stands out for the wrong reasons, as briefly mentioned earlier, but it is hardly the only one with negative earnings growth in Q3. In fact, 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to have lower earnings in 2015 Q3 relative to the year-earlier period, with Industrial Products (earnings decline of -24.8%), Conglomerates (-15.6%), Basic Materials (-13.8%), and Consumer Discretionary (-13.0%) as the big decliners.

3740,ARNC,"For the industrial metals industry, demand will remain strong in the years to come given their varied uses. While industrial metals would gain from healthy momentum in Automotive and recovery in the Construction space, the industry remains saddled by a number of headwinds. Below, we have discussed some of the key reasons and what investors in the industrial metals sector can look forward to in the coming months as well as over the long term:
"
3741,ARNC," The Perennial Problem of the Industry - Oversupply
"
3742,ARNC,"Iron: The threat of oversupply continues to plague the industry as major iron ore producers, Rio Tinto plc (RIO  -  Free Report), BHP Billiton Limited (BHP  -  Free Report), Vale S.A (VALE  -  Free Report) and Fortescue Metals Group Limited (FMG.AX), have ramped up production. They intend to continue exploring for iron ore in Australia despite lower growth forecasts from China and weaker iron ore prices, betting on continued strength in iron ore demand over the long term. Hence, Australia, the world's top exporter of iron ore, will rev up its shipments.
"
3743,ARNC,"The surging output are already overwhelming Chinese demand growth, leading to a supply glut. Iron exports from Brazil, the second largest exporter, have risen as a result of Vale increasing its production. Vale, which alone contributes almost 85% of Brazil’s iron ore, will continue to increase its iron output.
"
3744,ARNC,"In case this excess supply is not matched by adequate demand, it will expose the market to a risk of further price declines. Excess supply over demand, economic downturn in China and severe rivalry between mining giants will keep iron ore prices subdued. Weakening market prices of iron ore continue to hurt miners’ aggregate revenues and margins.
"
3745,ARNC,"Aluminium: Alcoa (AA) now expects global aluminum markets to be in a surplus of 760,000 tons, 4,000 tons higher than previously estimated, and surplus of 2.2 million metric tons in China.
"
3746,ARNC,"Copper: The International Copper Study Group has projected that the copper market, after five straight years of deficits, should swing into a 2015 production surplus of roughly 390,000 tons. This is less than a month of current daily demand. According to ICSG projections for 2016, the copper market may show a second consecutive production surplus relative to demand. However, this is expected to be lower at 230,000 tons as demand growth outpaces production growth.
"
3747,ARNC,"Despite seeing an oversupplied market for copper in the next few years, Rio Tinto and BHP (separately and in joint ventures) plan to mine millions of additional tons of copper. They are amassing vast copper holdings to capture a greater chunk of the $140 billion global market in a bid to eventually squeeze out high cost producers just as they did in the global iron ore business.Slowdown in China
"
3748,ARNC,"Demand in China that alone accounts for a major portion of the industrial metal demand has slowed down due to the country's tepid property market and weaker infrastructure investment growth. China’s economic growth has cast a shadow on investors' view of commodities demand and, as a result, brought down demand for metals, leading to price weakness.
"
3749,ARNC,"China’s GDP in the first quarter grew at the slowest pace since 2009 and its manufacturing activity also slowed down. China's economic growth for the second quarter rose 7% year over year. Analysts have slashed their forecasts for China's growth over the next three years amid broadening pessimism over the health of the world's second largest economy. The gloomy outlook is the latest setback for China which has had a tumultuous few weeks.
"
3750,ARNC,"The move by the country's central bank to devalue the yuan startled investors and roiled equity markets all over the world. Seeing a feeble impact from efforts to prop up jittery stock markets, Chinese authorities are now reportedly scaling back their market intervention plans.
"
3751,ARNC,"The earliest economic indicator available for August -- the preliminary Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) -- suggests persistent sluggishness in the country's vast factory sector. The index fell to a near six-and-a-half-year low of 47.1 in August, below Reuters’ forecast of 47.7 and down from 47.8 in the previous month.Eurozone Worries Persist
"
3752,ARNC,"The European economy has not recovered enough, as evident from the meager Eurozone GDP growth. The Gross Domestic Product in the euro area expanded 0.30% in the second quarter of 2015 over the previous quarter. Its biggest economy, Germany, expanded 0.4% while France remained flat. These two countries combined make up a significant chunk of the Eurozone's GDP. GDP Growth Rate in the euro area averaged 0.36% from 1995 until 2015.
"
3753,ARNC,"The European Commission is projecting 1.8% increase in the EU and 1.5 % in the euro area, 0.1 and 0.2 percentage points higher, respectively, from the figures projected three months ago. For 2016, the Commission forecasts growth of 2.1 % in the EU and of 1.9 % in the euro area.A Stronger U.S. Dollar
"
3754,ARNC,"Base metals, as commodities, move in opposite directions to the dollar. Both markets remain closely linked to each other as every turn in the dollar is either followed by, or coincides with, a turn in the price of commodities. The strengthening of the dollar has led to a drop in industrial metals’ prices. An interest rate hike is likely to make the dollar stronger which does not bode well for industrial metal prices.Falling Oil Prices
"
3755,ARNC,"The slump in oil prices to five-year lows had a visible impact on industrial metal prices. A sharp and sustained drop in oil is generally associated with declining sales and prices of other commodities. The entire commodities sector may be impacted negatively in the wake of the current oil price carnage.Bottom Line
"
3756,ARNC,"Global uncertainties and oversupply conditions of base metals are some of the sector’s worst detractors.  But what about investing in the space right now; are there opportunities for short-term investors overriding the headwinds?
"
3757,ARNC,"Check out our latest Industrial Metals Industry Outlook here for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective, and how the trend is looking for this important sector of the economy now.
"
3758,ARNC,"Industrial metals are the building blocks of an economy. At present, even though concerns over China’s future growth has added an element of uncertainly to the outlook, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the industrial metals industry’s long-term outlook.
"
3759,ARNC,"Here we discuss some of the key reasons and what investors in the industrial metals sector can look forward to in the coming months and years:Strong Demand in Automotive & Aerospace
"
3760,ARNC,"On the demand side, aluminum consumption is expected to improve on a global basis, spurred by the automotive and packaging industries -- the key end markets. The automobile market is becoming increasingly aluminum-intensive, given the metal's recyclability and light-weight properties. Automakers consumed a record amount of aluminum last year as plummeting prices and technological breakthroughs made it a viable alternative to steel.
"
3761,ARNC,"The global push to improve fuel efficiency in vehicles is expected to more than double the demand for aluminum in the auto industry by 2025. Major automakers like Ford Motor Co. (F  -  Free Report), General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. (FCAU  -  Free Report) are expected to become the biggest users of aluminum in the next decade.
"
3762,ARNC,"The airline industry is also expected to boost demand for the metal. To capitalize on the lucrative aerospace market, in November last year, Alcoa (AA) acquired U.K.-based leading jet engine components maker Firth Rixson, a significant milestone in its portfolio transformation strategy. This transaction will reinforce the company’s aerospace business and add a broad spectrum of high-growth, value-added jet engine components. Alcoa’s $1.1 billion agreement to supply key parts (including forgings) for Pratt & Whitney engines also underscores its continued efforts to profitably grow its aerospace business.
"
3763,ARNC,"In March, Alcoa acquired TITAL, a leading provider of titanium and aluminum structural castings for aircraft engines and airframes. The acquisition has enabled the company to expand its titanium casting capabilities in Europe, with strong customer relationships. TITAL’s titanium revenues are expected to increase by 70% over the next five years. Roughly 70% of TITAL’s revenues are likely to come from commercial aerospace sales in 2019.
"
3764,ARNC,"Also in March, Alcoa agreed to buy titanium and specialty metal products supplier RTI International Metals, Inc. (RTI), which will broaden the former’s titanium offerings and add advanced technologies and materials to its portfolio. In addition, the company launched an expanded wheels manufacturing plant in Hungary to meet the growing demand for its proprietary lightweight wheels in Europe. Alcoa’s automotive expansion in Tennessee is also progressing as planned with customer qualifications already taking place. Moreover, Alcoa has announced plans to invest in aerospace technology at its Whitehall, MI facility.
"
3765,ARNC,"Alcoa expects global aerospace sales to increase 8% to 9% year over year in 2015 on the back of strong demand for large commercial aircraft, regional jets and jet engines. The company anticipates that global automotive production will increase in the range of 2% to 4%, with a 1% to 4% rise in North America.
"
3766,ARNC,"Following China, which accounts for over 40% of the global aluminum consumption, India appears promising given its current low level of aluminum consumption and high urban population growth. With demand being strong and the industry pulling the reins on supply, the aluminum market is likely to witness supply deficits for a prolonged period, thereby creating a supportive backdrop for high aluminum prices.
"
3767,ARNC," Pickup in Economic Activity to Drive Copper Demand
"
3768,ARNC,"Copper is a major industrial metal playing a particularly important role in emerging countries. Given its varied applications, the trends in the copper market are often considered useful indicators of the state of the global economy.
"
3769,ARNC,"Developments in the world economy are strongly correlated with movements in copper prices. Trends in Chinese GDP growth and world trade play a major role. Given that China accounts for the largest share of global copper consumption (around 46%) by far, and also has a large share in the total production of pure copper (around 34%), correlation of the metal with China is a key factor.
"
3770,ARNC,"The near-term outlook for China has been over-riding concern for the global markets already and the situation isn’t expected to stabilize in the near term. But in in the long run, expectations of rising middle class in Asia, particularly in India and China, will spend more on consumer goods such as air conditioners and refrigerators in the years to come, which will create demand for copper. Rio Tinto plc (RIO  -  Free Report) and BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP  -  Free Report) are planning to mine millions of additional tons of copper, despite picturing an oversupplied market for the next few years.
"
3771,ARNC,"The economic outlook for 2015 is upbeat for the U.S. while the European economy is recovering slowly. In China, the government remains committed to maintaining control over the gradually slowing economy. Overall, as the global economic scenario improves, copper as well as other industrial metals will move in tandem.Rebound in Construction
"
3772,ARNC,"The housing and construction sector is the largest consumer of steel today and consequently of iron ore. Building construction (pipes and wires) is also the largest market for copper. An uptrend has been noticed in real estate activity, like new home starts and construction spends, in the U.S. over the past few quarters.
"
3773,ARNC,"The U.S. Architecture Billings Index (ABI), an economic indicator that provides an approximately nine-to-twelve-month glimpse into the future of non-residential construction spending activity, is reflecting healthy and sustained demand for design services in nearly all nonresidential project types. The American Institute of Architects (AIA) reported the July ABI score at 54.7 following a mark of 55.7 in June.
"
3774,ARNC,"Long-stalled construction projects are being renewed. Moreover, easier access to credit from lending institutions along with an increasing comfort level in the overall economy has helped revitalize the commercial real estate sector in recent months. Requirement for emerging projects, such as education facilities and government buildings, is also creating demand in the sector.
"
3775,ARNC,"In the long term, as the urban population increases worldwide, so will the need for steel to build skyscrapers and public-transport infrastructure. Emerging economies will also continue to be major demand drivers for increasing urbanization and industrialization. The demand for iron ore is thus expected to remain strong in the years to come. Hence, a rebound in construction bodes well for the iron ore and copper industries.Rectifying the Aluminum Demand-Supply Imbalance
"
3776,ARNC,"After aluminum prices bore the brunt of chronic surplus, the global aluminum industry went through a substantial change in the supply-demand picture. This will eventually lead to firm prices. The world’s largest aluminum producer, Rusal’s production fell 7% year on year to a record low of 3.6 million metric tons in 2014 as the company reduced production at seven smelters during the year in an attempt to improve the global supply and demand balance. Rusal is currently reviewing the company’s smelting capacity that may result in idling of up to 200 thousand tons of smelting capacity.
"
3777,ARNC,"Likewise, Alcoa undertook a number of restructuring measures (including closure of smelters) in the past two years and is aggressively pursuing cost-cutting actions. Alcoa has curtailed 443,000 metric tons of alumina refining capacity at Suralco in Suriname. The company is pursuing a transaction to sell the Suralco operations to a Suriname government-owned entity.
"
3778,ARNC,"In Brazil, Alcoa curtailed the balance 74,000 metric tons of primary aluminum smelting capacity at Sao Luis on Apr 15 and permanently closed the 96,000 metric ton Pocos de Caldas smelter on Jun 30. The company announced plans to permanently close Anglesea coal mine and power station in Australia. Alcoa’s remains on track for lowering its position on the global aluminum cost curve to the 38th percentile and the global alumina cost curve to the 21st percentile by 2016.Bottom Line
"
3779,ARNC,"As you can see, there is no reason for not being optimistic about the industrial metals industry over the long haul. But what about investing in the space right now?
"
3780,ARNC,"Check out our latest Industrial Metals Outlook here for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective, and how the trend is shaping up for this sector going forward.
"
3781,ARNC,"It did not come as a surprise when China, being the world’s top metals consumer, during its recent economic crisis dragged down the industrial metals market along with it. Commodities are now languishing at multi-year lows. To add to the industry’s woes, the latest data on the U.S. manufacturing sector showed an unexpected slowdown in growth to its weakest pace in almost two years in August as output, new orders and employment all grew at a slower pace. Moreover, the threat of oversupply looms large on the industry as inventory continues to pile up, while the once-frenzied demand in China has fizzled out.
"
3782,ARNC,"Iron
"
3783,ARNC,"Iron ore prices dropped to their lowest levels owing to a weaker Chinese steel market and surging low-cost supplies from Australia and Brazil, leading to a supply glut. The world’s largest miner, BHP Billiton Limited (BHP  -  Free Report), posted its worst underlying profit in a decade of $6.4 billion for the year ended Jun 30, less than half of last year’s profit of $13.3 billion.
"
3784,ARNC,"Vale S.A. (VALE  -  Free Report) reported a 50% drop in second-quarter earnings while  Rio Tinto plc (RIO  -  Free Report) suffered an unceremonious drop of 42.9% in underlying earnings for first-half 2015. Macroeconomic issues such as recession in China, Greece debt negotiations and weak prices of commodities in the global mining industry were responsible for the dismal results across the board.
"
3785,ARNC,"Notwithstanding the low prices, Vale reported record second-quarter iron ore production and aspires to produce even more down the line. BHP Billiton beat its own production guidance for iron ore in fiscal 2015 and stated that it was on track for additional growth in the current year, following major expansion work.Aluminum
"
3786,ARNC,"In 2015, falling oil prices took a toll on aluminum prices as aluminum is an energy intensive industry, with energy costs accounting for nearly 30% of the total cost of production. Further, growing exports from China and oversupply in different regions exerted pressure on aluminum prices throughout the first half of 2015 leading to record low aluminum prices. The average LME aluminium price decreased by 10.1% from $1,968 per ton in the fourth quarter of 2014 to $1,769 per ton in the quarter ended Jun 30 2015.
"
3787,ARNC,"The global market experienced a surplus due to the 47% surge in export of aluminum semis from China. In order to generate cash flow, aluminum manufacturers had to export even at a loss, due to the slowdown in the domestic market.
"
3788,ARNC,"Major aluminium producers, like Alcoa Inc. (AA) and RUSAL reported sequential drop in second quarter profits due to the price slump. RUSAL cut its 2015 demand growth forecast to 6% from the previous 6.5% due to weaker-than-expected demand in Russia, Brazil and Asia. Chinese apparent consumption growth is expected to slow to 9% in 2015. Alcoa reiterated its expectation of 6.5% global aluminum demand growth for 2015.
"
3789,ARNC," Copper
"
3790,ARNC,"Concerns about Chinese economic growth rates, apprehensions surrounding Europe, continued U.S. dollar strength and weakness in commodity prices put pressure on copper prices during second-quarter 2015. LME copper prices averaged $2.74 per pound in the quarter and are currently sitting at six year lows of approximately $2.25 per pound.
"
3791,ARNC,"Stockpiles tracked by the London Metal Exchange climbed to the highest in almost two years. China’s shrinking appetite for copper has hit the metal particularly hard as the country is responsible for over 45% of copper consumption. Demand from China has declined by 3% so far this year, even as global production has increased 3%, according to the International Copper Study Group.
"
3792,ARNC,"After suffering its second straight quarterly loss, copper miner, Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX  -  Free Report) plans to trim its capital spending plans for 2016 by 26% from its July estimates. The company also intends to slash its 2016 minerals exploration costs from $100 million to $50 million and plans to cut copper sales by about 150 million pounds per year in 2016 and 2017. Freeport also intends to lower unit site production next year by 20%. The miner will suspend operations at its Miami mine in Arizona, halve production at its Tyrone mine in New Mexico and adjust rates at other of its seven copper mines in North America.Industry Ranking & Outlook – Negative
"
3793,ARNC,"Within the Zacks Industry classification, the iron mining and non-ferrous mining industries (aluminum, copper, etc.) are grouped under the Basic Materials sector (one of 16 Zacks sectors). We rank all of the 257 industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in each industry. This ranking is available on the Zacks Industry Rank page. https://www.zacks.com/stocks/industry-rank
"
3794,ARNC,"The way to align the ranking and outlook from the complete list of Zacks Industry Rank for the 257+ companies is that the outlook for the top one-third of the list (Zacks Industry Rank of #86 and lower) is positive, the middle one-third (Zacks Industry Rank between #87 and #173) is neutral, while the outlook for the bottom one-third (Zacks Industry Rank #174 and higher) is negative.
"
3795,ARNC,"The non-ferrous mining industry and the iron mining industry are ensconced in the bottom tier with respective Zacks Rank of #232 and #235, indicating a negative outlook.Sector Level Earnings Trend
"
3796,ARNC,"Q2 Earnings Scorecard, Projection for Coming Quarters
"
3797,ARNC,"The Basic Materials sector has put a meager earnings growth of 3.7% on the board. This, however, looks better when compared to the 9.9% decline in revenues in the quarter. (For a detailed look at the earnings outlook for this sector and others, please read our Earnings Trends report.)
"
3798,ARNC,"The earnings graph is expected to pick up with 17.1% growth projected in the third quarter. However, the euphoria will be short lived with growth again falling to 3.2% in the fourth quarter.
"
3799,ARNC," What’s in Store?Iron: The threat of oversupply remains for the iron ore industry as major producers continue to ramp up production. As per the World Bank, the raw material will average $63 a metric ton this year and $77.90 a metric ton in 2016.
"
3800,ARNC,"Per the World Steel Association, global apparent steel use is expected to slow considerably, with meager growth of 0.5% projected for 2015 and 1.4% for 2016. Chinese steel use will continue to record negative growth of 0.5% in both 2015 and 2016. China is currently the largest producer of steel and consequently the largest consumer of iron ore, accounting for around 60% of the global seaborne market. Thus, the mismatch between the excess supply and demand for iron ore will keep iron ore prices subdued in the near term.Aluminum: LME aluminum prices will remain under pressure given the oversupply of the metal in the market as evidenced by large aluminum inventories in LME warehouses. However, the automotive, packaging and airline industries are expected to support demand. India appears promising given its current low level of aluminum consumption and high urban population growth. With demand being strong, the industry needs to pull the reins on supply which will lead to deficits for a prolonged period and create the backdrop of higher aluminum prices going forward.Copper: Major low-cost producers continue to sell even as prices fall, in a bid to force the high cost producers out of the market as prices fall below their cost of production. Eventually, when markets recover, the dominant producers, given their increased market share, will be in a position to make even more profits during the next bull market.
"
3801,ARNC,"A weak global economic landscape, increased supply and a strong dollar are all contributing factors to the persistence of a bearish copper market. Notwithstanding the current volatility in prices, we have a long-term bullish stance on copper, supported by its widespread use in transportation, manufacturing and construction, limited supplies from existing mines and the absence of new significant development projects.To Sum Up
"
3802,ARNC,"Overall, industrial metal prices will remain depressed until the supply glut is eased by production cuts. We expect slashing of capital expenditure, suspension of operations and cost saving initiatives to be in the cards. All these factors, along with recovery in the Chinese economy will revive the industry.
"
3803,ARNC,"Falling aluminum prices and weak global economic trends have created a very challenging for the metals giant Alcoa, even though the company continues to invest in higher growth areas and reduce its reliance on commodity business.
"
3804,ARNC," About the Company
"
3805,ARNC,"PA based Alcoa Inc. (AA), has an industry leading position in aluminum production. They focus on production and management of primary aluminum, fabricated aluminum, and alumina as well as mining of bauxite and refining of alumina.
"
3806,ARNC,"The company has four worldwide reportable segments: Alumina, Primary Metals, Global Rolled Products, and Engineered Products and Solutions. They have operations in 30 countries and 59,000 employees worldwide.
"
3807,ARNC," Disappointing Q2 Results
"
3808,ARNC,"Alcoa missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.23 per share for Q2, with earnings (excluding one-time special items) at $250 million or $0.19 per share. Earnings were hurt by lower selling prices for aluminum, which more than offset benefits from volume increases and productivity gains.
"
3809,ARNC,"However, revenues beat expectations on the back of stronger results from the company’s aerospace and automotive divisions. Revenues rose 1% to $5,897 million in the second quarter from $5,836 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase was mainly due to organic growth, backed by strong aerospace, automotive and alumina businesses.
"
3810,ARNC," Commodity Price Weakness Continues
"
3811,ARNC,"Prices for the aluminum remain under pressure due to supply surplus, primarily from China. During the conference call, the management talked about rising Chinese export of fake semis disguised as semi-finished products. These products compete directly against the Western primary, even though the export of primary metal from China remains at a low level.
"
3812,ARNC,"Aluminum prices are down about 10% since the beginning of the year. China is the buyer of about half of the world’s supply of aluminum and financial woes in the country could keep the metal price under pressure in the coming months. During the conference call, Alcoa raised its forecast for the global aluminum surplus, with supply expected to exceed demand by 760,000 tons this year.Downward Revisions
"
3813,ARNC,"Due to weak outlook, analysts have revised their estimates for the company sharply downwards. Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current and the next fiscal year $0.81 per share and $0.97 per share, respectively, down from $1.04 per share and $1.17 per share 30 days ago.
"
3814,ARNC," The Bottom Line
"
3815,ARNC,"The company is going through a multi-year transformation and has taken a number of steps to diversify its product offerings. It is trying to increase its focus on high growth and profitable automotive & aerospace markets and curtail its higher cost smelting and refining capacity.
"
3816,ARNC,"In the near term however, results will continue to be affected by weak aluminum pricing, uneven global economic growth and supply glut from China. The stock is down more than 30% this year, but given estimates cuts by analysts, it’s difficult to envision any recovery in near future.
"
3817,ARNC,"Mining-Non-Ferrous industry is currently ranked 180 out of 265 (Bottom 32%) Zacks industries. It is safer to avoid investing in this space till the outlook improves.

3819,ARNC,"The following is an excerpt from this week's Earnings Trends piece.  To access the entire article, please click here.
"
3820,ARNC,"Headlines about Greece are dominating the market discourse at present, but attention will likely shift to the Q2 earnings season following Tuesday’s Alcoa (AA) earnings release. We have only a few companies coming out with quarterly results this week, but the cycle ramps up next week with more than 40 S&P 500 members reporting results.
"
3821,ARNC,"The chart below shows the weekly reporting calendar for the S&P 500 index
"
3822,ARNC,"As has been the trend over the last couple of years, estimates for Q2 came down in the run up to this earnings season. This has prompted many in the market to hope that the negative revisions trend may have gone a bit too far, making it easy for companies to jump through. But judging from the market’s reaction to the admittedly small sample of reports at this (we already have results from 22 S&P 500 members with fiscal quarters ending in May), expectations may not be low enough. We will know more in the coming days.
"
3823,ARNC,"For the 2015 Q2 earnings season as a whole, here are the 3 key points to keep in mind.First, the earnings growth challenge that we witnessed in the preceding quarter is very much present in Q2 as well. Total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be down -6.7% from the same period last year on -6.1% lower revenues. This follows positive earnings growth of +2.6% in 2015 Q1 on -5.4% lower revenues. Revenues were weak in Q1 and the picture isn’t expected to improve in Q2 either.
"
3824,ARNC,"As you can see in the chart below, not much growth is expected in the second half of the year either, with full-year 2015 earnings now effectively flat from the preceding year.
"
3825,ARNC,"Growth is expected to resume next year, with total earnings for the S&P 500 index expected to be up in the low double digits. But then again, expectations for outer periods always tend to be on the optimistic side.Second, the Energy sector was a big drag on the aggregate growth picture in Q1 and we are on track to witness replay of that trend in Q2 as well. Total earnings for the Energy sector are expected to be down -63.8% from the same period last year on -41.1% lower revenues. Had it not been for the Energy drag, total Q2 earnings for the S&P 500 index would be essentially flat (up +0.5%).Third, estimates followed the by-now familiar trend of coming down as the quarter unfolded with the current -6.7% expected decline in total earnings down from a decline of -4.3% on March 31st and positive growth +1.1% in early January. The silver lining to this negative revisions trend is that the magnitude of negative revisions for Q2 is smaller relative to other recent periods, particularly the preceding quarter.
"
3826,ARNC,"The chart below shows that while estimates for total earnings for the S&P 500 index have declined by -3.1% since the start of the quarter, it is significantly lower than what we saw in the comparable period in Q1 as well as the preceding three quarters.
"
3827,ARNC,"The issues remain unchanged from what we encountered in Q1, with a combination of strong dollar, Energy sector weakness and global growth issues weighing on the earnings picture. These headwinds are expected to keep a lid on growth over the next few quarters. But next year’s estimates show that analysts are looking for the growth pace to materially ramp up.

3829,ARNC,"The following is an excerpt from this week's Earnings Trends article.  To see the full article, please click here.
"
3830,ARNC,"With only a few earnings reports still to come, the Q1 earnings season is essentially over. The focus will shift in the coming days to the 2015 Q2 earnings season, as companies with fiscal quarters ending in May start coming out with results. We count these companies, which includes such major players like Adobe (ADBE  -  Free Report), Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) and FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report), as part of our Q2 tally. By the time Alcoa (AA) reports on July 8th, we will have seen Q2 results from about two dozen S&P members that have fiscal quarters ending in May.
"
3831,ARNC,"Estimates for the current period have come down quite a bit since the quarter got underway.  This decrease is in-line with the trend that we have been seeing quarter after quarter for more than two years now. The chart below shows what has happened to 2015 Q2 earnings estimates for S&P 500 companies since the start of the year.
"
3832,ARNC,"As was the case in Q1, the Energy sector remains the biggest drag on Q2 estimates. Total Energy sector earnings are expected to be down -65.1% from the same period last year on -40.6% lower revenues. If we exclude the Energy sector from Q2 estimates, total earnings for the S&P 500 index would be barely in the positive territory (up +0.3%). The growth picture isn’t expected to improve in any meaningful way in the coming quarters either, as the chart below shows.Q1 Scorecard (as of June 4th, 2015)
"
3833,ARNC,"Total earnings for the 498 S&P 500 members that have reported results already are up +2.4% on -3.3% revenues, with 62.0% beating EPS estimates and only 42.4% coming ahead of top-line expectations.
"
3834,ARNC,"As we have stated repeatedly in this space since the start of the Q1 reporting cycle, this is weak performance compared to what we have seen from the same group of 498 S&P 500 members in other recent periods. (Please note that we provide the scorecard for the Russell 2000 index on page 16 of the detailed report).
"
3835,ARNC,"The two side-by-side charts below give a historical context to the results thus far – by comparing the Q1 earnings & revenue growth rates (left-hand side chart) and earnings & revenue beat ratios (right-hand side chart) with what these same companies achieved in the preceding quarter as well as the 4-quarter average.
"
3836,ARNC,"Three things stand out as we look at the results thus farFirst, the revenue weakness is very notable. We knew that growth will be problematic in Q1, so the weak revenue growth rate of -3.3% compared to other recent periods isn’t that surprising. But the very low proportion of companies beating revenue estimates is surprising and likely indicative that the growth backdrop has been even weaker than what was reflected in consensus estimates.Second, the earnings growth rate (+2.4%) is also weak relative to what we saw from the same group of companies in 2014 Q4 and the 4-quarter average. While the Finance sector has been a positive growth contributor, the Energy sector’s impact has been in the opposite direction. Excluding contribution of these two sectors, the Q1 growth picture still compares to unfavorably other recent periods, as the right hand-side chart below shows.  Third, as has been the norm in recent quarters, management guided lower for the current and following quarters. As a result, estimates for the current quarter, which had fallen quite a bit already in solidarity with the Q1 estimate cuts, came down even more over the last couple of months.
"
3837,ARNC,"The dollar issue has added to the Energy sector’s woes and some concerns about the U.S. economic picture in bringing down this year’s estimates. Current consensus estimates show earnings growth for the S&P 500 to be in the negative for the first three quarters of the year, with the growth rate for the full-year now modestly in the negative. The expectation is that the growth picture starts improving in the last quarter of the year, with the growth pace ramping up to double-digit rates in 2016.Note: Want more articles from this author?

3839,ARNC,"Should Industrial Metal Stocks Be in Your Portfolio Now?
"
3840,ARNC,"Industrial metals are the building blocks of an economy. At present, even though concerns over China’s future growth have added an element of uncertainly to the outlook, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the industrial metals industry for both the short and long term. Below, we have discussed some of the key reasons and what investors in the industrial metals sector can look forward to in the coming months and years:Rectifying the Aluminum Demand-Supply Imbalance
"
3841,ARNC,"After aluminum prices bore the brunt of chronic surplus, the global aluminum industry went through a substantial change in the supply-demand picture. This will eventually lead to firm prices. The world’s largest aluminum producer is Rusal, and its aluminum production fell 7% year on year to a record low of 3.6 million metric tons in 2014, as the company reduced production at seven smelters during the year in an attempt to improve the global supply/demand balance. Rusal is currently reviewing the company’s smelting capacity that may result in idling of up to 200 thousand tons of smelting capacity.
"
3842,ARNC,"Likewise, Alcoa Inc, (AA) has undertaken a number of restructuring measures (including the closure of smelters) in the past two years and is aggressively pursuing cost-cutting actions. In Mar 2015, Alcoa initiated a 12-month review of 2.8 million metric tons of refining capacity for possible curtailment, permanent closure or divestiture.
"
3843,ARNC,"This initiative is part of management’s target to lower Alcoa’s refining operations on the global alumina cost curve to the 21st percentile (currently 25th) by 2016. As part of this review, in Mar 2015, management decided to curtail 4.43 million metric tons per year of capacity at the Suralco (Suriname) refinery by the end of Apr 2015.Future of Aluminum Tied to Automotive & Aerospace Industries
"
3844,ARNC,"On the demand side, aluminum consumption is expected to improve on a global basis, spurred by the automotive and packaging industries -- the key consumer markets. The automobile market is becoming increasingly aluminum-intensive, given the metal's recyclability and light-weight properties. Automakers consumed a record amount of aluminium last year as plummeting prices and technological breakthroughs made it a viable alternative to steel.
"
3845,ARNC,"The global push to improve fuel efficiency in vehicles is expected to more than double the demand for aluminum in the auto industry by 2025. Major automakers like Ford Motor Co. (F  -  Free Report), General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. (FCAU  -  Free Report) are expected to become the biggest users of aluminum in the next decade.
"
3846,ARNC,"The airline industry is also expected to boost demand for the metal. To capitalize on the lucrative aerospace market, in November last year, Alcoa acquired U.K.-based leading jet engine components maker Firth Rixson, a significant milestone in its portfolio transformation strategy. This transaction will reinforce the company’s aerospace business and add a broad spectrum of high-growth, value-added jet engine components. Alcoa’s $1.1 billion agreement to supply key parts (including forgings) for Pratt & Whitney engines also underscores its continued efforts to profitably grow its aerospace business.
"
3847,ARNC,"In March this year, Alcoa acquired TITAL, a leading provider of titanium and aluminum structural castings for aircraft engines and airframes. The acquisition has enabled the company to expand its titanium casting capabilities to Europe, with strong customer relationships. TITAL’s titanium revenues are expected to increase by 70% over the next five years.
"
3848,ARNC,"Also in March, Alcoa agreed to buy titanium and specialty metal products supplier RTI International Metals, Inc. (RTI), which will broaden its titanium offerings and add advanced technologies and materials to its portfolio. In addition, the company launched an expanded wheels manufacturing plant in Hungary to meet the growing demand for its proprietary lightweight wheels in Europe.
"
3849,ARNC,"Alcoa expects global aerospace sales to increase 9% to 10% year over year in 2015 on the back of strong demand for large commercial aircraft, regional jets and jet engines. The company anticipates global automotive production will increase in the range of 2% to 4%, with a 1% to 4% rise in North America.
"
3850,ARNC,"Following China, which accounts for over 40% of the global aluminum consumption, India appears promising, given its current low level of aluminum consumption and high urban population growth. With demand being strong and the industry pulling the reins on supply, the aluminum market is likely to witness supply deficits for a prolonged period, thereby creating a supportive backdrop for higher aluminum prices.
"
3851,ARNC," Pickup in Economic Activity to Drive Copper Demand
"
3852,ARNC,"Copper is a major industrial metal playing a particularly important role in emerging countries. Given its varied applications, it is often considered that the trends in the copper market are a useful indicator of the state of the global economy.
"
3853,ARNC,"Developments in the world economy are strongly correlated with movements in copper prices. Trends in Chinese GDP growth and world trade play a major role. Given that China accounts for the largest share by far of global copper consumption (around 46%), and also has a large share in the total production of pure copper (around 34%), the correlation with China is a key factor. If China’s economy picks up pace, it will be instrumental in driving copper prices.
"
3854,ARNC,"It is expected that the rising middle class in Asia, particularly in India and China, will spend more on consumer goods such as air conditioners and refrigerators in the years to come, which will create demand for copper. Rio Tinto (RTP) and BHP (BHP  -  Free Report) are planning to mine millions of additional tons of copper, despite envisaging an oversupplied market for the next few years.
"
3855,ARNC,"The economic outlook for 2015 is upbeat for the U.S. while the European economy is recovering slowly. In China, the government remains committed to maintaining control over the gradually slowing economy. Overall, as the global economic scenario improves, copper as well as other industrial metals will move in tandem.Rebound in Construction
"
3856,ARNC,"The housing and construction sector is the largest consumer of steel today and consequently of iron ore. Building construction (pipes and wires) is also the largest market for copper. An uptrend has been noticed in real estate activity in the U.S., like new home starts and construction spends, over the past few quarters.
"
3857,ARNC,"The U.S. Architecture Billings Index (ABI), an economic indicator that provides an approximately nine-to-twelve-month glimpse into the future of non-residential construction spending activity, remained over 50 for most of 2014. After dipping in Jan 2015, it has again held its ground at above 50 in February and March.
"
3858,ARNC,"Long-stalled construction projects are being renewed. Moreover, easier access to credit from lending institutions along with an increasing comfort level in the overall economy has helped revitalize the commercial real estate sector in recent months. The requirement for emerging projects, such as education facilities and government buildings, is also creating demand in the sector.
"
3859,ARNC,"In the long term, as the urban population increases worldwide, so will the need for steel to build skyscrapers and public-transport infrastructure. Emerging economies will also continue to be major demand drivers for increasing urbanization and industrialization. The demand for iron ore is thus expected to remain strong in the years to come. Hence, a rebound in construction bodes well for the iron ore and copper industries.Bottom Line
"
3860,ARNC,"As you can see, there are plenty of reasons for optimism about the industrial metals industry over the long haul. But what about investing in the space right now?
"
3861,ARNC,"Check out our latest Industrial Metals Outlook here for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective, and how the trend is shaping up for this sector going forward.
"
3862,ARNC,"For the industrial metals industry, demand will remain strong in the years to come, given their varied uses. While industrial metals would gain from healthy momentum in automotive and recovery in construction, the industry still remains saddled by a number of headwinds. Below, we discus some of the key reasons and what investors in the industrial metals sector can look forward to in the coming months as well as over the long term:
"
3863,ARNC," Threat of Oversupply Looms Large
"
3864,ARNC,"Iron - The threat of oversupply continues to plague the industry as major iron ore producers, Rio Tinto plc (RIO  -  Free Report), BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP  -  Free Report), Vale S.A (VALE  -  Free Report) and Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. (FMG.AX), have ramped up production. They intend to continue exploring for iron ore in Australia despite lower growth forecasts from China and weaker iron ore prices, betting on continued strength in iron ore demand over the long term. Hence, Australia, the world's top exporter of iron ore, will rev up its shipments.
"
3865,ARNC,"Australia cut its iron ore price estimate for 2015 by 33% as the surging output will overwhelm Chinese demand growth, leading to a supply glut. Iron exports from Brazil, the second largest exporter, have risen as a result of Vale increasing its production. Vale, which alone contributes almost 85% of Brazil’s iron ore, will continue to increase its iron output.
"
3866,ARNC,"In case this excess supply is not matched by adequate demand, it will expose the market to a risk of further price declines.
"
3867,ARNC,"Recently, BHP Billiton decided to put the brakes on its planned boost to iron ore production, becoming the first top miner to act on the matter of global supply glut that has sent prices for the commodity reeling. It announced that it is pushing out its $2 billion Port Hedland expansion. It would have increased the miner’s output by 20 million tons. The move will slow BHP’s planned production boost to 290 million tonnes a year by mid-2017 but would enable its proposed 20 million-ton-a-year expansion to be executed at lower costs.
"
3868,ARNC,"The market took this as a sign that the top producers may begin to tackle oversupply which this year, which is expected to reach 90 million tons and only dip to around 80 million tons in 2016, the third consecutive year of excess production. The industry was also encouraged by the fact that export growth from Australia is showing signs of slowing.
"
3869,ARNC,"Despite the announcement, BHP said it produced 59 million tons of iron ore in the three months through March, up one-fifth year over year. The company lifted its output forecast for the year through June, saying it now expects to log 230-million tons in output, 2% more than its earlier projection.Copper - The International Copper Study Group has projected that the copper market, after five straight years of deficits, should swing into a 2015 production surplus of roughly 390,000 tons. This is less than a month of current daily demand.
"
3870,ARNC,"ICSG projections for 2015 indicate that world refined copper production is expected to exceed apparent refined copper demand by 365,000 metric tons (t). According to ICSG projections for 2016, the copper market may show a second consecutive production surplus relative to demand. However, this is expected to be lower at 230,000 t as demand growth outpaces production growth.
"
3871,ARNC,"Despite seeing an oversupplied market for copper in the next few years, Rio Tinto and BHP (separately and in joint ventures) plan to mine millions of additional tons of copper. They are amassing vast copper holdings to capture a greater chunk of the $140 billion global market in a bid to eventually squeeze out high-cost producers just as they did in the global iron ore business.Slowdown in China
"
3872,ARNC,"Demand in China that alone accounts for a major portion of the industrial metal demand has slowed down due to the country's tepid property market and weaker infrastructure investment growth. China’s economic growth has cast a shadow on investors' view of commodities demand and, as a result, brought down demand for metals, leading to price weakness.
"
3873,ARNC,"China’s GDP in the first quarter grew at the slowest pace since 2009 and its manufacturing activity also slowed down. China’s flash PMI fell to 49.2 in April, a fresh one-year low. China PMI has been below 50 in 2015, barring the exception of February. A PMI below 50 is another grim reminder of the slowdown in China.Eurozone Worries Persist
"
3874,ARNC,"The European economy has not recovered enough, as evident from the meager Euro zone GDP growth of 0.3% in the fourth quarter of 2014. Its biggest economy, Germany, expanded by just 0.7%. The European Commission is projecting 1.3% growth in 2015.A Stronger U.S. Dollar
"
3875,ARNC,"Base metals as commodities move in opposite directions to the dollar. Both markets remain closely linked to each other as every turn in the dollar is either followed by, or coincides with, a turn in the price of commodities. The strengthening of the dollar has led to a drop in industrial metals’ prices.
"
3876,ARNC,"At the recent FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting, the Federal Reserve did not rule out an interest-rate hike sometime later in June or September. The Federal Reserve said it expects the U.S. economy to rebound after slowing in the winter, reflecting transitory factors. An interest rate hike is likely to make the dollar stronger, which does not bode well for industrial metal prices.Falling Oil Prices
"
3877,ARNC,"The slump in oil prices to five-year lows had a visible impact on industrial metal prices. A sharp and sustained drop in oil is generally associated with declining sales and prices of other commodities. The entire commodities sector may be impacted negatively in the wake of the current oil price carnage.Bottom Line
"
3878,ARNC,"Global uncertainties and oversupply conditions of base metals are some of the sector’s worst detractors.  But what about investing in the space right now; are there opportunities for short-term investors overriding the headwinds?
"
3879,ARNC,"Check out our latest Industrial Metals Industry Outlook here for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective, and how the trend is looking for this important sector of the economy now.
"
3880,ARNC,"Industrial Metals to Sail Despite Near-Term Headwinds
"
3881,ARNC,"Industrial metals are used in a wide variety of applications, including numerous constructions and manufacturing businesses and hence, tend to exhibit a strong correlation to global equity markets. Since the fourth quarter of 2014, the slump in global oil prices, a strengthening US Dollar and slowdown in the Chinese economy have emerged as major headwinds for the global metal industry.Iron - Prices Going Downhill
"
3882,ARNC,"In the first quarter of 2015, iron ore prices suffered its largest quarterly loss since 2009 and subsequently fell to a decade low of $47.08 on Apr 2, as surging low-cost supplies from Australia and Brazil swamped the global market, leading to glut as demand slowed in China, the top consumer. Three big iron ore miners Vale S.A. (VALE  -  Free Report), Rio Tinto plc (RIO  -  Free Report) and BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP  -  Free Report) announced record production numbers, while global steel production declined 1.8% in the first quarter of 2015. This was mainly caused by a 5% year-on-year slowdown in China's steel demand.
"
3883,ARNC,"In the wake of low prices of iron ore, which accounts for about 90% of the company’s overall earnings, Rio Tinto has been cutting costs to protect its margins. Vale posted its lowest earnings in six years and the third straight quarterly loss. Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. (CLF  -  Free Report), the largest U.S. iron ore producer, posted better-than-expected first-quarter earnings after the company rationalized is operations in the face of weaker commodity prices. The company has decided to close one of its three iron ore pits in Western Australia. BHP Billiton has also decided to slow the pace of its $2 billion expansion plan in the Pilbara. Though these factors led to a temporary spike in iron prices, they plunged soon thereafter.Aluminum – Prices Down in 2015
"
3884,ARNC,"Last year, the global aluminum industry went through a substantial change to rectify the supply-demand imbalance that affected prices through 2013. Major aluminum producers like Rio Tinto and Rusal and Alcoa Inc. (AA) effectively cut their aluminum production. This, along with a pickup in aluminum demand from key end users, helped aluminum inventories to descend from peak levels. This tightening of aluminum supply lifted aluminum prices from the four and a half year low of $1,675 per ton in February.
"
3885,ARNC,"However, in the past few months, falling oil prices and weak industrial data from China have again resulted in a fall in aluminum prices. Aluminum is an energy intensive industry, with energy costs accounting for nearly 30% of the total cost of production. Falling oil prices tend to have a deflationary effect on aluminum.Copper Prices Worst Hit
"
3886,ARNC,"During the first quarter of 2015, copper prices were caught in a downward spiral due to the slowdown in China, weakness in Europe and a stronger greenback. Oversupply of this red metal also continues to weigh on its prices. Overall, copper fared the worst among all industrial metals, with prices declining 12% so far in the year.Industry Ranking & Outlook – Positive on Aluminum and Copper, Negative on Iron
"
3887,ARNC,"Within the Zacks Industry classification, the iron mining and non-ferrous mining industries (aluminum, copper, etc.) are broadly grouped under the Basic Materials sector (one of 16 Zacks sectors). We rank all of the 257 industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in each industry. This ranking is available on the Zacks Industry Rank page.
"
3888,ARNC,"The way to align the ranking and outlook from the complete list of Zacks Industry Rank for the 257+ companies is that the outlook for the top one-third of the list (Zacks Industry Rank of #86 and lower) is positive, the middle one-third (Zacks Industry Rank between #87 and #173) is neutral, while the outlook for the bottom one-third (Zacks Industry Rank #174 and higher) is negative.
"
3889,ARNC,"The non-ferrous mining industry features in the top tier with a Zacks Rank of #54 indicating that the outlook is positive. The iron mining industry, however, is in the bottom tier with a Zacks Industry Rank #199, indicating a negative outlook.Sector Level Earnings Trend
"
3890,ARNC,"Sector Q1 Earnings Scorecard – Overall Decline So Far
"
3891,ARNC,"The 61.9% of the companies in the Basic Materials sector that have reported their results put an earnings decline of 3.3% on the board. Taking into account the other companies that are yet to report their results, earnings of the sector is expected to go down 2.2% in the first quarter. (For a detailed look at the earnings outlook for this sector and others, please read our Earnings Trends report.)
"
3892,ARNC," Q2 & Beyond – Growth to Pick Up Eventually
"
3893,ARNC,"The earnings graph is expected to take a nosedive with the basic material sector expected to log declines of 2.4% in the second quarter and 5.8% in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, the graph will eventually pick up with 2.4% growth. Nevertheless, overall in 2015, the sector will log earnings growth of 0.4%. In 2016, the sector’s earnings growth is projected to pick up by 19.5%.
"
3894,ARNC," What’s in Store?
"
3895,ARNC,"Iron – The threat of oversupply looms large over the iron ore industry as major iron ore producers continue to ramp up production. As per the World Bank, the raw material will average $63 a metric ton this year, down from the prior $75 given in the bank's January's report. The forecast for 2016 was cut to $66.60 from $77.90.
"
3896,ARNC,"Per the World Steel Association, global apparent steel use is expected to slow considerably, with meager growth of 0.5% projected for 2015 and 1.4% for 2016. The slowdown in China’s steel demand will continue to be a drag on steel demand. Chinese steel use will continue to record negative growth of 0.5% in both 2015 and 2016.
"
3897,ARNC,"China is currently the largest producer of steel and consequently the largest consumer of iron ore, accounting for around 60% of the global seaborne market. Thus, the mismatch between the excess supply and demand for iron ore will keep iron ore prices subdued in the near term.Aluminum - Aluminum consumption is expected to improve on a global basis spurred by the automotive and packaging industries, its key consumer markets. The airline industry is also expected to boost demand for the metal. Following China, which accounts for over 40% of the global aluminum consumption, India appears promising given its current low level of aluminum consumption and high urban population growth.
"
3898,ARNC,"With demand being strong and the industry pulling in the reins on supply, the aluminum market is likely to witness deficits for a prolonged period. This will support high aluminum prices going forward.Copper - The copper market seems to be shifting into supply surplus. Major low-cost producers continues to sell even as prices fall in a bid to force the high cost producers out of the market as prices fall below their cost of production. Eventually, when markets recover, the dominant producers, given their increased market share, will be in a position to make even more profits during the next bull market.
"
3899,ARNC,"Therefore, it is likely that copper prices will continue to remain under pressure. A weak global economic landscape, increased supply and a strong dollar are all contributing factors to the continuation of a bearish copper market.
"
3900,ARNC,"Notwithstanding the current volatility in prices, we have a long-term bullish stance on copper, supported by its widespread use in transportation, manufacturing and construction, limited supplies from existing mines and the absence of new significant development projects.To Sum Up
"
3901,ARNC,"Revival in the Chinese economy on the back of policy support and correction of the supply-demand imbalance will be instrumental in driving growth in the industry. Moreover, a projected earnings growth for 2015 and increased momentum in 2016 instills optimism in the industry.
"
