0,CERN,"Oil & gas groups have risen to hold the largest share, four slots among the top 20 groups out of the industries tracked by IBD. Next in line are medical sector industries. Hospitals, medical products and outpatient care all hold top 20 positions.Any even faster-rising group — medical software — has gained 9% over the past four weeks. That lifted it into a No. 36 ranking on Friday, up from No. 120 six weeks ago.A surprising number of advancing stocks, namely Veeva Systems (VEEV), Medidata Solutions (MDSO), Teladoc (TDOC), Tabula Rasa (TRHC) and Evolent Health (EVH), are driving the advance.The group garnered added attention Friday, when Cerner (CERN) announced it had finally landed a deal to provide digital records-keeping tools to the U.S. Veterans Affairs Department. The $10 billion, 10-year contract had been left hanging by a thread after Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin was fired in March.But Cerner's profits are wobbly and its shares, consolidating since January, are far from the top seed in the group.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOf more interest to CAN SLIM investors are Veeva and Medidata. Both companies are more profitable. And both stocks are basing, although Veeva is in a late-stage base pattern.Medidata, a company that provides systems to manage clinical trial data, has the stronger technical traits. Its Accumulation/Distribution Rating is a powerful A. Its up/down volume ratio is 1.2. Combined, they suggest institutional investors are buying the stock.Teladoc is the innovative provider of health care analysis online and over the phone. As the service is picked up by an increasing number of insurers and employer health plans, shares are up 40% since the start of the year. They are also extended after breaking out from a first-stage flat base in May.Like Teledoc, Tabula Rasa has been knocking out new highs in recent stock market action. The stock is up 81% year to date, despite a failed breakout attempt in February and March.It holds a weak 35 EPS rating from IBD. But consensus views project a 167% earnings gain in Q1, and a 152% advance for the year.Another plus: Tabula's relative strength line has been slicing cleanly to new highs all year, a sign of comparative strength.Also worth keeping an eye on is Evolent Health. Its stock is staging an aggressive recovery, with a 59% gain since December 29. The company turned profitable in the first quarter, and now has five quarters of earnings acceleration under its belt.For the year, consensus views still project an 8 cent per share loss. But that's expected to change in 2019, with analysts expecting a profit of 13 cents.RELATED:Medidata Solutions Shows Rising Relative Price Performance; Still Shy Of Key ThresholdTrump Personally Lobbied Postmaster To Hike Amazon's Rates: Report

22,CERN,"Patience is a virtue.
"
23,CERN,"This can be particularly true when tracking a long-term subtle pattern like a saucer base.
"
24,CERN,"A saucer base typically features a 12% to 20% correction: essentially a shallow cup. The major difference is that, while the pattern can form in as few as seven weeks, it commonly takes several months or more than a year to bear fruit.
"
25,CERN,"When it does, particularly when a bullish saucer forms during a strong market, it can presage a powerful advance.
"
26,CERN,"Because saucers often appear as only slight depressions in stock value, they can sneak up on you. Be sure to use weekly and monthly charts to spot this pattern as it forms. A daily chart often won't give you a full view.
"
27,CERN,"A good example was medical software systems maker Cerner (CERN) when it tried, then failed, to clear a cup-with-high-handle base in early March 2004 1. Those who bought at the breakout faced a quick loss and should have sold to cut losses at 7% to 8% 2.
"
28,CERN,"But investors who kept an eye on the issue over the next several weeks noticed how it corrected 19%, then found support at its 40-week moving average 3.
"
29,CERN,"By July, the 10- and 40-week averages had converged, cradling the stock in a holding pattern straight through November 4.
"
30,CERN,"To some investors, the result may have looked like a doddering chart pattern: no gain for eight months.
"
31,CERN,"But those who looked closely would have suspected Cerner was building a saucer base.
"
32,CERN,"While deeper corrections shake investors out, saucer bases wear them down. Those who hold on are the stalwarts who understand and have faith in the company's fundamental strengths.
"
33,CERN,"The long consolidation can also depress certain technical gauges, such as the Relative Price Strength Rating. RS ratings often sag lower during long saucer bases. Cerner's RS was a soft 59 at the time of its breakout.
"
34,CERN,"Saucers require most of the same characteristics as cup-type bases. Accumulation weeks should outnumber distribution weeks. If the stock also shapes a handle, it should drift lower in soft trade. Breakouts should occur in volume that is 40% or more above the 50-day average. Cerner cleared its 48.80 buy point on a 128% surge in volume on Nov. 15, 2004 5. Shares climbed more than 100% over the next 12 months.

Cerner cleared its 48.80 buy point on a 128% surge in volume on Nov. 15, 2004 5. Shares climbed more than 100% over the next 12 months.Patience is a virtue.This can be particularly true when tracking a long-term subtle pattern like a saucer base.A saucer base typically features a 12% to 20% correction: essentially a shallow cup. The major difference is that, while the pattern can form in as few as seven weeks, it commonly takes several months or more than a year to bear fruit.When it does, particularly when a bullish saucer forms during a strong market, it can presage a powerful advance.Because saucers often appear as only slight depressions in stock value, they can sneak up on you. Be sure to use weekly and monthly charts to spot this pattern as it forms. A daily chart often won't give you a full view.A good example was medical software systems maker Cerner (CERN) when it tried, then failed, to clear a cup-with-high-handle base in early March 2004 1. Those who bought at the breakout faced a quick loss and should have sold to cut losses at 7% to 8% 2.But investors who kept an eye on the issue over the next several weeks noticed how it corrected 19%, then found support at its 40-week moving average 3.By July, the 10- and 40-week averages had converged, cradling the stock in a holding pattern straight through November 4.To some investors, the result may have looked like a doddering chart pattern: no gain for eight months.But those who looked closely would have suspected Cerner was building a saucer base.While deeper corrections shake investors out, saucer bases wear them down. Those who hold on are the stalwarts who understand and have faith in the company's fundamental strengths.The long consolidation can also depress certain technical gauges, such as the Relative Price Strength Rating. RS ratings often sag lower during long saucer bases. Cerner's RS was a soft 59 at the time of its breakout.Saucers require most of the same characteristics as cup-type bases. Accumulation weeks should outnumber distribution weeks. If the stock also shapes a handle, it should drift lower in soft trade. Breakouts should occur in volume that is 40% or more above the 50-day average. Cerner cleared its 48.80 buy point on a 128% surge in volume on Nov. 15, 2004 5. Shares climbed more than 100% over the next 12 months.

48,CERN,"Nasdaq 100 futures soared Friday morning after a wave of big earnings late Thursday. Megacap techs Amazon.com (AMZN), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) are all up sharply, with the two FANG stocks signaling likely buying opportunities. Chip plays Intel (INTC) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) also advanced. But Baidu (BIDU) was among several losers.XNasdaq 100 futures surged 1.35% above fair value. S&P 500 index futures rose 0.4% vs. fair value while Dow futures were up nearly 0.3%.During Thursday's stock market trading, the S&P 500 rose 0.1% and the Dow 0.3%, while the Nasdaq composite retreated 0.1%.Amazon earned 52 cents a share a share, obliterating views for just 1 cent. Revenue grew 34% to $43.7 billion, beating the consensus for $42 billion. Amazon Web Services revenue leapt 42% to $4.58 billion in Q3. AWS had operating profit of $1.171 billion vs. the companywide $347 million.Amazon shot up 7.4% to 1,044 in early trading. That suggests a high-volume rebound from its 50-day moving average, which would offer a buying opportunity. However, the stock could find resistance below its old high of 1,083.31. Amazon is in a late-stage flat base with a potential entry of 1,083.41.  Keep in mind that overnight action doesn't always translate into how a stock will open or close the following session.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. If you owned Amazon, you're happy now, but Baidu holders seem headed for a big retreat. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Adjusted earnings climbed 32% from a year ago, with revenue jumping 24% to $27.77 billion. Both cleared earnings views.Google doesn't break out its cloud computing revenue, grouping it in ""other revenues,"" which rose 40% to $3.405 billion. Google executives touted cloud growth on its post-Q3 call. Google reached a deal with Cisco Systems (CSCO) this week to market its cloud-computing services to the enterprise market as it takes on Amazon Web Services and Microsoft's Azure.Alphabet shares rose 3.2% to 1,023.59 early Friday. That suggests the stock will retake a 1006.29 buy point briefly cleared earlier this month.Google gets most of its money from online advertising. So its gains there bode well for Facebook (FB), which will report earnings in early November. Facebook shares rose 1.7% to 173.49 in the premarket, trying to get back above a 175.59 entry.Microsoft earnings rose 17% to 84 cents a share, defying views for a dip to 72 cents. Revenue grew 12% to $24.54 billion. Microsoft said its Azure cloud-computing revenue shot up 90%, though it didn't give an actual dollar figure. The Intelligent Cloud division, which includes Azure and Windows Server, saw a 14% gain to $6.9 billion.""This quarter we exceeded $20 billion in commercial cloud (annualized revenue run rate), outpacing the goal we set just over two years ago,"" Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella said in a  statement.Microsoft rose 4.6% to 82.38 early. The Dow tech titan's stock was already modestly extended from a breakout.Baidu appeared to deliver earnings that crushed third-quarter estimates. But the Chinese search giant, which is becoming a big leader in artificial intelligence, gave weak Q4 guidance. Baidu shares fell 8.8% to 237.65 in the premarket, signaling a move below its 50-day moving average. Baidu hasn't had a very long run and it's unclear how heavy the weekly volume will be, so this may not trigger a clear long-term sell signal.(During Thursday's session, Chinese for-profit education stocks Tal Education (TAL) and New Oriental Education (EDU) did trip long-term sell signals, including high-volume sell-offs through their 10-week lines.)In addition to Baidu, Mattel (MAT) and Expedia (EXPE) were huge overnight losers while Cerner (CERN) and Fortinet (FTNT) also sold off following their quarterly reports.RELATED:Google Shoots To All-Time High After Beating Earnings ViewsAmazon Blows Past Earnings Views, Beats On Sales; Shares SoarMicrosoft Tops September-Quarter Sales, Earnings TargetsBaidu Dives On Weak Revenue Forecast

51,CERN,"After a long absence, Apple (AAPL) made IBD's latest monthly list of new buys by top-performing mutual funds, as it gets ready to unveil its latest iPhone, with one analyst saying the launch may be delayed due to production issues.X The tech giant was joined by a slew of medical sector stocks, including managed care providers UnitedHealth (UNH) and Aetna (AET), as well as leading biotech companies Celgene (CELG) and Regeneron (REGN).Defense contractors Boeing (BA), Raytheon (RTN) and Heico (HEI) also made the list, as tensions with North Korea and anticipated defense spending increases are expected to drive demand.Over the last three months, top fund managers invested over $1 billion each in four stocks on the list: UnitedHealth (99 funds, $1.39 billion invested), Apple (85, $1.36 billion), Electronic Arts (EA) (76, $1.25 billion) and Celgene (96, $1.07 billion).The heavy institutional buying has helped push Apple, Electronic Arts and Celgene into new buy zones, and has already lifted UnitedHealth beyond buy range.Seeing that stocks on your watch list are being bought by mutual fund managers with a proven track record of success is a positive sign, since it means they've done their due diligence and like what they see.But it doesn't mean the stocks are necessarily in or near a proper buy zone right now. More time may be needed for them to set up a proper buying opportunity.In addition to Apple and Celgene, stocks on this month's list that are forming a base or within buy ranges also include Boeing, medical software firm Cerner (CERN), and casino operator MGM Resorts (MGM).Apple has the distinction of making the new buys screen and also topping the list of new sells this month. The net number of funds selling Apple (151 selling minus 85 buying) was 66.Mastercard (MA) had the second-most net sellers (48), followed by NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) (45) and biotech giant Amgen (AMGN) (30).Despite the number of sellers, each of those stocks continues to show strength, and Amgen is testing a new potential buy zone. On Monday, Amgen jumped past a 182.70 entry in heavy volume. The buy range extends to 191.84.RELATED: Why Mutual Fund Managers Are Betting On Tech, 'Quality' StocksFind And Track The Best Mutual Funds

57,CERN,"Stocks racked up commendable gains in light trade Monday, hauling both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average further above their 50-day moving averages.The session opened boosted by Saturday's announcement of more than $300 billion in long-term deals between U.S. manufacturers and Saudi Arabia, a set of bargains timed to correspond with President Trump's first trip to Saudi Arabia. The news lifted defense plays led by Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon (RTN), as well as National Oilwell Varco (NOV) and others.  Boeing and Lockheed Martin ended up nearly 2%.Ford (F) held its early gain, ending Monday up more than 2% after announcing it had replaced Chief Executive Mark Fields with Jim Hackett, the former CEO of Steelcase (SCS) who has headed Ford's Smart Mobility experimental operations unit.

Revenue soared 58%. But the industry took particular heart in Micron's Q3 outlook, which placed the midpoint of earnings guidance 61% above consensus views. Micron shares ended the week up 11% and at a new high, extended from a February rebound from 10-week support.Under Armour popped 4% following an upgrade to buy, from hold, by Jefferies.

Athenahealth's unique single-instance, multi-tenant cloud model should allow for greater profitability, he said.Athenahealth could extend its services across the entire health care spectrum, Hooker wrote. The firm generates $11 million run-rate from hospitals. Hooker expects that to quadruple over the next year, assuming Athenahealth adds more than 100 new hospital customers in 2017.The firm could also expand into ambulatory surgery centers, long-term care and other underinvested areas of medicine, Hooker wrote.""While on-premise software vendors take decades to build their offerings, Athenahealth is a single instance of software, which allows for one global API with third-party vendors,"" he wrote.

Electronic Arts has topped earnings estimates for the last eight quarters in a row.Results: EPS of 7 cents on non-GAAP revenue of $682 million.EA shares fell 1.5% after hours on the stock market today.No. 2 U.S. firearms maker by revenue Sturm Ruger will report Q2 earnings amid heightened fears for personal safety after a series of situations in which police were ambushed and shot dead, and a number of shootings of unarmed suspects by police. Rising terror attacks in Europe and the U.S. also stoked fears.Estimates: Wall Street expects $1.15 EPS, up 26% from 91 cents a share a year ago. No consensus revenue estimate was available, but the gunmaker reported $140.9 million revenue in Q2 2015, and its revenue has been growing in the mid-20% range. A 24% increase would imply revenue of about $174.7 million. Results: EPS of $1.22 on revenue of $167.9 million.Dividend: 49 cents, up from 48 cents in Q1.Sturm Ruger shares were up 0.2% late Tuesday as it worked on a handle in a base going back to mid-March. Ruger has a potential buy point at 70.40.The FBI reported that firearm background checks, seen as an indicator of gun demand, rose 3% in July from June and was up 37% from a year ago. But the tally was still down about a third from a high reached in December.Wearable fitness tracking device maker Fitbit has been impacted by intense and rising competition from Apple (AAPL), Garmin (GRMN), Samsung and others. Fitbit has a weak 24 IBD Composite Rating, as its sales growth rate has declined over the last three quarters from a respective 253% to 168%, 92% and 50% last quarter.Estimates: Analysts project a 52% decline in Q2 EPS to 11 cents a share on a 44.5% increase in revenue to $578.48 million.Results: EPS of 12 cents on revenue of $587 million.Outlook: Q3 EPS of 17-19 cents, vs. consensus for 17 cents, on revenue of $490 million-$510 million.Fitbit jumped 5.2% late.The maker of chips used in smartphones, wireless network gear and other devices has hitched its wagon to Apple (AAPL), which early this year tanked amid worries that iPhone sales growth was decelerating. But Apple a week ago reported earnings that beat estimates, driving its shares up 6.5% last Wednesday, a good omen for Qorvo.Estimates: Wall Street estimates Qorvo's earnings will drop 3.7% to $1.05 per share and sales will dip 3.4% to $650.62. Qorvo has topped earnings estimates for six straight quarters.Results: EPS of $1.08 on revenue of $698.5 million.Outlook: Q2 revenue of $820 million-$850 million.For a full IBD story on Qorvo's results, click here.Qorvo stock tumbled 4.4%.The maker of software for the health care industry in early April persuaded Universal Health Services (UHS), the second-largest publicly traded hospital chain in the U.S., to upgrade from its Siemens (SIEGY) revenue-tracking software to Cerner's new Millennium Revenue Cycle suite, which could boost Q2 results.Estimates: Cerner's Q2 EPS is projected to rise about 10% to 57 cents on a 7.5% increase in revenue to $1.21 billion.Results: EPS of 58 cents on revenue of $1.22 billion.Cerner shares dropped 0.5%.Paycom, a cloud-based records management software provider continues to grow.

66,CERN,"One way to win a big contract is to persuade existing customers to buy your companion products.Another way to win is to buy your rival and sell your products to your ex-rival's customers.Cerner (CERN), one of the largest makers of software for the health care industry, did it both ways when it persuaded the second-largest publicly traded hospital chain in the U.S., Universal Health Services (UHS), to upgrade from its Siemens (SIEGY) Invision revenue-cycle software to Cerner's new Millennium Revenue Cycle suite.First, Cerner took out the competitor, Siemens Health Services, for $1.3 billion in February 2015. Then it went to work on Siemens' revenue-cycle client Universal Health, which was already a Cerner customer in that it used Cerner's  electronic health records (EHR) and health information management (HIM) software on the clinical side of the medical profession.But for the business side -- to handle patient eligibility, co-pays, coding claims, tracking, collections and following up on claim denials -- Universal Health was using Siemens' Invision.Cerner's new Millennium Revenue Cycle product handles both the medical and business sides, while integrating with the federal government's push toward electronic health records (EHR) and PopHealth analytics to inform medical and administrative decision makers, as well as regulators and policymakers.""The size of the deal is unknown, and considering UHS is switching from one CERN-owned platform (Siemens' Invision) to the core CERN Millennium platform, the contribution will not be as large as if it were a completely new customer,"" said Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Close in a research note Thursday.Hey, money isn't everything.""Just as important as the size of the deal, however, is the signature nature of the Siemens conversion to Millennium Revenue Cycle for Cerner,"" said RBC Capital Markets analyst David Francis in a Thursday research note. ""While the clinical side of Cerner's Millennium offering has been highly regarded for some time, there have been pockets of questions recently about Cerner's revenue-cycle capabilities for large enterprises.""The UHS decision to replace Invision ... is a major conversion and should help Cerner in convincing other Siemens financial users to strongly consider not only moving their clinical platform to Millennium, but their financial solution as well.""Cerner announced the Universal Health deal after Wednesday's market close. In the stock market today, Cerner shares rose 1.4% to a two-month high of 55.98, 26% off an all-time high of 75.72 set nearly a year earlier, April 13, and down 12% for the year.Universal Health stock fell 1% to 123.04, 17% off  its record high of 148.57, set Aug. 5.

67,CERN,"Cisco Systems (CSCO) wants organizational leaders to understand that improving their competitive advantage, not just responding to fear, should inspire their cybersecurity strategy.Fearful tales, however, are hard to ignore. One recent example: Virtually all IT systems of the largest civilian hospital chain in the nation’s capital, including the MedConnect electronic health records system installed by Cerner (CERN), were shut down to prevent the spread of a computer virus in late March.Baltimore-based MedStar Health on March 30 called it a “despicable attack.” The disruption affected thousands of employees and many more patients, and restoration of the systems took days.“Within 48 hours of the malware penetration,” the three main clinical systems were “moving to full restoration,” said MedStar. A Cerner spokeswoman told IBD: “We continue to work closely with our client (MedStar) as the broader IT framework is brought back online.”But a week later, MedStar was still working on it: “Our partner Symantec (SYMC) ... has been on the ground from the start of the situation and has been conducting a thorough forensic analysis,” MedStar said in an update last week, acknowledging it “has worked closely with the FBI throughout this situation.” The company again assured “that we have no evidence of any compromise of patient or associate data.” The Baltimore Sun reported the hospital’s hackers demanded ransom be paid in Bitcoin to unlock the hospital’s maliciously encrypted data.What a pain. What a danger. What a motivation for every organization to get its cybersecurity in order, as if another example were needed.“We’re very familiar with it,” James Mobley, a Cisco security services vice president, told IBD in an interview last week, acknowledging MedStar is a Cisco client.Cisco, the No. 1 maker of computer networking gear and with a growing business in security, plans early next month to release a security survey of business executives. The company says productivity, growth and competitive advantage ought to be motivating cybersecurity decisions, not just fear.Its report, originally set for release early Tuesday, is titled “Nearly One-Third of Businesses View Cybersecurity Primarily as a Growth Enabler.” Silicon Valley-based Cisco, which briefed IBD and other media on the report, found that only a bit more than 30% of 1,014 corporate directors, vice presidents and C-level executives surveyed online “view cybersecurity primarily as an enabler of growth tied to digitization.“Security-led digitizers feel more prepared than others to address cybersecurity challenges in three key digital technology areas: analytics, Internet of Things and cloud computing,"" Cisco said. “As a result, these organizations are far more confident about incorporating digital technologies into their business processes and offerings.""In fact, 44% of executives surveyed consider cybersecurity to be a competitive advantage for their organizations.”Cisco said cybersecurity will drive about $7.6 trillion of digital value over the next decade, with $5.8 trillion resulting from “cybersecurity’s enablement of digital use cases that instigate innovation and growth.”Is this marketing pablum or a legitimate call to action? Cisco has been under pressure to grow as fast as some of the smaller networking and software security firms with which it competes or partners.In its fiscal 2015 ended July 25, Cisco’s overall revenue rose only 4% to $49.16 billion, but its security services sales alone grew 12% to $1.75 billion. Medical IT leader Cerner grew 2015 revenue 30% to $4.42 billion, in part by selling P2Sentinnel and P2Sentinel Security as a Service (P2SaaS) products as a “security, auditing and compliance solution for tracking end-user access to confidential patient data in Mellennium, as well as other non-Cerner clinical solutions and infrastructure systems.”Palo Alto Networks (PANW), which specializes in security software, grew sales 55% last year. Rival Check Point Software (CHKP) saw revenue rise 9%. Symantec, MedStar’s prime cybersecurity contractor, reported pro forma revenue fell 6.3% year over year for its fiscal Q3 ended Jan. 1, adjusting for the sale of its Veritas business.Cisco’s survey data could serve as grist for its hungry marketing-sales machine, but it also provides a heads-up to companies that there’s more to cybersecurity than preventing hacker disruption. When a company is confident it can prevent disruption, this enables minds to focus on everything else.“It’s critically important that we stop thinking about security as a defense-centric approach that is sold by fear, uncertainty and doubt,” Mike Dahn, head of data security for payments firm Square (SQ), said in Cisco's survey results press release. “We need to start thinking about security as an enablement of innovation that actually helps the business go forward.”Cisco stock touched a nearly one-year low of 22.46 in early February, but it has been on an upswing recently. Cisco closed Monday at 27.62, down a fraction.In the meantime, cybersecurity continues to be top of mind. By executive order, the U.S. Commerce Department will host its first Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity meeting on Thursday in Washington, D.C.

68,CERN,"Allscripts Healthcare Solutions (MDRX) stock jumped again Wednesday, with Wall Street ""extremely encouraged"" by a deal to extend Allscripts' information tech to University Hospitals in northeast Ohio through 2024.Meanwhile, Allscripts' No. 1 rival Cerner (CERN) was helping its Baltimore-based customer MedStar, after an apparent virus infected MedStar's computers. The hospital chain -- said to be the the largest civilian health care organization in the Washington, D.C., area -- shut down its entire network ""to prevent virus spread,"" MedStar tweeted Tuesday. ""We have no evidence of compromised information. All facilities remain open.""Wednesday morning, MedStar posted to Facebook: ""Thanks to our IT and Cyber teams, our analysis continues to show no patient or associate data have been compromised. All major clinical systems are working toward full restoration.""Cerner spokeswoman Marlene Bentley advised IBD in an email that “while all systems were taken offline as a precaution, Cerner solutions -- including the MedConnect EHR system -- were not penetrated. The MedConnect system is now online at limited facilities, and we continue to work closely with our client as the broader IT framework is brought back online.”Departing MedStar nurses, meanwhile, told CBS News that staff was delivering care using paper records. Cerner and MedStar entered into a seven-year IT deal in October 2014.Allscripts stock rose as much as 4.6% in the stock market today after rising 5.4% on Tuesday, and closed Wednesday at 13.10, up 2.3%.Cerner stock rose a fraction Wednesday but is 30% off a record high touched nearly a year ago.Allscripts didn't specify the value of the agreement announced Tuesday after the close, but it has already deployed its Sunrise Clinical Manager platform in nine University Hospitals in and around Cleveland. The deal calls for five more Sunrise platforms to be installed in five hospitals recently acquired by UH.The hospital chain will also increase use of Allscripts' database software, called dbMotion, Allscripts said in its announcement.""Because dbMotion harmonizes information from disparate clinical systems and brings actionable data to the point of care, UH will be positioned to more effectively coordinate care across settings,"" Allscripts said.

70,CERN,"Cerner, the nation's large pure-play developer of health care information technology software, late Tuesday did a belly-flop with its Q1 EPS guidance, sending shares sharply lower after hours, though it blew its Q4 earnings out the water.Cerner (CERN) forecast first-quarter earnings per share minus items of 52 to 54 cents on sales of $1.15 billion to $1.2 billion, both metrics up 18% from the year-ago quarter at their midpoints. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting 54 cents on $1.178 billion.  In either case, the performance would represent slowing growth. In the year-ago Q1, Cerner grew adjusted EPS 22% and sales 27%.The North Kansas City, Mo.-based company said it expects Q1 new-business bookings of $1.15 billion to $1.25 billion, the midpoint flat with Q1 2015,  which had risen 32% from Q1 2014.Cerner is facing single-digit hospital IT spending growth of about 8%, up from 6% to 7% in 2015,  as clinicians struggle to keep up with software innovation. Federal rule makers are requiring more health care technology updates while changing the game, complicating buying decisions.For its Q4 ended Jan. 2, Cerner said EPS rose 30% to 61 cents per share minus items, while revenue rose 27% to $1.175 billion. Revenue met analyst views, while EPS beat by 4 cents.Cerner stock was down more than 13% in after-hours trading, after the company released its Q4 results. Cerner stock rose 1% to 55.46 in the stock market today, 26% off its all-time high of 75.72 set April 13. Smaller rival Athenahealth (ATHN)  rose 7.7% Tuesday but was down more than 1% after hours. Rivals Allscsripts (MDRX) and Quality Systems (QSII) were flat in after-hours trading.Cerner said its Q4 bookings rose 16% to $1.35 billion.“Our fourth-quarter results reflect a solid finish to a record year,” Cerner President Zane Burke said in the earnings release. “In 2015, we added more than double the number of new EHR (electronic health records) clients than any year in our history, including both large health systems and small hospitals. We also continued to advance our cloud-based HealtheIntent platform and had a very strong year of selling our population health solutions both inside and outside our EHR installed base.”For this year, Cerner forecasts EPS ex items of $2.30 to $2.40, on revenue of $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion. Wall Street had modeled, $2.36 EPS minus items on $5.02 billion in revenue.

"
78,CERN,"Though the U.S. government has been in lockdown since Oct. 1, on that day enrollment started for health insurance exchanges, one of the main features of the Affordable Care Act.
"
79,CERN,"John Bardis, founder and CEO of medical software and services provider MedAssets (MDAS), has been warning that the exchanges are one contributing factor in a ""reimbursement cliff"" that health care providers are about to face. Adding to that is the longer-term trend of baby boomers joining Medicare and leaving private health insurance, which has been shouldering a disproportionate share of payments. Bardis says the shrunken revenue will make operating efficiency — which he says his company can provide — all the more crucial.
"
80,CERN,"MedAssets, founded in 1999 and publicly traded since 2007, is a member of IBD's Computer Software-Medical group. But like many of its peers such as Athenahealth (ATHN) and Cerner (CERN), it identifies less as a software vendor than as a provider of a broad range of products and services to help hospitals and clinics manage their back-office functions.
"
81,CERN,"In a recent interview with IBD, Bardis explained just what MedAssets does and how it fits into the changing landscape.
"
82,CERN,"IBD: Can you summarize why you think reimbursement is falling, and how MedAssets can help?
"
83,CERN,"Bardis: If you go back to the foundation of Medicare, every payment for any service whatsoever was structured on a cost-plus basis. If you provide any service to Medicare, you get (reimbursed for) cost, plus an additional defined margin over cost back to the government. So we set the foundation for a never-ending process of cost increase.
"
84,CERN,"Unfortunately, the private sector used the same cost infrastructure approach. So we had an arms race for costs all the way through 1983. That's when the diagnosis-related groups system for providers was established, which put cost caps on pre-existing cost infrastructures by hospital across the country for the same procedures. (But) the result was that we had thousands of different health care providers providing the exact same procedures at thousands of different prices.
"
85,CERN,"What MedAssets does in dealing with four out of five U.S. hospitals is that we understand what best practice looks like as it relates to cost of delivery, and we're able to view the differences (between providers) in how those costs are deployed and how they're paid for. Based on that data, we're able to recommend courses of actions (including) the integrated coordination of care that allows more effective handoffs in the care of patients. That eliminates the silos that have been created in a cost-plus environment.
"
86,CERN,"Remember, physicians were also highly incented to be volume-driven and focused only on their own level of care. They were not incented at all to coordinate the integration of care, or be concerned with how someone else was going to be paid for things that the physician wasn't responsible for. Doctors were highly incented to produce as many units as they possibly can, at the highest price they can. The specialists' handoff to one another was not coordinated in any way.
"
87,CERN,"This new environment is getting much more focused on ensuring that the total wellness of patients leads to an outcome that they can measure and justify for the dollars that are being spent. Central to that is the coordination of care in the place (where it's) most expensive to deliver: the hospital. We literally manage the cost of $55 billion of supply expense, but we also manage the coordination of how those particular supplies are utilized — not unlike the supply chain in relationship to an automobile, and how it's built and is ultimately delivered to the consumer.
"
88,CERN,"We coordinate the use of items with clinical interface, oftentimes led by physicians, who contemplate how a product is to be utilized in the face of available resources that they use to deliver the care, and the price of the product, with an outcome in mind. The average hospital is less than 60% in terms of its utilization of contracting price to maximum performance. There's a great deal of coordination yet to be done, and a great opportunity to reduce the cost of care.

89,CERN,"The nature of how health care has been paid for has been governmental and industrial. What is different about the Affordable Care Act is that the exchanges will be made up of individuals. They will, for the first time, be highly incented to acquire their health care. This is the biggest change I'm aware of since the institution of Medicare.
"
90,CERN,"IBD: How does the trend of baby boomers moving to Medicare from private insurance play into this?
"
91,CERN,"Bardis: (Let's say) we were to look at a graph and just say the horizontal axis is cost (of health care). Then, when you go up above it about 70 points, that's (what) private insurance (pays), and when you go below it 15 points, you have Medicare. What's happening with that 170% line is that about 5,000 people a day are leaving it, and they're going to Medicare at 85% of costs.
"
92,CERN,"And 7 million people this year (are projected to join) the new exchanges, and potentially within the next five years, 20 million or more. Those exchanges were priced at what we believe is substantially below that 170% level.
"
93,CERN,"IBD: How is MedAssets differentiated from its competitors in terms of dealing with this environment?
"
94,CERN,"Bardis: We not only know how to execute the best practice, but we know how to provide the data analytics that bracket it, so that we can continue to provide insight every day on how their current performance and resource management is comparing to best practice. We constantly cycle through the use of that data in order to evolve best practice, and provide the benchmark.
"
95,CERN,"In a very defined time frame, we're able to make commitments to cost reductions that are very specific, and then we achieve them. Over and above our traditional ability to drive down costs, we've done over $3 billion of identified and guaranteed savings. We've never missed a number.
"
96,CERN,"IBD: Is the revenue cycle management, or bill collecting, side of the business also differentiated? There are a number of other companies that offer that service.
"
97,CERN,"Bardis: We do a great deal of work to coordinate payment with clinical expectation in contracts. So payors provide contracts for providers to do the delivery-of-care work. We coordinate that delivery of care with payment in a way that rationalizes the rules as to how value is derived. So it's not strictly about revenue — it's about getting the right payment for the right expected outcome.
"
98,CERN,"Revenue cycle management is a very relevant factor in doing the work that we do, because it continues to require the use of work-flow enhancement to make sure you're managing revenue process more efficiently (and) the documentation required for how payor contracts work.Though the U.S. government has been in lockdown since Oct. 1, on that day enrollment started for health insurance exchanges, one of the main features of the Affordable Care Act.John Bardis, founder and CEO of medical software and services provider MedAssets (MDAS), has been warning that the exchanges are one contributing factor in a ""reimbursement cliff"" that health care providers are about to face. Adding to that is the longer-term trend of baby boomers joining Medicare and leaving private health insurance, which has been shouldering a disproportionate share of payments. Bardis says the shrunken revenue will make operating efficiency — which he says his company can provide — all the more crucial.MedAssets, founded in 1999 and publicly traded since 2007, is a member of IBD's Computer Software-Medical group. But like many of its peers such as Athenahealth (ATHN) and Cerner (CERN), it identifies less as a software vendor than as a provider of a broad range of products and services to help hospitals and clinics manage their back-office functions.In a recent interview with IBD, Bardis explained just what MedAssets does and how it fits into the changing landscape.IBD: Can you summarize why you think reimbursement is falling, and how MedAssets can help?Bardis: If you go back to the foundation of Medicare, every payment for any service whatsoever was structured on a cost-plus basis. If you provide any service to Medicare, you get (reimbursed for) cost, plus an additional defined margin over cost back to the government. So we set the foundation for a never-ending process of cost increase.Unfortunately, the private sector used the same cost infrastructure approach. So we had an arms race for costs all the way through 1983. That's when the diagnosis-related groups system for providers was established, which put cost caps on pre-existing cost infrastructures by hospital across the country for the same procedures. (But) the result was that we had thousands of different health care providers providing the exact same procedures at thousands of different prices.What MedAssets does in dealing with four out of five U.S. hospitals is that we understand what best practice looks like as it relates to cost of delivery, and we're able to view the differences (between providers) in how those costs are deployed and how they're paid for. Based on that data, we're able to recommend courses of actions (including) the integrated coordination of care that allows more effective handoffs in the care of patients. That eliminates the silos that have been created in a cost-plus environment.Remember, physicians were also highly incented to be volume-driven and focused only on their own level of care. They were not incented at all to coordinate the integration of care, or be concerned with how someone else was going to be paid for things that the physician wasn't responsible for. Doctors were highly incented to produce as many units as they possibly can, at the highest price they can. The specialists' handoff to one another was not coordinated in any way.This new environment is getting much more focused on ensuring that the total wellness of patients leads to an outcome that they can measure and justify for the dollars that are being spent. Central to that is the coordination of care in the place (where it's) most expensive to deliver: the hospital. We literally manage the cost of $55 billion of supply expense, but we also manage the coordination of how those particular supplies are utilized — not unlike the supply chain in relationship to an automobile, and how it's built and is ultimately delivered to the consumer.We coordinate the use of items with clinical interface, oftentimes led by physicians, who contemplate how a product is to be utilized in the face of available resources that they use to deliver the care, and the price of the product, with an outcome in mind. The average hospital is less than 60% in terms of its utilization of contracting price to maximum performance. There's a great deal of coordination yet to be done, and a great opportunity to reduce the cost of care.The nature of how health care has been paid for has been governmental and industrial. What is different about the Affordable Care Act is that the exchanges will be made up of individuals. They will, for the first time, be highly incented to acquire their health care.

99,CERN,"Has Quality Systems, the up and coming health care information tech (HCIT) company, done come and gone? The company disappointed with its fiscal third-quarter earnings and hazy guidance, released after the close Thursday. Quality Systems (QSII) stock gapped down 23% to a 12.51 three-month low early trading in the stock market today before recovering a bit and closing Friday at…
"
100,CERN,"Health care information technology is growing fitfully -- hurt and helped by government policies. Still, HCIT software makers Cerner (CERN), Allscripts (MDRX), Athenahealth (ATHN) and Quality Systems (QSII) are expected to see their combined revenue rise more than 12% this year to $8.14 billion, and 11%, to $9 billion, next year, Wall Street analysts estimate.That's an achievement, since the biggest spenders -- hospitals -- are expected to increase their IT budgets by only 8% in 2016, up from 6%-7% in 2015, says analyst Matthew Gillmor with investment banker Robert W. Baird.That 8% increase will be shared with other companies that compete in HCIT, including IBM's (IBM) Watson Health, an analytics provider launched last year that is expected to ramp up to 2,000 employees. Another rival is Verona, Wis.-based, privately held Epic Systems, which employs some 8,500 workers and reportedly generated $1.7 billion in sales in 2014.The workforce for Kansas City, Mo.-based Cerner, the largest of the HCIT software pure plays, reached 22,000 employees last year after the company acquired Siemens Health Services for $1.3 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Cerner's revenue to rise 13% in 2016, to $5.01 billion.HCIT growth faces a unique struggle, heavily influenced by policymakers in Washington, D.C., determined to expand and improve care while keeping a lid on patient costs. While federal rules have stimulated HCIT growth, they're also challenging hospitals' ability to keep up, compromising doctors and nurses' ability and time to provide care, some observers say.The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which includes the Health Information Technology (HITECH) Act, established the Electronic Health Records Incentive Programs that reward and punish hospitals and doctors’ practices for the pace of their EHR transition. Then the Affordable Care Act of 2010, better known as ObamaCare, and most recently the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA), which became law in April, also hasten higher HCIT standards.In between the lawmaking, rule writers continue to draft implementation language that the federal director of HCIT standards in October called an ""IT bonanza.""This is good for the software vendors as they race to refine and sell Population Health software. PopHealth records expenses, tracks patient care and outcomes, incorporates patients’ evaluations of their care, parses data from similar patient populations, encourages communication between caregivers, and collects performance metrics throughout a hospital -- all intended to improve patient care while giving regulators tools to measure compliance.Cerner calls its PopHealth platform HealtheIntent and says it's used ""to address the growing demand, payer pressures and policy mandates organizations face today.""Those policy mandates are driving some doctors, nurses and hospital IT executives up the wall -- and some are pushing back.At this month's JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, where Cerner was among presenters, Andy Slavitt, acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which oversees HCIT, tweeted: ""In 2016, MU as it has existed – with MACRA – will now be effectively over and replaced with something better.""In other words, the rules are changing again, maybe.MU is meaningful use, a protocol that has guided health care IT spending and systems development, and which the director of HCIT standards, Steven Posnack, has been implementing with a certification process under the auspices of MACRA. (At 39,010 words, MACRA is 10% the length of ObamaCare, which most consider complex.)In November, Dr. John Halamka went public with the case for changing or eliminating MU.""I’m likely going to violate many rules with this post,"" he prefaced in a blog post. He's chief information officer of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, the 631-bed teaching hospital for Harvard Medical School. Halamka wrote in a post titled ""The Path Forward for Meaningful Use"" that MU had outlived its usefulness and is doing damage.""Stage 1 created a foundation of functionality for everyone,"" Halamka wrote. ""That was good.""Stage 2 tried to change too much too fast and required an ecosystem of applications and infrastructure that did not exist. ... Stage 3 makes many of the same mistakes as Stage 2, trying to do too much too soon. ...""Clinicians cannot get through a 12-minute visit, enter the necessary Stage 3 data elements, reconcile problems/allergies/medications from multiple institutions, meet the demands of the Stage 3 clinical quality measures, make eye contact with patients and deliver safe medical care. There needs to be a new approach.”As a veteran medical-surgical registered nurse at a big California hospital told IBD: ""We’re set up to fail.""This uncertainty helps explain why HCIT spending is growing slowly as hospital administrators hesitate to invest in systems requiring, as Halamka put it, ""infrastructure that did not exist"" under a ""meaningful use"" protocol of questionable viability for a MACRA law just 9 months old, with pending regulations yet to come.Two days after Slavitt's declaration to do away with MU under MACRA, his office issued its regular newsletter, ""What's Happening in Health IT,"" highlighting news of the ""Adopted 2015 Edition Criteria for Testing and Certification Under the Health IT Certification Program"" and ""In Preparation for Testing, ONC Publishes Certification Companion Guides,"" among other HCIT must-reads.""HCIT spending is still in the process of resetting post the MU bonanza, but the overall environment remains healthy,"" said Baird analyst Gillmor in a research note issued Jan. 8.He says the electronic health records replacement ""opportunity remains elusive,"" even though many hospitals need to get moving on their EHR efforts.Chicago-based HIMSS Analytics says only 4% of U.S. hospitals had achieved the most advanced Stage 7 of EMR proficiency as of Q3 2015, with 25% in Stage 6 and the remainder at the lower levels.""Replacement activity has been slow, and we expect this will continue in 2016,"" said Gillmor. ""CERN and Epic will continue to win the lion's share of replacements.""

135,CERN,"MedAssets (MDAS) stock got a lift Wednesday after the medical software maker announced plans to cut 5% of its workforce, or roughly 180 jobs, by year's end.MedAssets stock was up 4.5% in afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 20. On Tuesday, shares touched a nearly six-month low, below 19.MedAssets expects restructuring expenses of $11 million, with $5 million of that to be recorded in the third quarter and the remainder in Q4. The company says the reduction should bring $21 million in savings, adding 4 cents to 5 cents a share to 2015 earnings. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters now expect full-year earnings of $1.23 a share for 2015, down from $1.35 last year.Analysts said the cuts would enable the company to get its costs in line with expected 2016 revenue, as the company recently lost a key contract with Tenet Healthcare (THC), but they weren't raising their ratings on the stock.""On the one hand, we are impressed by today's announcement of $21 million in cost savings and the rationalization of underperforming products.

202,CERN,"Medical sector stocks delivered strong gains in 2014.
"
203,CERN,"Among the stocks in this week's Big Cap 20, medical-related issues gained 16% to 67% last year. Are any of these stocks poised to deliver further price gains in 2015, or are these stocks spent?
"
204,CERN,"Let's look at three with bases that aren't late stage.
"
205,CERN,"The stock of San Diego-based gene sequencing company Illumina (ILMN) rose 67% in 2014.
"
206,CERN,"When full-year earnings are tallied, the Street expects 47% growth in EPS. That would be the best earnings growth since 2008.
"
207,CERN,"Analysts expect earnings growth to slow to 20% in 2015, which is roughly in line with the company's three- and five-year growth rates of 21% and 22%, respectively.
"
208,CERN,"While 20% growth is below the CAN SLIM minimum of 25%, an earnings beat of 4.4% for the year would bring the gain to 25%. In the most recent quarter, earnings topped views by about 38%. After-tax margin was almost 24%, the best in at least 18 quarters.
"
209,CERN,"Illumina is sketching a flat base, which is early stage because of a base-count reset in October 2013. The usual entry would be at 197.47 — the left-side high plus 10 cents.
"
210,CERN,"However, the daily chart shows a W-like pattern, arguably with an earlier entry at 196.10.
"
211,CERN,"Individual investors interested in establishing a position should watch to see if the stock can clear that area in strong volume.
"
212,CERN,"AmerisourceBergen (ABC) posted a 28% gain in its stock price in 2014. The pharmaceutical sourcing and distribution company is in an industry group that carries thin profit margins. After-tax margin in Q3 was 0.8%, which is typical for AmerisourceBergen.
"
213,CERN,"Earnings are expected to grow 12% in fiscal 2015 ending in September, a slowdown vs. fiscal 2014's 24% pop.
"
214,CERN,"Amerisource is extended from a October breakout. However, the stock has retreated to its 10-week line for the first time since the breakout. A first or second trip to the line can present a buying opportunity, if the stock bounces off the line in strong volume.
"
215,CERN,"The stock price of medical software provider Cerner (CERN) rose 16% last year, roughly in line with the Nasdaq's 13% gain.
"
216,CERN,"Earnings grew 17.5% in 2013, and the Street expects nearly the same in 2014 and then a pickup to 19% growth in 2015. That's below the firm's three- and five-year growth rates of 21% and 23% respectively.
"
217,CERN,"Pretax margin stepped up every year since at least 2006, swinging from 12% in 2005 to almost 26% in 2013. Full-year results for 2014 are expected in early February.
"
218,CERN,"Cerner is just beyond the 5% buy zone after clearing a 60.47 buy point in October. The base was first stage.

219,CERN,"For growth investors, Illumina and Cerner look more appealing than Amerisource.

Economists had forecast a more mild 0.6% slip. The bulk of the miss was apparently due to a sharp decline in aircraft orders during the month. Minus transportation, durable goods orders rose 0.5% — in line with expectations. So far this year, durable goods orders are running 2.2% below last year's January to May period.
"
231,CERN,"Housing prices improved steadily in May, lifting the Federal Housing Finance Agency's House Price Index 0.3%. That increase was equal to March's increase but just below consensus forecasts for a 0.4% gain. Year over year, the index is up 5.3%.

Its Purchasing Managers Manufacturing Index was at 53.4, down from May's 53.8 number and below forecasts for an increase to 54.2.

236,CERN,"Citrix Systems (CTXS) pecked out a 2% gain, the best increase among Nasdaq 100 stocks. The Fort Lauderdale-headquartered software developer is still in buying range, 4% above a 69.33 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.

241,CERN,"""It never was my thinking that made the big money for me. It always was my sitting.""So said Jesse Livermore in the classic ""Reminiscences of a Stock Operator.""IBD founder Bill O'Neil can also relate. One of his most successful investments was Syntex, the developer of the birth-control pill, in the 1960s. But he didn't make money by simply trading it. He made money by sitting as well.Make no mistake, though. It's not easy being patient with a big winner. Fact is, few investors capitalized fully on Home Depot's (HD) 20-fold move in less than two years from its IPO in September 1981.And how many investors held on to Cisco Systems (CSCO) when it soared more than 80,000% between October 1990 and March 2000? Not many.Remember that stock you bought last year? You took a 20% profit, only to see the stock rise another 150% from where you sold it.You're not alone. After a few stinging losses, or due to fear of the future, it's human nature to nail down a quick gain to get your confidence back.The process of learning how to buy a growth stock is hard enough. Handling it after you buy is even harder. Here are some tips to help you learn how to hold better. Be early. A breakout generally has the best chance of working in the early stages of a bull market — not the latter stages. This is an important point, and it's certainly relevant to today's market.Five-plus years into a bull market, recent breakouts have been a mixed bag at best. Expect a pullback. Sometimes, volatility hits a stock after a breakout and the breakout falls apart. Other times, a breakout shows great promise, but sellers come into the stock and it erases a double-digit gain. In both cases, cutting losses or selling to nail down a gain is smart even if the stock eventually turns into a big winner.Keep watching the stock. It may offer a second chance to buy it back. If it becomes a winner, give it room to run. Don't fear major corrections. Emerging leaders with outstanding fundamentals tend to do the best in the early stages of a new bull market. The strong bull markets that started in March 2003 and March 2009 came after extremely sharp pullbacks for the major averages. Both bear-market declines flushed sellers out — so much so that it wasn't hard for stocks to gain traction after both uptrends were confirmed with follow-through days.After a 19% pullback for the Nasdaq in April to July 2010 that flushed a lot of sellers out, the Nasdaq soared 3% in higher volume on Sept. 1 (please see a daily chart), confirming a new uptrend.On Nov. 24, Cerner (CERN) cleared a cup-with-handle pattern with a buy point of 44.54 (adjusted for a 2-for-1 split). In this case, it was an easy winner to hold. A big market shakeout earlier in the year helped.Some volatility hit the champion in electronic medical records management in the second half of 2011. A 53% gain from the buy point temporarily shrank to 21%. Some investors might have decided to take profits, but those with conviction in the stock could afford to sit through the selling. They could also have added shares as the stock broke again in February 2012.

248,CERN,"Monday brought news of yet another large acquisition of a U.S. company by a German industry titan, adding up to the biggest year on record for German-American buyouts.
"
249,CERN,"Drugmaker Merck KGaA said it will buy St. Louis-based Sigma-Aldrich  (SIAL), which supplies chemicals and kits to the life-science industry, for $17 billion. Diversified giant Siemens (SIEGY) on Sunday night confirmed last week's rumors that it is buying Houston oil-drilling equipment firm Dresser-Rand (DRC) for $7.6 billion.
"
250,CERN,"On Sept. 18, software maker SAP (SAP) inked a $7.4 billion deal for Bellevue, Wash.-based Concur Technologies (CNQR), which provides cloud-based expense-report and travel software. A few days earlier, Michigan auto-parts maker TRW Automotive (TRW) agreed to become part of ZF Friedrichshafen for $11.74 billion.
"
251,CERN,"And not to be forgotten is Bayer's (BAYRY) $14.2 billion deal to buy the consumer business of the U.S. Merck (MRK) (long divorced from the German Merck), hammered out in May.
"
252,CERN,"In total, there has been $64.5 billion worth of German acquisitions of U.S. targets in 2014, according to Thomson Reuters. That beats any full year in the 20 years that Thomson has tracked.
"
253,CERN,"""Three of the four largest-ever German acquisitions in the United States have taken place this year, the largest-ever being Daimler-Benz's acquisition of Chrysler back in 1998,"" said Richard Peterson, senior director at S&P Capital IQ.
"
254,CERN,"Refocusing On No. 1
"
255,CERN,"What's driving the trend? Some of the most venerable German giants have been reorganizing and refocusing their businesses, reflected in the fact that they've been selling as well as buying. Just last week Bayer announced that it's spinning off its polymer business into a separate company. Last month, Siemens agreed to sell its health care IT business to Cerner (CERN) for $1.3 billion.
"
256,CERN,"There are also industry-specific reasons why they chose their targets. Big pharma's acquisition strategy has been guided for the last few years by the idea that a product category isn't worth being in unless you're No. 1 or No. 2, which the Bayer and Merck buyouts help accomplish. SAP's buyout expanded the company further into the hot cloud-computing space, while Dresser-Rand brings Siemens a play on the shale-oil boom.
"
257,CERN,"Betting On America
"
258,CERN,"Even so, the sheer amount of money moving from Germany to the U.S. is suggestive. Merck will pay a 37% premium on Sigma-Aldrich's Friday close. That's also the premium Siemens is paying on Dresser-Rand's stock price before rumors drove it up. Both deals are also all in cash.
"
259,CERN,"""One factor that might connect the various deals (but I would not overstretch this point) is that emerging market growth has slowed down a little and the political risk in these markets receives more attention again,"" Christian Stadler, associate professor at the Warwick Business School in Coventry, U.K., told IBD in an email. ""This means that developed markets are gaining more interest again. Now once you look at developed markets, you notice that the U.S. is doing better than Europe and Japan.""
"
260,CERN,"S&P's Peterson cited signs that the European economy is slowing, which encourages companies to buy their way to growth. Lack of revenue gains is a unifying theme of all these buyers: the top performer among them is SAP, whose sales grew a whopping 8% year-over-year last quarter.
"
261,CERN,"Peterson also suggested that the stronger dollar might be putting the German buyers in more of a hurry to close the deals before their targets get too pricey.
"
262,CERN,"Dresser-Rand rose nearly 3% to 81.97 on Monday vs. its 83-a-share deal price. The stock rose 17% last week. Siemens fell less than 1% after sliding 2% Friday.

That beats any full year in the 20 years that Thomson has tracked.""Three of the four largest-ever German acquisitions in the United States have taken place this year, the largest-ever being Daimler-Benz's acquisition of Chrysler back in 1998,"" said Richard Peterson, senior director at S&P Capital IQ.Refocusing On No. 1What's driving the trend? Some of the most venerable German giants have been reorganizing and refocusing their businesses, reflected in the fact that they've been selling as well as buying. Just last week Bayer announced that it's spinning off its polymer business into a separate company. Last month, Siemens agreed to sell its health care IT business to Cerner (CERN) for $1.3 billion.There are also industry-specific reasons why they chose their targets. Big pharma's acquisition strategy has been guided for the last few years by the idea that a product category isn't worth being in unless you're No. 1 or No. 2, which the Bayer and Merck buyouts help accomplish. SAP's buyout expanded the company further into the hot cloud-computing space, while Dresser-Rand brings Siemens a play on the shale-oil boom.Betting On AmericaEven so, the sheer amount of money moving from Germany to the U.S. is suggestive. Merck will pay a 37% premium on Sigma-Aldrich's Friday close. That's also the premium Siemens is paying on Dresser-Rand's stock price before rumors drove it up. Both deals are also all in cash.""One factor that might connect the various deals (but I would not overstretch this point) is that emerging market growth has slowed down a little and the political risk in these markets receives more attention again,"" Christian Stadler, associate professor at the Warwick Business School in Coventry, U.K., told IBD in an email. ""This means that developed markets are gaining more interest again. Now once you look at developed markets, you notice that the U.S. is doing better than Europe and Japan.""S&P's Peterson cited signs that the European economy is slowing, which encourages companies to buy their way to growth. Lack of revenue gains is a unifying theme of all these buyers: the top performer among them is SAP, whose sales grew a whopping 8% year-over-year last quarter.Peterson also suggested that the stronger dollar might be putting the German buyers in more of a hurry to close the deals before their targets get too pricey.Dresser-Rand rose nearly 3% to 81.97 on Monday vs. its 83-a-share deal price. The stock rose 17% last week. Siemens fell less than 1% after sliding 2% Friday.Sigma-Aldrich jumped 33% to 136.40 vs. its 140 offering price.

264,CERN,"Health care IT company Athenahealth has always seen itself as a disruptor.
"
265,CERN,"The company was among the first to provide practice-management software to doctors entirely through the cloud, rather than with installed systems.
"
266,CERN,"And since 2011, it's been running a project whose name is a demand: More Disruption Please.
"
267,CERN,"More Disruption Please is a kind of incubator, in which health IT startups pitch Athenahealth (ATHN) on why they offer a value-added service for Athenahealth's clients.
"
268,CERN,"Athenahealth picks its favorites and makes them available to clients through its network, in a system that's been compared with Apple's (AAPL) App Store.
"
269,CERN,"Athenahealth CEO Jonathan Bush plucked Kyle Armbrester fresh from Harvard Business School to develop the program. Armbrester, vice president of business development, spoke with IBD about how the project began.
"
270,CERN,"IBD: How did the More Disruption Please concept get started?
"
271,CERN,"Armbrester: When I came to Athena, we were one of the best technology-enabled services companies in the market. We're very good at building these technology-enabled services like Collector, Clinicals and Communicator.
"
272,CERN,"But what we noticed was twofold. One, we have a large distribution network with all of these providers and patients that were interconnected. And two, we were never going to be everything to everyone. We were never going to build a product that satisfied every need.
"
273,CERN,"And there was a fantastic business model from the consumer space of having an open-platform type concept. So we looked to Amazon (AMZN) and Salesforce (CRM) and Facebook (FB) and other titans of technology to take that particular model and align it with our cloud-based infrastructure.
"
274,CERN,"Our unique spin is that, because we take a percentage of net collection, we don't actually partner with technology companies. We partner with outcomes companies like ourselves. So to be a part of the More Disruption Please program, we give our partner the scorecard, and that scorecard shows how they're either driving more revenue to the doctors for doing the right things, or decreasing operational inefficiencies inside the providers' workflow, or helping to improve patient and provider outcomes.
"
275,CERN,"There are a few examples of that. We measure things like documentation time — how long the doctor is inside the EMR (electronic medical record). We want them out of the EMR as much as possible. We want them seeing patients, because we win and the doctor wins when that happens.
"
276,CERN,"We also look at things like charge-entry lag. When each charge gets captured, there's a lag time to when it actually gets put in the system, and there's a delay in payment because of that. So we work with our partners to attack some of these metrics that we know help our doctors perform clinically and financially in the best way possible.
"
277,CERN,"That's really the crux of the MDP program. We find best-in-breed cloud-based technologies, build free connectivity with them and then help them spread throughout our cloud-based network with our providers.
"
278,CERN,"IBD: How has your process evolved since you started? Have you learned as you've gone along about selecting the right companies?
"
279,CERN,"Armbrester: Yes, absolutely. When I showed up, we had no advance connectivity. The process for partnership was pretty ad hoc, and we built custom interfaces. It wasn't really scalable.
"
280,CERN,"I think the biggest changes have been twofold. One, we've built good awareness around the program inside the industry and inside our client base. Which is important, because our clients look at the MDP label as a mark of distinction for these partners, because they know that Athena is doing our jobs as stewards of the network, making sure that they're driving performance.
"
281,CERN,"Number two, and my real goal in wanting to come to Athena, is to drive more energy into the health IT space. Right before I decided to go into health IT I wanted to start something else — I always had a technology background — (then) got interested in health through a project I was working on, and quickly realized that the barriers to entry for scaling inside the health IT space were really on the connectivity side.
"
282,CERN,"You had large client-server systems, by Cerner (CERN) and Allscripts (MDRX) and others, to dominate the landscape, and interfacing with those custom systems in those large silos is impossible. For an entrepreneur to scale something that actually has a meaningful impact on physicians and patients and their workflow is really, really hard. So on a conceptual level, what I bought into with Jon (Bush), was his vision to lower that barrier to entry for entrepreneurs and to, like Justin Timberlake, 'bring sexy back' to HIT (health care IT).
"
283,CERN,"IBD: Can you give an example of a company you've selected through this process and how that's played out?
"
284,CERN,"Armbrester: One of our best partners is a company called Entrada. They do cloud-based, real-time speech-to-text, and cloud-based transcription.
"
285,CERN,"We give these small startup companies five clients right out the gate, and we run a beta (test) process. During the beta process we optimize them, we tweak them, we get the user experience right, we give them a scorecard (and) we measure results. This gives them an ROI (return on investment) that they can then go sell to our clients. They can say, ""Listen, we're moving documentation in time, we're moving same-day encounter close rates, and all these other metrics so you can get paid more quickly and see more patients efficiently.""
"
286,CERN,"With Entrada, we took them through that process. And after they move out of that, they move into something we call ""generally available."" That means they're open to anybody inside Athena to use.
"
287,CERN,"We launched them last year, and since then they've signed 45 accounts inside Athena. Some of those accounts have hundreds of doctors, some of them have two to three doctors. They're driving documentation time lower for all those practices. It's been fantastic to see them transform from a very small startup into a company that has dozens and dozens of clients in less than a year's time.Health care IT company Athenahealth has always seen itself as a disruptor.The company was among the first to provide practice-management software to doctors entirely through the cloud, rather than with installed systems.And since 2011, it's been running a project whose name is a demand: More Disruption Please.More Disruption Please is a kind of incubator, in which health IT startups pitch Athenahealth (ATHN) on why they offer a value-added service for Athenahealth's clients.Athenahealth picks its favorites and makes them available to clients through its network, in a system that's been compared with Apple's (AAPL) App Store.Athenahealth CEO Jonathan Bush plucked Kyle Armbrester fresh from Harvard Business School to develop the program.

289,CERN,"It's been a big year for IPOs, but one of its wildest days was March 14, when Castlight Health soared 149% on its first day of trading. The stock hit a market cap of more than $4 billion, for a company with 2013 revenue of just $13 million.
"
290,CERN,"Though the stock's come closer to earth since then, Castlight (CSLT) continued the comeback for health care IT IPOs. Drug IPOs have gone gangbusters since early last year, but HCITs didn't get rolling until the fall, when Benefitfocus (BNFT) and Veeva Systems (VEEV) debuted.
"
291,CERN,"Two more HCIT IPOs are scheduled: on Thursday, consumer-oriented health website Everyday Health (EVDY), and next week, in a stark contrast to all the tiny startups, venerable health-industry data and consulting services provider IMS Health (IMS).
"
292,CERN,"About 125 HCIT companies in the portfolios of top venture capital and private equity firms are ""ripening"" to where they're ready for an exit, says Paul Teitelbaum, managing director at boutique investment bank Mesirow Financial.
"
293,CERN,"Teitelbaum expects most of those exits will be buyouts, but he also expects more to go public this year since so few went out last year.
"
294,CERN,"""People (were) waiting to see how the Affordable Care Act was going to roll out and how that was going to impact various different sectors of health care,"" he said. ""Some of the companies who were looking to exit were holding off until they reached certain levels of revenue and profitability.""
"
295,CERN,"The small size of most of the IPO candidates is in part because many were started during the Obama administration. The 2009 stimulus package included incentives toward digitizing health care, particularly medical records, which led to a boom in HCIT stocks already trading as well as the formation of more startups.
"
296,CERN,"Most of the established stocks in IBD's Computer Software-Medical Industry Group, such as Cerner (CERN) and Allscripts (MDRX), sell products that help run hospitals and doctors' offices, so they took naturally to electronic health records.
"
297,CERN,"The more recent IPOs, however, have a more eclectic variety of business models. Castlight and Benefitfocus both help employers shop for health plans, while Veeva's software handles sales and marketing functions for drugmakers.
"
298,CERN,"Analyst Michael Cherny of ISI Group says the newer companies had to carve out their own niches.
"
299,CERN,"""In an environment where there are so many established competitive players in the pure electronic-health-record/practice management market, the fact that there are other technologies that are needed creates an opportunity for venture-capital-backed companies to create business models that just now are big enough to stand alone as public companies,"" he said.
"
300,CERN,"Teitelbaum says one need that became more apparent as ObamaCare rolled out was for consumers to take more control of their health care, as they often end up shouldering more of the expenses. Castlight, Benefitfocus and Everyday Health all pitch their consumer focus as a major selling point.
"
301,CERN,"Along that line, he says Vitals and Healthgrades are two consumer-oriented health companies he sees ripening for possible IPOs. Both help users find and rate physicians, in a similar way to how you might find a plumber on Angie's List (ANGI).
"
302,CERN,"Providers, meanwhile, are facing a world where more than ever their pay will be tied to outcomes, which creates business for companies offering population health management and disease-management software.
"
303,CERN,"Among the possible IPOs in that field, Teitelbaum points to MediMedia, which has both a population-health arm and a consumer arm, and America Well, which assists disease management by letting doctors and patients consult online.
"
304,CERN,"The old practice-management field also might produce a few more IPOs. Both Teitelbaum and Cherny point to Practice Fusion, which offers online electronic health records for free. Cherny also highlights CareCloud, which offers both records and other practice-management solutions online.
"
305,CERN,"Since these companies are small enough to be ""emerging"" under the Jobs Act, they can file confidentially, so investors might not know when these firms are going public until a couple weeks before their debuts. Meanwhile, Teitelbaum and Cherny note, we shouldn't expect another Castlight anytime soon — either in terms of how early in its life cycle it went out, or the massive valuation.

313,CERN,"Investors looking for stocks in the Medical Info Systems sector might want to consider either Computer Programs and Systems (CPSI  -  Free Report) or Cerner (CERN  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Computer Programs and Systems has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Cerner has a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell) right now. This means that CPSI's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.CPSI currently has a forward P/E ratio of 14.26, while CERN has a forward P/E of 24.04. We also note that CPSI has a PEG ratio of 1.34. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. CERN currently has a PEG ratio of 1.73.Another notable valuation metric for CPSI is its P/B ratio of 3.27. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, CERN has a P/B of 4.08.Based on these metrics and many more, CPSI holds a Value grade of B, while CERN has a Value grade of C.CPSI sticks out from CERN in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that CPSI is the better option right now.

Cerner underperformed its industry in a year’s time. The stock has lost 9.7% compared with the industry’s return of 3.2%.Bookings DetailThe year-over-year upside in revenues can be primarily attributed to an increase in bookings in the first quarter.Bookings were $1.40 billion, up 12% on a year-over-year basis. The company registered strong bookings on business office services. However, subscription bookings were lower than expected.Cerner Corporation Price and Consensus  Cerner Corporation Price and Consensus | Cerner Corporation QuoteSegment DetailsInstead of reporting in three revenue categories — system sales, support maintenance and services — Cerner reported in six segments in the first quarter.Licensed software in the first quarter fell 5.3% to $134.8 million, on a year-over-year basis. Lower-than expected subscription bookings marred growth in the segment.Subscriptions accounted for revenues worth $76.6 million, down 32.4% on a year-over-year basis.Professional services increased 11.3% year over year to $441.3 million. Per management, strong performance in the segment is likely to enhance  revenue cycle position.Managed services segment revenues were $268.3 million, up 3.3% year over year.Support and maintenance revenues were $284.6 million, up 8.6% year over year.Reimbursed Travel sales amounted to $23.9 million, up 6% from the year-ago quarter.MarginsGross margin in the first quarter was 82.1%, almost flat year over year.Operating margin for the reported quarter was 15.1%, which contracted 427 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis.The downside was caused by surge in operating expenses, which rose 6% year over year. The growth was driven by personnel expense related to revenue-generating associates and non-cash items.Financial PositionCerner exited the first quarter with free cash flow of $255.7 million. Operating cash flow totaled $409 million.Long-term debt, including capital lease obligations, was $527 million, down slightly on a sequential basis.View DownbeatCerner expects second-quarter 2018 revenues between $1.31 billion and $1.36 billion.

Revenues came below expectations due to software issues, technology resale, lesser-than-expected subscription bookings and the delay of the VA contract. A downbeat guidance indicates concerns for the stock. Further, lower margins on technology resale, resulting from higher mix of device resale is a concern. Additionally, Cerner has been facing macroeconomic challenges along with cutthroat competition in niche space. Surging operating expenses also add to the woes.International growth is likely to boost with the company’s prospects in Australia, Canada, Middle East, U.K., Ireland and Germany. Cerner witnessed strong cash flow and record bookings. We believe that the company has growth opportunities in the revenue cycle management (RCM), Population Health and ambulatory markets based on its product strength and enviable track record of adding new clients. Solid growth in the HealtheIntent platform also holds promise. Further, the company recently reported a suite of developments in its EHR platform.Q1 Earnings of MedTech Majors at a GlanceA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space which reported solid earnings this season are Baxter International Inc.

325,CERN,"Cerner Corporation (CERN  -  Free Report) is a popular name in the HCIT (Healthcare Information Technology) space. The stock has returned 0.7%, compared with the industry’s rally of 8.4% in a year’s time. Also, the current return is lower than the S&P 500’s 14.8%.With a market capitalization of approximately $19.22 billion, the company has missed earnings estimates in the first, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017. The company’s earnings met with estimates in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. At present, Cerner is grappling with stiff competition in the niche space and regulatory headwinds. The mixed sentiments justify the stock’s Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Here we take a detailed look at the company’s performance and operations to analyze why investors should hold on to this stock.Cerner Corporation Price and Consensus  Cerner Corporation Price and Consensus | Cerner Corporation QuoteWhat’s Acting in Favor of Cerner?Cerner is one of the best known HCIT giants with a large client base and a comprehensive array of solutions for patients. It is one of the major EHR (Electronic Health Record) vendors gaining significant market traction. In the past, Cerner had used Amazon Web Services (AWS) for storage, computer networking and databases and on-demand disaster recovery. Cerner's HealtheIntent platform facilitates the gathering and retrieval of and access to patient EHRs.Lately, Cerner has been witnessing a series of developments in its EHR platform. The company was selected by the Illinois Rural Community Care Organization (IRCCO) to implement Cerner HealtheIntent across its accountable care organizations (ACO).

Reputed names such as Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Epic Systems, GE Healthcare Technologies, McKesson Corp and Quality Systems pose significant challenges apart from hurting pricing and margins.The company’s long-term debt and declining operating margin raise concern. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, gross margin was flat year over year, while operating margins contracted 280 basis points year over year.Furthermore, the industry Cerner operates in is highly regulated by the government. With rapid evolution of product standards and requirements, any change in government regulation may have an adverse impact on Cerner's products.Bottom LineUnhindered by the issues, analysts are optimistic about Cerner. For the current quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pinned at $1.34 billion, reflecting a year-over-year rise of 6%.Thus, investors might want to hold on to the stock, courtesy of Cerner’s edge over peers.

334,CERN,"The tax-repeal saga has been dominating the headlines of the U.S. MedTech industry since the last couple of months.While numerous reports are expecting it to be a solid buffer, the Congressional Budget Office (“CBO”) forecasts rather ominous implications of this tax relief on the nation’s economy.The ‘Alarming’ CBO ReportA report published by the CBO projects that the two-year tax suspension will cost the federal government about $3.7 billion during that period, and $310 billion to federal-budget deficits over the next decade. In this regard, the federal budget deficit has already reached $228 billion in the first three months of the current fiscal, almost $18 billion more than the deficit in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.However, Republicans spurned these concerns with the belief that tax cuts will drive faster growth.In fact, the right-wing conservatives are of the opinion that America’s unparalleled purchasing power, massive demand for medical services, and opportunity for innovation has lent it a competitive edge in the global space.So, despite the CBO’s assumptions, continuous technological and strategic advancements, especially in the MedTech sector, should help the nation in increasing its gross domestic production (GDP), and minimize the deficits over the long haul.In this regard, per Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services report published by Advisory Board, U.S. health care spending is estimated to reach approximately $5.5 trillion by 2025, representing 19.9% of GDP.Consequently, here we take a sneak peek on how the U.S. MedTech space is gearing up to counter the unsettling CBO projections, and which are the major companies that would lead the process.MedTech Advancements to Minimize DeficitsBig-Data Trends to Aid MedTechThe future of MedTech is embedded in artificial intelligence, virtual reality and Big data.Apart from GoogleFlu and HealthMap, the latest trend of Electronic Health Records has been gaining prominence in the Big-data market. A research report by Fact.MR expects the global big data analytics in healthcare market to multiply at a double-digit CAGR by 2026. In fact, companies banking on big-data analytics would save over 25% in annual costs in the upcoming years.Of the major companies, Cerner Corporation (CERN  -  Free Report) has been hogging the limelight, courtesy of its consistent efforts to digitize electronic health record systems.Increasing ConsolidationM&A activity in the MedTech space surged 50% in 2017, increasing the value of aggregate M&A to more than $200 billion (Data provided by BioSpectrum Asia).The latest trend of rising consolidation in the healthcare space has led to a reduction in the number of players, greater market concentration and reduced competition. It has also fortified the industry against new entrants. The companies will benefit from higher market cap, which will put them in a position to negotiate with suppliers.The latest buyout of Express Scripts by Cigna ($67-billion deal), which follows just three months after drug chain and pharmacy giant CVS Health Corp announced plans to acquire the nation's third-largest health insurer Aetna ($69 billion-deal), deserve a mention.Market DynamicsThe MedTech industry has been favored by a massive change in consumer behavior lately. This along with changing market dynamics led to a dramatic transformation of the U.S. healthcare system over the last couple of years.This is evident from the rise in minimally-invasive surgeries, higher demand for liquid biopsy tests and use of IT for quick and improved patient care along with the shift of the payment system to a value-based model.3 ‘Value’ Stocks to Gain TractionWhen the market is full of mixed sentiments, value investment trick can easily work. This is because most of the fundamentally good stocks are often found lying within the discounted range due to the volatility.Thus, here we take a look at three stocks that are currently available at a cheaper rate and have been gaining prominence in the MedTech markets on the back of above trends. Notably, these stocks have Value Score of A or B.Apart from having favorable price performances, these stocks have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and have witnessed strong margin expansion in the last couple of years. Although no single metric can determine the profitability of a business accurately, investors can count on net margin to get a fair idea of the amount of profit a company is making.AmerisourceBergen Corporation (ABC  -  Free Report)The stock has a Value Score of B and returned 86.8% in the last five years, much higher than the S&P 500’s growth of 12.7%.Consolidation has been one of the major catalysts behind the company’s growth. In January 2018, AmerisourceBergen declared that it has completed the acquisition of H.D. Smith, the largest independent wholesaler in the United States, for $815 million in cash. The deal was initiated back in November 2017. Coming to net margins, the company’s net margin has expanded significantly in the last couple of years. The company invested nearly $1 billion in capital expenditures to create operational efficiencies, leverage scale and provide best-in-class customer service in the last two years alone.The company is now well positioned to realize long-term benefits from these. Further, the recent U.S. tax legislation enhances the company’s ability to invest in business, innovate and deliver value to its shareholders. Fresenius Medical Care (FMS  -  Free Report)Fresenius Medical has had a solid price performance over the past year, returning 25.9%. The stock has a Value Score of B.Acquisitions have been a key catalyst for the company. In an initiative to boost its long-term strategy or the ‘Growth-Strategy 2020’, Fresenius Medical has signed an agreement to acquire all outstanding shares of NxStage Medical for $30 a share.  The transaction has been valued at $2 billion and is subject to close by 2018, following approval from NxStage stockholders and other customary conditions.Fresenius Medical expects the buyout to prove accretive to earnings within three years from deal closure. Furthermore, the deal is anticipated to provide annual pre-tax cost savings of $80-$100 million over the next three to five years. The company also expects integration costs of about $150 million over the next three years from the time of announcement in 2017.Fresenius Medical’s expanding net-margin trends hold promise. Further, the company has launched the second phase of its Global Efficiency Program (GEP II) in 2018. The program’s aim is to identify and realize further efficiency potential and enhance the overall competitiveness of Fresenius Medical. Starting in 2018, GEP II targets to achieve sustained cost improvements of EUR 100 to 200 million per annum by 2020. Olympus Corp. (OCPNY  -  Free Report)The stock has a Value Score of B and returned 9.9% in the last year.Headquartered in Tokyo, Japan, Olympus manufactures and sells precision machineries and instruments worldwide. The company has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 9.4% and holds considerable promise in the long haul.With solid growth in North America, the company’s net-margin trends have been solid in the last couple of years. The company is expected to witness strong growth in Japan and Europe, courtesy of VISERA ELITE II and impressive energy device performance.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

335,CERN,"In the era of big data, unless one's portfolio is in tune with the evolving digital trend, making prudent investment choices can prove to be a daunting task. Millennials have started to recognize the increasing need of the emerging automation trend and subsequently robotics, IoT, 3D printing are becoming part of our daily life with the latest buzzword being Artificial Intelligence (AI).While Siri and Ok Google have made life easier, the latest version of Global Positioning System helps track almost anything and everything along with its intelligent route map. Also, not being a pro on social network sites like Facebook, Twitter or snapchat can be seen as primitive.According to investment giant Jim Cramer, AI along with big data will soon let companies to bat a thousand. Interestingly, the benefits of the same will not remain restricted to any particular industry but will be felt across all business segments and investment arenas.AI to Help MedTech Gain TractionNon-healthcare bigwigs like Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Google, Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), IBM and Microsoft with their digital affluence are already eyeing the healthcare and device market of late, courtesy of its solid prospects. Two things to be noted here:Health treatment costs have skyrocketed over the past few years. Surprisingly, medical devices and pharmaceuticals account for only a small portion of healthcare expenses. Per Josh Makower, MD, general partner venture capital firm New Enterprise Associates, the greater part of healthcare costs goes in paying the salaries of healthcare employees. AI can help to curtail this high labor cost.Going by 2018 Deloitte data, global health care spending is projected to increase at an annual rate of 4.1% in 2017-2021, a significant escalation from just 1.3% in 2012-2016. Per the report, rising labor cost is acting as a major spending growth driver.Also, with growth in the aged population, the necessity for AI has increased by leaps and bounds. Per the U.S. Census Bureau report, between 2012 and 2050, there will be a significant rise in the aged population in the United States. In 2050, the population aged 65 or older is projected to be 83.7 million, almost double its estimated population of 43.1 million in 2012. Data also shows that the median age is increasing in most areas of the country and this is the global scenario as well.Notably, the industry is bearing the brunt of an exploding population at present. The World Health Organization's (""WHO"") latest available data show that more than 45% of WHO Member States worldwide report to have less than 1 physician per 1000 population. The density of physicians to patients in the United States is 2.3:1000.The strategic application of AI in every sphere of healthcare can provide an impetus to  productivity. Evidently, companies that adopted AI technologies have already witnessed a 50% reduction in healthcare costs and have also experienced improved patient outcome by more than 50%.MedTech Stocks Going the AI WayMedtronic (MDT  -  Free Report) is undoubtedly among the first MedTech manufacturers forging ahead with initiatives to bring in AI techniques in manufacturing processes. Back in 2016, the company partnered with IBM Watson to utilize the latter’s machine learning algorithms to incorporate AI in its diabetes app MiniMed.  In 2017, they jointly launched the first artificial pancreas systems. Metronic has utilized sugar IQ with the cognitive computing capability of IBM Watson to detect important patterns and trends for diabetes.EHR technologies developer Cerner (CERN  -  Free Report) is also adopting AI techniques rapidly. Lately, the company has been in the headlines, courtesy of its efforts to digitize electronic health record systems. In this regard, the company recently entered into two collaborations, one with Salesforce, a renowned player in the field of customer relationship management, and the other with Centrus Health, a clinically integrated, physician-led network. With the latest development, the company is planning to advance its flagship big-data platform HealtheIntent.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report) designs, manufactures and markets the da Vinci surgical system — an advanced robot-assisted surgical platform. This AI platform enables minimally-invasive surgery that helps negate trauma associated with open surgery. The company plans to expand the usage of da Vinci in general and thoracic surgery, colorectal surgery and hernia repair.Of late, Boston Scientific (BSX  -  Free Report) has also been putting an all-out effort to incorporate AI techniques in neuromodulation, cardiac rhythm management, cardiology, electrophysiology, peripheral interventions, oncology, endoscopy, urology and pelvic health.ConclusionA long debate can be structured on how an intelligent machine intensive technology can make human capabilities outmoded gradually — but that’s a different story. Despite several adversities, AI undoubtedly has emanated to change the behavioral pattern of consumers in medical device space like all other sectors. Once again going by Jim Cramer’s say, “I love behavior-change investing. It can be incredibly lucrative, and when you have a behavior-change theme you can use selloffs to pick stocks based on those changes.” Thus, it goes without saying that the market holds ample promise and the proper execution of AI will definitely prove to be a trump card for the space.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

338,CERN,"The latest Earnings Preview depicts a bullish run in the ongoing reporting cycle. Till Oct 20, 87 S&P 500 members (24.7% of the total market cap) reported their numbers. Total earnings for these members have gone up 9.4% on 7.3% higher revenues.However, investors are concerned about the Medical sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) that saw a lot of struggle during the first nine months of the year, thanks to the political change and the ongoing policy-restructuring related battle.The ensuing lack of visibility has roiled the favorable trend that this sector maintained in the trailing few quarters. For the third quarter, the expected earnings growth rate stands at a mere 2.2% on a 4.8% revenue-growth projection. In comparison, the second-quarter earnings growth was quite impressive at 7% on 4.4% revenue growth.What’s in Store for the Medical Product Space?While twists and turns continue to unfold at Capitol Hill, the scenario within the Medical - Products space, an important part of the medical device subcategory within the broader Medical sector, is getting gloomier. The latest executive order released by the Republicans points to a shrinking customer base, indicating a cut in demand for expensive medical procedures and devices. This may lead to major supply/demand disequilibrium within this space.However, major medical device players have been pinning hopes on the abolition of the infamous 2.3% medical device sales tax, though its elimination is far from reality.Considering these tax issues, investors interested in the Medical Product space eagerly await earnings reports of MedTech bigwigs throughout this week.

The company while gaining a fair share in a few cardiovascular segments and DES (Drug Eluting Stent), continues to build momentum worldwide.However, ahead of this earnings release, the quarter’s IC business is likely to be grossly impacted by the company’s product recall issue within Europe. While the downbeat IC business tangled under product recall issue will possibly gain some boost from the company’s recent $435 million acquisition of Switzerland-based Symetis SA, a full recovery may take time.

339,CERN,"Cerner Corporation’s (CERN  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 results, scheduled for release on Oct 26, are expected to show steady growth in system sales — one of the major revenue components. While this could majorly drive third-quarter earnings, an expected improvement in revenues at all other segments should help the company generate solid results this season.It is important to note that Cerner’s last quarter earnings met the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Similar to the prior quarter, strong growth in licensed software and subscriptions are expected to be the main factors driving systems revenues.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for systems sales stands at $337 million for the third quarter. This reflects an increase of almost 12% from the year-ago quarter. Growth across acute and ambulatory EHR and sales of Population Health and Revenue Cycle solutions and services hold promise for Cerner.Cerner Corporation Price and Consensus  Cerner Corporation Price and Consensus | Cerner Corporation Quote Delving deeper into the fundamentals of the stock, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this release.Other Factors at PlayView Upbeat: For the third quarter, Cerner forecasts revenues between $1.27 billion and $1.33 billion. Adjusted earnings are expected in the band of 61 cents to 63 cents per share. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $1.29 billion, signifying 9.2% growth on a year-over-year basis.Furthermore, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at 62 cents per share, up 5.4% year over year. Solid participation in the EHR placement market has lent Cerner a competitive edge in the global space. Cerner offers an exposure to worldwide healthcare automation.Growth in Support, Maintenance & Services: In the last quarter, management at Cerner announced that the company expects growth in the band 3% to 4% at the segment for the rest of the year. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment’s revenues stands at $933 million, up 8.4% on a year-over-year basis and 1.7% sequentially.Strategic Partnerships: Cerner follows a strategy of acquiring complementary businesses that allow the company to expand its solutions, device offerings and services, and grow its market and client base.In August, Cerner announced the formation of the Post-Acute Innovation Center with HealthSouth Corporation, the nation's largest provider of post-acute services. Furthermore, Cerner partnered with LifePoint Health, a large investor-owned health company that owns and operates more than 70 hospitals in the last quarter.Bookings Update: It is important to note that bookings in the last quarter were $1.636 billion (an all-time high), up 16% on a year-over-year basis. Buoyed by solid trends, management expects third-quarter bookings in the band of $1.45 billion to $1.60 billion, with the midpoint reflecting 6% growth on a year-over-year basis.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter bookings stands at $1.54 billion. We believe solid growth in Ambulatory and CommunityWorks offerings will drive bookings in the third quarter.However, our quantitative model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Cerner this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. This is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Cerner is -0.32%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Cerner currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.

344,CERN,"With the second-quarter earnings season gaining momentum, the broader picture no longer looks as bright as it was expected to be. Putting together all the 128 S&P 500 members’ released results as of Jul 25, constituting 36% of the index’s total membership, we note that earnings growth pace is less than the last quarter. However, it is more or less in line with the trailing four-quarter average earnings growth and exceeds the trailing 12-quarter average.Per the latest second-quarter scorecard, total earnings increased 7% year over year on 4.2% higher revenues. While earnings beat ratio remains at 77.3%, revenue beat ratio is at 70.3%. (For more information, please consult our Zacks Earnings Analysis).What’s in Store for the Medical Space?Investors are concerned about the healthcare space, a sector that has been seen through a lot of struggle during the past half year, thanks to the political power change and the ongoing policy restructuring related battle.While yesterday, it was finally President Donald Trump’s win with the Republican healthcare bill passing one more barrier by a very narrow margin, investors are however not much optimistic about this development. Per a Vox article today, in its effort to repeal and replace Obamacare, “President Donald Trump continues to make bold promises about what that bill would do — promises that all available analysis suggests the bill will not keep”.While there are still chances that the Senate will amend the latest bill, its extent still remains unclear. Accordingly, uncertainty within the medical space is towering high. Investors are currently adopting a wait-and-see policy about this space.Let’s sneak a peek into the performance of five major Medical – Products companies within the broader Medical space expected on Jul 27.Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report): We are upbeat about Align Technology’s execution of strategic initiatives like international expansion, which ensured Invisalign treatment for a growing base of patients. In this context, the company strengthened its foothold internationally by acquiring the Invisalign distributors in the highly lucrative Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region as well as Brazil in February. This is likely to drive the company’s results in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Align is expected to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter 2017 results before the market opens, as it has the right combination of two key ingredients. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has an Earnings ESP of +2.74%. We note that, while a positive Zacks ESP serves as a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise, a bullish Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of the ESP.

Cerner announced that it has been chosen by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to develop an electronic health record (EHR) system. Department of Veterans Affairs will use the same system the company is developing for the U.S. Department of Defense, which began its operation at its first site in February. This system will facilitate the exchange of data between military care facilities and civilian health providers, where current and former service members receive care.This leading healthcare information technology (HCIT) company is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 earnings after the market closes.

Notably, this indicates a rise of 6.5%-9.4% on a year-over-year basis. We believe that the growing adoption of MAKO robots will drive sales in the orthopedic and reconstructive surgery market. Additionally, Stryker is well poised on the acquisitions of both Sage and Physio-Control in the past.The company also expects to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter 2017 results after the closing bell.

After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for CERN in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 58 cents per share for CERN, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 57 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for CERN, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.75% heading into earnings season.Cerner Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Cerner Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Cerner Corporation QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that CERN has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Cerner, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaries,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

Based in North Kansas City, MO, the company provides healthcare information technology (HCIT) solutions worldwide. Cerner has a stellar four-quarter average earnings surprise of 0.97%.Last quarter, Cerner reported adjusted earnings of 56 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 53 cents.

Meanwhile, revenues rose from $1.138 billion in the year-ago period.Delving deeper into the fundamentals of the stock, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this release.Why a Likely Positive Surprise? Our proven model shows that Cerner is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Cerner is +1.75% as the Most Accurate Estimate stands at 58 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 57 cents. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks Rank: Cerner currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Cerner’s Zacks Rank #3 and positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of a positive earnings surprise this season.Cerner Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Cerner Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Cerner Corporation QuoteFactors to ConsiderView Upbeat: We believe Cerner’s strong sales performance, solid portfolio and strategic initiatives have positioned it for stellar growth. For second-quarter 2017, the company forecasts revenues between $1.265 billion and $1.335 billion. Adjusted earnings are now expected in the band of 60 cents to 62 cents per share. For full-year 2017, management expects revenues between $5.100 billion and $5.300 billion. Cerner currently forecasts 2017 adjusted earnings in the band of $2.44 and $2.56 per share.Development of Electronic Health Records System: Cerner announced that it has been chosen by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to develop an electronic health record (EHR) system. Department of Veterans Affairs will use the same system the company is developing for the U.S. Department of Defense, which began its operation at its first site in February.This system will facilitate the exchange of data between military care facilities and civilian health providers, where current and former service members receive care.Stable Estimate Revision Trend: For the current quarter, one analyst moved south, compared to no upward revision in the last two months. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share is stable at 57 cents over the same time frame.Robust Portfolio: We believe that Cerner’s strong product portfolio will help boost its customer base. The frequent contract wins reflect growing traction. Furthermore, the company has strong growth opportunities in the revenue cycle management (RCM) and ambulatory space.Solid Global Foothold: Cerner is one of the largest pure-play HCIT companies and its wide footprint, large reference-able client base and composite array of solutions make it an ideal candidate for investors seeking an exposure to the HCIT industry. Cerner offers an exposure to worldwide healthcare automation. Its international operations provide a more diversified revenue stream. In the past, the company has won contracts in the U.K. as well as in the Middle East. The company has also been working with client organizations globally, to a focus on its population health management profile.Other Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are a few other companies you may want to consider as our proven model shows that they also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.41% and a Zacks Rank #2.

348,CERN,"Cerner Corporation (CERN  -  Free Report) announced that it is collaborating with Virginia-based Surescripts, an information technology company that provides network to pharmacies for connecting fragmented health information technology. With this deal, Cerner will be able to integrate Surescripts’ Real-Time Prescription Benefit functionality into the “Cerner Millennium” electronic health record (EHR).In this regard we note that, last November, the company along with other EHR makers had entered into another collaboration with Surescripts on personalized prescription benefit.This development will help in providing patient-specific prescription information required at any point of time during the physician’s workflow.Cerner Corporation Price and Consensus Cerner Corporation Price and Consensus | Cerner Corporation Quote“Cerner Millennium” is an EHR platform used to reduce medical error. It helps physicians document and access critical patient data and organize workflows, thereby ensuring patient safety through evidence-based decision making.Per management, the functionality will be implemented in March 2018 and will be added to Cerner ePrescribe, which comes free of cost for all clients.This alliance will thus help Cerner gain a stronger foothold in the HCIT (healthcare information technology) space.Why is Real-Time Prescription Benefit Important?Surescripts’ Real-Time Prescription Benefit provides prescription price transparency by leveraging information from pharmacy benefit managers. This process helps identify other therapeutic alternatives and patient specific coverage alerts like quantity restrictions and step therapy requirements.Consequently, this will reduce the number of patients abandoning their prescriptions if the prescribed drugs become unaffordable for them. Hence, greater price transparency may improve medication adherence and also build stronger relationships between the patients and physicians.Lucrative Prospects in Niche SpacePer a study conducted by Allied Market Research, North America was the leading regional HCIT market in 2015. The North American healthcare asset management market is projected to witness a CAGR of 17.4% to $9.7 billion by 2022.Rising needs to curtail healthcare costs and growing focus on quality of care drive the market.Accordingly, we believe, the addition of the new functionality in EHR platform is a strategic move by Cerner as it is likely to secure a diversified client base in the near future.Price PerformanceIn the past year, Cerner has underperformed the industry in terms of price. The stock has returned 14.4% compared with the industry’s rally of 16.6%.However, we are optimistic that the latest developments will have a positive impact on Cerner’s share price movement.Zacks Ranks & Key PicksCerner carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report), Bioverativ Inc  and athenahealth, Inc. (ATHN  -  Free Report). Each of these stocks sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

350,CERN,"The fourth-quarter earnings season has taken center stage, with 251 S&P 500 members having reported their numbers. The season has turned out to be favorable so far, especially on the revenue front. A sturdy revenue momentum was witnessed in the season, above-average proportion of positive surprises along with favorable revisions trend for the present and the upcoming quarters.Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for the companies that have reported their results, are up 16% year over year on 10.5% higher revenues. Of the total companies, 80.5% beat earnings and 78.1% surpassed revenue estimates. With 92 S&P 500 members lined up to release their quarterly results this week, we are decidedly bullish on the equity market, which is gradually demonstrating a sequential improvement.Medical, one of the 16 Zacks sectors, is expected to fare impressively. For the fourth quarter, the expected earnings growth rate for the sector is 6.6% on 5.7% revenue growth. Let us take a look at the major factors that are likely to influence the earnings results of Medical Product companies within the broader Medical universe.Factors Influencing MedTech in Q4Tax BenefitsAs part of the tax overhaul, corporate tax rates have been slashed to 21% from 35%, providing a huge relief for all sectors. Needless to say, the medical device companies cheered the legislation as well.Further, the news of Congress delaying the 2.3% medical-device tax for another two years was a huge boost for industry players and investors. Manufacturers appreciate the delay as it is likely to favor the companies’ R&D activities.Favorable Consumer BehaviorDespite political issues in the healthcare space, the change in consumer demand and market dynamics led to a dramatic transformation in the entire U.S. healthcare system over the last couple of years. This is evident from the growing prevalence of minimally-invasive surgeries, rising demand for liquid biopsy tests, use of IT for ensuring quick and improved patient care along with the shift of the payment system to a value-based model.Let’s take a look at four major Medical Product stocks slated to release their quarterly reports on Feb 6:Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report)Becton, Dickinson is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results before the opening bell.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $3.05 billion, up 4.2% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings is $2.40, up 3% on a year-over-year basis.The quarter is expected to show sluggishness in BD Medical — one of the major revenue components. While this can majorly dampen earnings in the first quarter, an expected improvement in revenues in other segments will help the company generate solid results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BD Medical revenues is pegged at $2.03 billion. This indicates a decline of 3.9% from the year-ago quarter.The company’s innovative product pipeline is a key catalyst. A plethora of regulatory approvals in the United States and international markets are expanding the company’s product portfolio.

However, adjusted earnings deteriorated 4.3% on a year-over-year basis.Revenues totaled $132.6 million, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $131 million. Revenues also increased 4.7% on a year-over-year basis.Quality Systems carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Segment DetailsTotal software, hardware and related revenues increased 1.5% to $39.3 million, primarily driven by a 16.3% rise in software-related subscription services. However, growth at this segment was partially offset by lower software license and hardware sales, which declined almost 17% in the quarter. The company expects software license and hardware revenues to remain under pressure for the remainder of the fiscal.Support and maintenance revenues in the quarter totaled $41.7 million, up 7% on a year-over-year basis. Revenues at this segment were driven annual price increases.Professional services revenues increased 9.9% to almost $7.7 million. The year-over-year increase was led by transfusion services.

In the second quarter, recurring revenues reached a record level of 83% of total revenues. Quality Systems, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Quality Systems, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Quality Systems, Inc. Quote Quarter HighlightsEagleDream & Entrada Hold Promise: In August, Quality Systems completed the acquisition of EagleDream Health Inc. for roughly $26 million in cash. EagleDream Health is a cloud-based analytics company that optimizes understanding across clinical, financial and administrative data to enhance practice performance.Following the acquisition, NextGen Healthcare, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Quality Systems, gained facilities to provide enriching care experience and accelerate patient engagement for ambulatory clinics and health systems. Management further expects to achieve per capita cost efficiency as well as enhanced work-life balance for clinicians and staff in the quarter to come (read more: Quality Systems Completes EagleDream Health Buyout).Entrada’s pipeline has been offering new deals to Quality Systems for quite some time now. Earlier this year, NextGen Healthcare had acquired Entrada for $34 million. Per the second-quarter fiscal 2018 results, Subscription revenues were significantly up on strength in Entrada. We believe the acquisition will prove accretive over the long haul.Bookings Decline: Quality Systems registered bookings worth $26 million, down 24% on a year-over-year basis. Per management, subscription bookings continued to be a steady contributor to second-quarter bookings. However, headwinds in the perpetual license bookings marred bookings growth in the quarter.Margin DetailsQuality Systems’ gross margin remained flat on a year-over-year basis at 56% of net revenues in the reported quarter.Coming to operating expenses, the company recorded selling general & administrative (SG&A) expenses of $41 million, down from $42.8 million a year ago. As a percentage of revenues, SG&A expenses in the second quarter were 69%, up 260 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis.Meanwhile, research and development (R&D) costs totaled $19.5 million, expanding 40 bps year over year. R&D expenses rose in the second quarter on the back of incremental personnel costs, offset by increased software capitalization.GuidanceFor fiscal 2018, the company projects revenues in the band of $522-$530 million, up from the previously issued range of $512-$530 million.Adjusted earnings per share are projected in the range of 64 cents to 68 cents, compared with the previous 62 cents to 70 cents.Our TakeQuality Systems posted a stellar second quarter of fiscal 2018, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both the counts. We are particularly upbeat about the company’s solid performance with regard to total software, hardware and related revenues. Quality Systems’ solid recurring revenue base is a key catalyst for the quarters to come. Furthermore, the company’s new Entrada and Eagle Dream solutions are likely to drive growth. On the flipside, ongoing sluggishness in the RCM customer base, intensifying competition and a strict regulatory environment are likely to mar the top line. Furthermore, management slashed the high end of the fiscal 2018 earnings guidance, signaling at looming concerns. The company expects software license and hardware revenues to remain under pressure for the remainder of the fiscal.Companies With Solid Earnings ResultsIntuitive Surgical Inc.

363,CERN,"Cerner Corp (CERN  -  Free Report) reported adjusted third-quarter 2017 earnings of 61 cents per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. The lackluster third-quarter performance can be primarily attributed to the year-over-year decline in bookings, which had scaled an all-time high in the last quarter. However, earnings rose 3.4% on a year-over-year basis.The company reported net revenues of $1.28 billion, falling short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.29 billion. However, revenues rose 7.7% on a year-over-year basis. Cerner holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Bookings DisappointIn the third quarter, Cerner registered bookings worth $1.111 billion, down 22.5% on a year-over-year basis. In fact, bookings were below the company’s previously issued guidance owing to the postponement of several big contracts from this quarter to tentatively the fourth quarter of 2017.Notably, bookings in the last quarter totaled $1.64 billion, up 16% on a year-over-year basis.Nonetheless, Cerner is well positioned for a strong full-year performance based on solid bookings guidance for the fourth quarter. Next-quarter bookings are expected in the band of $1.75 billion to $2 billion, with the midpoint reflecting 30% growth on a year-over-year basis. The midpoint of the fourth-quarter booking guidance would increase full year 2017 bookings guidance by 8% on a year-over-year basis.Segment DetailsSystems sales increased 8% to $324 million. Sales were buoyed by licensed software and subscriptions, partially offset by a decline in technology resale.Total support, maintenance and services, including professional and managed services, rose 7.8% from the year-ago quarter to $927.8 million. This reflects solid execution by the company’s service organizations. Revenue Cycle has also been a strong contributor, courtesy of strong sales and contribution from RevWorks services (revenue management services). Population Health service businesses also drove revenues in the third quarter on solid growth in the flagship HealtheIntent solutions. The company has been targeting the broader shift from fee-for-service to value-based care for long. Cerner also posted an impressive performance in the ambulatory and small hospital market.Reimbursement Travel revenues increased 8.7% in the quarter, slightly below the company’s full-year expected growth rate.Geographically, domestic revenues increased 7% from the year-ago quarter to $1.13 billion, while non-U.S. revenues increased 10% to $142 million.Margin & Balance Sheet DetailsGross margin in the third quarter was 82.7% of revenues, down 50 basis points (bps) from a year ago. The decline was due to the lower mix of sublicensed software and lackluster performance by the technology resale business. Adjusted operating margin in the third quarter was 23.1% of net sales, down 130 bps from a year ago.Cerner ended the third quarter of 2017 with $964 million in total cash and investments. Total debt for Cerner, including capital lease obligations, was $535 million.FY17 Guidance LoweredFor the fourth quarter, Cerner forecasts revenues between $1.3 billion and $1.35 billion, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 5% on a year-over-year basis. Adjusted earnings are expected in the band of 60 cents to 62 cents per share, midpoint of which is flat on a year-over-year basis.For the full year, management expects revenues at around $5.15 billion, which is at the low end of the previously issued range of $5.15 billion to $5.25 billion, thanks to lower bookings in the third quarter.
