(PVH), the owner of Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein, both fell after-hours following quarterly earnings, and the companies' full-year profit outlooks remained below analyst expectations.XEstimates: First-quarter earnings per share to jump 36% to $2.25, on revenue of $2.257 billion, a 14% gain, according to Zacks Investment Research.Results: EPS of $2.36; revenue rose 16% to $2.3 billion.PVH also raised its full-year EPS outlook to $9.05-$9.15, up from $9.00-$9.10 and below views for $9.14.Stock: Shares dipped 0.7% to 154.48 after-hours in the stock market today, grinding their way through a flat base with a 163.88 buy point. The stock has a Composite Rating of 90, out of a best-possible 99. Shares this month found support at their 50-day line.Piper Jaffray, in a recent survey of teen consumer trends, said Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein were among the brands that ""made significant upward moves"" in popularity. Hilfiger, the survey said, remained popular among males. Popularity in Calvin Klein's handbags also held up, the survey said.PVH also stands to benefit from a rebound in tourism spending in the U.S., Credit Suisse said in a research note in April.Estimates: A net loss of 23 cents per share for the company's fiscal first quarter, compared to a net loss of 24 cents a year ago.

In March, Guess said the U.S. accounts for 31% of its global business, down from 38%.Zacks analysts also praise Guess' efforts to connect physical stores to digital shopping. Its e-commerce businesses in Europe and in China are growing.But the stock, whose value has more than doubled over the past year, is also getting expensive, they warn. Much of the company's run higher came after its fourth-quarter earnings, reported in March, topped expectations. Those results got a lift from the holidays. Black Friday is popular in Europe too, management noted.CEO Victor Herrero said he believed that 2018 marked ""the beginning of a turnaround"" for Guess. Co-founder Paul Marciano in February stepped back from his day-to-day responsibilities after an investigation was launched into sexual misconduct allegations against him by model Kate Upton and others.Shares of Guess crashed on Feb. 1.

5,PVH,"How can technology and oil stocks mix? One way: When high-quality companies from both sectors rise to new highs.ConocoPhillips (COP) and new IPO Dropbox (DBX) lead a still modest yet growing cadre of companies that burst to 52-week or all-time new highs Thursday. The latter is trying to break out of its first base; the former is trying to pad its gains after a successful breakout from an early-stage base.Dropbox, whose service allows users to access and edit files from multiple computers or internet-enabled devices, burst past a 34.47 buy point in a very narrow IPO base. That base began forming after the stock reversed sharply March 29. The IPO base formed over a period of just eight sessions, far fewer days than the typical successful IPO base.Analysts see the San Francisco-based firm earnings 2 cents a share in the first quarter. It lost 8 cents a share in Q1 and Q2 of 2017 and 4 cents in Q3 and 10 cents in Q4.Revenue jumped 33%, 33%, 30% and 28% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters.The company priced 36 million shares at 21 a share in late March.Oil and gas giant ConocoPhillips rose to as high as 63.88, extending gains from a 61.41 entry in a cup without handle to 4%. This means shares are still in buy range. Don't chase a stock more than 5% past the proper buy point.The cup without handle is most visible on a daily chart. But in looking at a weekly chart, it appears that a one-week handle also formed. That ushers in a slightly lower buy point of 61.27, 10 cents above the highest price during last week's action.An earlier Stock Market Today column covered Conoco's breakout in detail Wednesday.Elsewhere, apparel firms are gaining more steam.Business apparel, casual clothing and footwear giant PVH (PVH) moved further past a 158.06 buy point in an excellent flat base. On Thursday, shares reached as high as 162.62, up almost 3%.While volume is running roughly flat vs. the stock's 50-day average turnover, check out its daily chart. Since a March 29 bullish gap up in price, PVH had already registered five significant up days in heavy volume.Such action points to rising institutional demand.The reasons are clear. The owner of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger apparel brands is showing a fresh streak of top and bottom line growth.Earnings fell vs. year-ago levels in the final two quarters of fiscal 2017, ended in January that year. Then PVH grew its earnings per share by 10%, 15%, 16% and 28% in the next four quarters. In the April-ending fiscal first quarter for this year, the Street sees profit accelerating 36% higher to $2.25 a share.Sales grew 4%, 7%, 5% and 19% in the past four quarters, and are seen rising 15% in the current period to $2.28 billion.Global sports apparel and shoe maker Adidas (ADDYY) rallied as much as 2% and hit as high as 129.81 in afternoon trading Thursday. Shares are now up 11% past a 116.94 buy point in a long saucer with handle.

(Gigi and Bella have endorsement deals with Tommy and Calvin, respectively.)This reads as good news for PVH (PVH), one of the biggest players in the apparel space, and the parent of both '90s sweethearts.Tommy Hilfiger alone makes up 44% of the company's sales. Together with fellow '90s staple Calvin Klein, the two brands account for over 80% of PVH's revenue and 90% of PVH's earnings before interest and taxes, according to the company's latest figures.

In a separate survey, B. Riley FBR analysts found that Under Armour (UAA), a stock which halved its value in 2017, is waning in popularity, particularly with women and teens.Piper Jaffray, for its part, said Under Armour is being ""boxed out by resurgent Adidas and retro-category growth.""Perhaps the most striking example: once-popular athletic-sweats maker Champion, in the midst of its own '90s comeback, jumped from No. 44 to No. 10 among upper-income teen boys over the last half year.

94,PVH,"Amazon's (AMZN) Whole Foods (WFM) acquisition, the launch of Prime Wardrobe, and Nike's (NKE) decision to sell directly on the e-commerce site have shaken up the grocery and broader retail space, but recent sell-offs could actually prompt ""more investable"" opportunities in retail, says one analyst.X ""Although it may take time for investors to be willing to re-enter the space, we believe this may actually have made the 'winners' within our retail/brands coverage (which have already been coping through the Amazon threat) more investable,"" wrote Instinet analyst Simeon Siegel on Monday, arguing that apparel ""is no 'deader' than it was two weeks ago.""Who are the Amazon-resistant names on his list? Ulta Beauty (ULTA), TJX (TJX), Ross Stores (ROST), Nike and Signet Jewelers (SIG). Ralph Lauren (RL) is also seen potentially benefiting.""With fewer 'safe havens' across the broader consumer landscape, multiple premiums around anything thought to be 'safe' will likely be reinforced,"" he said.Amazon closed down 1% at 993.98 in the stock market today. Ulta finished 1.8% higher, TJX added 1%, Ross gained 0.7%, Nike rose 0.8%, and Signet climbed 3.2%.And while Amazon's foray into ""try before you buy""-style at-home shopping with Prime Wardrobe treads further onto department store and apparel retailers' turf, Siegel wonders if the offering could actually be a boost for brands, given the number of store closures happening on the brick-and-mortar level.The additional distribution provided by Amazon, of all places, could help offset lost distribution at department stores, he said.IBD's TAKE: Meanwhile, Amazon chief Jeff Bezos and other tech heads met with India Prime Minister Narendra Modi ahead of Modi's meeting with President Trump on Monday. For the latest on FANG stocks, check out IBD's hub on all things Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google. Nike, Under Armour (UAA), Adidas (ADDYY), PVH (PVH), Ralph Lauren, and Hanes Brands (HBI), which have wide wholesale distribution to department stores ""could stand to gain the most from syncing up with the Amazon machine, as the site's success could provide a new form of wholesale distribution, offering some protection from the structural challenges facing the current establishment,"" Siegel added.Furthermore, he said wider apparel distribution on Amazon would actually help to bolster full-price retail and thereby protect off-pricers like TXJ and Ross Stores.RELATED:Wal-Mart Is Not Mulling A Rival Bid For Whole Foods: ReportHere's The Latest Group Having An Amazon-Induced Anxiety Attack

Bass, Marc New York and other brands; its licensed brands include Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Ivanka Trump.CEO Morris Goldfarb touted G-III's strong wholesale business, which allowed the apparel maker to ""transcend a difficult market environment and retain a leadership position as one of the most high-performing vendors for our retail customers.""He said that previously projected losses that related to its retail stores and Donna Karan businesses offset strength in wholesale.""We are reducing operating costs in our retail business, closing and repurposing stores and enhancing our store product offerings, all which are intended to help us significantly reduce the losses in our retail operations,"" said Goldfarb in the release.For the year, G-III expects $2.76 billion in revenue and $1.04-$1.14 per diluted share, up from prior outlook for $2.73 billion in sales and EPS of 80-90 cents. Analysts are projecting per-share profit of $1.01 on sales of $2.73 billion.G-III shares leapt 15.2% to 22.92 after rising as high as 25.79.

97,PVH,"Stocks kept a lustrous shine with an hour to go in Monday's bullish advance. IBD-style breakouts showed oomph, adding to the argument that it's still a good market for growth investors.The current outlook, as seen in the IBD Big Picture, has remained ""Uptrend under pressure"" for months due to a high distribution day count. Watch to see if that outlook changes after Monday's market close.The Nasdaq composite gained 1.2%, bolstered by gains in the chip, computer, data storage, telecom gear and software industries. But the NYSE composite slightly outperformed, up almost 1.3%. The Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 both rallied around 1.1%.Volume was running nearly 9% higher on the Nasdaq vs. the same time Friday and a tad lower on the NYSE. Friday saw the expiration of weekly and monthly stock and index options.Within the S&P 500, banks and select names in the consumer goods, industrial and automotive sectors led the way as at least 18 names rallied 3% or more. They included Star Wars toy supplier Hasbro (HAS) (up 6% to 101.70 on a 42% jump in first-quarter earnings per share), SunTrust Banks (STI), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Delphi Automotive (DLPH) and shirt maker PVH Corp. (PVH).Delphi and PVH both retook their 50-day and 200-day moving averages, respectively, a sign that institutions are gaining more confidence in consumer-oriented industries. Hasbro is showing excellent action since it displayed an earnings-inspired breakaway gap on Feb. 6, clearing an 88.06 early entry in the process.Hasbro spent just 10 days below the 50-day line prior to Monday's buying rush, and volume spiked nearly five times its 50-day average of 1.13 billion shares. The move back above the 50-day line serves as a chance to add shares to a winning position in the stock.Hasbro's Composite Rating of 81 is hampered in part by a decent but not great EPS Rating of 89. Yet after Monday's quarterly results, watch to see if the toymaker's ratings go up at IBD Stock Checkup. Plus, the stock's RS line powered into new high ground, a good sign.Also on the upside, recent breakouts by lithium metal miner Sociedad Quimica Y Minera (SQM) of Chile, Fortinet (FTNT) and Macom Technologies (MTSI) showed gusto. SQM jumped nearly 2.5% to 36.50, holding above a recent flat-base breakout at 34.94.SQM is expected to grow full-year profit 34% to $1.42 a share on a 5% lift in revenue to $2.04 billion.Fortinet, which joined IBD Leaderboard several weeks ago, added to Friday's solid gain, rising 1% to 39.93. The security software play and midcap name is now almost 4% past a 38.43 proper buy point. Don't chase stocks that are already more than 5% past the proper entry.Fortinet gets strong ratings from IBD, including a 90 Composite Rating and an 84 RS. Macom, which gapped up at the open and rose 3.7% to 53.66, boasts even stronger proprietary ratings (98 Composite, 88 RS, 95 EPS) as seen in IBD Stock Checkup. The stock is rapidly rising past a 52.32 entry on a five-month cup with handle.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see Fortinet's first-quarter earnings up just 7% to 16 cents a share, a significant decline from gains of 88%, 27%, 29% and 67% in the prior four quarters. The difficult year-over-year comp is one factor. However, keep in mind that the Sunnyvale, Calif., firm smashed Wall Street consensus views in three of the past four quarters. In those three periods, the average beat was 32%.Macom's base features a less than 20% decline from the cup's high to low, well within the normal range for excellent versions of this tried-and-true bullish stock chart pattern. The cup with handle allows investors to time their buys at the point where a stock is best poised to break out and run to new highs. When a stock is at new highs, every investor is happy, except the short sellers.On the downside, Rite Aid (RAD) continued to slump badly, down 2% to 3.72. News reports continue to focus on the rising chance that pharmacy chain rival Walgreens Boot Alliance (WBA) will not be able to merge. Rite Aid, which sports a terrible EPS Rating of 11, is expected to post an 83% plunge in 2017 earnings to 4 cents a share. The stock had broken out of a deep, low-priced cup with handle at 2.15 in the week ended April 12, 2013, but now shares look poised to fall further as it struggles to rise back above the steeply falling 10-week moving average.RELATED:The Case For Gold: Can It Become A Solid Long-Term Play Again?Earnings News: Will Rite Aid Post Another Quarterly New Loss?

102,PVH,"As president-elect, Donald Trump is pro-business and a champion of corporate tax cuts — not to mention, anti-free trade and a big-company bully.That's a disorienting mix for chief executive officers trying to suss out whether Trump in the White House will be a blessing or bad luck. Planning ahead is no easy task when the next commander in chief is a guy with a hair-trigger Twitter finger who touts policies that could both help and hurt U.S. companies. Many said in interviews that they're cautiously optimistic — and a tad nervous.""I've got a great deal of confidence with the new administration coming in,"" Manny Chirico, CEO of apparel giant PVH Corp., said on Bloomberg Television, adding in the next breath, ""You have to be concerned about some of the talk and the rhetoric on trade.""The challenge is anticipating what Trump will do once in office. Will he crack down on immigration, dealing a blow to labor markets for restaurants, retail and construction? Hike tariffs on foreign-made goods and exit trade deals, which would be a hit to companies from Apple (AAPL) to Nike (NKE)? Push to slash tax rates and ease regulations, things business tends to like?""I don't think anyone has any idea what to expect,"" said David Yermack, a professor at New York University's Stern School of Business. ""Companies have to make educated guesses about what may happen when, but there's a huge amount of uncertainty.""Prepping for Trump's four years has added a new plank to public-relations strategy and the assessment of reputational risk. At PR firm Weber Shandwick, Liz Cohen, an executive vice president for financial communications, said she's advising clients to perform vulnerability analyses just as they would for outspoken activist investors.""Clearly, in this environment, it's important companies take a look at what parts of the business could be criticized,"" Cohen said.Such is the power of the Trump Twitter feed, with its 17.3 million followers. He's been using it to harass companies just as he did Hillary Clinton and his GOP primary rivals. A CEO can be thrust into the news cycle with no warning.""That's a little bit unnerving,"" said Southwest Airlines' (LUV) Gary Kelly. ""There is some volatility there. We just don't know where the bully pulpit is going to come from.""Lockheed Martin (LMT) was a recent target, slammed in a tweet for what the president-elect said were out-of-control costs for the F-35 fighter jet. The immediate fallout was painful, with the tweet sending the stock down 2.5% and erasing almost $2 billion in market value.In fact, Trump's gripe with Lockheed caused drops in other defense contractors, which had been rallying in anticipation his administration would boost defense spending, considering he said when he was campaigning that he wanted to beef up the number of U.S. troops, ships and warplanes.Whatever the industry, ""a lot of guys are thinking, 'Oh man, I don't want him tweeting about me and my company,""' said Ken Lowe, chief executive of Scripps Networks Interactive (SNI), which owns lifestyle-oriented websites and cable-television channels. And there's no telling who Trump will assail next.""A lot of us also think, 'That's one day. What's he on to tomorrow?'"" said Lowe.General Electric's (GE) Jeffrey Immelt said many chief executives would gladly accept fleeting bad publicity in exchange for the tax reform and job creation the next president may bring. Immelt said he's not worried about getting in the man's cross hairs — and that he keeps a sharp eye on @realDonaldTrump.""Sure,"" he said with a laugh during an exchange last week with reporters in New York. ""Who doesn't?""Bosses should totally get what Trump's doing when he calls a company on the carpet, because it's what so many of them do within their own operations. He's acting just like a CEO, Lowe said, by publicly asking, ""Why are you spending so much money?""In the corporate world, ""it's been an effective strategy,"" said Davia Temin, founder of the crisis-management company Temin & Co. ""It will be a fascinating experience to see how things that have worked inside global organizations translate to the political arena.""For all that, the victim of a Twitter pounce must be careful, she said.""Never start a press war with someone who can outgun you,"" Temin said. ""A CEO could choose to have a battle of the titans and fight back. That is a strategy, but not one I'd recommend.""Boeing (BA), another recent mark, certainly didn't take that road. In fact, according to people familiar with the matter, Boeing executives reached out to transition-team members to tell them the Air Force One price tag Trump had complained about could be lowered — if the government reduced the requirements. The company said CEO Dennis Muilenburg had spoken with Trump and was committed to keeping the project as affordable as possible.That's the kind of outcome, squishy as it is, that Trump can trumpet as a victory. There was a similar result after he hammered United Technologies (UTX) during the campaign for its plan to move some U.S. jobs to Mexico in its Carrier unit. Postelection, Carrier made a deal to keep an Indiana factory open with more than 1,000 employees in exchange for tax incentives provided by the state — whose governor is Vice President-elect Mike Pence — while still sending jobs to Mexico.Some executives profess not to be sweating it all.""We're not big enough to be on that radar screen,"" said Wendy's (WEN) CEO Todd Penegor. Maybe, but Trump has gone small too, even badgering a local union representative in Indiana.Asked if presidential unpredictability will make it harder to run a business, Lululemon Athletica (LULU) CEO Lauren Potdevin said only time will tell. The company generates about 70% of its revenue in the U.S. But as Potdevin took pains to point out, it's based in Vancouver, British Columbia, in a country not ruled from the White House.""Being a Canadian brand is awesome,"" he said. ""Everyone loves Canada.""

Volume in the stock market today was running slightly higher on the NYSE and slightly lower on the Nasdaq.The Dow Jones utility average delivered one of the day's better gains, up 0.6%.

Southern Co. (SO) fell nine sessions in a row, and it too rose Friday. The two utilities rose about 2% and 1% respectively but then reversed to nominal gains.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, five of the day's nine top gainers were from retail or the related apparel makers groups.Gap (GPS), the owner of the namesake and Old Navy chains, thrust 15% as it retook its 200-day and 50-day lines in huge volume. September sales were a bit more than expected. Francesca's (FRAN), another retailer in the same apparel/shoes group, popped 2%. The stock cleared a 16.30 buy point in an awkward pattern. Volume was below average.Other retailers doing well included department store Nordstrom (JWN), which added to Thursday's breakout; Best Buy (BBY), which climbed closer to an entry in a flat base; apparel maker PVH Corp. (PVH), which padded a recent breakout; and big box retailer PriceSmart (PSMT), which advanced 3% as it tries to build the right side of a pattern.On the downside, the day's worst performer was Food-Meat Products. Allegations that the poultry industry conspired since 2007 to fix prices rattled the group. Tyson Foods (TSN) dropped 9%; Sanderson Farms (SAFM), 6%; and Pilgrim's Pride (PPC), 5%.RELATEDU.S. Added Just 156,000 Jobs In September; Won't Change FedOil Rig Count Rises, But Texas Plays See Dips

115,PVH,"Shares of G-III Apparel (GIII) tumbled early Tuesday after the company fell well short of quarterly earnings views and offered disappointing guidance.Reporting before the open, G-III posted adjusted earnings of 17 cents a share for its fiscal third quarter, which ended in January. That was down from 49 cents the prior year and well below consensus estimates for 42 cents.It was the first time in four years the company logged lower earnings. The results also ended a run of four straight quarters of double-digit or better EPS growth for G-III, which sells everything from swimwear and accessories to outerwear and performance wear under its own Vilebrequin, Andrew Marc and Marc New York brands as well as licensed brands like Calvin Klein, Levi’s, Kenneth Cole and Tommy Hilfiger.Quarterly revenue gained 2% to $527.4 million, also well below estimates.G-III shares sank 19.4% to 44.52 in the stock market today after falling as low as 41.14. The stock had been rallying since mid-January and closed Monday’s session up 1% to 55.23.In a statement, CEO Morris Goldfarb called fiscal 2016 “a very strong year” for G-III, but said the company was “disappointed by our wholesale and retail outerwear business, which was heavily impacted by the warmest winter ever recorded. ... That said, we had excellent performances from our nonouterwear Calvin Klein businesses, as well as our dress and team sports businesses. We have significantly expanded our relationship with the Tommy Hilfiger brand and increased our financial investment and partnership with the Karl Lagerfeld brand. We will be making significant investments in these brands going forward.”G-III guided fiscal 2017 earnings in a range of $2.55 to $2.65 a share, below the $2.69 expected by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.Another apparel company, PVH (PVH), is slated to report fiscal Q4 results after Wednesday’s close.

116,PVH,"Stocks hung on to their early losses Thursday morning, as a firming dollar and weak oil prices pressured shares in the U.S. and Europe.The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 were down 0.5% each. The Nasdaq stuck with its early 0.4% loss. Volume turned mixed -- up 9% on the NYSE, and dipping 1% on the Nasdaq -- relative to action at the same time Wednesday.The stock market today got off on weak footing, as a rising dollar pressured commodities in general, with oil skidding hard for a second straight session. Early hawkish comments from St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard may have amplified that effect. European markets reacted sharply, with the CAC 40 in Paris down 2% in afternoon trade. The FTSE 100 in London and Frankfurt's DAX showed declines of 1.5% apiece.A preliminary March estimate from researcher Markit showed the U.S. service sector ticking up into expansion mode.

A federal district judge criticized the Federal Trade Commission for allegedly attempting to alter the testimony of an Amazon.com (AMZN) executive during antitrust proceedings. Staples is attempting to acquire Office Depot (ODP) in a $6.3 billion deal announced in February 2015. Office Depot shares spiked 12% in early trade.Apparel brand PVH (PVH) sewed up a 6% gain.

Shares are working on their ninth advance in 10 weeks, and they are just below their 40-week moving average in a six-month consolidation.Signet Jewelers (SIG) narrowed a 5% gain to 3%, boosted by fourth-quarter revenue and earnings, which met its preannounced (and above-consensus) guidance. The stock has been climbing off a February low, building the right side of a February consolidation.

It reversed higher after falling nearly 4% early. Late Tuesday, the retailer reported its second straight quarter of accelerating sales growth. Five Below is a heavily shorted stock, so part of today's move could be short covering.Meanwhile, IBD 50 name O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) is close to breaking out of a 21-week consolidation. Shares rose 1%.After the close, watch for earnings from two apparel makers: Oxford Industries (OXM) and PVH Corp. (PVH).Image provided by Shutterstock.

""Going forward, I remain confident in VF's ability to deliver continued long-term profitable growth and value creation for our shareholders.""On Wednesday, the company announced the election of Kroger (KR) CEO Rodney McMullen to the VF board of directors.Image provided by Shutterstock.

Sales jumped 34% to $1.9 billion, the highest increase in eight quarters. While business was solid across the board, Warnaco's portion contributed strongly to the results. Nevertheless, the company remained cautious, not raising its guidance for 2013 as it is still early in the integration process.

313,PVH,"PVH Corp. (PVH  -  Free Report) recently launched an integrated e-commerce site for its Heritage Brands, which allows cross-brand shopping. The sites launched include IZOD.com, VanHeusen.com and styleBureau.com, thus permitting customers to shop from the IZOD and Van Heusen brands via these sites in a single shopping platform. This website is built in collaboration with Firstborn, the design company.The launch of this website is expected to improve customers’ shopping experience through the availability of various choices, flexibility and convenience. Notably, StyleBureau e-shop will help customers to buy men’s clothing and accessories across the company’s IZOD, Van Heusen and EAGLE brands. The e-shop will also cover a wide range of the company’s offerings besides shirts and ties under the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands. Additionally, it features a ‘tie match’ device that will digitally connect the site’s more than 200 neckties as well as above 100 dress shirt styles.We note that PVH Corp.’s Heritage Brands has been witnessing sluggish growth compared with its premium Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands. In fact, the company continues to benefit from the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands’ solid momentum, particularly in the international regions. These have been significantly contributing to the company’s financial performance.In first-quarter fiscal 2018, revenues at Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger improved 18% and 21% each, whereas Heritage Brands segment’s revenues grew 5% year over year. For fiscal 2018, brand-wise, revenues are expected to increase roughly 8% (or 7% on a currency-neutral basis) at Calvin Klein and 7% (or 6% on a currency-neutral basis) at Tommy Hilfiger. However, management anticipates revenues from its Heritage Brands to be flat year over year.We believe that the launch of this new website for Heritage Brands will surely drive the segment’s revenues, while boosting the company’s overall profitability. This multi-platform online site is likely to enhance customers’ shopping experience and in turn generate higher sales.A glance at this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s share price shows that it has gained 7.6% year to date.

314,PVH,"Robust earnings surprise history, efficient brand management and strong cash flows are aiding PVH Corp. (PVH  -  Free Report) to scale higher. Also, its efforts to keep pace with the evolving consumer trends are commendable.In a year’s time, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has surged 30%, outperforming the broader Consumer Discretionary sector’s 12.6% rally. Notably, the company delivered 16th straight quarter of earnings beat in first-quarter fiscal 2018. We believe the company will continue to impress investors on the earnings front as evident from its long-term earnings growth rate of 12.6%. Additionally, management envisions fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share of $9.05-$9.15 compared with $7.94 reported in fiscal 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at $9.19 for the fiscal year.What’s Aiding This Robust Performance?Apart from impressive earnings history, PVH Corp. is performing well on the top-line front. In fact, it has delivered top line beat in the last seven quarters. For fiscal 2018, the company anticipates revenues to rise 6% while the same is expected to grow 5% (on a constant-currency basis) compared with fiscal 2017.PVH Corp.’s diversified brand portfolio allows it to stay ahead of its peers to generate above-average industry growth. Also, the company’s approach toward brand management facilitates each of its brands to develop further through efficient marketing strategies, financial control and operating leverage. Notably, its Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein brands have been performing exceedingly well, particularly in the international regions. These brands are likely to continue with its robust performance, which is apparent from brands’ upbeat guidance.For fiscal 2018, management anticipates revenues to rise roughly 8% (or 7% on a currency-neutral basis) at Calvin Klein and 7% (or 6% on a currency-neutral basis) at Tommy Hilfiger. Further, it expects second-quarter fiscal 2018 revenues to grow 15% (or 14% on a currency-neutral basis) at Calvin Klein and 13% (or 12% on a currency-neutral basis) at Tommy Hilfiger. This is likely to significantly boost the company’s top line and overall profitability.However, it is exposed to foreign currency translation risks, given PVH Corp.’s substantial international presence. Fortunately, currency has been working in favour of the company for the moment and is aiding growth. Notably, adjusted earnings included 20 cents per share positive impact from foreign currency in first-quarter fiscal 2018.Further, the company’s earnings outlook for second-quarter and fiscal 2018 reflect significant currency tailwinds. Favorable currency is likely to boost adjusted earnings per share by 3 cents in the fiscal second quarter and 12 cents in fiscal 2018.PVH Corp. also boasts a healthy balance sheet, which provides it with the financial flexibility to boost growth across its business. In fact, the company’s ability to generate a strong operating cash flow has helped in the execution of its long-term strategies such as global expansion, product enhancement and brand offerings, and building of operational infrastructure. Notably, in first-quarter fiscal 2018, management repurchased 400,000 shares for roughly $54 million under its $1.25-billion standing authorization that extends till Jun 3, 2020.Despite these tailwinds, the company is not devoid of persistent concerns. Volatility in the global markets and intense competition remain woes.Nevertheless, we believe PVH Corp.’s solid brand strategies, healthy balance sheet and other robust initiatives poise the company well for long-term growth.Better-Ranked Textile-Apparel StocksDelta Apparel, Inc.

319,PVH,"Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (ANF  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jun 1. The company has pulled off a positive earnings surprise in the trailing three quarters. Also, it posted an average earnings beat of 25% in the last four quarters.For the to-be-reported quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 79 cents, which narrowed by a penny in the last 30 days. However, the loss estimate has widened from a loss of 72 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayAbercrombie has been gaining from significant progress on initiatives, strategic capital investments, cost-saving efforts, loyalty and marketing programs. Also, the company is expanding its digital presence with growth of direct-to-consumer (DTC) and omni-channel capabilities. Notably, its investments in mobile, omni-channel and fulfillment have significantly led to development of the DTC business, which delivered double-digit growth in both the United States and international markets in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017.In addition, Abercrombie is aggressively expanding Hollister stores in new markets, thus enhancing the company’s overall performance. We note that Hollister brand is gaining traction from the positive customer response to product innovations, emerging categories and overall customer experience. The Hollister brand reflects persistent positive momentum from previous quarters, reaching the $2-billion mark in sales in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017. Also, comparable store sales (comps) for this brand improved 11% in the quarter.Apart from the afore-mentioned initiatives, the company remains keen on further improving customer experience by investing in loyalty programs and store expansion. It has also shifted focus to closing the underperforming U.S. chain stores to drive top-line growth and boost profitability. Furthermore, Abercrombie expects to maintain its disciplined approach toward expense management for improving the top- and bottom-line performance. For the soon-to-be-reported quarter, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $698.3 million, up 5.6% from the year-ago quarter.Abercrombie & Fitch Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Abercrombie & Fitch Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Abercrombie & Fitch Company QuoteThese initiatives have also aided Abercrombie to gain 43.8% in the past six months, faring much better that the industry’s increase of 2.9%.However, Abercrombie’s strained gross margins since last few quarters remain a concern in first-quarter fiscal 2018. Soft traffic at stores and a highly promotional environment have been weighing on the company’s margins. Its ongoing strategic initiatives to improve profitability are hurting margins as well. Notably, the company’s guidance suggests continued gross margin pressure in the fiscal first quarter.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model shows that Abercrombie is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

320,PVH,"Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 31. In the last reported quarter, the company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.1%. However, we note that in the trailing four quarters, this Issaquah, WA-based company has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 2.1%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Investors are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping for a positive earnings surprise from Costco in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is $1.68, reflecting a year-over-year increase of roughly 20%. We observe that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased by a penny in the past 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $31.74 billion, up approximately 10% from the year-ago quarter.Which Factors Hold Key to Costco’s Performance?We believe that the company’s growth strategies, sturdy comparable-store sales (comps) performance, strong membership trends and higher penetration of Citi Visa co-brand card program are the pillars that reinforce its position. While major chains are grappling with sluggish store and mall traffic as consumers switch to online shopping, the company seems somewhat resilient to the challenging retail backdrop.Costco continues to be one of the dominant retail wholesalers based on the breadth and quality of merchandise offered. In fact, the company’s strategy to sell products at heavily discounted prices has helped it to remain on growth track. The company remains committed toward opening new clubs in domestic and international markets.Additionally, a differentiated product range enables Costco to provide an upscale shopping experience for its members, consequently resulting in market share gains and higher sales per square foot. It is also gradually expanding e-commerce capabilities in the United States, Canada, the U.K., Mexico, Korea and Taiwan. Consequently, comparable e-commerce sales surged 43.1% in April, 33.2% in March and 38.1% in February.Costco continued with positive comps performance driven by improved store traffic and average transaction size. Comps for April increased 10.9%, following an advance of 8.6% in March and 10.5% in February. Certainly, improving labor market, rising disposable income and elevated consumer sentiment are working in tandem for the company.Costco Wholesale Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Costco Wholesale Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Costco Wholesale Corporation QuoteModel Predicts Higher Probability of Earnings BeatOur proven model shows that Costco is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

However, we note that in the trailing four quarters, this discount retailer has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 2.3%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at $1.40, up nearly 36% year over year. Analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues of $6,189 million, up roughly 10% from the year-ago quarter. Well the obvious question that comes to mind is whether Dollar General will be able to pull off positive earnings surprise.Factors at PlayWe believe that Dollar General’s commitment toward better price management, cost containment, private label offering, effective inventory management, merchandise and operational initiatives should drive sales and margin trends. This is quite evident from the aforementioned Zacks Consensus Estimate.Moreover, in order to increase traffic, Dollar General is focusing on both consumables and discretionary categories. Additionally, the company is expanding its cooler facilities to enhance the sale of perishable items and is rolling out DG digital coupon program too.Dollar General’s comparable-store sales (comps) growth story is impressive. Rise in average transaction has been driving comps higher. In first, second, third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, comps increased 0.7%, 2.6%, 4.3% and 3.3%, respectively. Given the past trends and strategic endeavors, the company is likely to continue with its positive comps performance in the to-be-reported quarter.Analyst polled by Zacks expects sales in the Consumables and Home Products categories to be $4,692 million and $377 million, up 8.7% and 13.2% year over year, respectively.

The consensus estimate is within the company’s guided range of $1.15 to $1.22. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has dropped a penny in the last seven days.Big Lots has a remarkable history, at least in terms of the bottom line. The company’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results marked the ninth consecutive quarter of an earnings beat. In the trailing four quarters, the company has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 12.3%.Big Lots, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Big Lots, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Big Lots, Inc. Quote Well the obvious question that comes to mind is whether Big Lots will be able to sustain its earnings surprise streak in the fiscal first quarter. Though the past trend indicates a positive surprise, it will not be wise to jump to a conclusion without analyzing the factors at play.Deciding FactorsBig Lots’ furniture financing programs and soft home category have been consistently gaining traction, which is likely to reflect in first-quarter fiscal 2018 results. Meanwhile, management has been expanding assortments in the furniture category by including lawn and garden items.In order to tap the opportunities in the furniture and soft home categories, the company has added brands and revamped the food department by giving it a fresh look for the convenience of customers. Further, the company has rolled out a cooler/freezer facility in stores in an attempt to expand its merchandise of food-related items to target food stamp recipients. These initiatives are likely to boost comps and revenues.However, Big Lots is not doing well on the revenue front. Its sales have lagged estimates in eight of the last 10 quarters. Analysts surveyed by Zacks expect revenues of $1,283 million for the fiscal first quarter, down almost 1%.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model shows that Big Lots is unlikely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

323,PVH,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Rocky Brands (RCKY  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 13% over the past month. RCKY hit a new 52-week high of $27.95 in the previous session. Rocky Brands has gained 44.4% since the start of the year compared to the 2.3% move for the Consumer Discretionary sector and the 12.3% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on April 24, 2018, Rocky Brands reported EPS of $0.44 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.25 while it missed the consensus revenue estimate by 0.35%.For the current fiscal year, Rocky Brands is expected to post earnings of $1.5 per share on $246.9 million in revenues. This represents a 29.31% change in EPS on a -2.49% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $1.65 per share on $254.5 million in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 10% and 3.08%, respectively.Valuation MetricsRocky Brands may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for RCKY? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Rocky Brands has a Value Score of B. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and D, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 18.2X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 13.4X versus its peer group's average of 14.8X. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Rocky Brands, Inc. Price and Consensus  Rocky Brands, Inc.

Price and EPS Surprise | American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. Quote Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the earnings announcement.Factors Likely to Impact 1Q18American Eagle has been grappling with soft margins for a while now. The decline in margins can be attributed to higher promotions along with increased shipping costs and compensation. Further, the company’s attempt to expand globally exposes it to adverse currency movements and other international risks.Although American Eagle's expansion plans and omni-channel growth are likely to strengthen its business, high dependence on external suppliers and macroeconomic headwinds might weigh on results. Evidently, the company delivered negative surprises in two of the last four quarters, with in-line earnings in the previous quarter.However, the stock has outperformed the industry in the past month, owing to the company’s impressive comps trend. Also, it has been gaining from strong online sales at both brands due to efficient use of omni-channel capabilities for enhancing customer experience.In the last three months, shares of the company have rallied 13.4% against the industry’s decline of 5.4%. What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively show that American Eagle is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

However, it broke the trend in the last reported quarter with a negative earnings surprise of 0.7%.Nevertheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.48 for the first quarter increased by a penny in the last seven days and reflects a year-over-year improvement of 29.8%. Management envisions earnings per share within $2.43-$2.48 for the quarter.Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise |  QuoteSo let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the earnings announcement.Factors Influencing 1Q18Ulta Beauty’s effective marketing initiatives, sturdy e-commerce business, superb salon operations and strength in prestige cosmetics bode well. Notably, Ulta Beauty recorded 60.4% growth in e-commerce sales in last reported quarter, which helped it to stand out amid intense online competition. Additionally, favorable traffic is driving its comparable store sales (comps) growth. Further, the company has been gaining from enhanced market share gains and benefits from loyalty program, which have been significantly contributing to its results. These are likely to prove conducive to the company’s upcoming quarterly results.These initiatives have also aided the stock to outperform the industry in the last three months. The stock has returned 27.2%, while the industry gained 2.8%.For first-quarter fiscal 2018, management anticipates net sales in the $1,506-$1,519 million band. Comps, including e-commerce sales, are predicted to grow 6-7%.Notably, analysts surveyed by Zacks expect revenues for the first quarter to come in at $1,525 million, up nearly 16% from the year-ago period. Further, the consensus estimate for salon business’ revenues is pegged at $80 million, up 8.5% from fourth-quarter fiscal 2017.However, Ulta Beauty has been grappling with soft margins for a while now. The company witnessed contraction of both gross and operating margins in the fiscal fourth quarter. Gross profit margin contracted 50 basis points due to deleveraged merchandise margins and one-time bonus payment with respect to tax reforms. Higher SG&A expenses along with lower gross margin led to the decline in operating margin.Further, the company is exposed to risk in the customer-driven industry as cheaper alternatives might deter buyers’ loyalty for the brand, consequently impacting the sale of products under Ulta banner.Zacks ModelOur proven model shows that Ulta Beauty is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

340,PVH,"PVH Corp. (PVH  -  Free Report) looks promising on the back of robust brand strength, impressive surprise history, healthy balance sheet and efforts to keep pace with the evolving consumer trends. Also, the company has topped the earnings estimates for the 15th consecutive quarter with sixth straight sales beat.These factors have raised investors’ confidence in this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. In a year’s time, PVH Corp. outperformed the Textile-Apparel industry and the broader sector. While shares of the company surged a whopping 52.5%, the industry and the Consumer Discretionary sector gained 32.9% and 7.2%, respectively. We believe that momentum is still left in the stock as it has a VGM Score of A and long-term earnings growth rate of 13%. Let’s Delve DeeperPVH Corp. has been doing extremely well, courtesy of its brand strength, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger in particular. In fact, these two brands are performing impressively worldwide and significantly contributing to the company’s profitability. Also, its approach toward brand management facilitates each of its brands to develop further through efficient marketing strategies, financial control and operating leverage. We believe that opportunities with regard to distribution, alongside a diversified brand portfolio poise the company for long-term growth.Furthermore, management issued robust guidance for the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands. For fiscal 2018, revenues are anticipated to increase roughly 9% (or 7% on a currency-neutral basis) at Calvin Klein and 8% (or 4% on a currency-neutral basis) at Tommy Hilfiger. For the fiscal first quarter, the company expects revenues to grow 17% (or 12% on a currency-neutral basis) at Calvin Klein and 19% (or 10% on a currency-neutral basis) at Tommy Hilfiger.PVH Corp. also has a significant international presence and outlets in various tourist destinations in the United States. Impressively, currency has been favorably impacting the company’s results. Given sturdy fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 and currency tailwinds, management issued bullish guidance for first-quarter and fiscal 2018. It expects favorable currency to boost adjusted earnings by 20 cents per share in the first quarter and nearly 35 cents per share in fiscal 2018.Moreover, analysts are growing bullish on PVH Corp. as apparent from its earnings estimate revisions. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.15 for fiscal 2018 and $10.47 for fiscal 2019 has moved up by a penny, respectively, in the last 30 days. Management envisions fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $9.00-$9.10 compared with $7.94 last year.Additionally, PVH Corp. boasts a healthy balance sheet, which provides it the financial flexibility to drive future growth. In fact, the company’s ability to generate a strong operating cash flow has helped in the execution of its long-term strategies, such as global expansion, product enhancement and brand offerings, and building of operational infrastructure.Based on these above-mentioned tailwinds, we believe PVH Corp. is a favorable investment option now.Want More of Textile-Apparel Stocks?

341,PVH,"Ralph Lauren Corporation (RL  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 23, before the market opens. The company posted positive earnings surprise of 8.6% in the last reported quarter.Moreover, the company delivered positive earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 10.4%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to ExpectThe question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this designer, marketer and distributor of premium lifestyle products will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 86 cents, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 3.4%. We note that earnings estimates for the current quarter have been stable in the last 30 days. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.49 billion, down about 4.7% from the year-ago quarter.Ralph Lauren Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Ralph Lauren Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Ralph Lauren Corporation QuoteRalph Lauren has outperformed the industry in the past year, driven by its positive earnings trend. The company’s shares have surged 53.2%, compared with industry’s gain of 39.1%.Factors at PlayRalph Lauren has a robust surprise trend with positive earnings surprises delivered in 12 straight quarters. The company has been gaining from favorable geographic and channel-mix shifts along with lower promotions and reduced product costs. Additionally, results in the recent quarters have been gaining from foreign currency tailwinds.The company adjusted fiscal 2018 outlook to account positive currency rates, which are likely to aid revenues and operating margins. Further, the outlook for fiscal fourth-quarter reflects optimism. The company expects fiscal fourth-quarter reported revenues to be down 8-10%, excluding currency impact. The company anticipates foreign currency to aid revenue growth by nearly 330 basis points (bps). Though it expects operating margin to decline 240-260 bps on a currency-neutral basis, foreign currency is likely to boost operating margin by about 90 bps in the fiscal fourth quarter.Including ASU 2016-09, the tax rate is expected to be nearly 3% in the quarter under review, driven by lower U.S. federal statutory income tax, owing to the new tax reform.Furthermore, Ralph Lauren remains focused to deliver goals under its Way Forward Plan while bolstering digital and international presence. Additionally, it is well on track with its restructuring plan, which is likely to generate savings of roughly $140 million by the end of fiscal 2019. These restructuring activities include rightsizing the portfolio and cost-structure alongside streamlining the organizational structure. All these factors make us optimistic about Ralph Lauren’s upcoming results.However, the company’s North America business continues to suffer due to distribution and brand exits, a planned reduction in shipments and promotions to enhance the quality of sales, and lower customer demand.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively show that Ralph Lauren is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

343,PVH,"Sony Corporation’s (SNE  -  Free Report) wholly-owned subsidiary, Sony Music Entertainment, recently entered into a definitive agreement with DHX Media Ltd. Per the deal, Sony Music will acquire 49% of the 80% equity interest held by DHX Media in Peanuts Holdings LLC. Notably, this $185-million agreement is expected to conclude on or about Jun 30, 2018.On completion of the deal, Sony Music will own about 39% of equity interest in Peanuts Holdings, whereas DHX Media will own about 41% of the same. The remaining 20% of the stake will continue to be owned by family members of Peanuts Holdings’ creator, Charles M. Schulz. Our TakeWe expect Sony’s diligent efforts in its Branded Product Business, including Mobile Communications, Imaging Product & Solutions, and Home Entertainment & Sound segments to facilitate solid growth. Measures like cost-reduction initiatives, lower exposure in low-profit geographic regions and reduction in advertising & promotion expenses are also anticipated to benefit this business in the long run. Moreover, the spectacular performance of the company’s Music business has proved to be a solid profit churner. In the past six months, shares of Sony have gained 4.8%, outperforming the industry’s increase of 0.9%. Meanwhile, the company’s Game & Network Services business, which accounts for its service-related revenues, has proved to be one of the strongest growth drivers. Per Sony’s mid-term business plan, console sales, subscriber addition to PlayStation network and virtual reality headset prospects are likely to drive its performance. For instance, over the past few quarters, robust sales of its flagship gaming product, PlayStation, have provided a boost to the top line. We believe strong sales of the PS4 hardware and software units should continue to fuel growth for the segment, moving ahead.Furthermore, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s ardent eye for strategic acquisitions and joint ventures is anticipated to be beneficial to its business. In this context, the Altair Semiconductor buyout is one of the notable acquisitions made by Sony. This buyout should expand the company’s footprint in the thriving wearable and IoT devices market. Also, it completed the buyouts of eSATURNUS NV and Zee Entertainment Enterprises’ sports broadcasting business, TEN Sports Network. Such strategic acquisitions are likely to enable the company develop new products, broaden customer base and market share.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks from the same space include Cable One, Inc.

344,PVH,"Ralph Lauren Corp. (RL  -  Free Report) is on a winning streak with its shares displaying notable momentum in the last six months backed by a solid earnings surprise trend, robust growth strategies and a favorable outlook. Further, the premium lifestyle retailer’s long term earnings growth rate of 8.8% and a VGM Score of A, highlight its inherent strength.Notably, the stock has improved 34.6% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s growth of 16%. Moreover, it has surged 7.3% in the past month owing to the robust earnings results and outlook. That said, let’s find out the reasons behind the upsurge in the stock price.Robust Earnings TrendAs mentioned earlier, Ralph Lauren’s robust earnings trend is one of the key reasons for the stock momentum. The company flaunts a solid earnings history, with positive earnings surprises delivered in 11 straight quarters. Notably, second-quarter fiscal 2018 marked its 10th consecutive earnings beat. Further, the bottom line grew year over year and gross profit margin continued to expand — thanks to favorable geographic and channel mix shifts along with lower promotions and reduced product costs.Ralph Lauren Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Ralph Lauren Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Ralph Lauren Corporation QuoteCurrency Tailwinds to Drive Future ResultsWhile foreign currency has long been a headwind for Ralph Lauren and most other retailers, favorable currency rates in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 benefited results. Foreign currency tailwinds contributed 40 basis points (bps) to revenue growth, 10 bps to gross margin expansion and 30 bps to operating margin growth in the second quarter. Following the strong quarter, the company provided outlook for the third quarter and adjusted guidance for fiscal 2018 to account for the recent positive movements in foreign currency rates.The company expects foreign currency to benefit revenue growth by nearly 160-170 bps and operating margin by 10-20 bps in the third quarter. Furthermore, it now estimates foreign currency to aid revenue growth by nearly 80 bps in fiscal 2018, against the previous guidance of minimal negative impact. Moreover, foreign currency is now anticipated to have a minimum effect on operating margin, compared with 40-50 bps negative impact predicted earlier.Way Forward Plan to Aid GrowthRalph Lauren remains on track to deliver goals under its Way Forward Plan that was announced in Jun 2016. Divided in two parts, the first part focuses on evolving the company’s core business in relation to product, marketing and customer experience. The second part centers around reviving operating structure by developing a systematic way of building stronger assortments, a demand-driven supply chain, an excellent sourcing capability and a multi-channel global expansion strategy. In short, the plan is all about refocusing on the core, strengthening the brands and returning the company to profitable growth in the long term. The company is also focused on lowering inventories to keep it on par with demand.Key Initiatives – Digital and International ExpansionAs part of key initiatives, Ralph Lauren remains keen on bolstering digital and international presence. On the International front, the company envisions immense growth potential in Asia, particularly in China. In the past two years, the company has elevated the brand in Asia and built strong business foundation by enhancing the quality of sales and profitability. With only 13% of its business in Asia, the company is currently underpenetrated in the region and anticipates numerous growth opportunities ahead.Going forward, the company expects Mainland China to be a major contributor of growth in Asia due to lower penetration and strong brand awareness in the region. Moreover, the company is continually expanding both online and physical presence in China, while also focusing on marketing and distribution. In the second quarter, the company successfully launched T-mall and JD.com, and with commerce on WeChat. Complementing these digital portals, the company has also opened 15 smaller format stores year-to-date in Mainland China.By the end of fiscal 2018, the company plans to have a total of 60 stores in Mainland China. Moreover, including Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, the company targets generating nearly $0.5 billion of revenues for Greater China in the next five years compared with about $170 million generated by the region in fiscal 2017.Possible DeterrentsWhile all is well with this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company, its North America business continues to suffer. Revenues at the North America segment slumped 16% in the second quarter owing to lower retail and wholesale sales. Lower sales in these channels can be attributed to distribution and brand exits; planned reduction in shipments and promotions to enhance the quality of sales; and lower customer demand. On a currency-neutral basis, comparable store sales at this division tumbled 9%. This included a drop of 6% in stores and 18% plunge in e-commerce sales, which were hampered by the planned reduction in promotional activities and fall in traffic.Looking for Some Trending Picks?

345,PVH,"You must have braced yourself for a rate hike, if you have followed the tide. As widely expected, the Federal Reserve raised the benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point for the third time this year to a range of 1.25-1.5%. This clearly signals that the economy is in good health with inflation gradually crawling toward the desired 2% target and job market remaining robust. Together, these have set the stage for a rate hike.The policy makers had trimmed the rate at a time when the economy had slipped into recession, and since then it has been treading cautiously and considering all the economic aspects before arriving at a decision over the rate hike. This is the fifth time that the Fed officials have raised the interest rate, since the financial crisis.The Fed, who have chalked out a detailed plan to shrink $4.5 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, continue to advocate three more hikes next year on expectations of strengthening job market. We noted that the U.S. economy added a robust 228,000 jobs in November, while the unemployment rate continues to hover around at its 17-year low rate of 4.1%.The Chairperson expects the unemployment rate to be around the current level at the end of 2017 but anticipates the same to dip 20 basis points to 3.9% in 2018. Industry experts believe that the labor market is likely to get a major boost from Trump’s tax reform policy. The new tax code once implemented will lower the burden of corporates, spur domestic investments and stimulate economic growth.Janet Yellen, whose term ends in February, pointed that any rational tax reform that triggers economic activities, helps create jobs and increase wages are always welcome. The Fed now envisions economy to grow at a rate of 2.5% in both 2017 and 2018, up from its previous forecast of 2.4% and 2.1%, respectively.Certainly, things are looking well placed at the very moment unless an unprecedented event disrupts the same. So, let’s focus on sectors that are likely to benefit from the move and pick some value-intrinsic stocks. Here we have highlighted four value stocks from consumer discretionary and financial sectors that have a favorable combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of A or B.4 Prominent PicksWe suggest investing in Tailored Brands, Inc. (TLRD  -  Free Report) with a long-term earnings growth rate of 16.5% and a Value Score of A. This operator of specialty apparel retailer delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 7.7% in the trailing four quarters. The company sports a Zacks Rank #1.

353,PVH,"Kirkland's, Inc. (KIRK  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 21, before the market opens.We expect the company to gain from its expanding e-commerce business. However, rising operating expenses stemming from business expansion efforts is likely to dent the company’s margins in the upcoming quarterly release. Notably, the company’s bottom line has lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average miss of 12.1%.Let’s look into some factors that are likely to impact the third-quarter performance of this specialty retailer of home decor products.What to Expect? The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is pegged at a loss of 7 cents per share, which is wider than the year-ago loss of 5 cents. Further, the consensus estimate has widened by a penny in the past 30 days.Nevertheless, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $144.2 million, improving 4.3% from the prior-year period.Kirkland's, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Kirkland's, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Kirkland's, Inc. QuoteFactors Impacting the Quarter Kirkland’s has been struggling with increased store occupancy costs, due to aggressive store expansion strategies. This has led to higher operating expenses in the last few quarters. Such headwinds are well reflected in the company’s price performance. The stock has declined 12.9% in the past year, as against the industry’s rally of 4.4%.  Higher costs can also be attributed to increased shipping, store payroll, advertising and packaging costs. Such expenditures are likely to hurt the company’s bottom-line performance. Further, costs associated with Kirkland’s supply-chain and omni-channel expansions may mar the bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter.However, Kirkland’s has been closing smaller and underperforming stores in malls to reduce costs and enhance efficiency. Additionally, the company plans to open bigger off-mall stores at popular locations, which are likely to boost sales. Incidentally, Kirkland’s intends to inaugurate 25-30 stores and close 20 in fiscal 2017. Furthermore, the company is on track with its initiatives to improve merchandise margins.Kirkland’s has also been gaining from sturdy growth in e-commerce platform. Management expects e-commerce business to grow at a greater pace than its brick-and-mortar stores and contribute significantly to top-line growth. In order to support the momentum of its online business, Kirkland’s has rolled out several new information systems to improve online purchasing and planning.Although Kirkland’s has been taking several initiatives to revive performance, we believe it will take time for the company to offset rising costs.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil? Our proven model does not show that Kirkland's is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) as well as a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen.Although Kirkland carries a Zacks Rank #3, its Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.

Quote What to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review has remained stable over the past 30 days at 11 cents, which is in line with the year-ago figure. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $566 million, up 5.6% from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayGuess? is likely to continue benefiting from its robust performance in Europe and Asia. Notably, the company has been witnessing solid sales and margin growth in these regions for nearly a year now. Evidently, European revenues surged 19% (on a currency-neutral basis) in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, while revenues in Asia were up 17%. Results in both regions were fueled by higher comparable store sales (comps) (including e-commerce) and store openings, while European sales also gained from constant efforts of Guess? to enhance sales quality and merchandise organization. Moreover, the operating margins in Europe and Asia continued to expand, courtesy of stringent cost-control efforts, mainly in supply chain. Strength in these regions and developing e-commerce has enabled Guess? to achieve year-over-year top line growth for four straight quarters now. This has also helped Guess? surge 41.3% this year, as against the industry’s dip of 2.3%. Further, the company remains on track to solidify its European and Asian businesses, as evident from its store-opening plans. While the company’s U.S. retail business continues to face challenges like soft traffic and intense promotions from evolving consumer preferences, Guess? remains focused on reducing its U.S. footprint by undertaking store closures. Also, the company is making strong efforts to link the brick-and-mortar stores, e-commerce and mobile sales to improve e-commerce operations. This has enabled customers to reserve merchandise online and pick them up from stores.We believe that all these factors, along with focus on cost curtailment and supply-chain enhancement are likely to drive Guess? in the quarter to be reported. Incidentally, management projects currency-neutral revenues to advance in a range of 2-4% in the third quarter, while adjusted earnings are envisioned in a band of 8 to 11 cents per share.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that Guess? may beat earnings estimates because it has the right combination of two key components.Zacks ESP: Guess? currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.47%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 12 cents is a notch higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise.

Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. The combination of the company’s Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP make us reasonably confident of a positive earnings beat.Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Zumiez Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +0.69% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.

355,PVH,"Hanesbrands Inc. (HBI  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 results wherein both top and bottom lines grew year over year. Moreover, the company posted organic sales growth for the first time in eight quarters, thanks to robust International sales growth. Domestic sales, on the other hand remained soft on account of a tough back-to-school selling season. While earnings came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate, sales missed the same. Also, management provided a bleak outlook, which weighed upon investors’ sentiment.Evidently, shares of Hanesbrands dropped 4.6% during yesterday’s after-market trading hours. This took Hanesbrands’ past three months performance to a decline of 7.1%, wider than the industry’s dip of 1.5%.Q3 HighlightsThe company posted adjusted earnings of 60 cents, which came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while it jumped 7.1% year over year. Including pre-tax acquisition and integration charges, earnings came in at 55 cents, depicting an increase of 22% from the year-ago period.Hanesbrands Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Hanesbrands Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Hanesbrands Inc. QuoteNet sales of $1,799.3 million climbed 2.2% from the year-ago period, though it fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,805 million. The year-over-year upside was backed by double-digit sales growth at the company’s International region, somewhat offset by soft domestic sales that stemmed from weak apparel sales in the back-to-school selling season.Notably, the quarter witnessed a rise in organic sales (on a reported and currency neutral basis) on the back of solid International sales that represented nearly 31% of the company’s top line. This, in turn was backed by strength in Hanes Europe Innerwear; Champion Europe and Hanes Australasia, with global Champion sales growing 16% in the quarter. Clearly, the company is benefiting from its geographic expansion and acquisition related synergies.This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s online sales also remained strong in the quarter, as sales growth from global online channels remained in the high 20s range. Notably, online sales formed about 9% of the company’s total sales, driven by growth across all regions and product categories.Hanesbrands' adjusted gross profit improved 2.7% to $680.7 million on the back of higher sales. Adjusted gross margin expanded 20 basis points (bps) to 37.8%. However, adjusted operating profit slipped 0.3% to $270.2 million in the reported quarter, with the operating margin contracting 40 bps to 15%. This stemmed from escalated SG&A costs (also as a percentage of sales).Segment DetailsInnerwear: Sales declined 5.2% in the quarter to $644.1 million, as the apparel category bore the brunt of a tough back-to-school retail landscape. Sales for the segment have been declining for a while now, as it fell 2.5%, 6% and 8% in the preceding three quarters, respectively. Operating profit also dropped 4.7% to $141 million owing to lower sales. Nonetheless, the company retained its market share in the basics category and online Innerwear sales surged more than 20% in the quarter.Activewear: Sales inched up 0.5% to $519.5 million, as contributions from GTM Sportswear’s buyout and online sales growth of more than 30% offset the adverse impact from a subdued back-to-school season.  Also, sales from the Champion brand rose by double-digits in the midtier, college bookstore and sporting goods networks. Operating profits jumped 8.3% to $79 million, buoyed by higher sales and savings from Project Booster.International: The third-quarter sales for the segment improved 16.4% to $556.7 million, while currency neutral sales grew 14%. The growth was driven by strong Champion sales in Asia and Europe, along with intimate apparel and underwear sales growth in Latin America and Australia. Moreover, extensive online sales growth bolstered sales improvement at the segment. Notably, operating profit surged 25% (up 23% on a currency neutral basis) in the quarter.Other: Sales declined 9.3% to roughly $79 million in the quarter. The segment posted an operating profit of $10.2 million, up 10.5% year over year.Other Financial DetailsHanesbrands ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $400 million, long-term debt of $3,566.5 million and equity of $1,231.2 million. Net cash from operations during the first three quarters amounted $331.1 million. This marked a 59% jump from the year-ago period, thanks to working capital improvement initiatives.The company paid dividends of $165.2 million, while it repurchased shares worth roughly $300 million during the first three quarters of 2017.2017 GuidanceHanesbrands remains optimistic about its organic sales growth in the fourth quarter. The company also remains impressed with the benefits from buyouts and its efforts to keep pace with the evolving consumer environment. However, management expects the fourth quarter to be impacted by additional marketing investments; the recently announced buyout of Alternative Apparel and effects of Sears Canada bankruptcy. Considering all factors, the company lowered the upper end of its sales and earnings guidance for 2017.Hanesbrands now projects net sales in the band of $6.45-$6.48 billion, compared with $6.45-$6.55 billion expected earlier. Further, it now envisions adjusted earnings from continuing operations in a range of $1.93-$1.95 per share, compared with $1.93-$2.03 guided earlier. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 is currently pegged higher than the projected range, at $1.99.The company’s GAAP EPS for continuing operations is now projected in the band of $1.68-$1.70, compared with $1.70-$1.82 forecasted earlier.Net cash from operations is now anticipated to be in line with or surpass the mid-point of its previously projected band of $625-$725 million.The company expects to incur around $95 million as pre-tax charges associated with Alternative Apparel’s acquisition and integration. It also envisions capital expenditures of approximately $90 million, while interest and other costs are expected to amount to $180 million on a combined basis. Management now expects synergy cost benefits of more than $20 million as in 2017, compared with $15 million anticipated earlier.Q4 OutlookFor the fourth quarter, management projects total net sales in a band of $1.63-$1.65 billion, with the mid-point depicting an increase of nearly 3% on an organic basis. This outlook is based on a conservative view for the U.S. sales landscape; sales of roughly $15 million expected from Alternative Apparel and negative effects from Sears Canada bankruptcy. Adjusted earnings are envisioned in a band of 51-53 cents, while GAAP earnings per share are projected to range from 47-49 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter is currently pegged quite higher, at 57 cents.The earnings estimate (both GAAP and adjusted) includes 5 cents from higher marketing investment, greater mix of International sales and the expected adverse impact from Sears Canada bankruptcy somewhat negated by greater-than-expected buyout synergies.   Looking for More?

356,PVH,"Robust earnings history and brand strength have been the cornerstones for success of PVH Corporation (PVH  -  Free Report). The company kept the trend alive in the recently reported third-quarter fiscal 2017, where earnings and sales topped estimates backed by solid momentum at its premium Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands.Driven by the solid third-quarter results, improvement in foreign currency rates and continued strength across its brands, PVH Corp anticipates delivering robust revenues and earnings in fourth-quarter 2017. This favorable view further backed by the strong start to the holiday season and the additional $20 million increase in marketing expenditures to take advantage of the continued momentum across its businesses. Moreover, the company raised guidance for fiscal 2017 on the aforementioned favorable trends.PVH Expects Strong Q4 on Solid Start to Holiday SeasonFor fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, the company expects total revenues to jump 11% year over year, while it is anticipated to advance 8% on a constant-currency basis. The company’s revenue growth guidance is in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimated revenue growth rate. While fourth-quarter revenues will be positively impacted by the inclusion of the 53rd week, it will bear the brunt of Mexico deconsolidation, the G-III Apparel licensing, and a shift in the selling period in advance of the Chinese New Year, which will fall in first-quarter fiscal 2018 this year.Brand-wise, revenues are expected to jump 16% (or 12% on a currency-neutral basis) at Calvin Klein, and 12% (or 7% on a currency-neutral basis) at Tommy Hilfiger, while revenues for Heritage Brands are anticipated to decline nearly 1%.Adjusted earnings per share for the fiscal fourth-quarter are expected to be $1.42-$1.44, including 2 cents per share positive impact from foreign currency translations.

On a GAAP basis, the company envisions earnings per share of $1.35-$1.37.Raised Fiscal 2017 ViewFor fiscal 2017, the company now projects revenues to rise 7% year over year, while constant-currency revenues are expected to grow 6%. Earlier, the company forecasted revenue growth of 6%, with constant-currency revenues improving 5%. Currently, the Zacks Consensus revenue estimate for fiscal 2017 is pegged at $8.7 billion, reflecting growth of nearly 6.1%, which lags the company’s estimate.Management expects revenues to continue being dented by the licensing deal with G-III Apparel and a $150 million reduction due to the Mexico deconsolidation.Brand-wise, revenues are anticipated to increase 9% (or 7% on a currency-neutral basis) for Calvin Klein and 8% (or 7% on a currency-neutral basis) for Tommy Hilfiger. Earlier, the company had projected revenue growth of 8% for Calvin Klein (7% on a currency-neutral basis) and 6% for Tommy Hilfiger (5% on currency-neutral basis). However, the company continues to expect revenues for Heritage Brands to be flat year over year.Management now envisions fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $7.78-$7.80, compared with $7.60-$7.70 expected previously. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 is $7.76 per share, which is below the company’s guidance range.The latest outlook includes an expected 17 cents per share negative impact from currency headwinds. The guidance also includes an additional $20 million marketing expenditures for Calvin Klein in the fourth quarter. On a GAAP basis, the company projects fiscal 2017 earnings per share in the range of $6.80-$6.82 compared with previous guidance of $6.44-$6.54.Stock PerformanceThough the company’s shares plunged nearly 2.1% since reporting earnings on Nov 29, it has gained a significant 48.8% year to date.

357,PVH,"The bull market that started in 2009 is expected to go strong this year. This optimism largely stems from the Santa Claus rally, which is being felt way ahead of Christmas. This year’s holiday season started on a solid note as consumers have stepped up their online purchases. But, it’s the Senate Republican’s approval of the rewrite of the U.S. tax code that is likely to drive the equity market higher.Further, encouraging economic backdrop and higher consumer confidence in recent times also painted a rosy picture. Thus, it’s time to invest in solid stocks that are likely to make the most of the bullish sentiments.December: The Best Month for InvestorsHistorically, the month of December has been the best for the S&P 500 investors. While it has been the second best for the Dow and the Nasdaq, the Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks also tends to perform well starting mid-December going into January.The table shows December’s monthly return for the S&P 500 from 1964-2016:MonthAverage ReturnJan0.9%Feb0.1%Mar1.2%Apr1.5%May0.2%Jun0.0%Jul0.4%Aug-0.1%Sep-0.4%Oct1.0%Nov1.1%Dec1.4%(Source: Topdown Charts, Thomson Reuters)In fact, all the major indices more or less have yielded an average return of at least 1.8% in the final month of the year since 1987, per CNBC analysis using Kensho. This is entirely because of the Santa Claus Rally or the rise in prices in the final six days of the year. This term was first coined by market analyst Yale Hirsch in 1972 in The Stock Trader's Almanac.But, many market pundits have been using the term to refer to the period from the beginning of December, or even as early as Black Friday, to Christmas. And this time around, markets have gained on strong holiday sales and, there you have it, a Santa Claus rally. Consumers have also shown confidence in their financial future and are prepared to spend more. This is usually what triggers a Santa Claus rally.Santa Claus Rally Drives Holiday SalesAbout 174 million Americans shopped during the Thanksgiving weekend, surpassing the estimated 164 million, according to the National Retail Federation. Cyber Monday, in fact, registered the largest online shopping day in U.S. history. Online sales crossed the $6.6 billion mark by the end of the day, reflecting a rise of 16.8% from the same period last year.Lest we forget, around $5.03 billion was spent online on Black Friday, reflecting an uptick of 17% from last year. Small Business Saturday and Sunday (Nov 25 & 26) also recorded combined online sales of $5.12 billion, up 10% from the year-ago levels.Senate Passes Sweeping Tax Overhaul BillThe Senate voted 51-49 to approve the Republican tax bill. It’s a major policy change that will create big winners and help markets maintain the decade-long bull run.The bill trims the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, marking the biggest one-time drop in big business tax rates. Banks face a high tax burden, which makes them big gainers when tax rates go down. Lower domestic tax rates will also result in repatriation of hundreds of billions of dollars in cash. This could help boost the economy and may cause interest rates to rise. Higher interest rates boost bank profits by increasing the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities.Let us also not forget, tech behemoths Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Cisco Systems (CSCO  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) hold 88% of their money overseas to avoid paying the 35% corporate tax rate. Thus, they are positioned to gain immensely under Trump’s tax reduction plan.As the Senate approved the tax bill, small-cap stocks will also tend to surge. After all, such companies have been paying taxes of more than 30% for quite some time, while their large-cap counterparts are paying close to 25%.Gearing Up for a Solid End to 2017: 5 BuysCourtesy of positive seasonal trend, solid holiday sales and Republicans’ approval of the nearly $1.5-trillion tax rewrite, we are lined up for a strong year-end rally. The economy had already seen the fastest growth in three years in the third quarter, which highlights its resilience toward devastating events like the recent hurricanes.Hence, it will be prudent to invest in five of the best stocks in the market that can make the most of this bullish sentiment. Such stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a VGM score of A or B. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three metrics. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners.PVH Corp.

358,PVH,"Benchmarks finished mixed on Wednesday as investors rotated out of tech stocks to financial stocks. Investors moved to financial stocks after both Yellen and Powell gave enough hint of a rate hike next month. Meanwhile, the second estimate of the U.S. GDP showed that the economy grew at its fastest pace in three years, which further boosted investors’ sentiment.  While the Dow posted an all-time record finish, the Nasdaq took a beating due to decline in tech stocks.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) increased 0.4%, to close at 23,940.68. The S&P 500 Index (INX) lost 0.04% to close at 2,626.07. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,824.39, decreasing 1.3%. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,467 to 1,340. On Nasdaq, advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by 1,478 to 1,270. The CBOE VIX increased 2.8% to close at 10.31.How Did the Benchmarks Perform?The Nasdaq tanked almost 88 points to end in the negative territory. The tech-laden index posted its worst single-day drop since Aug 17. Such losses were triggered after the investors rotated out of the tech stocks to financial stocks. Yellen’s comments that a burgeoning U.S. economy would pave way for the future of rate hikes encouraged the investors to move to financial stocks.Moreover, Powell had commented on Tuesday that he would continue to work toward raising interest rates at the same time as gradually unwinding the Fed’s humungous balance sheet. This also bolstered gains for the financial stocks.Shares of major tech players such as Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) and Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) all declined 4%, 2.7%, 2.1%, 2.4% and 5.5%, respectively. The PHLX Semiconductor index tanked 4.4% to 1,265.01 to post its biggest decline since Dec 1, 2016. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 shed less than a point to also end in the red. Although, eight of the 11 major segments of the S&P 500 ended in the green, gains were negated by sharp losses for the tech stocks. The Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) declined 2.2%. Such losses for the tech stocks weighed heavily on the broader markets.Finally, the Dow amassed 103 points to close at a record high following better-than-expected GDP data in the third quarter. Such a stellar showing by the blue-chip index was also supported by gains for UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), shares of which increased 3.1% and 2.3%.U.S. GDP Exhibits Highest Rate of Growth Since 2014According to the second estimate, the gross domestic product of the United States expanded at an astounding 3.3% in the third quarter of 2017. This also marks it fastest pace of growth since the third quarter of 2014. Per the report from the Commerce Department, consumer spending, the biggest contributor to economic growth advanced 2.3% in the 3Q17. Further, spending on business equipment shot up 10.4% in the period, also notching up a three-year high. Meanwhile, corporate pre-tax profits have surged 5.4% year-over-year.However, some analysts stated that such figures are rather aggrandized and do not present a true picture of the health of the economy. They have reasoned that inventories accounted for as much as 25% of the GDP growth and if excluded from the calculation, the U.S. GDP stands at 2.5% annual rate of growth.In her final testimony on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, Janet Yellen commented that the economic growth is largely broad based “across sectors as well as across much of the global economy.” However, price data in the GDP report clearly indicated that inflation remained well below the targeted 2%.Economic DataThe Fed’s Beige Book report showed that the economy has expanded at a modest to moderate pace. Moreover, the Fed also reported that it noticed a ‘slight improvement in the outlook.’Further, pending home sales for the month of October increased 3.5%, surpassing the consensus estimate of a 2% growth.

The adjusted EBIT margin expanded 20 bps to nearly 12.5%.Segment AnalysisPVH Corp. reports financial results under three business segments: Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Heritage Brands.Calvin Klein’s revenues advanced 6% year over year to $943 million, including about $20 million impact from the deconsolidation of the company’s business in Mexico in November 2016. The growth was driven by a 20% increase in the segment’s International revenues, partially offset by a 5% decline in revenues for the North America business.Growth in International business was backed by solid performance of wholesale business in Europe, alongside robust growth in the retail business due to 9% comparable store sales (comps) increase and square-footage expansion. Meanwhile, revenues for the North America business was primarily hurt by the deconsolidation of the Mexico business as well as 1% decline in comps. In constant currency, revenue for the segment improved 4%.Revenues at the company’s Tommy Hilfiger segment jumped 10% to $1 billion, while it improved 7% in constant currency.

This was partly offset by nearly $20 million reduction due to the discontinuation of its directly-operated womenswear wholesale business in the United States and Canada in fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 in connection with the licensing of this business to G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. (GIII).The Heritage Brands segment’s revenues dipped 7% year over year to $396 million due to a planned change in Wholesale shipment timings from the third quarter to the second quarter.

362,PVH,"U.S. markets took a breather after China's president expressed plans to lower tariffs on vehicles and work on intellectual property rights. However, a new issue flared up with a chemical attack in Douma close to the Syrian capital, Damascus. Consequently, the Trump administration is weighing its military actions against Syria. Per sources, the U.S. President is likely to strike soon as his team is working seriously on this issue. These actions might call for trouble between the United States and Russia, thus rattling the global economy.Meanwhile, tech stock’s concerns about Facebook’s (FB  -  Free Report) data breach scandal and apprehensions related to further rate hikes by the Fed continue to do the rounds.Amid these headwinds, investors are quite confused as to which stock might fetch them good returns. To make the search easier we have handpicked a few stocks from the Consumer Discretionary sector that are doing well in this market scenario and have stellar past records.Why the Consumer Discretionary Sector?Despite afore-mentioned market repercussions, the Consumer Discretionary sector is grabbing attention because of a buoyant U.S. economy which offers multiple tailwinds.The U.S. economy appears to be positive on improving consumer spending, tightening labor market, accelerating wages and increasing government expenditure. Per the Commerce Department, consumer spending that constitutes more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity inched up 0.2% each in February and January. The outlook for the American consumer spending is also likely to improve further as the aforementioned positive factors linger.Consequently, the Consumer Discretionary sector that houses textile-apparel, hotels and motels as well as other discretionary consumer products, gained 8% in the past year.Further, the first-quarter 2018 outlook for the Consumer Discretionary sector looks good. Per the latest Earnings Outlook, quarterly earnings for the sector are anticipated to increase 7% year over year on 6.8% growth in revenues.That said, we will here focus on the Textile – Apparel industry within the broader Consumer Discretionary space. Currently, the industry seems to be performing well as its players are adhering to solid omni-channel mantra with expansion of digital capabilities. Also, well-knit strategies like effective merchandise plans, customer-centric initiatives, loyalty programs have been boosting growth. Incidentally, the industry ranks among the top 39% of all Zacks industries.Among the Textile – Apparel stocks, we have zeroed in on four companies with greater potential. Shares of these companies have also cruised ahead of the industry in a year. While any stock can witness a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the industry. These stocks also have impressive track record, excellent long-term earnings growth rate and favorable Zacks Rank.With that said, our research shows that a stock with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), when combined with a VGM Score of A or B, has robust growth potentials.4 Winners to Hook UpGuess?, Inc.

However, the ongoing steel costs inflation has been largely weighing on its margins, which is likely to continue hurting margins in the second quarter.Following the soft quarterly results, management updated its guidance for 2018. Sales are now projected to grow nearly 9-12% year over year to $4.3-$4.4 billion, up $100 million from the previously guided range of $4.2-$4.3. The raised top-line guidance was backed by continued steel inflation. The company’s solid sales view is backed by expectations of mid-single-digit volume growth, raw material price increases and favorable currency. Additionally, the PHC acquisition is likely to contribute 2% to sales growth.Consequently, EBIT margin is envisioned to be nearly 11.5-12% compared with 12-12.5%, guided earlier. However, on assuming that costs will stabilize, Leggett predicts margins to improve through the second half of 2018.Based on above iterations, management projects earnings from continuing operations in the range of $2.60-$2.80 per share, down 5 cents from $2.65-$2.85 projected earlier. The downside can be attributed to adverse impacts of continued steel cost inflation as well as the pricing lag for recovering greater costs. Notably, this guidance takes into account an effective tax rate of 22%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the year is pegged at $2.75.Additionally, the company seems to be continuing with its trend of generating more cash to fund dividends and capital expenditures. For 2018, Leggett expects operating cash flows of about $450 million compared with $500 million anticipated earlier. Capital expenditures for the year are still projected at $160 million, while the company intends to spend $195 million toward dividend payouts. The company also outlined the target dividend payout ratio to be 50-60% of adjusted earnings. Furthermore, it expects payout for 2018 to be near the midpoint of the aforementioned range.Meanwhile, management plans to continue with its share repurchase program, having a standing authorization to buy back up to 10 million shares every year, after fulfilling all priority requirements. For 2018, the company also intends to repurchase nearly 2-3 million shares and issue about 1 million shares primarily for employee benefit plans.Three Top-Ranked Stocks in the Consumer Discretionary SpaceGuess?, Inc.

367,PVH,"It was not UGG but sturdy sales performance across HOKA ONE ONE and Teva brands coupled with lower cost of sales and SG&A expenses that enabled Deckers Outdoor Corporation (DECK  -  Free Report) to post better-than-expected second-quarter fiscal 2018 results.

368,PVH,"Whirlpool Corporation (WHR  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 results, wherein both earnings and sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The quarter marked the company’s fifth consecutive negative earnings surprise and second straight sales miss. Additionally, management cut earnings guidance for 2017 due to higher raw material inflation and unfavorable price/mix.Consequently, shares of this world’s leading home-appliances manufacturer declined 6.6% in the after-hours session yesterday. Further, Whirlpool’s shares have lost nearly 4.5% in the past three months, narrower than the industry’s decline of 16.2%.Q3 HighlightsWhirlpool’s quarterly adjusted earnings per share came in at $3.83 that missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.90.  However, it increased 4.7% year over year.On a GAAP basis, the company’s earnings grew 20% to $3.72 per share from $3.10 earned in the prior-year quarter. The upside was driven by lower income tax expense versus year-ago period, owing to the timing of tax planning activities in the current year.Revenues were $5,418 million that rose nearly 4% from the comparable year-ago quarter revenues of $5,248 million. The top line fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,487 million. On a currency-neutral basis, Whirlpool registered sales growth of 2%. Markedly, the top line benefited from strength in North America, Asia and Latin America.  Further, adjusted operating profit in the quarter dropped 9.8% to $376 million from $417 million in the year-ago quarter. Also, the operating margin contracted 100 basis points (bps) to 6.9%. During the quarter, ongoing cost productivity and increased unit volumes were more than offset by the adverse product price/mix and raw material inflation.Regional PerformanceRevenues from North America went up 3.5% year over year to $3 billion while the same grew 4% on a currency-neutral basis. Adjusted operating profit margin contracted 40 bps to 11.7% while in dollar terms operating profit grew 1.2% to $350 million. Notably, operating profit gains reflected from higher unit volumes and cost productivity negated adverse currency impacts and raw material inflation. However, the negative impact of raw material price inflation dented operating margins. Yet, the company retained North-American industry unit shipments guidance of 4-6% growth for 2017.Revenues from Latin America rose 6.1% year over year to $849 million. Also, the same increased 5% excluding the effects of currency translation. Adjusted operating margin of 6.3% increased 50 bps, on the back of higher volumes and cost productivity gains, more than offset by raw material inflation and adverse product price/mix. The company reiterates its industry unit shipments in Brazil to be flat in 2017.Meanwhile, revenues from EMEA remained flat year over year at $1.3 billion. On a currency-neutral basis, the same dropped 8%. Whirlpool reported adjusted operating profit of $11 million in the third quarter versus adjusted operating profit of $48 million in the year-ago quarter. Further, its adjusted operating margin came in at 0.8%, which fell 290 bps from the year-ago period. The decline can be attributed to raw material inflation, adverse product price/mix as well as lower volumes that were more than offset by cost productivity benefits and restructuring gains. However, Whirlpool reaffirms its industry unit shipments growth in 2017 in the range of flat to up 2%.Revenues from Asia grew 5.6% to $357 million in third-quarter 2017 from $338 million in the prior-year quarter. Excluding currency effects, revenues rose 4%. However, adjusted operating margin contracted 430 bps to 0.6%. Cost productivity gains were more than compensated with adverse product price/mix in China and raw material inflation. Nevertheless, management maintains its industry unit shipments guidance in the range of flat to 2% growth for 2017.Financial PositionWhirlpool had cash and cash equivalents of $1,087 million as of Sep 30, 2017 and long-term debt of $3,669 million.The company used cash of $33 million in operating activities during the nine months of 2017. In the same period, the company’s capital expenditure was $371 million. As of Sep 30, 2017, Whirlpool had negative free cash flow of $348 million due to the company's focus on working capital optimization.In the reported quarter, management bought back shares for nearly $200 million and intends to repurchase in the remaining period of 2017. Moreover, Whirlpool bought back shares worth $550 million and paid cash dividend of $235 million in the nine months of 2017.Other DevelopmentsWe note that Whirlpool has been witnessing significantly higher raw material prices, which are expected further increase through 2018. In October, management announced to its trade customers, global cost-based pricing that will include most of the company’s operations in order to mitigate raw material inflation. This is anticipated to be implemented in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of 2018.Furthermore, Whirlpool took initiatives to cut down its fixed overhead expenses by $150 million. These initiatives are likely to be implemented in early 2018 and add to its ongoing cost productivity program.GuidanceWhirlpool slashed earnings forecasts for 2017 based on raw material inflation and adverse price/mix. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company now envisions adjusted earnings per share for 2017 in a range of $13.60-$13.90 compared with $14.50-$15.00, guided earlier. On a GAAP basis, Whirlpool anticipates earnings in a range of $11.10-$11.40 per share compared with the previous estimate of $12.40-$12.90 for 2017.Whirlpool Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Whirlpool Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Whirlpool Corporation QuoteNonetheless, the company continues to anticipate generating free cash flow of about $900 million for 2017 while it revised operating cash flows guidance to range from $1.55–$1.6 billion. Earlier, the company had anticipated operating cash flows of $1.65-$1.7 billion.The revised guidance includes restructured cash outlays of approximately $175 million, legacy product warranty and liability costs of $70 million, pension contributions of $45 million and capital expenditures of $650-$700 million.Also, management stated that it reiterates 2020 goals and remains optimistic about ongoing growth initiatives as well as global cost-based pricing and fixed cost reduction strategies.Three Stocks Hogging the LimelightSome better-ranked stocks in the broader Consumer Discretionary sector include G-III Apparel Group, Ltd.

369,PVH,"Columbia Sportswear Company (COLM  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, after the markets close. While the company is expected to gain from sturdy performance in its Europe-direct business and prAna brand, results are likely to be hurt by declines across the United Sates, Latin America and Asia Pacific regions. As a result, both top and bottom lines depict a probable year-over-year decline.Let’s now have a closer look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Europe-Direct Business and prAna Brand to Continue Growth Columbia Sportswear has been witnessing stellar performance in its Europe-direct business for some time.  In fact, the wholesale, brick-and-mortar and e-commerce channels across the Europe-direct business have depicted sustained growth during the first-half of 2017.Owing to this trend, analysts polled by Zacks expect sales from the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) regions to inch up 2.7% year over year to $75 million. Similarly, net sales from Canada are also expected to grow 1.3% to $76 million owing to strong performance of the company’s core brands.From a brand perspective, we note that Columbia Sportswear’s prAna brand has been attracting a large consumer base. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of revenue for prAna brand is $38.1 million, almost in line with the prior-year figure.Headwinds Impacting Revenue Analysts polled by Zacks expect net sales from United States and Latin America and Asia Pacific (LAAP) regions to decline 2.5% and 0.9% respectively during the third quarter.Of late, the company has been facing challenges in the domestic region, especially in the wholesale front, mainly due to store closures, bankruptcies, or plans to restructure or liquidate. This has led to lower-than-expected advance orders for fall 2017 from U.S. wholesale customers.Revenues in the LAAP region have also witnessed challenges lately, owing to lower sales in Korea. There has been a general shift of consumer preference away from outdoor apparel and accessories in Korea. Also, the consensus estimate of revenues for the SOREL brand is $86 million, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 1.8%.Owing to such headwinds, analysts polled by Zacks expect total revenues of $734.9 million for the said quarter, down 1.4% from the year-ago period.These ongoing challenges are also visible in Columbia Sportswear’s share price performance. Shares of the company have underperformed the industry in the past six months. The stock has returned 4.8% compared with the industry’s gain of 10.9%.   Earnings ExpectationsThe expected decline in revenues across some of its core regions and brands has led to a bleak earnings view. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.15 for the third quarter depicts a decline of 2.7% from the year-ago period.However, estimated earnings for 2017 of $2.78 per share depict a growth of 2.2% from the year-ago figure and are in line with management’s guidance of $2.74-$2.84. Estimates for both the quarter under review as well as fiscal 2017 have remained stable over the past 30 days.We note that Columbia Sportswear has delivered an average positive surprise of 12.3% in the trailing four quarters. Notably, the company’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in 18 straight quarters.Columbia Sportswear Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Columbia Sportswear Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Columbia Sportswear Company QuoteWhat Does the Zacks Model Say?

371,PVH,"Michael Kors Holdings Limited‘s (KORS  -  Free Report) positive earnings surprise, store optimization and global expansion bode well. Further, the company’s decision to acquire Jimmy Choo gives an indication that it is focused on international fashion brands. However, waning top-line along with dismal comps and wholesale segment performance continues to act as headwinds. The company has taken several strategic initiatives to bring both the top line and comps back on growth trajectory.Turn Around StrategyMichael Kors’ acquisition of Jimmy Choo will help diversify portfolio and tap international markets. The buyout is likely to be accretive in the low-single digits in fiscal 2020. In order to drive top-line growth, the company has been focusing on store expansion. In fiscal 2016, the company opened 142 new stores, which included 47 in the Americas and 95 worldwide. In fiscal 2017, it opened 159 net new stores openings, which includes 111 outlets related to the acquisition of the earlier licensed operation in Greater China. Given the scope for high profitability from company-owned stores, management is putting more emphasis on opening retail outlets.Sales from Asia have shown tremendous improvement. The company had stated that it will continue with the expansion drive in Asia and also believes it has an opportunity worth $1 billion in the long term.In an effort to increase the profitability in stores fleet, the company has announced its intention to close between 100 to 125 full priced retail stores over the next two years. Moreover, the company stated that it will incur one-time costs of nearly $100-$125 million related to store closures. Meanwhile, it anticipates annual saving of $60 million due to store closures as well as fall in depreciation and amortization related with these impairment charges.Hurdles to CrossMichael Kors’ wholesale segment continues to pose concern. In first-quarter fiscal 2017, wholesale segment sales declined 23% to $303.6 million primarily due to dismal performance of Americas, European and Asia region, while on a constant currency basis, it fell 22.7%. In the fourth, third, second and first quarter of fiscal 2017, wholesale segment sales declined 22.8%, 17.8%, 18.4% and 7%, respectively.Stiff competition, falling comps, aggressive promotional environment and waning mall traffic are making things tough for Michael Kors. We noted that comparable sales had fallen 5.9% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, following declines of 14.1%, 6.9%, 5.4% and 7.4% in the fourth, third, second and first quarters, respectively.Michael Kors which shares space with Gildan Activewear Inc. (GIL  -  Free Report), PVH Corp. (PVH  -  Free Report) and Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU  -  Free Report) is struggling with top-line performance. After registering meager growth of 0.2% in first-quarter fiscal 2017, it had declined 3.7%, 3.2% and 11.2% in the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017. In first-quarter fiscal 2018, revenues declined 3.6%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

372,PVH,"Select Comfort Corporation  is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 17, after the closing bell.Currently, the question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether the company will be able to deliver positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. Select Comfort’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last two quarters, with the trailing four-quarter average beat of 24.5%.  Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review has been stable at 68 cents in the last 30 days, while the same has moved up by a penny to $1.40 for 2017. Notably, these estimates reflect a year-over-year growth of about 21% for the impending quarter and 27% for the current year.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $415.1 million and $1.43 billion for the third quarter and 2017, up 12.8% and 8.9%, respectively.Select Comfort forms part of the Consumer Discretionary sector, which is currently placed at the bottom 38% (10 out of 16) of the Zacks classified sectors. Also, we observed that the sector has gained 16.7% in a year, below the S&P 500’s growth of 19.3%.Per the Earnings Outlook, total earnings for the sector are expected to decline marginally by 1.9%, while revenues are projected to improve 2.9%. As per the report, 5.6% of the total S&P 500 companies in the sector have already reported their financial numbers. Notably, all the companies in the sector delivered positive earnings surprises and also surpassed the top-line expectations.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model conclusively shows that Select Comfort is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

This increases the predictive power of ESP, thus making us confident of an earnings beat.Factors Likely to Impact the QuarterSelect Comfort has been benefiting from its ongoing strategic initiatives such as brand innovations, direct-to-consumer distribution model, digital enhancement, and pricing power. Meanwhile, the company remains focused on its new marketing campaign — The Future of Sleep — that is expected to raise demand for the company’s 360 smart bed products.In fact, these initiatives are well reflected in the company’s share price that surged 50.3% in a year, substantially outperforming the industry’s gain of 15.4%.Evidently, sales in the second quarter rose 3% year over year. Also, management stated that demand in the reported quarter was ahead of the company’s expectation and store traffic was steady throughout the quarter as well.Though traffic at the stores were consistent, retail comparable-store sales (comps) declined 6% during the second quarter. Also, the company-controlled comps decreased 4% year over year. However, comps for 2017 are anticipated to increase by low-single digits.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite also gained 1.6% driven by a sharp rebound in tech stocks.Technology Stocks Drive Markets Major driver of Thursday’s stock markets surge was the turnaround in the tech sector which suffered significant losses in recent times. First, a major data breach of about 50 million users of Facebook Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) and then President Trump’s indication that the government may impose Internet taxes to rein in Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) weighed on the tech sector.

The Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq gained 2.7%, 2.1% and 1% respectively. Markets staged a powerful rebound on Monday as tensions of an ensuing trade war between the United States and China appeared to ease.

Stock markets entered correction territory in February due to high inflationary expectations. Following a short resurgence, stocks continued to suffer in March due to President Trump’s tariff policies and the tech stock plunge, which occurred due to certain company-specific issues. However, strong consumer and business sentiments and a robust labor market helped to curb losses toward the end of the first quarter.Stocks That Made HeadlinesPVH Corp Tops on Q4 Earnings & Sales, Issues FY18 ViewPVH Corp. (PVH  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected earnings and sales in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017.

375,PVH,"Possibilities of a U.S.-China trade war have created a chaotic situation, compelling investors in the Wall Street to play safe. Ignoring the market jitters, a few stocks have managed to reach a pinnacle or more specifically hit a 52-week high. Here we have highlighted two such stocks — PVH Corp. (PVH  -  Free Report) and American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. (AEO  -  Free Report) — which scaled a 52-week high on Apr 5 and have outperformed their respective industries in the past three months.Let’s analyze whether the momentum these stocks have shown is sustainable.What’s in Favor of PVH Corp?PVH Corpscaled a new 52-week high of $160.22, closing a tad lower at $159.51. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock is gaining investor confidence on superb earnings history and brand strength. The stock has rallied 11.8% compared with the industry’s gain of 4.4% in the past three months.PVH Corp’s diversified brand portfolio lends it an edge over peers, allowing it to generate above-average industry growth and sustain its position in a challenging environment. The company’s approach to brand management helps each of its brands grow through efficient marketing strategies. Based on the strength of many of its brands, particularly Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein, coupled with opportunities with regard to distribution, we believe that the company is poised for long-term growth. Also, the strong guidance instills confidence. For fiscal 2018, the company projects revenue growth of 7%, while constant-currency revenues are expected to improve 4% from fiscal 2017. Management envisions fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $9.00-$9.10, compared with $7.94 last year.Given the company’s strong fundamentals, we expect PVH Corp to scale higher in the coming days. Notably, the stock shares space with Delta Apparel, Inc. (DLA  -  Free Report).Are Solid Comps Driving American Eagle Outfitters?American Eagle reached a new 52-week high of $21.35 on the day, closing the session at $21.25. The stock has gained 18.4% over the past three months, compared with the industry’s gain 0.8%. The outperformance can be attributed to the company’s solid comparable store sales (comps) trend, which continued in third-quarter fiscal 2017 and through the holiday period.The third quarter marked the company’s 11th straight quarter of positive comps, which rose 3%. Key factors driving this trend are solid online sales, strength in both American Eagle and Aerie brands, improved in-store traffic and favorable product mix. Among the company’s brands, Aerie has delivered comps growth for 14 straight quarters.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company strives to develop its omni-channel platform to better reach customers. Hence, the company has been upgrading its website as well as mobile app. Backed by these efforts and efficient digital marketing endeavors, American Eagle’s e-commerce sales contributed about 25% to third-quarter fiscal 2017 revenues. Strong online sales at both brands also drove comps. We believe the plans for omni-channel growth open up significant opportunities for the company to expand its business and meet the rising global demand for its products.We are also encouraged to note that American Eagle, which shares space with The Buckle, Inc. (BKE  -  Free Report) plans to focus on strengthening its product assortments by adding more brands, managing inventory levels and enhancing e-commerce capabilities. The strategic initiatives to boost its top line are expected to propel the stock higher as well.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

376,PVH,"V.F. Corp. (VFC  -  Free Report) has successfully acquired the privately held outdoor and sports apparel company Icebreaker Holdings Ltd. for an undisclosed amount. Following the conclusion of the acquisition, which was announced in November 2017, this Auckland, New Zealand-based brand has become a wholly owned subsidiary of V.F. Corp.The acquisition of the Icebreaker brand, which uses natural merino wool in its merchandise, perfectly complements V.F. Corp’s SmartWool brand that also has the merino component in its clothes and accessories. Rightly, this acquisition will enhance V.F. Corp’s position in the growing and underpenetrated natural fiber category. The company expects the addition of the brand to be immediately accretive to its bottom line.Founded in 1995, Icebreaker is popular for its natural clothing solutions as its merchandise are designed using merino wool, plant-based fibers and recycled fibers. The company uses a ‘farm to garment’ approach, buying merino wool from some of the most sustainable and ethical Merino farms in New Zealand. Served by 340 full-time employees, the brand is available in 47 countries.Operating under the V.F. Corp. umbrella, Icebreaker will retain its name as a unique brand and continue to base its employees in New Zealand.As it is, we believe that the acquisition provides increased opportunity for both parties. As for V.F. Corp., the Icebreaker brand will strengthen its leadership position in the natural fiber space. Meanwhile, this transaction provides Icebreaker and its suppliers with the opportunity to illustrate the benefits of its sustainably-farmed, ethically-sourced, New Zealand merino wool products to a whole new set of consumers. Icebreaker is positioned to gain from V.F. Corp’s strong customer base and reach.V.F. Corp. closed trade at $74.27, reflecting a 1.6% upside before the news made rotations.

378,PVH,"Hanesbrands Inc. (HBI  -  Free Report) has been facing multiple challenges from rising competition and evolving trends in the apparel space. This has dampened investors’ sentiments, which is evident from the stock’s 10.2% decline against the industry’s rally of 26.1%. In fact, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company hit a 52-week low of $17.94 during the trading session on Apr 2, eventually closing at $18.18.On the flip side, other players like Michael Kors (KORS  -  Free Report), Lululemon Athletica (LULU  -  Free Report) and PVH Corp. (PVH  -  Free Report) have been delivering stellar performance and contributing toward the industry’s rally on the back of well-chalked strategies to stay competitive.  Let’s take a closer look at the factors that have made Hanesbrands the odd pick and see if there’s any scope for a turnaround.What’s Pulling Hanesbrands?After posting in-line earnings in the preceding two quarters, the company succumbed to a negative surprise in the fourth quarter of 2017. Moreover, earnings fell year over year, thanks to higher cost of sales and higher SG&A expenses as well as interest expense. An improvement in the top line failed to cushion the downtrend. Further, adjusted operating profit slipped 7.7% with the operating margin contracting 180 bps, due to higher SG&A expenses.  Apart from this, we note that the Intimate Apparel/Innerwear industry is highly competitive and price sensitive. The company’s strategy to focus more on premium brands and hike prices in these categories come with the inherent risk of consumers shifting to more competitively-priced brands offered by competitors. Thus, failure to offer high-quality distinguished products at competitive price may hamper Hanesbrands’ market share, resulting in lower earnings and sales.Moreover, to add to investor’s disappointment, management continues to be cautious about 2018, given a challenging U.S. wholesale landscape. Also, rising input costs and increased marketing investments to support new innovations are likely to affect margins. Incidentally, management expects operating margin for the first half of 2018 to be hurt by escalated marketing and distribution costs.  Any Hopes of a Turnaround?We are hopeful about the company’s focus on buyouts, evident from its recent acquisition of Bras N Things that is likely to augment earnings in 2018. In this regard, the company has been gaining from contributions from Champion Europe and Hanes Australasia that were acquired in 2016.Additionally, the company has long been benefitting from the solid performance of its international segment, driven by store openings, robust consumer demand and extensive online sales. Moreover, management is focused on making investments and innovations, internationally, to sustain growth in this segment. Also, Hanesbrands’ organic sales growth during the fourth quarter has been encouraging. For 2018, the company projects organic sales growth at roughly 1% on a constant-currency basis.While the aforementioned factors make us hopeful about Hanesbrands’ revival, it is to be seen if these drivers can actually place the company in tandem with other industry gainers.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

380,PVH,"Today marks the last day of the holiday-shortened trading week, as well as the last trading day on the month and last day of the quarter. Futures are up thus far in the pre-market, but are relatively tepid at this hour; should this remain throughout the day, we will see the Dow Jones index close lower for the first quarter in the last ten.Initial Jobless Claims Sink Even LowerBut you can’t say weekly jobless claims data isn’t pulling its weight: 215K jobless claims a week ago actually falls 10,000 below our long-term range of 225-250K, which had been consistent with a robust U.S. labor market. (We had peaked a tad above this range back when hurricane season was ravaging the southern part of the country late last summer.) At 215K, we are nearing all-time lows we haven’t seen since the first few years of jobless claims data was recorded, back in the 1960s. This 215K has a real “White Album” feel to it.Last week’s total in new jobless claims ratcheted down 2,000 in the previous week’s revision to 227K, also historically very low. Continuing claims was up somewhat from the previous week, but at a still very healthy 1.87 million. A week from tomorrow, we will see new non-farm employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which brought in a stellar 313K new jobs in the month of February; for March, analysts expect another 200K or so new jobs.Personal Income & Spending In-LineAlso ahead of today’s market open, new data on Personal Income & Spending is out, reporting +0.4% for income and +0.2% for spending — both in-line with analyst estimates. Wages numbers were also up, +0.5%, a key indicator for inflation asserting itself in today’s economy (or February’s, anyway). The Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) price index for February registered at +1.8%, with core PCE for the month at +0.2%.These figures continue to point in the “right” direction for an increasingly tightening job market, but at rates that are not expected to raise anyone’s hackles regarding spiking inflation causing extra interest rate hikes from the Fed. We continue to exist in a “Goldilocks” economy, even if stock market sentiment isn’t really seeing it like that currently.Constellation, PVH Beat EstimatesOn this last day of calendar Q1, even though the bulk of earnings reports aren’t expected for another couple weeks, two branding-oriented firms did put up their fiscal quarter earnings numbers ahead of today’s opening bell: alcohol distributor Constellation Brands (STZ  -  Free Report) and apparel company PVH Corp. (PVH  -  Free Report).Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)-rated Constellation, producers of name brand beverages like Corona and Svedka, posted $1.90 per share versus $1.75 in the Zacks consensus estimate, amounting to 28% growth on the bottom line year over year.

381,PVH,"Thursday, March 29, 2018Today marks the last day of the holiday-shortened trading week, as well as the last trading day on the month and last day of the quarter. Futures are up thus far in the pre-market, but are relatively tepid at this hour; should this remain throughout the day, we will see the Dow Jones index close lower for the first quarter in the last ten.Initial Jobless Claims Sink Even LowerBut you can’t say weekly jobless claims data isn’t pulling its weight: 215K jobless claims a week ago actually falls 10,000 below our long-term range of 225-250K, which had been consistent with a robust U.S. labor market. (We had peaked a tad above this range back when hurricane season was ravaging the southern part of the country late last summer.) At 215K, we are nearing all-time lows we haven’t seen since the first few years of jobless claims data was recorded, back in the 1960s. This 215K has a real “White Album” feel to it.Last week’s total in new jobless claims ratcheted down 2,000 in the previous week’s revision to 227K, also historically very low. Continuing claims was up somewhat from the previous week, but at a still very healthy 1.87 million. A week from tomorrow, we will see new non-farm employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which brought in a stellar 313K new jobs in the month of February; for March, analysts expect another 200K or so new jobs.Personal Income & Spending In-LineAlso ahead of today’s market open, new data on Personal Income & Spending is out, reporting +0.4% for income and +0.2% for spending — both in-line with analyst estimates.

382,PVH,"Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST  -  Free Report) ended fiscal 2017 on a positive note, with both the top and bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second straight quarter. The company’s results were driven by growth in membership fees, which it raised effective Jun 1, 2017. We believe that the recent hike in annual membership fees and increased penetration of Citi Visa co-brand card program will continue to benefit stock in the near term.However, despite reporting better-than-expected in the quarter under review, the company’s shares declined nearly 3% during after-market trading session yesterday as contraction in margin alarmed investors.This Issaquah, WA-based company posted adjusted quarterly earnings of $2.08 per share that surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.02 and increased 17.5% from the prior-year period. Total revenues, which include net sales and membership fee, came in at $42,300 million that edged past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 41,739 million and jumped 15.7% year over year.Major chains are grappling with sluggish store and mall traffic as consumers choose to shop online from the comfort of their homes. But Costco seems somewhat resilient to the challenging retail backdrop. We noted that in the reported quarter the company’s e-commerce sales increased 21%, this gives an indication that the company’s efforts to drive online sales bode well.Meanwhile, Costco which has been trying all means to push online sales launched new delivery options for its customers. Per the new delivery options, the company is not only offering two days delivery but is also providing customer same-day delivery choices.Costco Wholesale Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Costco Wholesale Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Costco Wholesale Corporation QuoteDelving DeeperFourth-quarter net sales were up 15.8% to $41,357 million, while membership fee increased 13.3% to $943 million. Moreover, we noticed that the rate of increase in membership fee accelerated from 4.2% registered in the third quarter.Costco’s comparable-store sales (comps) for the quarter improved 6.1%. The company witnessed comps growth of 6.5%, 4.9% and 5.6% across the United States, Canadian and Other International locations, respectively.Excluding the effect of gasoline prices and foreign exchange, the company witnessed comps growth of 5.7% during the quarter with the United States, Canada and Other International registering comps growth of 5.8%, 4.8% and 6%, respectively.Costco has been witnessing comps growth for quite some time now driven by improved store traffic and average transaction size. Comps for September increased 8.9%, following an increase of 7.3% in August, 6.2% in July, 6% in June, 4.1% in May, 3% in April, 6% in March, 4% in February and 7% in January. Notably, net sales increased 12.1%, 10%, 8.8%, 7%, 7%, 5%, 9%, 8% and 9% in September, August, July, June, May, April, March, February and January, respectively. In a one year, the stock has advanced 11.4% and comfortably outperformed the industry’s growth of 4.1%.Costco’s operating income in the quarter increased 21.7% year over year to $1,450 million, while operating margin (as a percentage of total revenues) expanded 20 basis points to 3.5%. However, gross margin as a percentage of net sales contracted 15 basis points to 11.3%.Store UpdateCostco operates 741 warehouses, comprising 514 warehouses in the United States and Puerto Rico, 97 in Canada, 37 in Mexico, 28 in the UK, 26 in Japan, 13 in Korea, 13 in Taiwan, nine in Australia, two in Spain and one each in Iceland and France.Financial AspectsCostco ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $4,546 million and long-term debt (including current portion) of $6,659 million. The company’s shareholders’ equity was $10,778 million, excluding non-controlling interests of $301 million.Let’s ConcludeThe Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company continues to be one of the dominant retail wholesalers based on breadth and quality of merchandise offered. A differentiated product range enables the company to ensure an upscale shopping experience for its members, resulting in market share gains. Moreover, Costco continues to maintain a healthy membership renewal rate. It is also gradually expanding eCommerce capabilities in the United States, Canada, UK, Mexico, Korea and Taiwan.However, Costco faces stiff competition from Sam’s Club, a division of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report), which follows a similar business model, pushing through high volumes of merchandise at low prices in membership-only warehouse clubs. Consequently, aggressive pricing to gain market share and drive traffic amid competitive pressure may dampen sales and margins.Other Key PicksOther top-ranked stocks which warrant a look in the retail space include PVH Corp. (PVH  -  Free Report) and Burlington Stores, Inc. (BURL  -  Free Report) both carrying a Zacks Rank #2.

383,PVH,"Coty Inc.’s (COTY  -  Free Report) division Calvin Klein Fragrances along with Calvin Klein, Inc, jointly announced a new advertising campaign for ETERNITY brand. The campaign will feature actor Jake Gyllenhaal as its new face. Calvin Klein, is a wholly owned subsidiary of PVH Corp (PVH  -  Free Report). Coty acquired the licensing agreement for Calvin Klein’s fragrance line from Unilever in 2005.The veteran actor has been a part of many successful movies such as Brokeback Mountain, Stronger and Nocturnal Animals. The new campaign also stars Liya Kebede, a leading model and advocate. The celebrities would be a part of ETERNITY’s television and print advertising campaigns. The campaign highlights Calvin Klein’s ideologies of contemporary life such as commitment, intimacy and love.Celebrity endorsements for marketing beauty products have been quite popular, as it aids increasing acceptance of the brand, more effectively amongst teenagers. Coty, one of the pioneering companies in the beauty industry, along with peers such as Estée Lauder Companies Inc (EL  -  Free Report) and L’Oréal (LRLCY  -  Free Report), has been utilizing celebrity power to endorse many products. For instance, advertising campaigns for Coty’s Rimmel lipsticks and other color cosmetics line features Kate Moss and Georgia May Jagge. Similarly, Beyoncé Knowles, Enrique Iglesias and David Beckham are other well-known celebrities who have endorsed Coty’s iconic brand line up.Other Brand Strengthening Initiatives by Coty Coty continuously evaluates strategic acquisitions and new brand licenses to enhance its portfolio. The company consistently introduces new products in response to shifting consumer preferences and markets new as well as established products through strategic advertising and merchandising. Moreover, the product launches made in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 including Hugo Iced and Boss Tonic, Chloe Love Story Eau Sensuelle and Miu Miu L'Eau Bleue proved to be beneficial and have yielded results in the fourth quarter. In addition, Gucci Guilty Absolute, which was launched in the end of March 2017, also witnessed strong growth.Further, the company is repositioning some of the brands, including COVERGIRL, Max Factor and Sally Hansen, in order to reconnect these brands with consumers. Coty also seeks to divest non-performing brands in order to focus and utilize resources in other attractive opportunities. This includes investing in Professional Beauty segment and Luxury segment, which have been depicting strong growth.Headwinds Pulling Down Shares Coty’s acquisitions, product launches and licensing agreements have led to higher marketing spending and increased operating expenses, which have been affecting the company’s profits. Moreover, the new celebrity endorsement campaign for ETERNITY Calvin Klein is expected to further raise marketing spends for Coty.Moreover, weak market trends across several of its categories, especially in North America and some reduction of shelf space for a few brands like Astor have weakened the company’s Consumer Beauty segment over the last few quarters. While the new marketing campaign for ETERNITY is expected to enhance Coty’s revenues in the Luxury segment, it may not be sufficient to counter the weakness in Consumer Beauty division.As a result of such headwinds, shares of Coty have underperformed the industry in the past 12 months. In the said time frame, Coty’s shares declined 32.8% as compared with the industry’s fall of 10.1%. Ahead of the company’s first-quarter fiscal 2018 results, estimates for the same have also declined by 18 cents in the past 60 days.Coty currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

Currently, the industry is placed at the top 20% of the Zacks classified industries (50 out of 256). In fact, the company’s shares have substantially outperformed the broader Consumer Discretionary sector’s gain of 1.6%, which is placed at the top 44% (7 out of 16) of the Zacks classified sectors.The Consumer Discretionary space is gaining from favorable consumer trends supported by favorable gross domestic product (GDP) growth, a chic labor market and increased consumer spending. Further, the new tax reforms proposed by President Donald Trump instil optimism. Notably, the sector has recorded growth of 11.6% year to date.Coming back to PVH, its VGM Score of B and long-term earnings growth rate of 13.1% look encouraging. That said, let’s find out more about the factors aiding this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock’s performance.Solid Surprise HistoryPVH has delivered a robust earnings surprise trend for quite a while now. The company has beat bottom-line estimates for 13 straight quarters, with an average four-quarter beat of 3.6%. Additionally, the company boasts of having delivered positive sales surprise in the preceding four quarters. This solid trend is primarily driven by solid momentum at the company’s premium Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands, particularly in the international regions.PVH Corp. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise PVH Corp. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | PVH Corp. QuoteRobust Outlook Drive Estimates UpEncouraged by the solid second-quarter fiscal 2017 results, PVH raised earnings outlook for fiscal 2017 and initiated guidance for fiscal third quarter. For fiscal 2017, the company projects revenues to rise 6% year over year, while currency neutral revenues are expected to grow 5%. Management now envisions fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $7.60-$7.70, compared with $7.40-$7.50 expected earlier.Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 and 2018 witnessed an uptrend in the last 60 days.

The company’s approach to brand management facilitates each of its brands to develop further through efficient marketing strategies, financial control and operating leverage. Based on the strength of many of its brands, particularly Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein, along with opportunities with regard to distribution, we believe that the company is poised for long-term growth.Strategy to Keep Pace with Evolving Retail TrendsPVH has been undertaking significant steps to keep pace with the evolving retail trends and integrate consumers’ changing preferences into operating decisions. In fact, these constant endeavors have helped the company to stay afloat even in a challenging retail landscape.Some recent evidences of PVH’s growth efforts include its latest agreement with Li & Fung, which is likely to enhance the former’s supply-chain network. Moreover, the company inked a deal to acquire True&Co, which is a direct-to-consumer intimate apparel online retailer. This deal underscores the company’s focus on making innovations and developing omni-channel operations to enrich consumer experience. We believe that PVH is moving in the right direction and these strategies will help it to exploit opportunities in the lifestyle apparel market.Bottom LineThough currency headwinds, volatile retail backdrop and unpredictable global consumer spending remain hurdles, the company’s brand strength and efforts to match consumers’ needs position it for solid long-term growth.Looking for Some Trending Picks?

385,PVH,"The stock markets have been exhibiting a bull run since the start of 2017 driven by favorable economic background, which indicates that the U.S. economy is on the uptick. The commerce department stated that annual gross domestic product (GDP) rose 3.1% in second-quarter 2017, marking the best growth in three years.Despite the supply chain disruptions due to hurricanes Harvey and Irma, a steady labor market, robust consumer spending and the recent tax cut proposal instill optimism. The new tax plan suggests a 20% corporate income tax rate; a new 25% tax rate for pass-through businesses including partnerships; and a reduced 35% high-income tax rate for individual Americans.Notably, the optimism stemming from the robust economic data as well as the new tax reforms proposed by President Donald Trump was well reflected by the U.S. stock markets. Major stock indices closed strong on Oct 2 with the Nasdaq Composite Index adding 20.8 points to 6,516.7; the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 152.5 points to 22,557.6; and the S&P 500 improving 9.8 points to 2,529.1. This also meant a robust start to the fourth quarter of 2017.Moreover, these indices have registered year-to-date growths of 20.3%, 13% and 11.9%, respectively. Not surprisingly, investors can make the most of this market momentum by investing in stocks that mirror the momentum of these indices.Rightly, momentum investing can prove to be a winning strategy for investors seeking higher returns in a short span. This strategy mainly suggests capturing profits by buying hot stocks that have witnessed an uptrend in the past few weeks or months. It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend, it is more likely to continue in that direction than drift away from the trajectory.Adidas AG (ADDYY  -  Free Report) is one such stock which is on the roll owing to solid growth prospects. The stock has gained 20.3% in the last three months, against the industry’s fall of 9.9%. Further, this designer, producer and seller of athletic and sports lifestyle products remains well positioned to sustain this momentum as is clear from the expected long-term earnings growth rate of 20.9%. Also, a Momentum Score of B and Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) justify that the company has room to run. 3 More Momentum Stocks with Room to RunThe Momentum Score theory states that what has been going up so far will possibly continue to do so in the near future. Stocks with Style Scores of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy) handily outperform other stocks. We have identified three other Consumer Discretionary stocks that are fundamentally strong and have displayed momentous growth of late.PVH Corporation (PVH  -  Free Report), which specializes in designing and marketing branded dress shirts, neckwear, sportswear, jeanswear, intimate apparel, swim products, footwear, handbags and other related products, is a good bet. The company’s long-term expected earnings growth rate of 13.1% show potential. Moreover, the stock has gained 10.6% in the last three months, outperforming the industry’s 1.1% increase. The company currently has a Momentum Score of B and carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Another lucrative option is New York-based G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. (GIII  -  Free Report). The company designs, manufactures and markets apparel for men and women. It has a Momentum Score of B and sports a Zacks Rank #1. Moreover, the company has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 15%. The stock has grown 15.5% in the last three months, outperforming the industry’s 1.2% upside.Investors can also count on Electronic Arts Inc. (EA  -  Free Report), a leading developer, marketer, publisher and distributor of interactive games (video game software and content). It distributes gaming content and services through multiple distribution channels and directly to consumers (online and wirelessly) through its online portals Origin and Play4Free. This Redwood City, CA-based company currently has a Momentum Score of B and long-term expected earnings growth rate of 16.5%. Further, this Zacks Rank #2 stock has gained 11.9% in the last three months, outperforming the industry’s 8.4% growth.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

The company’s shares have increased 6.7%, while the industry inched up 1%. Factors at PlayPVH boasts a spectacular positive earnings surprise record for 14 consecutive quarters along with five straight quarters of sales beat.

388,PVH,"The luxury goods market had a lavish 2017 with impressive sales figures from top players. Given the continuing economic recovery, the momentum is likely to continue in 2018. Also, optimism surrounding steady economic growth, lower tax rates, strong wage growth and a robust earnings season hint at a brighter future for luxury stocks. Robust sales figures registered by a number of luxury brands in China along with an increasing number of millennials spending more on luxury goods bode well too. A Stunning 2017 U.S. luxury stocks witnessed a robust 2017. The S&P Global Luxury Index has risen 34.76% in the last year. Shares of PVH Corp. (PVH  -  Free Report) have surged 62.4%, while Michael Kors Holdings Limited (KORS  -  Free Report) has rallied 67.02% in the same time frame.  The last 12 months were also great for LVMH-Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (LVMUY  -  Free Report), Ralph Lauren Corp. (RL  -  Free Report) and Tapestry, Inc. (TPR  -  Free Report), which gained 51.35%, 34.44% and 29.31%, respectively.While LVMH-Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA, Michael Kors Holdings Limited and Ralph Lauren Corp. carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), PVH Corp. and Tapestry have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Interestingly, it wasn’t only the domestic market but also the international space, particularly China, that saw companies coming up with a stellar show. Overall, the impressive performance of luxury goods was a global affair following a change in the tastes and habits of shoppers.The overall global economy too was strong, which helped luxury goods’ stocks to grow. A good start to the holiday season in 2017 gave an added thrust to the share price of luxury brands that range from wearables, to handbags, belts, eyewear, sportswear and shoes.Global Factors Influencing GrowthThe overall picture for luxury goods was quite rosy in 2017 with the big players going all out to make their presence felt in the global market. One of the primary reasons was that most brands focused more on millennials, who are splurging on luxury goods pretty early.According to a February 2018 survey report by Mindshare North America, 57% of shoppers are between the ages of 18 and 34, indicating that millennials are now the biggest shoppers.That said, the optimism surrounding steady economic growth, higher wages, business-friendly policies by the government and an appeal for luxury in emerging economies cannot be overlooked.Moreover, a number of luxury brands also expanded globally, which helped them come up with higher sales. While Tapestry acquired Kate Spade for $2.4 billion last year, Kors acquired Jimmy Choo for $1.2 billion to expand its presence in China.LVMH-Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA registered record sales for 2017 with a like-for-like sales growth of 12%, double the rate of 2016. The growth was driven by the stupendous performance of its fashion and leather goods divisions. Moreover, one of the best U.S. holiday season in years helped Tiffany rev up its sales.China Powers Global ExpansionFor global luxury brands, China remains the hottest destination. Most big names reported of benefiting from the China market in 2017 and 2018 too won’t be any different. And those who are yet to explore that market are fast gearing up to set up shop in China.Per a January 2018 Bain & Co report, sales of luxury goods in China, which moved at a snail’s pace for years, escalated at the fastest rate in more than half a decade in 2017 and are expected to perform well in 2018. The report further says that sales of luxury goods in China touched 142 billion yuan ($22.07 billion) in 2017, increasing almost 20% from a year ago. The highly dynamic Chinese market helped brands like LVMH and Kors and Tapestry.Global luxury goods purchases by Chinese shoppers jumped 12% last year to €84 billion ($104 billion), per Bain & Co. This surge in consumer spending is being attributed to the changing demographics in China. Those born after the adoption of the one-child policy in 1979, today comprise the highest number of shoppers.Moreover, the millennials, who are setting new fashion trends, are the biggest spenders and most luxury brands are following them. At the same time, per a February 2018 BCG report, social media and word-of-mouth are the first and second sources of information for shoppers in China, with 49% and 30% share, respectively. Keeping that in mind, most global luxury brands are going the D2C (direct-to-customer) way in China. Last July, LVMH launched its directly operated online store that country. Prior to that, Kors and Burberry too opened e-commerce sites in China.Millennials & Boomers to Power 2018 GrowthMillennials are dominating the changing preferences and habits of consumers as they comprise the highest percentage of shoppers. Naturally, focus on millennials will be the key to success for luxury brands in 2018. Millennials’ tastes and preferences are increasingly blurring the gap between premium and luxury brands.According to Mindshare North America’s recent survey, 55% millennials are of the opinion that big luxury brands are losing their personal feel compared with 46% Gen X and 23% of Boomers. Hence most brands are addressing these perceptions and trying to meet the demands of millennials, who are trend setters.At the same time, Boomers cannot be neglected as they are the ones with great spending impact in the market right now. So, while millennials are setting trends, Boomers have more spending power. Most luxury brands are trying to strike a perfect balance between the two.Future PerfectWith positives such as a recovering economy, lower tax rates and business-friendly policies, luxury brands are poised for growth in 2018. The China market, which saw sluggish sales for years, is finally recovering with sales of luxury goods touching record highs. This certainly has made luxury brands optimistic about the China market and expansion plans are afoot for quite a few big names. Moreover, millennials have emerged as the biggest spenders and are expected to impact sales this year too. Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

Quote Segment AnalysisPVH Corp. reports financial results under three business segments: Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Heritage Brands.Calvin Klein’s revenues advanced 23% year over year to $977 million while it grew 18% in constant currency. Further, the segment’s International revenues surged 33% to $512 million and 23% on a constant-currency basis. Growth in International business was backed by sturdy performance in Europe and Asia, which includes a 4% increase in international comparable store sales (comps). However, gain from 53rd week was primarily offset by a decrease in revenue attributable to the timing of the Chinese New Year.The segment’s North America revenues were also up 13% to $464 million driven by solid wholesale performance in all categories along with a 4% rise in comps. However, the gain from a 53rd week was mitigated by a decline in revenues due to the deconsolidation of the segment’s business in Mexico in November 2016.Revenues at the company’s Tommy Hilfiger segment jumped 22% to $1.1 billion while it improved 15% in constant currency. The improvement in revenues can be primarily attributed to sales growth of 37% to $702 million in the brand’s International business owing to stellar performance in all regions and channels, gain from the 53rd week, and 6% comps growth.Additionally, the segment’s North America business witnessed 5% increase in revenues to $439 million (4% growth in constant currency) driven by a 10% rise in comps. However, the metric was partly offset by a decline in the wholesale off-price distribution. Further, the decline in revenues from discontinuation of its directly-operated womenswear wholesale business in the United States and Canada in fourth-quarter fiscal 2016, in connection with the licensing of the business to G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. (GIII), was mitigated by gain from the 53rd week in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017.  Meanwhile, the Heritage Brands segment’s revenues remained flat year over year.

390,PVH,"Under Armour, Inc.’s (UAA  -  Free Report) sustained focus on brand development, expansion of direct-to-consumer business, product innovation and foray in to the technology-based fitness business bode well. However, conservative sales guidance for fiscal 2017, currency headwinds and margin pressure remain matters of concern for investors. Let’s delve deeper and find out more about the stock’s state of affairs.Hidden catalystUnder Armour continues to seek opportunities for increasing global footprint and market share. Though the company generates a major portion of its revenues from the North America region, it intends to expand business operations to other parts of the world, in order to mitigate the risks stemming from concentration in one geographic region. In sync with this strategy, the company has opened factory and brand stores in Canada and China over the years as well as given franchise licenses in several other countries.Further, it has rolled out e-commerce platforms in countries like Mexico, Australia, New Zealand and Chile. Another major tool used by Under Armour to broaden its base is the development of an International e-commerce team. In second-quarter 2017, international business surged 57% to $235 million.Previously, management had announced a restructuring plan in order to utilize financial resources more efficiently. This will better cater to evolving demands of the changing consumer environment. Taking this into consideration, Under Armour anticipates incurring total estimated pre-tax restructuring and related charges of roughly $110-$130 million in the fiscal 2017.Under Armour, which share space with NIKE, Inc. (NKE  -  Free Report), PVH Corp. (PVH  -  Free Report) and G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. (GIII  -  Free Report) has been trying to boost its DTC business through store expansion initiatives and enhancement of e-commerce platform for the past few years. This strategy has enhanced DTC’s contribution to total revenues, which has advanced 25% in 2016 from 6% in 2005. In second-quarter 2017, the company’s revenues increased 20% to $386 million and its contribution to total revenues rose to 35%.Hurdles to CrossMeanwhile, despite top and bottom line beat in second-quarter 2017, investors were hurt due to conservative sales guidance. It anticipates net revenues for 2017 to rise in the range of 9-11%, down from the prior estimate of an increase of 11-12% over the 2016 level primarily due to moderation in North American business. Further, the company expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of 37-40 cents, which was lower than the analysts’ expectations.Gross margin, an important financial metric, which gives an indication about the company’s health has shown constant deceleration in the past three quarters. In second-quarter 2017, gross margin contracted 190 basis points to 45.8% following a decline of 70 basis points in the first quarter. In the second quarter, gross margin shriveled owing to aggressive inventory management, foreign currency headwinds, and rise in air freight related to the company’s enterprise resource planning (ERP) system implementation, which overshadowed the benefits from channel and product mix.We noted that, in the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2016, gross margin have decreased 100, 70, 130 and 320 basis points to 45.9%, 47.7%, 47.5% and 44.8%, respectively. The company anticipates adjusted gross margin to decline by a minimum of 120 basis points, in comparison with 46.4% reported in 2016 due to foreign currency headwinds, restructuring plan and efforts toward managing inventory.4 Promising Stock Picks to Keep an Eye OnWith news stories about computer hacking and identity theft becoming increasingly commonplace, the cybersecurity industry looks like a promising investment opportunity.

391,PVH,"PVH Corp. (PVH  -  Free Report) has been gaining from solid momentum at premium Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands. Moreover, a superb surprise history, efforts to keep up with the changing retail trends and financial strength are notable growth drivers for the stock. However, persistent currency headwinds and volatile global environment remain impediments.Shares of PVH have rallied 20.2% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 12.4%. Let’s analyze the pros and cons of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.Brand Strength – Key Growth DriverPVH maintains a diversified brand portfolio which allows it to generate above-average industry growth and sustain its position in the current challenging environment as well. Additionally, the company’s efficient brand management facilitates each of its brands to develop further through efficient marketing strategies, financial control and operating leverage. We believe PVH is well poised for long-term growth backed by continued strength at many of its brands, particularly Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein, coupled with opportunities with regard to distribution.Splendid Surprise History & Upbeat OutlookPVH boasts a spectacular positive earnings surprise record for 14 consecutive quarters along with five straight quarters of sales beat. This robust surprise trend is mainly backed by significant momentum at the company’s premium Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands, particularly in the international regions.Going forward, PVH expects to deliver robust revenues and earnings in fourth-quarter 2017. The company anticipates revenues to increase 7% year over year while currency neutral revenues are anticipated to grow 6%. Also, management envisions fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $7.78-$7.80 compared with $7.60-$7.70 projected earlier.Furthermore, the company is likely to gain from a strong holiday season and an additional $20 million increase in marketing expenditures in the fourth quarter.Catching Up With the Evolving Retail TrendsPVH has been striving to keep pace with the evolving retail trends and integrate consumers’ changing preferences into its operating decisions. This has gone a long way in bolstering the company’s quarterly performance, amid a challenging retail landscape. Some recent growth endeavors like the latest agreement with Li & Fung is also likely to enhance the former’s supply-chain network. Moreover, the company has inked a deal to acquire True&Co, a direct-to-consumer intimate apparel online retailer. This deal underscores PVH’s focus on making innovations and developing omni-channel operations to enrich consumer experience.That said, we believe PVH is moving in the right direction and these strategies will help it to exploit opportunities in the lifestyle apparel market.Bottom LinePVH seems to be favorably positioned in the industry. However, its significant international presence exposes the company to foreign currency risks. Though we note that currency rates are likely to improve in the fourth quarter, it will still bear an impact of about 17 cents per share in fiscal 2017 earnings. Also, volatile macroeconomic and geopolitical environment remain potent threats.Do Textile-Apparel Stocks Grab Your Attention? Check TheseInterested investors may consider G-III Apparel Group LTD.

392,PVH,"Columbia Sportswear Company (COLM  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 8, after the closing bell.The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this active lifestyle apparel and footwear marketer and distributor will be able to maintain its positive earnings surprise streak in the to-be-reported quarter. Notably, the company’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 19 straight quarters now, with a trailing four-quarter average of 14.3%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the earnings announcement.How are Estimates Shaping Up?The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.11 for the fourth quarter has been stable over the last 30 days. The estimate reflects a year-over-year decline of 7.5% from $1.20 recorded in the prior-year quarter.Columbia Sportswear Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Columbia Sportswear Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Columbia Sportswear Company QuoteAnalysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $761.7 million for the impending quarter, up 6.2% from the year-ago quarter. In addition, analysts expect net sales from the United States, Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA) and Canada to be $497 million, $74 million and $41.6 million, up 9.2%, 5.6% and 4%, respectively, year over year. However, the estimate for net sales from the Latin America/Asia Pacific (LAAP) region is expected to decline marginally by 0.6% to $151 million in the fourth quarter.Furthermore, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales from the Columbia, SOREL, prAna and Mountain Hardwear brands are pegged at $580 million, $104 million, $31.9 million and $29.1 million, respectively. These estimates reflect 5%, 0.2% and 13.1% year-over-year growth in net sales for the Columbia, SOREL and prAna brands. On the flip side, the consensus estimate for the Mountain Hardwear brand reflects a decline of nearly 7% year over year.Factors Influencing 4Q17Columbia Sportswear has been gaining from its sturdy performance at the European wholesale and U.S. direct-to-consumer businesses. Impressively, sales improved across all international regions in the last reported quarter. Also, the company remains on track with its Project CONNECT initiative, which is likely to boost revenues, capture efficiencies, improve the marketing process and lower SG&A costs. In fact, this initiative is anticipated to benefit the company’s direct-to-consumer and wholesale channels.Meanwhile, we believe the largest opportunity lies in China, given the region’s strength in digital wholesale and e-commerce channels. Alongside, the company’s prAna brand is also attracting an expanding base of female consumers in addition to male consumers.Further, management anticipates continued growth from its SOREL brand through constant upgradation and effective management strategies. Markedly, athletic and outdoor apparel sub-segment has been depicting growth owing to higher demand of athletic wear as a result of increased athletic activities.While the company is facing challenges in the United States, especially on the wholesale front, we expect it to continue benefiting from the robust direct-to-consumer business in the region.What Does the Zacks Model Say?Our proven model shows that Columbia Sportswear is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen.

393,PVH,"Delta Apparel, Inc. (DLA  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 5, after the closing bell.The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this lifestyle basics and branded active wear apparel designer and marketer will be able to pull off a positive earnings surprise in the to-be reported quarter. The company has delivered a negative earnings surprise in three of the last four quarters, with an average miss of 79.8%Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the earnings announcement.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 6 cents for the first quarter has been stable over the last 30 days. However, the estimate reflects an improvement of 25% from a loss of 8 cents reported in the prior-year quarter.Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $78 million for the impending quarter, down 8.6% from the year-ago quarter.Factors Influencing the QuarterDelta Apparel has been struggling with declines at brick-and-mortar stores for a while. Further, the company’s Branded segment has been witnessing lower sales for the last few quarters, primarily due to the sale of its Junkfood Clothing business. Additionally, general market softness, customer bankruptcies, several weather disruptions along with a challenging retail backdrop has been hurting the company’s performance and overall profitability.As a result, the company’s shares have declined 12.1% in the past three months against the industry’s growth of 21.2%. Nevertheless, management stated that it began fiscal 2018 on a solid note when it recently reported preliminary first-quarter fiscal 2018 results. The company projects overall net sales in the band of $88-$90 million, up 3-5% from the year-ago quarter. Excluding the revenues from the divestiture of Junkfood business, it depicts growth of 16-18%.Notably, the quarter witnessed double-digit year-over-year sales increase and robust execution across each of its businesses despite it being the seasonally slowest quarter. The improvement was driven by enhanced distribution and improved product offerings as well as gain in market share. Also, the latest Salt Life and Soffe retail outlets opened in the quarter aided results via brand-building and consumer awareness opportunities. Markedly, the solid sales results keeps management encouraged about delivering pre-tax profit in the first quarter, as against a loss reported in the same period last year.So, let’s wait and see whether these strategic endeavors are reflected in the upcoming results and provide cushion to the stock.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not show that Delta Apparel is likely to beat earnings estimates in the first quarter.

394,PVH,"Whirlpool Corporation (WHR  -  Free Report) remains committed to its innovation strategy that helps tap additional sales and gain market share. Also, the company’s long-term goals backed by its robust product pipeline, solid innovations and cost-productivity initiatives, bode well.Despite the company’s solid growth drivers, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock gained only a meager 1.5% in the last six months, in line with the industry's growth. However, its shares have underperformed the broader Consumer Discretionary sector’s growth of 4%, which is currently placed at the top 31% of the Zacks classified sectors (5 out of 16).Let’s take a deep look as why the company’s solid strategic efforts are not well reflected in its share price.What’s Weighing Upon the Stock?Dismal Performance & Bleak OutlookWhirlpool delivered fourth consecutive negative earnings surprise in second-quarter 2017. With this, the company has recorded an average miss of 5.8% in trailing four quarters. Further, the company’s top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in four of the last seven quarters.Also, Whirlpool has slashed its earnings forecast for 2017 based on elevated raw material inflation and lower product price/mix in China and Europe. Management now envisions adjusted earnings per share in the range of $14.50–$15.00 compared with $14.75–$15.50, guided earlier. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 is currently pegged at $14.62.Other ConcernsWhirlpool’s operating performance is significantly dependent on the price of raw materials, particularly steel, oil, plastic resins, aluminum, copper, zinc and nickel. In fact, the volatility in commodity prices has been adversely affecting the company’s performance as evident from its second-quarter results.Notably, the costs of key raw materials, particularly steel and resins have also increased worldwide in the first half of 2017. While these headwinds were fully offset in North America and Latin America due to favorable demand and productivity gains, Europe and Asia suffered as soft demand made it difficult to offset these challenges.Furthermore, Whirlpool’s customer concentration is high, which is expected to negatively impact the company’s margins. Also, the current challenging global economic environment is weighing on the company’s performance in terms of volatility in currency and weak market demand, primarily in Brazil, China and Eastern Europe.Innovation Mantra – A Secret to Success?Whirlpool is among the few companies that heavily invest in technologies to produce differentiated products to suit the needs of their end consumers. Evidently, the company inked a deal with Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), to introduce voice-controlled home appliances. Also, Whirlpool is keen on boosting revenues of its core appliance business through expansions and investments. This, in turn, is expected to fuel growth of its high-margin categories.Other Strategic EndeavorsWhirlpool is striving to improve its margins through a series of measures, including cost-based price increments and cost-reduction initiatives that are focused on improving business efficiency. Though second-quarter 2017 was disappointing from margins perspective, the company has very strong initiatives to facilitate operating margin expansion in the second half.Recently, management also outlined significant long-term targets through 2020, backed by brand strength and product portfolio. The company aims to deliver organic revenue growth of 3–5% every year.Going forward, Whirlpool anticipates growth efforts to boost consumer demand and lead to enhanced price mix. This, in turn encouraged management to target its operating margin to exceed 10% by 2020. Further, the company envisions earnings per share to grow by 10–15% each year.Bottom LineWe expect Whirlpool’s robust strategies to spark a turnaround in its performance. This is likely to bolster share prices and attract investors in the near term.3 Picks You Can’t MissSome better-ranked stocks in the broader Consumer Discretionary sector include Crocs, Inc.

395,PVH,"Leggett & Platt, Incorporated (LEG  -  Free Report) has been going through a rough phase owing to volatility in raw material prices. However, its long-term strategic plan remains on track.A glimpse of Leggett’s share price movement reveals that it has fallen nearly 6% year to date, wider than the industry’s decline of 1.6%. Let’s delve deeper and find out what is troubling this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.Why is the Stock Struggling?Disappointing Performances & Bleak OutlookInvestors remain cautious about Leggett’s top-line performance that has missed expectations in eight of the last nine quarters. It reported dismal top- and bottom-line results in second-quarter 2017 due to raw material price inflation, which more than offset benefits of higher sales and lower tax rate. Also, the inflationary pressure dented operating margins.Consequently, management lowered its sales outlook for 2017 and narrowed its earnings per share guidance range. Sales for the year are now anticipated to grow by 4-7% to $3.9-$4.0 billion. Earlier, the company projected sales of $3.95-$4.05 billion that reflected 5-8% year-over-year growth. Also, it narrowed earnings to a band of $2.55-$2.65 per share from the previous range of $2.55-$2.75.Given the aforementioned troubles, the company’s earnings estimates have witnessed downward revisions in the last 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.48 for 2017 and $2.74 for 2018 moved down 4.6% and 2.8%, respectively.Other HeadwindsLeggett remains exposed to volatility in raw material prices as steel is one of the company’s key raw materials and the steel market is cyclical in nature. Evidently, Leggett’s bottom line and operating margins were hurt by steel price inflation in the second quarter. In fact, fluctuating steel prices impacted Leggett’s performance throughout 2016. We expect the persistence of inflationary pressure to remain a threat to Leggett’s earnings in 2017.Apart from this, the company is susceptible to fluctuating metal margins as it is a manufacturer of steel rods. Alongside, intense competition from local as well as regional players and other macroeconomic factors remain threats to Leggett.Strategic Long-Term GoalsLeggett’s long-term strategic plan remains on track and it has already completed the first two parts of it successfully. While, the first part was to divest low-performing businesses, the second part comprised an improvement in margins and returns. Currently, the company is working on the third part of the plan, which aims to achieve top-line growth of 4%–5% annually.Markedly, Leggett has significant operating leverage to accomplish the third part of the plan as it has a considerable amount of retained spare production to meet the demand of $4 billion. In fact, solid market demand coupled with market share gains has been enhancing capacity utilization over the years.Meanwhile, the company has been focusing on boosting its business portfolio by increasing investment in areas that provide a competitive edge, simultaneously exiting underperforming operations and markets.Furthermore, in September 2016, Leggett had chalked out its goals for 2019, aimed at helping the company achieve its top-third TSR target in the following three years. These targets include revenue of about $4.75 billion, operating margin of 13.3%, earnings per share of $3.25 and a dividend of $1.70 per share.Well, the company believes revenues growth, margin enhancement and shareholder-friendly moves like buybacks and dividend payments to be the main TSR drivers. Going forward, the company expects these targets to be fueled by organic growth, which in turn is anticipated to be backed by strategic buyouts, with the absence of any non-recurring factors.Bottom LineThough Leggett seems in trouble now, we believe the company’s long-term growth plans bode well for the stock.Want to Know About the Gems in the Consumer Discretionary Space?Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Consumer Discretionary sector include Crocs, Inc.

396,PVH,"The Consumer Discretionary sector is witnessing positive trends thanks to the improving economy backed by a favorable labor market, increased consumer spending and enhanced consumer confidence.While this indicates favorable prospects for the sector participants, leading global manufacturer of toys, Mattel, Inc. (MAT  -  Free Report), has been witnessing challenging trends for quite some time. Evidently, the company has lagged earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 47.5%. Moreover, sales have missed the same for three consecutive quarters.Consequently, shares of this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock plunged 45.3% year to date, underperforming the industry’s rally of 49.2%.What’s Troubling Mattel?We note that one of the prime concerns for the company has been the persistent sluggish performance of certain key brands including Mattel Girls & Boys Brands, Barbie, Thomas, MEGA brands and American Girl Brands. Mattel has been witnessing soft sales for these brands due to increased competitive advertising and value players.Though the company began 2017 expecting top-line growth in the mid- to high-single digits, it is now targeting low single-digit sales growth for the year. The lowered expectations reflect lower sales of Thomas, American Girl and MEGA brands. These brands represent half of the reduction of the company’s full-year revenue outlook and the impact of lower sales from its fragmented innovation pipeline, which Mattel plans to rebalance and refocus for the rest of 2017 for improving productivity.While Mattel expects its incremental licensed entertainment portfolio, strategic investments in emerging markets and key power brands – Barbie, Hot Wheels and Fisher-Price – to drive growth in the second half of 2017, we believe it will take time for all the brands to show steady development.Meanwhile, lack of innovative schemes for brand awareness and brand innovation have been hurting the company’s revenues and POS momentum, which is putting pressure on revenues and margins. Also, the U.S. toy category slowdown, unfavorable foreign exchange translation and loss of Disney deal remain concerns. Competition from technology-based gaming companies poses a significant threat to its market position as well. Given the deep routed troubles and the negative surprise trends, the company’s estimates have witnessed downward revisions in the last 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 73 cents for 2017 and 90 cents for 2018 moved down 7.6% and 10%, respectively. Also, the stock bears a VGM Score of D that signals trouble down the road.How is the Consumer Discretionary Sector Positioned?Though Mattel seems in deep trouble, there are many stocks in the Consumer Discretionary space that promise growth. Overall, the sector has put up a decent performance in the past. A look at the sector’s performance shows that it has witnessed growth of 14.9% in the past year, almost in line with the momentum of the S&P 500 index that grew 15%.Further, it carries a Zacks Sector Rank of #4 (out of 16), placing it at the top 25% of the Zacks classified sectors.Hence, there lies an opportunity to invest in Consumer Discretionary stocks which are poised to make the best of the improving economic situation.4 Trending PicksThat said, we bring you four Consumer Discretionary stocks that are displaying solid performance backed by sound fundamentals, Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), a VGM Score of A or B, surging share price and a track record of better-than-expected results.

398,PVH,"A prudent investment strategy not only means buying promising stocks, but also selling the ones that can dent your portfolio. Unfortunately, Hanesbrands Inc. (HBI  -  Free Report) has been facing multiple challenges from rising competition and evolving trends in the apparel space and is a risky bet.Notably, shares of this designer and manufacturer of apparel essentials for men, women and children have lost around 4.5% in the past year compared with the industry’s rally of 10.2%. In the past three months, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock tumbled nearly 9.7%.What’s Troubling Hanesbrands?Hanesbrands has been struggling against weak domestic performance, due to soft store traffic and a tough retail landscape. Evidently, these headwinds hurt the company’s back-to-school selling season performance, which along with the U.S. hurricanes and earthquake in Mexico have affected results in third-quarter 2017.Apart from this, Hanesbrands is also battling soft sales in its Innerwear segment for quite some time, thanks to soft brick-and-mortar performance stemming from sluggish traffic. In the third quarter, sales in this unit declined 5.2% as the apparel category bore the brunt of a tough back-to-school retail landscape. Prior to this, sales for the segment fell 2.5% in the second quarter of 2017, 6% in the first quarter of 2017 and 8% in the fourth quarter of 2016.Notably, the Intimate Apparel/Innerwear industry is highly competitive and extremely price sensitive. Hence, the company’s ongoing strategy to focus more on premium brands and increase prices in these categories comes with the inherent risk of consumers shifting to other competitively-priced brands, offered by competitors.  This may, in turn, hurt Hanesbrands’ market share along with profits.Moreover, to add to investor’s disappointment in the stock, management continues to expect effects of the aforementioned adverse environment conditions and a difficult retail sales environment to linger in 2017. Increased marketing investments to drive market share growth may also hamper the company’s profits.These factors, along with impacts from the bankruptcy of Sears Canada, compelled management to trim sales and earnings outlook for 2017. The company projects net sales in the band of $6.45-$6.48 billion and adjusted earnings from continuing operations in the $1.93-$1.95 per share range.Textile Apparel Still Has Some Bright SpotsRanked amongst the top 23% of all Zacks industries, the textile-apparel industry space still has some bright spots for investors to put their funds in. Despite the headwinds looming over the apparel industry, there are many firms which have managed to stay afloat gaining from strategic endeavors to keep pace with the evolving retail trends and the improved economic scenario. This is evident from favorable consumer spending, healthy consumer confidence and improved labor market, which has been driving the U.S. economy.Moving to the companies’ efforts to resonate with consumers’ preferences, expansion in the e-commerce realm has been a vital strategy for most apparel companies. Further, efficient brand management and strategies to strengthen and expand business operations have aided firms to counter industry challenges. All said, the textile-apparel space appears to be well placed.Thus, we used the Zacks Stock Screener, and zeroed in on three apparel stocks that have been performing well.

399,PVH,"Iconix Brand Group, Inc. (ICON  -  Free Report) has been in the red for a while, evident from bearish run in the market. Shares of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock have plunged 88% in a year, against the industry’s rally of 20.2%.What’s Weighing Down the Stock?Iconix’s performance has been sluggish, thanks to persistent softness in women's and men's segments. Notably, in third-quarter 2017, sales in the women’s and men’s categories declined 13% and 5% respectively. Earlier, these segments depicted a decline of 12% and 18% during second-quarter 2017, respectively.The women’s and men’s segments businesses have mainly been marred by dismal brand performances, due to heightened competition in the retail market. Apart from the Danskin brand, the women’s segment performance was weakened by lower licensing revenues from OP brands and Mossimo during the third quarter. Additionally, in the men’s business portfolio, prolonged weakness in the Starter business has been a major drag. Consequently, the licensing agreement for this brand with Wal-Mart will not be renewed by the management. Apart from these, revenues at the Home segment also fell 6% in the third quarter, causing total licensing revenues to tumble 12% year over year. Also, management expects revenues for 2017 at the lower end of its previous range of $225-$235 million.To make matters worse, the company’s performance is also weighed down by debt. Iconix is striving to reducing its huge debt burden, through various initiatives. To this end, the company has already divested non-core brands such as Sharper Image, Peanuts Worldwide LLC and Strawberry Shortcake which have however weakened its top-line expansion capabilities. Until the third quarter, Iconix’s debt totaled $1,055 million.    Any Scope of Revival?Considering the growth depicted by the international business segment, management is on track with expanding Iconix’s global footprint.

400,PVH,"There seems to be a lot of cheer in the Textile-Apparel industry with many companies putting up a stellar show — driven by favorable economic indicators and strategic growth endeavors. Ranked among the top 13% out of more than 250 Zacks industries, the industry has gained 11.1% in the past three months.On the contrary, we have Hanesbrands Inc. (HBI  -  Free Report) which has lost 10.8% in the same time frame, thereby being a drag on the otherwise buoyant space. Notably, other players like Michael Kors (KORS  -  Free Report), Lululemon Athletica (LULU  -  Free Report) and PVH Corp. (PVH  -  Free Report) have contributed to the industry’s rally, keeping pace with the evolving consumer trends, international expansion and brand enhancement efforts. While all these stocks sport a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), Hanesbrands carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.So, let’s delve deeper into the factors that have caused Hanesbrands to be the odd one out and see if there’s any scope for turnaround.Why is Hanesbrands the Odd One Out?Hanesbrands has been struggling with its domestic performance, owing to soft store traffic and a tough retail landscape. Evidently, these headwinds hurt the company’s back-to-school selling season performance, which along with the U.S. hurricanes and earthquake in Mexico have affected the company in third-quarter 2017.Apart from this, Hanesbrands is also battling soft sales at its Innerwear segment for quite some time now on account of soft brick-and-mortar performance stemming from sluggish traffic. In the third quarter, sales at this unit declined 5.2% to $644.1 million as the apparel category bore the brunt of a tough back-to-school retail landscape. Prior to this, sales for the segment fell 2.5% in the second quarter of 2017, 6% in the first quarter of 2017 and 8% in the fourth quarter of 2016.Well, the Intimate Apparel/Innerwear industry is highly competitive and extremely price sensitive. Therefore, the company’s strategy to focus more on premium brands and increase prices in these categories come with the inherent risk of consumers shifting to more competitively-priced brands. This, in turn, is a threat to Hanesbrands’ market share.Unfortunately, management expects the effect of the aforementioned natural disasters and a difficult retail sales environment to linger in 2017 as well. Moreover, it anticipates the fourth quarter to be impacted by additional marketing investments to capture market share, the recently announced Alternative Apparel buyout and effects of Sears Canada bankruptcy.Considering all the above factors, Hanesbrands had lowered the upper end of its sales and earnings guidance for 2017 during the third quarter earnings announcement. The company now projects net sales in the band of $6.45-$6.48 billion and adjusted earnings from continuing operations in the $1.93-$1.95 per share range.  Consequently, estimates for the fourth quarter and 2017 have moved south by a notch to 52 cents and $1.94, respectively, since the earnings announcement.Any Scope for Revival Ahead?Nevertheless, Hanesbrands’ international segment has been gaining from its focus on acquisitions, particularly Champion Europe and Hanes Australasia. On a currency-neutral basis, sales at the International segment jumped 14% in the third quarter, wherein Hanesbrands posted organic sales growth for the first time in eight quarters. Apart from the aforementioned factors, extensive online sales growth also bolstered sales improvement at the segment. Going forward, management expects organic sales growth to remain positive as it anticipates the fourth quarter to mark another quarter of organic sales growth.While these factors and cost savings from Project Booster make us hopeful about Hanesbrands’ revival prospects, it remains to be seen if these drivers can actually place the company in tandem with the other industry gainers.  Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

401,PVH,"Coach, Inc.  looks quite disciplined in its approach when it comes to tackling prevailing headwinds in the retail landscape — sluggish store traffic, stiff competition from online retailers and aggressive pricing strategy. The company has undertaken transformational initiatives revolving around products, stores and marketing to pull itself back on growth trajectory and emerge as a multi-brand company. Further, a VGM Score of A and long-term earnings per share growth rate of 11.1%, clearly indicate the stock’s inherent potential.Despite these tailwinds, the stock is struggling to find a safe zone. In fact, the stock has declined 14.1% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 1.1%. Let’s find out what’s bothering this stock.What’s Giving the Stock a Hard Time?We noticed that shares of Coach came under pressure after the company reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 15. Analysts pointed that disappointing top-line performance and not so encouraging outlook in spite of integration of Kate Spade & Company hurt investor sentiment.After declining 4% during the third quarter of fiscal 2017, net sales tumbled 1.8% in the final quarter. Moreover, we also noted that the total sales of $1,133.8 million fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,146 million, thus marking the fourth successive quarter of revenue miss. Sales growth were hurt by 60 basis points due to management’s efforts to elevate the Coach brand’s positioning in the North American wholesale channel by lowering promotional events and door closures.Are the Remedies Sufficient?As one of the leading American marketers of fine accessories and gifts, Coach boasts a proven strategy of investing in stores to enhance sales output through product innovation, compelling pricing strategy, new merchandise assortments and cost-effective global sourcing model. We believe that these strategies will help drive comparable-store sales and operating margins in the long term. The company’s growth drivers include expansion of global distribution model and venturing into under-penetrated markets.Coach is undergoing a brand transformation and introducing modern luxury concept stores in key markets. The acquisition of Stuart Weitzman has been accretive to performance and is being viewed as a significant step in its efforts toward becoming a multi-brand company. The recent agreement to acquire to Kate Spade & Company for $2.4 billion is another step taken in that direction. Additionally, it is aggressively expanding e-Commerce platform.Strategic endeavors along with transformational initiatives are expected to facilitate the company to attain operating income growth of 22-25% backed by mid-single digit organic growth, Kate Spade buyout and estimated synergies of $30-$35 million.Taking the pros and cons into consideration, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Looking for Gems?

402,PVH,"Deckers Outdoor Corporation (DECK  -  Free Report) has not only outperformed the industry but also the broader sector in the past six months. The stock has increased 21.5%, while the industry has witnessed a decline of 3.7%. Meanwhile, the broader Consumer Discretionary sector gained 2.9%. So, what’s driving this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock.We believe that the company’s disciplined approach toward enhancing e-commerce capabilities, innovative line of products and concentrated efforts on expanding brand assortments has been well received by investors. Additionally, the stock’s long-term earnings growth rate of 9.8% and a VGM Score of A reflect its inherent strength.Let’s Take a Closer LookDeckers is targeting profitable markets and remains focused on product innovations and store augmentation along with transitioning to a direct subsidiary model from a distributor model outside the United States. The company’s focus on expanding brand assortments, bringing more innovative line of products, targeting consumers through marketing and optimizing omni-channel distribution also bode well.In keeping with the changing trends, Deckers has made substantial investments to strengthen online presence and improve shopping experience for customers. Further, it is focused on opening smaller concept omni-channel outlets and expanding programs such as Retail Inventory Online, Infinite UGG; Buy Online, Return In Store; and Click and Collect to enhance shopping experience.Moreover, in an effort to drive long-term growth, the company has taken strategic initiatives. Its store fleet optimization plan focuses on striking the right balance between digital and physical stores. Additionally, Deckers expects cost savings of about $150 million on the back of improvement in cost of goods sold and SG&A savings, which includes consolidation of retail outlets and process improvement efficiencies. This will help realize $100 million operating profit improvement by fiscal 2020.However, management expects second-quarter fiscal 2018 net sales to decline approximately 10% on account of store closures and earlier-than-planned shipments in the first quarter. Management informed that the last year quarter sales also benefited from the shipment of Women's Classic II. Moreover, Deckers envisions earnings in the range of approximately $1.00-$1.05 compared with $1.23 per share delivered in the year-ago period.Nevertheless, we believe that the company’s strategic endeavors will help overcome short-term impediments.Looking for More?

404,PVH,"The sporting goods industry seems to be in doldrums, as customers are jumping on the dot-com bandwagon, leaving lesser options for brick-and-mortar retailers. Consequently, the sporting goods space has grown extremely competitive and promotional, thus creating pressure on margins. While most retailers are trying all means to enhance omni-channel capabilities, competition from online retailers remains a major threat. Challenging retail landscape and changing consumer spending pattern are making operating environment tough, and Foot Locker, Inc. (FL  -  Free Report) falls victim of the same. However, management is not sitting idle and trying all means to lift the company’s performance.Shares of Foot Locker have plunged a little of over 30% in the past three months, wider than the industry’s decline of 4.5%. We have tried to ascertain major reasons that can be held responsible for this Zacks Rank #5 (Sell) stock’s dismal show in the bourses. We also note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.95 and $3.80 for fiscal 2017 and 2018 has declined by 22.5% and 30%, respectively, in the past 60 days. Moreover, the same has slumped34.4% to 80 cents for the third quarter.Foot Locker Continues to Grapple with Soft Top-Line PerformanceAfter registering a meager growth of 0.7% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, total sales declined 4.4% during the second quarter. Meanwhile, comparable-store sales fell 6% during the second quarter, following an increase of 0.5% in the preceding quarter. These numbers are in sharp contrast to the company’s performance in fiscal 2016. During the first, second, third and fourth quarters of last fiscal total sales increased 3.7%, 5%, 5.1% and 5.3%, respectively. Maintaining the same chronological order comparable-store sales rose 2.9%, 4.7%, 4.7% and 5%, respectively.Bottom Line Fell Short of the EstimateFoot Locker, the athletic shoes and apparel retailer, continued with dismal performance in fiscal 2017 posting second straight quarter of earnings miss, when it reported second-quarter results. The quarterly earnings of 62 cents a share fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 90 cents and plummeted 34% year over year after declining 2.2% in the preceding quarter. The results in the quarter were impacted by soft performance of “some recent top styles” and lack of innovative fresh products in the market.Bleak OutlookManagement anticipates comparable sales to decline in the range of 3-4% in remaining part of fiscal 2017. Foot Locker expects adjusted earnings per share to decline in the band of 20-30% (excluding a benefit of 12 cents from 53rd week) during the second half of 2017. Management envisions gross margin to contract in the range of 230-250 basis points in the third quarter and between 150 and 170 basis points in the final quarter on a 13-week basis. SG&A as a percentage of sales is likely to be up 70-100 basis points in both the third and fourth quarters.Bottom LineNevertheless, Foot Locker is trying to improve performance through operational and financial initiatives. The company is also focusing on augmenting e-commerce platform, growing direct-to-consumer operations, rationalizing store fleet and improving supply chain infrastructure. However, these will take time to reap benefits. Well for the time being you can shift your focus on these better-ranked retail stocks.G-III Apparel Group, Ltd.

405,PVH,"Michael Kors Holdings Limited‘s (KORS  -  Free Report) positive earnings surprise, store optimization and global expansion has kept it afloat amid a competitive environment. Further, the company’s decision to acquire Jimmy Choo gives an indication that it is focused on international fashion brands. However, waning top-line along with dismal comps and wholesale segment performance continues to act as headwinds. Let’s delve deeper and analyze the issues influencing the stock.Driving FactorsMichael Kors better-than-expected first-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings aided the company to provide upbeat fiscal 2018 view. The company now envisions fiscal 2018 total revenues to be approximately $4.275 billion, up from the previous estimate of approximately $4.25 billion and expects comparable sales to decrease in the mid-single digit range, compared with the previous estimate of decline in the high-single digit range. Operating margin is still projected to be about 16%. Management anticipates earnings in the band of $3.62-$3.72 per share for the fiscal year, up from earlier estimate of $3.57-$3.67.Michael Kors’ acquisition of Jimmy Choo will help diversify portfolio and tap international markets. The buyout is likely to be accretive in the low-single digits in fiscal 2020. In order to drive top-line growth, Michael Kors has been focusing on store expansion. In fiscal 2016, the company opened 142 new stores, which included 47 in the Americas and 95 worldwide. In fiscal 2017, it opened 159 net new stores openings, which includes 111 outlets related to the acquisition of the earlier licensed operation in Greater China. Given the scope for high profitability from company-owned stores, management is putting more emphasis on opening retail outlets.Sales from Asia have shown tremendous improvement. The company had stated that it will continue with the expansion drive in Asia and also believes it has an opportunity worth $1 billion in the long term.In an effort to increase the profitability in stores fleet, the company has announced its intention to close between 100 to 125 full priced retail stores over the next two years. Moreover, the company stated that it will incur one-time costs of nearly $100-$125 million related to store closures. Meanwhile, the company anticipates annual saving of $60 million due to store closures as well as fall in depreciation and amortization related with these impairment charges.Hurdles to CrossMichael Kors’ wholesale segment continues to pose concern. In first-quarter fiscal 2017, wholesale segment sales declined 23% to $303.6 million primarily due to dismal performance of Americas, European and Asia region, while on a constant currency basis, it fell 22.7%. In the fourth, third, second and first quarter of fiscal 2017, wholesale segment sales declined 22.8%, 17.8%, 18.4% and 7%, respectively.Stiff competition, falling comps, aggressive promotional environment and waning mall traffic are making things tough for Michael Kors. We noted that comparable sales had fallen 5.9% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, following declines of 14.1%, 6.9%, 5.4% and 7.4% in the fourth, third, second and first quarters, respectively.Michael Kors which shares space with Gildan Activewear Inc. (GIL  -  Free Report), PVH Corp. (PVH  -  Free Report) and Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU  -  Free Report) is struggling with top-line performance. After registering meager growth of 0.2% in first-quarter fiscal 2017, it had declined 3.7%, 3.2% and 11.2% in the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017.

407,PVH,"The U.S. apparel industry, one of the largest in the global market, is segregated by Zacks in Retail – Apparel and Shoes and Textile – Apparel. The basic difference in this classification is that the first one includes apparel retailers, while the second comprises apparel manufacturers.There seems to be a lot of cheer in the Textile-Apparel industry that has witnessed a rise of 10.2% this year, with many companies in the space putting up a stellar show — buoyed by favorable economic indicators and strategic growth endeavors. However, the industry, which has been battling stiff competition and soft traffic due to consumers’ inclination toward online shopping has lagged the S&P 500’s rise of 22.9%.Nonetheless, the industry (ranked among the top 16% out all Zacks industries) appears to be a bright spot for investors in 2018, given the current market scenario and companies’ efforts to keep pace with the evolving consumer trends. Notably, the U.S. economy is riding on improved consumer spending, rising consumer confidence and favorable labor market scenario. The latest GDP data also speaks of a healthy domestic economy. Per the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the third and final estimate for third-quarter GDP jumped at an annual rate of 3.2%.These factors, along with textile-apparel players’ strategies of keeping pace with the evolving consumer trends; international expansion and brand enhancement efforts have resulted in solid earnings trends for many companies.

408,PVH,"Shares of Coach, Inc.  have fallen over 15% in a month and also underperformed the industry‘s decline of 1.8%. This fact alone is enough to unnerve investors but the question is what is bothering this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, which otherwise looks quite disciplined in its approach to the changing retail landscape. Further, VGM Score of A and long-term earnings per share growth rate of 11.1%, clearly indicate the stock’s inherent potential.Why Is the Stock Struggling?We noticed that shares of Coach came under pressure after the company reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 15. Analysts pointed that investors were not impressed by the disappointing top-line performance and not so encouraging outlook in spite of integration of Kate Spade & Company.After declining 4% during the third quarter of fiscal 2017, net sales tumbled 1.8% in the final quarter. Moreover, we also noted that the total sales of $1,133.8 million fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,146 million for the fourth successive quarter. Sales growth were hurt by 60 basis points due to management’s efforts to elevate the Coach brand’s positioning in the North American wholesale channel by lowering promotional events and door closures. The company now envisions fiscal 2018 earnings in the range of $2.35-$2.40 per share.Sluggish mall traffic, increased online competition and aggressive pricing strategy are headwinds with which the industry is grappling. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.36 and $2.65 for fiscal 2018 and 2019 has declined by 5 cents and 6 cents, respectively, in the past 30 days. Moreover, the same has plunged 14 cents to 36 cents for the first quarter of fiscal 2018.What Are the Tailwinds?As one of the leading American marketers of fine accessories and gifts, Coach boasts a proven strategy of investing in stores to enhance sales output through product innovation, compelling pricing strategy, new merchandise assortments and cost-effective global sourcing model. We believe that these strategies will help drive comparable-store sales and operating margins in the long term. The company’s growth drivers include expansion of global distribution model and venturing into under-penetrated markets.Coach is undergoing a brand transformation and introducing modern luxury concept stores in key markets. The acquisition of Stuart Weitzman has been accretive to performance and is being viewed as a significant step in its efforts toward becoming a multi-brand company. The recent agreement to acquire to Kate Spade & Company for $2.4 billion is another step taken in that direction. Additionally, it is aggressively expanding e-Commerce platform.Strategic endeavors along with transformational initiatives are expected to facilitate the company to attain operating income growth of 22-25% backed by mid-single digit organic growth, Kate Spade buyout and estimated synergies of $30-$35 million.3 Retail Stocks Taking the LimelightIf you are interested in the retail space you can consider stocks such as G-III Apparel Group, Ltd.

410,PVH,"Consumers are considered to be the core of almost all economic activity. Recent data on jobs, income, inflation and economic growth reveal that consumers are currently in a favorable position, raising chances of increased spending.The labor department’s jobs data illustrates a tightened jobs scenario, with unemployment rate remaining range bound. Recent reports show that unemployment rate rose unexpectedly to 4.4% in August following a 4.3% growth in July.Further, the commerce department stated that annual gross domestic product (GDP) rose 3% in second-quarter 2017, marking the best growth in three years. This growth was supported by robust consumption gains of 3.3%. Consumption accounts for nearly 70% of the economy.Notably, consumer spending for July increased 0.3% after an upside of 0.2% in June. While this reflected a slight slowdown from the economists forecast of 0.4% growth, it still indicates that consumers are willing to spend primarily backed by the strong labor market.Apart from this, other factors influencing the consumers’ willingness to spend are rise in incomes and lower inflation.Incomes rose 0.4% in July, reflecting the highest since February. Further, personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, which is Fed’s preferred inflation measure, increased only 0.1% remaining stable for three consecutive months. Further, it grew at an annual rate of 1.4%, which is below the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. The central bank’s preferred inflation gauge has matched or topped policy makers’ target in just two months since 2012.The solid consumer spending, supported by a chic jobs scenario, indicates that the economy is well-poised for consistent growth in the second half of 2017. Further, the diminishing inflation rate lowers the Federal Reserve’s chances to raise borrowing rates for the third time this year, in the scheduled December meeting.Moreover, these positives from the economic data were reflected in Consumer Confidence, which reached the second highest level in August since late 2000. The Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index surged to 122.9 last month from July’s revised reading of 120.How the Consumer Discretionary Sector Stands to Gain From This TrendWell, spending on discretionary items which form part of the Consumer Discretionary sector is largely dependent on consumers’ spending appetite. Given the favorable background discussed above, consumers are currently willing to spend on discretionary items like durable goods, apparel, entertainment and leisure, and automobiles.The Consumer Discretionary sector growth trends since the start of 2017 have been very appeasing. Markedly, the sector recorded 12.6% growth year to date, comfortably outpacing the 10.2% upside of the S&P 500.Further, it carries a Zacks Sector Rank of #5 (out of 16), placing it at the top 31% of the Zacks Classified sectors.Hence, there lies an opportunity to invest in Consumer Discretionary stocks which are poised to make the best of the improving economic situation.Picking the Right StocksThough investing in the Consumer Discretionary space makes perfect sense at this point. However, making the right choices is tedious.The volatility in equity markets has always been a concern even for the smartest and wittiest investors. So, formulating a strategy is always ideal to skim the cream of the markets. One such strategy that has recently emerged is to invest in stocks that are currently winning and have further growth potential.This entails picking the stocks that are trading near their 52-week highs. This tried and tested technique is based on the new investment mantra, “buy high and sell higher.”Why Stocks Near 52-Week High are Good Bets Investing in stocks near 52-week high runs parallel to the momentum strategy, which formulates that a trend once is established, it is likely to continue. The surge is driven by a broad set of factors including impressive sales, robust profitability and bullish earnings prospects. Major developments may also send stocks soaring. Meanwhile, stocks that are trading near 52-week highs carry the risk of declining rapidly as the market might consider them overvalued. But the positives seem to outweigh drawbacks. Notably, momentum investors strongly believe in “the trend is your friend”, which means stocks that are growing will continue to grow. They make short-term choices among stocks that are scaling up and sell them at the first sign of a downtrend. The basic idea is that once a trend is recognized, it is likely to continue and the chances of a reversal are minimal. Thus, picking such stocks might help investors earn higher returns in the short term. However, this is only a speculative strategy and has its share of risks.Consumer Stocks Worth Buying NowAs stated above, there is an amount of risk involved in picking the stocks at 52-week high. Hence, we suggest clubbing this parameter with other sure shot growth drivers like a VGM Score of A or B , Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), sound fundamentals, surging share price and a track record of better-than-expected results. That said, we hand-picked five Consumer Discretionary stocks that are positioned to benefit from the ongoing economic and sector trends.First on the list is PVH Corporation (PVH  -  Free Report), which specializes in designing and marketing branded dress shirts, neckwear, sportswear, jeanswear, intimate apparel, swim products, footwear, handbags and other related products.

411,PVH,"Central Garden & Pet Company (CENT  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 7, after the closing bell.The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this leading lawn & garden and pet supplies’ producer and marketer will be able to pull off a positive earnings surprise in the to-be reported quarter. Last quarter, the company reported a negative earnings surprise of 20% after 12 straight quarters of earnings beat.Central Garden & Pet Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Central Garden & Pet Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Central Garden & Pet Company QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up prior to the earnings announcement.Estimates & Stock Performance In order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release, let’s have a look at the earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal first quarter has inched up by a penny to 15 cents, in the last 30 days. Also, the estimate reflects year-over-year growth of 25% from 12 cents in the prior-year quarter.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $434.3 million for the impending quarter, up nearly 3.5% from the year-ago quarter. Moreover, the consensus estimates for net sales at the Pet and the Garden segments are currently pegged at $315 million and $116 million, respectively. In the year-ago period, the company registered net sales of $304 million and $115.5 million for the Pet and the Garden segments, respectively.The company forms part of the Consumer Discretionary sector. Per the Earnings Preview  dated Jan 26, the sector’s earnings are expected to decline 1.4% year over year in fourth-quarter 2017 while revenues are likely to be up 3.6%.In the past six months, shares of Central Garden & Pet have gained 22.8% against the industry’s decline of 9.1%.Factors Influencing 1Q18Organic growth, value accretive acquisitions and divestment of non-strategic assets have been the major strengths for Central Garden & Pet. Management is also revamping both the Pet and the Garden segments and aims to have a balanced approach that encompasses improvement in revenues through operational efficiency and cost reduction. Further, it intends to launch several products that appeal to customers as well as upgrade customer service.These initiatives are likely to boost the company’s top line and overall profitability. Evidently, the company’s Pet segment recorded ninth successive quarter of organic sales growth in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017. This came on the back of robust performance at the dog & cat businesses. Additionally, Central Garden & Pet’s diversified portfolio of brands and effective inventory management are expected to drive growth.Nevertheless, seasonality of garden business and cautious approach by customers toward discretionary spending remain concerns.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not show that Central Garden & Pet is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Central Garden & Pet has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 15 cents. The company carries a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, its ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.

412,PVH,"Michael Kors Holdings Limited (KORS  -  Free Report) has been constantly deploying resources to expand product offerings, opening new stores, building shop-in-shops and upgrading e-commerce platform. These endeavors along with the positive earnings streak for the 10th straight quarter gives an indication that the stock is well poised in the long run. Let’s delve deeper.Growth DriversMichael Kors’ acquisition of Jimmy Choo will help diversify portfolio and tap international markets. The buyout is likely to be accretive in the low-single digits in fiscal 2020. In order to drive top-line growth, Michael Kors has been focusing on store expansion. In fiscal 2016, the company opened 142 new stores, which included 47 in the Americas and 95 worldwide. In fiscal 2017, it inaugurated 159 net new stores openings, which includes 111 outlets related to the acquisition of the earlier licensed operation in Greater China.Given the scope for high profitability from company-owned stores, management is putting more emphasis on opening retail outlets. The company also remains focused on enhancing men’s business either through standalone stores or by adding men's offering in the existing lifestyle outlets in North America, Europe and Asia along with expanding luxury fashion product assortments.The company closed the buyout of Michael Kors (HK) Limited, the exclusive licensee in China and certain other jurisdictions in Asia, for $500 million in cash. During second-quarter fiscal 2018, total retail net sales in Asia surged 30.4% on account of new store opening as well as positive comparable sales growth. The company stated that it will continue with the expansion drive in Asia and also believes it has a $1 billion opportunity in the long term.Further, Michael Kors which shares space with Gildan Activewear Inc. (GIL  -  Free Report), PVH Corp. (PVH  -  Free Report) and Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU  -  Free Report), has stated that its project Runway 2020 strategic plan has made early progress during the second quarter. Notably, this plan focuses on product innovation, brand engagement and customer experience. As part of the company’s strategy of product innovation it launched Bancroft in the Michael Kors collection line. The product innovation strategy aided the global Women's footwear comparable sales to increase by double digit.ConcernsStiff competition, falling comps, aggressive promotional environment and waning mall traffic are making things tough. We noted that comparable sales dipped 1.8% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, following declines of 5.9% in the preceding quarter. We noted that comps had declined 14.1%, 6.9%, 5.4% and 7.4% in the fourth, third, second and first quarters, respectively. In fiscal 2018, it continues to expect comparable sales to decrease in the mid-single digit range.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

413,PVH,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put PVH Corp. (PVH  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, PVH has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 19.9, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 22.7. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, PVH’s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Textile - Apparel industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 22.2. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that PVH has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 19, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for PVH stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, PVH has a P/S ratio of about 1.4. This is lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.6x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, PVH currently has a Value Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes PVH a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for PVH is 1.5, a bit lower than the industry average of 1.8. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, PVH is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though PVH might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and a Momentum Score of C. This gives PVH a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of C. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been pretty encouraging. The current quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower, while the full year estimate has seen six up and no down in the same time period.This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has inched up by 0.7% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has increased by 1.2%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:PVH Corp. Price and Consensus PVH Corp. Price and Consensus | PVH Corp. QuoteDespite this bullish trend, the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and that is why we are looking for better performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LinePVH is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Boasting a good industry rank (Top 29% out of more than 250 industries), the company deserves attention right now. In fact, over the past six months, the industry has clearly outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company’s prospects, as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All   Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

Management envisions fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $7.78-$7.80.Let’s Delve DeeperPVH Corp. has been delivering robust performance for quite some time now. This is evident from the company’s positive earnings surprise in 13 of the last 14 quarters. Further, it marked fifth consecutive sales beat in third-quarter fiscal 2017. Also, the company has been gaining from solid momentum at its premium Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands, particularly in the international regions.Additionally, PVH Corp. has been undertaking significant steps to keep pace with the evolving retail trends and integrate consumers’ changing preferences into operating decisions, thereby aiding it to stay afloat in a tough operating environment. The company’s strategic deals to enhance supply-chain network, develop its omni-channel operations, making innovations are likely to boost performance. Moreover, the company’s healthy balance sheet provides it with the financial flexibility to drive growth in the future.However, PVH Corp.’s significant international presence as well as outlets in various tourist destinations across the United States exposes it to foreign currency risks. In fact, currency headwinds have been hurting the company’s results for a while now. While currency rates are expected to improve in the fourth quarter, it is likely to hurt fiscal 2017 earnings by 17 cents per share. Alongside, the company expects volatility in the overall retail environment and unpredictable global consumer spending to remain major challenges.Nonetheless, PVH Corp. has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Long-term earnings growth rate for the company is pegged at 13%.Do Textile-Apparel Stocks Grab Your Attention, Count on TheseSome better-ranked stocks in the same industry include Tailored Brands, Inc.

415,PVH,"Central Garden & Pet Company (CENT  -  Free Report) is a sound investment opportunity backed by its robust growth strategies and an impressive brand portfolio. Organic growth, value accretive acquisitions and divestment of non-strategic assets have also been boding well for the stock.Also, shares of the company have returned 21.8% in the past six months. The stock has outperformed both the industry’s decline of 5.7% and the broader Consumer Discretionary sector’s growth of 6.7%. Also, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has a VGM Score of A and a long-term earnings growth rate of 10%.What’s Pushing the Stock Higher?Central Garden & Pet is revamping both its Pet and Garden segments. The company intends to have a balanced approach that encompasses revenue growth as well as cost reduction. It also plans to launch several products that appeal to customers and upgrade customer services. The company expects to enhance market share in the home centers, mass market, grocery, specialty pet store and other independent channels as well.Impressively, the company’s Pet segment recorded ninth straight quarter of organic sales growth in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, primarily owing to solid performance of the dog & cat businesses.Armed with a diversified portfolio of brands, the company is the leading producer of garden and pet supplies products in the United States and has developed healthy commercial relationships with giant retailers. This, in turn, is expected to provide the company a significant opportunity to drive growth.Additionally, Central Garden & Pet has an impressive gross margin trend backed by its efforts to improve manufacturing efficiency. The improvement was further aided by exit from the holiday decor business that was hampering the margin, due to lower raw material costs.This leading producer and marketer of premium and value-oriented products have shown constant improvement in the past five quarters. In the first, second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017, gross margin expanded 110, 90, 10 and 50 basis points to 28.8%, 32.2%, 31.9% and 29.6%, respectively.What Bothers the Stock?Unfortunately, the company could not maintain its robust earnings surprise streak in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. After 12 straight quarters of earnings beat, Central Garden & Pet’s bottom line not only missed the consensus mark but also declined sharply year over year owing to rise in cost of goods sold and occupancy and higher SG&A expenses. This along with high debt and seasonality of business remains a major concern.Still, management envisions adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2018 to increase by 8% or higher, which indicates that the company may be back on growth track in the quarters ahead. Looking for Solid Picks, Check TheseSome better-ranked stocks in the Consumer Discretionary space include SodaStream International Ltd.

416,PVH,"Consumers, who are the core of all economic activity, have shown profound optimism lately as is evident from the increased consumer confidence, consumer spending and stable job scenario. Consumers’ favorable position also reflects a steady U.S. economy, which is poised for growth.The commerce department revealed that annual gross domestic product (GDP) rose 3.3% in third-quarter 2017 (second estimate), above the advance reading of 3% and up from 3.1% growth in the preceding quarter. This growth was supported by increases in consumer spending, inventory investment, business investment, and exports.Consumer spending rose 2.3% in the third quarter. Further, initial holiday period sales data (during the Thanksgiving weekend) suggests that consumers are increasingly spending on restaurants, clothing, electronics, fuel and groceries in November.Moreover, consumers’ optimism is well reflected in the Consumer Confidence data, which increased for the fifth straight month and remains at a 17-year high in November. The Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index surged to 129.5 in November from October’s reading of 126.2.A major reason for the high consumer confidence is consumers’ expectations of further improvement in labor market. Notably, the labor market remains attractive with a gradual decline in unemployment rate. The unemployment rate has gone down significantly to 4.1% in November from 4.8% in January.The uptick in the U.S. economy is well supported by the bullish run of the stock markets in 2017. Major stock indices Nasdaq Composite Index, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average registered year-to-date growths of 15.2%, nearly 20% and 24.3%, respectively. Not surprisingly, investors can make the most of this market momentum by investing in stocks that have crushed these indices in 2017.Why Consumer Discretionary Sector?Well, spending on discretionary items which form a part of the Consumer Discretionary sector is largely dependent on consumers’ spending appetite. Given the favorable background discussed above, consumers are currently willing to spend on discretionary items like durable goods, apparel, entertainment and leisure, and automobiles.The Consumer Discretionary sector growth trends since the start of 2017 have been very appeasing. Markedly, the sector recorded 17.1% growth year to date, slightly lagging the 19.9% upside of the S&P 500. Further, it carries a Zacks Sector Rank of #9 (out of 16).Hence, there lies an opportunity to invest in Consumer Discretionary stocks that have outpaced major indices, to make the best of the improving economic situation.5 Consumer Stocks that Outpaced the MarketThat said, we bring five Consumer Discretionary stocks that not only outpaced the market in 2017 but are expected to outperform in the coming years.

418,PVH,"Investors in PVH Corp. (PVH  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Sep 5th 2017 $70.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for PVH Corp shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, PVH Corp is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in the Textile - Apparel industry that ranks in the Top 40% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, the current quarter Zacks Consensus Estimate has seen four upward versus no downward revisions. The net effect has been taken by the Zacks Consensus Estimate going to $2.91 from $2.76 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about PVH Corp right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

419,PVH,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put PVH Corp. (PVH  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, PVH Corp. has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 17.56. This level compares favorably with the market at large, as the PE ratio for the S&P 500 comes in at about 19.87.If we focus on the long-term trend of the stock the current level puts PVH Corp.’s current PE among its highs over the observed period. This suggests that the stock is overvalued compared to its own historical levels. Further, the stock’s PE compares favorably with its industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 19.31. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that PVH Corp. has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 16.32, which lower than the current level. So, it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for PVH Corp. stock in the near term too.PS RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, PVH Corp. has a P/S ratio of about 1.18. This is lower than the industry average, which comes in at 1.84x right now.As we can see, the stock is trading at its median value for the time period from a P/S metric. This does not provide us with a conclusive direction as to the relative valuation of the stock in comparison to its historical trend.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, PVH Corp. currently has a Value Score of ‘B’, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes PVH Corp. an apt choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for PVH Corp. is just 1.29, a level that is lower than the industry average of 1.38. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, PVH is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though PVH Corp. might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of ‘A’ and a Momentum score of ‘A’. This gives PVH a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of ‘A’. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>).Our VGM Score identifies stocks that have the most attractive value, growth, and momentum characteristics, and a good VGM score can increase your odds of success. All things considered, PVH Corp. seems to have pretty striking prospects.Meanwhile, the company’s earnings estimates have been trending upward lately. The current quarter has seen four estimates go higher in the past thirty days compared to none lower, while the full year estimate has seen six upward revisions and no downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a small but meaningful impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has increased 3.2% over the past month, while the full year estimate has moved up 2%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:PVH Corp. Price and Consensus PVH Corp. Price and Consensus | PVH Corp. QuoteThis bullish trend indicates that analysts feel good about this company right now, despite the fact that the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which signals expectations of in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LinePVH Corp. is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a strong industry rank (Top 20% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock.Moreover, the company recently posted better-than-expected earnings and sales results for second-quarter fiscal 2017. While sales marked its fourth consecutive beat, earnings retained its positive surprise trend for the 13th straight time. Results continued to gain from solid momentum at its Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands, particularly in the international regions. Further, the company raised earnings outlook for fiscal 2017.So, despite a Zacks Rank #3, we believe that it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company’s prospects, as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

Further, the company raised earnings outlook for fiscal 2017.Results continued to gain from solid momentum at the company’s premium Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands, though it was partly hampered by a volatile macro and geopolitical environment.Shares of the company jumped 3.7% in the after-market trading session following the results. Moreover, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has grown 12.2% in the last three months, outperforming the industry’s upside of 8%.Q2 HighlightsThe company posted second-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.69, up 15% year over year. Earnings also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.65 and surpassed its own guidance range of $1.60-$1.63. However, currency hurt earnings by 5 cents per share in the quarter.PVH Corp. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  PVH Corp. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | PVH Corp. QuoteOn a GAAP basis, PVH Corp. reported earnings of $1.52 per share, up 36.9% from $1.11 earned in the year-ago quarter.PVH Corp.’s total revenues advanced 7.1% to $2,069.9 million, also surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,033 million. During the quarter, the company’s revenues reflected no impact from foreign currency both on a consolidated basis and segment-wise. Hence, second-quarter results do not include constant-currency discussions for revenue.Adjusted gross profit increased 10.5% year over year to $1,147.3 million, with the gross margin expanding 170 basis points (bps), to roughly 55.4%.Adjusted EBIT ascended 9.3% to $199.7 million, backed by improved Tommy Hilfiger and Heritage Brands earnings, somewhat negated by earnings decline in Calvin Klein due to higher investments and marketing expenditure, as well as increased corporate expenses. The adjusted EBIT margin expanded 10 bps to nearly 9.6%.Segment AnalysisPVH Corp. reports financial results under three business segments: Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Heritage Brands.Calvin Klein’s revenues advanced 8% year over year to $786 million, including about $15 million impact from the deconsolidation of PVH’s business in Mexico in November 2016. The improvement was driven by a 20% increase in the segment’s International revenues, partially offset by a 1% decline in revenues for the North America business.The growth in International business was backed by solid performance of wholesale business in Europe and China, alongside robust growth in the retail business due to 6% comparable store sales (comps) increase and square-footage expansion. Meanwhile, revenues for the North America business was mainly hurt by the deconsolidation of the Mexico business as well as 2% decline in comps.Revenues at the company’s Tommy Hilfiger segment jumped 4% to $892 million, mainly backed by 9% sales growth in the brand’s International business owing to persistent strength in Europe and Asia, and 6% comps growth.However, this was partly offset by a 2% decline in the brand’s North American revenues due to the discontinuation of its directly-operated womenswear wholesale business in the United States and Canada in fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 due to the licensing of this business to G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. (GIII). Further, comps for the North American business remained flat.The Heritage Brands segment’s revenues rose 13% year over year to $392 million due to a planned change in shipment timings from both the first and third quarters in to the second quarter. Further, comps improved 1%.FinancialsThe company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $559.4 million, long-term debt of $3,185.7 million, and shareholders’ equity of $5,095.2 million.In first-half fiscal 2017, the company repurchased about 1.2 million shares for roughly $124 million under its $1.25 billion standing authorization that extends till Jun 3, 2020.GuidanceDriven by the solid second-quarter results, improvement in foreign currency rates and continued strength across its brands, PVH Corp. expects to deliver a robust second-half performance. Consequently, the company raised earnings outlook for fiscal 2017 and initiated guidance for the third quarter. However, concerns regarding the volatile macroeconomic and geopolitical environment remain.For fiscal 2017, the company now projects revenues to rise 6% year over year, while currency neutral revenues are expected to grow 5%. Earlier, the company forecasted revenue growth of 3%. Management expects revenues to continue being dented by the licensing deal with G-III Apparel as well as the Mexico deconsolidation.Brand-wise, Calvin Klein revenues are anticipated to increase 8% (or 7% on a currency-neutral basis), revenues of Tommy Hilfiger are estimated to climb 6% (or 5% on a currency-neutral basis), and Heritage Brands is expected to remain flat year over year. Earlier, the company had project revenue growth of 6% for Calvin Klein and 2% for Tommy Hilfiger (4% on currency-neutral basis).Further, management now envisions fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $7.60-$7.70, compared with $7.40-$7.50 expected earlier. The latest outlook includes an expected 20 cents per share negative impact from currency headwinds. The guidance also includes an additional $10 million of marketing investments in the second half. On a GAAP basis, the company projects fiscal 2017 earnings per share in the range of $6.44-$6.54.Q3 GuidanceFor third-quarter fiscal 2017, the company expects total revenues to jump 4% year over year, while it is anticipated to advance 3%, on a constant-currency basis. Third-quarter revenues are also anticipated to bear the brunt of Mexico deconsolidation and the licensing agreement with G-III Apparel.Brand-wise, Calvin Klein revenues are expected to jump 5% (or 4% on a currency-neutral basis), revenues of Tommy Hilfiger are estimated to advance 8% (or 7% on a currency-neutral basis), while revenues for Heritage Brands are expected to decline 8%.Adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter are expected to be $2.88-$2.92, including 6 cents per share negative impact from currency translations.

423,PVH,"Premium lifestyle products retailer, Ralph Lauren Corporation (RL  -  Free Report) seems to be striking the right chords as evident from the progress made on its Way Forward Plan and other Restructuring initiatives. The cumulative effect of this progress is not only reflected in the company’s solid earnings surprise trend but has also seeped in to the recent stock performance.Shares of Ralph Lauren have shown significant growth last month as against its dismal past performances. The stock witnessed a solid 19.4% growth in the past month, outperforming the industry’s 4.7% upside.Further, this apparel retailer boasts a VGM Score of A and has a long-term EPS growth rate of 15%. That said, let’s take a closer look at the factors behind this solid performance.Q1 Performance Reflects Progress on Strategic PlanRalph Lauren’s first-quarter fiscal 2018 performance was a testimony to its progress on the Way Forward Plan and Restructuring initiatives that was announced in Jun 2016. Divided in two parts, the plan is all about refocusing on the core, strengthening the brands and returning the company to profitable growth in the long term.During the fiscal first quarter, the company enhanced quality of sales by reducing promotions and markdowns, alongside reducing Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) count to drive productivity. Further, the company improved inventory turns by curtailing inventory levels by 31% year over year and also achieved cost savings by lowering operating costs. Additionally, the company is keen on optimizing its wholesale distribution by shutting down underperforming points of distribution.Earnings Trend & OutlookRalph Lauren flaunts a solid earnings history, with positive earnings surprises delivered in 15 out of the last 16 quarters. Notably, first-quarter fiscal 2018 marked its 10th consecutive earnings beat. Further, the bottom line grew year over year and gross profit margin continued to expand – thanks to favorable geographic and channel mix shifts along with lower promotions and cost-controls. Also, the company curtailed operating expenses, which in turn drove operating margin expansion.Ralph Lauren Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Ralph Lauren Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Ralph Lauren Corporation QuoteLooking ahead, management remains confident of Ralph Lauren’s performance based on its efforts related to global brand reorganization, constant infrastructural investments and eCommerce enhancements. Further, the company’s efforts to evolve product and marketing bode well. Additionally, management lowered effective tax rate forecast for fiscal 2018, which we believe should benefit the bottom line.Positive Estimate RevisionsThese factors led to an uptrend in the Zacks Consensus Estimates in the last seven days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter and fiscal 2018 rose to $1.77 per share and $4.89 per share, respectively, from $1.70 and $4.81.Sales Continue to DeclineWhile all is well with this New York-based company, its sales continued to be soft due to weak demand, brand exits and efforts to drive quality of sales. This marked the company’s second consecutive sales miss.Currency HeadwindsApart from the aforementioned factors, foreign currency continued to have an adverse impact on Ralph Lauren’s top-line and margins in the most recent quarter. In fact, currency has long been a hindrance for Ralph Lauren, given its international exposure. Currency impacted revenues by nearly 130 basis points (bps) and operating margin by 50 bps in the fiscal first quarter.Further, it anticipates the headwinds to continue to impact results in second-quarter fiscal 2018. For the second quarter, the company expects currency headwinds to hurt revenue growth and operating margin by nearly 40 bps, each.ConclusionWhile the company’s soft top-line picture is discouraging, we commend its progress on its strategic plans, which should bear fruit in the long term. Further, we note that the soft sales performance is more or less a function of its ongoing revival efforts and should recover as the company implements its plans. Aptly, Ralph Lauren currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Meanwhile, investors interested in the space can also count on Michael Kors Holdings Limited (KORS  -  Free Report), PVH Corp. (PVH  -  Free Report) and Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

424,PVH,"PVH Corp. (PVH  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 23. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this designer and marketer of branded apparel, footwear and other accessories will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The company has a splendid positive earnings surprise record of nearly 12 quarters now, while it has also topped sales estimates in the last three quarters. In fact, its solid performance helped it surge 36.7% so far this year, beating the industry’s 8.8% growth. So, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at $1.65, reflecting year-over-year growth of over 12%. We noted that our earnings estimate has remained stable over the last 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of roughly $2 billion, up about 5.2% from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayPVH Corp.’s solid show even in the face of an uncertain macro environment mainly reflects the strength of its premium brands – Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger. Apart from its diversified brand portfolio, the company has been gaining from the impressive trends at its international business. Management believes that the company’s superb execution, continued investments in brands and international platforms remain its growth drivers. Also, keeping pace with the evolving trends and undertaking necessary initiatives to stay afloat in the current business scenario is likely to help PVH Corp. sustain its solid momentum. These factors also encouraged the company to raise its fiscal 2017 outlook.However, PVH Corp. remains cautious against the adverse foreign currency movements, which has long been a hurdle for the company. Also, volatility in the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment can impact performance. Considering all factors, the company projected total revenues to jump 5% year over year, in the second quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, revenues are anticipated to advance 7%. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to range from $1.60 - $1.63, including 7 cents negative impact from currency translations. Also, management expects witnessing a $20 million escalation in total marketing costs in the quarter, primarily accountable to Calvin Klein.All said, let’s wait and see if PVH can keep its robust streak alive this time as well.PVH Corp. Price and EPS Surprise  PVH Corp. Price and EPS Surprise | PVH Corp. QuoteWhat the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that PVH Corp.is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with ourEarnings ESP Filter.PVH Corp. currently sports a Zacks Rank #1, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company has an Earnings ESP of -0.61% as the Most Accurate estimate of $1.64 is pegged a notch below the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The combination of PVH Corp.’s Zacks Rank #1 and negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Burlington Stores, Inc. (BURL  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.00% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Big Lots, Inc.

425,PVH,"Michael Kors Holdings Limited‘s (KORS  -  Free Report) positive earnings surprise, upbeat guidance, store optimization and global expansion bode well. However, waning top-line along with dismal comps and wholesale segment performance continues to act as headwinds. Let’s delve deeper.Hidden CatalystShares of Michael Kors took a sharp “U–turn” following the company’s positive earnings streak for the ninth straight quarter and upbeat fiscal 2018 guidance. Revenues also came ahead of the estimate for the second quarter in row on account of robust retail sales performance. The company now envisions fiscal 2018 total revenue to be nearly $4.275 billion, up from the previous estimate of about $4.25 billion. Management anticipates earnings in the band of $3.62–$3.72 per share for the fiscal year, up from earlier estimate of $3.57–$3.67 per share.Michael Kors’ acquisition of Jimmy Choo will help diversify portfolio and tap international markets. The buyout is likely to be accretive in the low single digits in fiscal 2020. In a bid to drive top-line growth, Michael Kors has been focusing on store expansion. In fiscal 2016, the company opened 142 new stores, which included 47 in the Americas and 95 worldwide. In fiscal 2017, it opened 159 net new stores openings, which includes 111 outlets related to the acquisition of the earlier licensed operation in Greater China. Given the scope for high profitability from company-owned stores, management is putting more emphasis on opening retail outlets. Sales from Asia have shown tremendous improvement. The company had stated that it will continue with the expansion drive in Asia and also believes it has a $1 billion opportunity in the long term.In an effort to increase the profitability in stores fleet, the company has announced its intention to close between 100 to 125 full priced retail stores over the next two years. Moreover, the company stated that it will incur one-time costs of nearly $100–$125 million related to store closures. Meanwhile, the company anticipates annual saving of $60 million owing to store closures as well as fall in depreciation and amortization related with these impairment charges.Hurdles to CrossMichael Kors’ wholesale segment continues to pose concern for the investors. In first-quarter fiscal 2017 wholesale segment sales declined 23% to $303.6 million primarily due to dismal performance of Americas, European and Asia region, while on a constant currency basis, it fell 22.7%. In the fourth, third, second and first quarter of fiscal 2017, wholesale segment sales declined 22.8%, 17.8%, 18.4% and 7%, respectively.Stiff competition, falling comps, aggressive promotional environment and waning mall traffic are making things tough for Michael Kors. We noted that comparable sales had fallen 5.9% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, following declines of 14.1%, 6.9%, 5.4% and 7.4% in the fourth, third, second and first quarters, respectively.Michael Kors which shares space with Gildan Activewear Inc. (GIL  -  Free Report), PVH Corp. (PVH  -  Free Report) and Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU  -  Free Report) is struggling with its top-line performance. After registering a meager growth of 0.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, it had declined 3.7%, 3.2% and 11.2% in the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017. In the first-quarter of fiscal 2018, revenues declined 3.6%.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

427,PVH,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping Under Armour, Inc. (UAA  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further confirms weakness in UAA.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen fourteen estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with just no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from 42 cents a share a month ago to its current level of 38 cents.Under Armour, Inc. Price and Consensus Under Armour, Inc. Price and Consensus | Under Armour, Inc. QuoteAlso, for the current quarter, Under Armour has seen thirteen downward estimate revisions versus no revision in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 66 cents a share from $1.14 over the past 30 days. The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 9.9% in the past month.So it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don’t have a long time horizon to wait.If you are still interested in the Textile - Apparelindustry, you may instead consider a better-ranked stock - PVH Corp.(PVH  -  Free Report).
