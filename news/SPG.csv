1,SPG,"Real estate funds have been making a comeback since tumbling to recent lows. In fact, several are near potential buy points.Why? Most of these ETFs hold real estate investment trusts (REITs), high-yielding securities which tend to do better when interest rates are low. So investors bailed out as the 10-year Treasury yield climbed past 3% earlier this year. But they're getting back in as rates have slipped below 3% again.The $32 billion Vanguard Real Estate ETF (VNQ) is in buy range from an 80.87 entry of a cup with handle. While shares are near a 52-week high, they are still about 11% below their August 2016 peak.Specialized REITs accounted for the biggest sector weight in the fund as of May 31, at about 27% of assets. Other sizable REIT sector weightings were retail, representing nearly 16%, residential at 14%, office at 11% and health care 9.5%. Top 10 holdings in the 186-stock fund included shopping mall owner Simon Property Group (SPG), cell tower operator American Tower (AMT) and industrial REIT Prologis (PLD).Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseVNQ's 1.1% year-to-date return through Monday lags the S&P 500's 5% gain, according to Morningstar Inc. It also lags the S&P index over the longer haul. But REITs tend to shine when it comes to dividends. The ETF's annualized yield is 3.6%, double the average payout of the S&P 500. VNQ charges a 0.12% expense ratio.Schwab U.S. REIT (SCHH) is near the left-side high of a seven-month base. It has also offered an earlier entry off a handle. The $4.5 billion fund, which tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Select REIT Index, carries a 0.07% expense ratio. Top holdings include Simon Property, Prologis and Public Storage (PSA). SCHH has returned 2.9% year to date. Its average annual returns also lag the S&P 500 over the past three and five years.

2,SPG,"Roadie — a startup that gets everyday folks to deliver packages while on their way to wherever they're already driving — has notched a lot of oddball same-day delivery jobs that Amazon (AMZN) doesn't do. A glass aquarium from Fountain Valley to Long Beach, Calif. A set of keys to someone locked out of her house in Georgia at 2 a.m. A box of trial evidence from San Francisco to Napa in time for a panicked lawyer's court date.Around 80%-85% of its shipments are same-day affairs, fueled partly by individuals with curious packages, but mostly by bigger businesses. And Roadie, which provides Kroger (KR) grocery delivery in select areas and brings lost luggage to Delta Air Lines (DAL) customers in about 40 markets, is not alone.Roadie rivals Instacart and Deliv have separately joined forces with Walmart (WMT), Costco (COST), Kroger, Macy's (M) and Best Buy (BBY) on same-day shipping. Target (TGT) even went so far as to acquire Shipt for $550 million. The bull's-eye is ""becoming the first retailer to offer same-day delivery nationwide,"" said Target CEO Brian Cornell last month at retail conference Shoptalk.The driving force behind this latest retail trend, as ever, is Amazon. Its Prime same-day delivery service follows a free-shipping perk that is now a de facto requirement for online shopping. But after scrambling to catch up to Amazon on free shipping, these old brick-and-mortar titans are rushing to stay ahead of the e-commerce giant on same-day delivery. And this next online battleground might actually tilt in their favor, some analysts say.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSpeedy delivery doesn't come cheap. Customers could pay anywhere from $5.99 to $9.99 per shipment for the pleasure. But demand continues to mount, which makes it ""absolutely essential"" for retailers in order to compete in this ""instant-gratification economy,"" said Retail Metrics head Ken Perkins, who thinks one-hour delivery might be the next goal. ""People want to see a package on their door when they return from work.""As President Trump continues tweeting his rage at Amazon on a near-daily basis over its use of the U.S. Postal Service, it's the Shipts and Instacarts and Delivs (not to mention the Postmates and DoorDashes in food delivery) that are harvesting this ripe market. And they may not even emerge as the biggest winners. Instead, logistics giants like UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX) have the scale and infrastructure to capture at least 80% of the future same-day delivery market, a 2017 McKinsey report noted.To a physical store, looking to a web-based firm to hurry along online orders might seem like hastening one's own demise.But the McKinsey report called same-day a ""$200 billion opportunity for retailers in Europe and North America over the next decade."" And it pinpointed brick-and-mortar stores as potentially recapturing turf from online pure plays.The firm said that only traditional retailers ""have the dense network of physical stores to support same-day order fulfillment and delivery.""Perhaps surprisingly, that dinosaur of retail — shopping malls! — is also poised to benefit from the interest in same-day delivery.Daphne Carmeli, CEO of delivery startup Deliv, had an aha! moment when she realized that this could offer shopping centers a ""line of sight ... into e-commerce revenue"" that they wouldn't otherwise have.If you live in Palo Alto, Calif., and place an order on Macys.com, for example, that purchase is likely to be shipped out from a nonlocal distribution center in, say, Atlanta. In that scenario, only Macy's and UPS make money off that transaction.But if you place that online order through Deliv, and the nearby Stanford Shopping Center fulfills that order (and a few dozen others) from its own in-house Macy's, then the mall owner gets some of that revenue, because of the way that leases are structured.Malls ""make money on real estate and rent,"" said Carmeli, adding, ""the more sales the actual Macy's makes, the more the actual mall operator makes.""Which is why malls are willing to carve out parts of their own budgets to hire runners to fulfill Deliv orders. Deliv has partnered exclusively with — and has strategic investments from — major operators Simon Property Group (SPG), Westfield, General Growth Properties (GGP) and Macerich.Luckily for Deliv and its rivals, the technology to make same-day drop-offs happens to have come a long way since the early dot-com days. Deliv's Carmeli, whose company serves 1,400 cities across 35 U.S. markets, was once told her idea was the ""stupidest idea ever.""""Do you remember Webvan? Do you remember Kozmo? Do you remember all the hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars that were deployed to build up these companies that ended up exploding in colossal fashion?"" she recalls being asked.Deliv, like many of its peers, avoids being blown up by using modern-age technology to orchestrate an algorithmic symphony of scheduled pickups and drop-offs from nearly 150 retailers — including Macy's, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), Sam's Club and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Express — straight to people's homes.Retailers nowadays have a better grip on inventory visibility, says Carmeli. And smartphones make it easy to crowdsource drivers.Her predecessors, like Leonardo da Vinci dreaming up helicopters in the early 1500s, tried to make same-day work on a mass scale before the right equipment existed.Boston Retail Partners analyst Scott Langdoc knows that serious pain. As a former C-suite exec at ""mini-Webvan"" delivery company PDQuick at the start of the new millennium, he says that Google Maps would have made all the difference.""If I had the tools that are available today, starting with Google Maps but fast-forwarding to the (artificial intelligence and machine learning) tools that are available today, it's amazing to think what I could've done at my scale or what Webvan or Kozmo could've done at their scale,"" he said.Like many of its peers of the time, PDQuick didn't survive. It was bought out and went back to its roots as a scaled-down SoCal neighborhood delivery service, Pink Dot.""What we'd intended to do before the 2001 implosion was basically do what Shipt did, which was to generalize the delivery and logistics capability for any retail platform so we could bring in inventory. A retailer brought in drivers and you would be able, based on location, to provide that capability,"" said Langdoc.""Fast forward 15 years, that is what Shipt is; that is what Instacart is.""That doesn't mean that same-day delivery is not without major challenges. It's expensive, for one. And as grocery delivery emerges as the next massive battleground, the stakes are being raised beyond mere speedy delivery of things like T-shirts, to more delicate items like yogurt and tomatoes.Even first movers are encountering issues.""It's not free and you can lose an awful lot of money trying to do it for free,"" said Moody's analyst Charlie O'Shea. ""Amazon will approach $10 billion in absorbed delivery costs this year. There aren't a lot of companies that have the ability to absorb that, either from a financial flexibility perspective or shareholder patience.""That has bestowed upon Amazon a ""fairly significant advantage,"" he said.Still, other companies have advantages too. If any physical retailer could conceivably take on same-day delivery in-house, it's Walmart, say experts.So far, Walmart's grocery-delivery pilot employs its own trucks in just one of six test markets, Denver. It relies on Deliv in San Jose and on Uber in Dallas, Orlando, Phoenix and Tampa.The Bentonville, Ark.-based mega-retailer recently declared that over 40% of American households across more than 100 cities will have access to its online grocery delivery service by year-end. That effort is expected to add thousands more to its already 18,000-strong force of personal shoppers.On Tuesday, Walmart said it enlisted courier Postmates to deliver online grocery orders starting in Charlotte, N.C., before rolling out to other cities.""We know one thing's for sure: that (customers) want a delivery option and so we're committed to that,"" Walmart spokesperson Molly Blakeman told Investor's Business Daily in late January. The company filed to trademark grocery delivery-related ""Wam! by Walmart"" earlier in the year, which Blakeman confirmed is associated with active, ongoing projects.Still, even as analysts agree that same-day shipping, including grocery delivery, has to be an option for shoppers now, some question if the effort is worth it.""In this arms race to provide faster delivery, are you providing too many resources to a very small niche product, or a small niche customer base?"" asked Moody's O'Shea.There are more households in America that make less than $30,000 a year than more than $100,000, he said. So the idea of same-day, for most products, isn't hugely compelling at current price points.""I would not say that the demand is minimal, it just has a definite ceiling — at least as far as the pricing stays where it is,"" echoed Euromonitor analyst Tim Barrett.And if you're wondering whether same-day delivery could ever scale up and reach rural settings, the answer is: ""No way,"" he said, laughing.""Simply put, that's not going to happen,"" said Barrett. ""We have seen traditional grocery stores struggle to sustain enough traffic to justify real estate and actual brick and mortar, let alone expensive delivery, let alone even more expensive same-day delivery.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Amazon Vs.

3,SPG,"Stocks weakened into the close after the Federal Reserve made its expected interest-rate increase Wednesday.X The Nasdaq composite closed 0.2% higher and the Dow Jones industrial average ended with a 0.3% gain, good for another record close. But the S&P 500 fell a fraction as financials lagged noticeably. The small-cap Russell 2000 led with a 0.6% leap at the closing bell.Volume rose, according to preliminary figures.The Fed raised the fed funds rate by a quarter point and held to a projection of three more rate hikes in 2018. The Fed, factoring in tax cuts, boosted its projection of 2018 economic growth to 2.5% from September's 2.1% forecast but did not increase inflation estimates.Meanwhile, congressional negotiators reached a compromise on a massive tax bill that includes a reduction in corporate tax rates to 21% from 35%.Banks have been rising on expectations of rising rates, but they lagged in Wednesday's market, perhaps a sell-on-the-news reaction.State Street (STT) rose above the 100.09 buy point of a cup-shaped base in average volume. But the Boston-based investment management firm closed slightly below that entry.Gold miners were one of Wednesday's top-performing industry groups as gold, silver and other metals climbed. Freeport McMoRan (FCX) is following through on a breakout from a double-bottom buy point at 15.69. The copper miner has surged for six straight days while copper prices rally.Chile's Codelco, the world's largest copper producer, is headed to contract talks with 32 labor unions, which raises the possibility of work stoppages, Bloomberg reported. Supplies are constrained, too.With brick-and-mortar retailers making a rebound, a few shopping-center companies reached buy points Wednesday.Agree Realty (ADC), a real estate investment trust that owns retail space for restaurants, auto parts stores, gyms, banks and other shops, cleared the 51.38 buy point of a choppy flat base. Volume was only average, however.It wasn't quite a breakout, but Simon Property Group (SPG), the nation's largest mall operator, tried to clear the 167.92 buy point of a flat base deep within a larger consolidation.The SPDR Retail (XRT) ETF rose more than 1% and is near the highest level since the start of the year.

4,SPG,"Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) latest investment is real estate. Store Capital Corp. (STOR) announced a $377 million investment from the industrial conglomerate Monday, equal to a 9.8% stake.A Berkshire subsidiary paid $20.25 per share for 18.6 million shares of the real estate investment trust's (REIT) stock in a private placement. Shares of Store Capital gapped up 11% to 23.11 on the stock market today, moving above the 50-day moving average. The short-term trend line had acted as a resistance level since late April.B-class shares of Berkshire closed up 0.2% at 167.49, after a 1.9% loss last week. Berkshire's other real estate investments include Lodging Capital Partners, LCB Senior Living and Strategic Capital Partners.Store Capital's CEO Christopher Volk described the Berkshire investment as a ""vote of confidence"" in the company's strategy, positioning it for continued growth. Berkshire's investment makes it one of the largest holders in the REIT after Vanguard Group and Fidelity Management & Research, reports said.Vanguard REIT (VNQ), the largest real estate exchange traded fund, has a small, 0.42% stake in Store Capital. Its top stock holding Simon Property Group (SPG) added 1% Monday. Vanguard REIT rose 0.7%.Store Capital, an internally managed net-lease real estate investment trust (REIT), invests in Single Tenant Operational Real Estate. Its portfolio includes more than 1,750 properties in 48 states.However, Store stock has slumped 19% in the past year vs. a 22% gain for the S&P 500. The REIT has suffered from its association with retail tenants but ""has intentionally weighted its portfolio heavily to service industries, including restaurants, movie theaters, fitness clubs, early childhood education, veterinary clinics and more,"" one news report noted early Monday.""The result is that only 3% of the company's entire investment portfolio is within close proximity (a quarter mile in any direction) to any Sears (SHLD), J.C. Penney (JCP), Macy's (M), Kmart or HHGregg (HGG) store, Forbes contributor Brad Thomas added.Buffett's other recent investments include Toronto-based lender Home Capital Group and German chemical company Lanxess.RELATED:Why Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Rescued This Canadian LenderQatar Airways Wants 10% Stake In American AirlinesTwo Railroads Formerly Owned By Warren Buffett Eye BreakoutsIs Berkshire's Buffett Signaling His Next Takeover Target?

5,SPG,"Look up ""sad mall"" or ""dead mall"" online and you're likely to be confronted with images of desolate, shuttered shopping centers that have been left for dead. Overgrown plants crack through abandoned storefronts; crumbled tile litters broken-down escalators. It's a common-enough phenomenon that entire photography projects revolve around the state of the country's retail centers.Is this what 2017 holds for American shoppers?Not quite, but the upcoming year isn't exactly going to be a cakewalk, either. The hundreds of collective store closures (from Macy's (M), Wal-Mart (WMT) and others, combined) and bankruptcies (Sports Authority, Sports Chalet) in 2016 are enough to make even the most devoted shopaholic wonder if the future of commerce is one big Amazon.com (AMZN) screen.""It's going to be a year of transition and a year of reckoning and a year of awakening for retailers,"" said Marshal Cohen, NPD Group's chief industry analyst.Retail sales excluding autos and gasoline rose 4% from Nov. 1 to Dec. 24, according to MasterCard's SpendingPulse. That suggests a stronger-than-expected holiday season, perhaps reflecting more optimistic consumers. But while digital sales continued to boom, with Amazon grabbing an ever-larger e-commerce share, brick-and-mortar locations faced declining traffic. And those trends are likely to intensify into the new year.The big discounts offered at apparel stores this holiday season echoed prior sales-heavy years, particularly 2015's. While retailers generally went into this important shopping period claiming that inventories were lean, stores feel they have no choice in an already cutthroat environment.""Consumers have been trained that if they hold out, they will get a promotion,"" said Morningstar analyst Bridget Weishaar. ""The other problem is that it's a really overcrowded space with no barriers to entry. A lot of retailers are choosing to compete on price.""IBD'S TAKE: What's holding Amazon back from becoming a major player in beauty? For an in-depth look, read: ""Why Amazon Has Been Powerless Against Beauty Stores.""Retail Metrics President Ken Perkins said that outside of a few busy hours on the weekends, Holiday 2016 was ""somewhat eerily quiet"" at the mall.During store checks, his research firm observed but a ""handful of people"" at Foot Locker (FL), Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) brand Hollister, American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) and Macy's. L Brands' (LB) Bath & Body Works ""always seems to have a buzz,"" he said, but even Apple (AAPL) stores seemed less bustling than in years' past.""Each year it feels like that lull is a bit deeper and deeper,"" said Perkins.Some of the lag can be attributed to holiday promotions being pushed up earlier in November, said NPD's Cohen, spreading out the spending. But the perhaps greater problem is the lack of product innovation and uniqueness on shelves, he said.In other words, there's not enough new, fun stuff to buy — for other people or for self-gifting purposes.NPD, which tracks the November-December shopping period week by week, said in its latest report that as of the week ending Dec. 10, dollar sales in the first six weeks of the holiday retail season were lagging the prior-year period by 4%.Brick-and-mortar traffic fell about 10% at stores through Dec. 17, according to Prodco Retail Traffic Index.One saving grace for brick-and-mortar locations: Christmas Eve — also the start of Hanukkah this year — was on a Saturday, while Dec. 26 was also a day off.The issues that faced retailers in 2016 are likely to continue to face them in 2017, without much abatement. Perkins highlighted the ongoing shift to online and mobile spending, a consumer taste for experiences instead of products, high promotional activity and a ""hollowing out"" of the middle class that leaves less disposable income on the table.And, of course, Amazon's insistent gains. On top of Prime shipping and Prime Video, the company's smart-home device, Alexa, can help Prime members place orders.""(Alexa) cuts retailer out of the equation for consumers that are pressed for time,"" he said.Upper-tier malls — the kind that house Tiffanys (TIF) and Louis Vuittons and Shake Shacks (SHAK) — are expected to continue to perform well enough. But the average mall might still see some individual stores close up shop, say experts, unless they go out of their way to attract more foot traffic.""Mid-tier malls are going to need to step up their game"" with restaurants, movie theaters and lifestyle stores, said NPD's Cohen, adding that ""the food court won't be good enough.""Simon Property Group (SPG), a major mall operator, has tumbled 24% over the last five months, sinking Wednesday to the lowest level in nearly 16 months.That young people are doing more mobile shopping and are craving experiences is no surprise. But how retailers respond may foreshadow the brick-and-mortar industry's fate.Wal-Mart (WMT) investments (which include its e-commerce efforts) may weigh on short-term income growth but lead to foreseeable rewards in the future, said Perkins, whose store checks found that Wal-Mart has been ""one of the busier stores"" this season.In 2017, the top-performers list should feature some familiar names, by Perkins' estimate. Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW) are ""two of the strongest performers in retail."" He also sees off-price trio TJX (TJX), Ross Stores (ROST) and Burlington (BURL) continuing to do well, as well as Ulta Beauty (ULTA), which is ""obviously a standout player.""Home improvement, off-price and beauty all involve some element of in-store necessity: looking for just the right part, digging through bargain racks and trying on new makeup brands are usually best done in person.Department stores have had a choppy year, though Nordstrom (JWN) frequently gets a shout-out from analysts for being an ""omnichannel"" retailer that knows how to engage its customers across platforms. And unlike Macy's or Kohl's (KSS), which compete ""with Amazon and everyone else on the internet,"" says Morningstar's Weishaar, Nordstrom has differentiated itself by catering to more affluent shoppers with a highly curated selection.""If you go to Amazon and type in 'red dress,' you're going to get literally hundreds of pages of results to sift through that (are) not useful,"" she said. ""If you go to Nordstrom, you're going to get 10 (products in line with) your price points and brands.""Even so, Nordstrom was recently handed a downgrade from JPMorgan after the department store's management team said brick-and-mortar levels hadn't been that bad since 1972.In the future, being omnichannel might not be enough, particularly in a world increasingly populated by Alexa and Google Home devices.Retail ""omnipresence"" is key, said NPD's Cohen.That is, instead of simply giving customers a way to buy products both in-store and online, it would behoove retailers to latch onto shoppers before, during and after the transaction, he said. Educate them and anticipate their needs ahead of potential transactions, allow them different ways to buy, then stay in touch via product reviews or other methods following the purchase.The goal, said Cohen, is ""that the store becomes the epicenter for the entire process.""RELATED:Amazon's Top Selling Holiday Products Came From ...

8,SPG,"U.S. stock indexes battled to overcome turbulence midday Wednesday after a slew of issues suffered bearish gap-down moves at the open.The Nasdaq itself gapped down as much as 0.7% and then backfilled the gap to a 0.3% loss. The early dunking took the composite back to its 50-day line, where it found support and bounced up. The S&P 500 was flat, while the Dow Jones industrial average advanced 0.3%.Volume in the stock market today was running modestly higher on both major exchanges compared to the previous session.An unusually high number of blue chip stocks suffered gap downs at the open. A gap down occurs when a stock opens and stays below the lowest price in the previous day's range. In the S&P 100, which is comprised of the biggest blue chips in the S&P 500, a dozen stocks gapped down. This is unusual for conservative stocks.S&P 100 gap downs included Simon Property Group (SPG), Apple (AAPL), and home-improvement chain Lowe's (LOW).Some of the early gap downs reversed to fill in all or part of the gap as the session continued.IBD'S TAKE: The gap downs ought to make individual investors think twice before buying a stock, but Northrop Grumman gapped up into a buy zone Wednesday.In some cases, the negative reactions seemed a bit excessive. Dow transports member Southwest Airlines (LUV) gapped down 11% in torrid volume despite earnings that topped the consensus estimate by about 6%. Revenue fell shy of expectations by 0.6%, and guidance was weak. The company said it expected Q4 unit revenue to decline 4% to 5%.A strong market might have shrugged off the negatives and focused on the earnings beat, or at least contained the damage. But this market is clearly under pressure.Growth stocks also suffered gap downs. Medical-device maker Edwards Lifesciences (EW) was off 13%; online food delivery service provider GrubHub (GRUB), 8%; pizza chain Papa John's (PZZA), 4%; surgical products firm Zimmer Biomet (ZBH), 3%; internet content company Line (LN), 6% and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), 8%.RELATEDChanging Focus Helps Coca-Cola Beat Earnings EstimatesWhy Does Wall Street Like Clinton?

9,SPG,"Real estate investment trusts were big winners for much of the year, as investors sought out juicy payouts in a world of low or even negative interest rates. But with bond yields rising amid growing expectations of a Federal Reserve rate hike, property REITs such as Store Capital (STOR) and Simon Property Group (SPG) are selling off.REITs get special tax treatment as long as they pass on nearly all earnings to investors. Many pay attractive yields and in the low-interest world they've also delivered significant share price appreciation. But the stocks peaked a few months ago, with many REIT stocks breaking their 50-day moving averages or their 200-day lines in recent days.IBD'S TAKE: Fed rate hike talk is sinking REITs and utilities, but it's giving a boost to financials. See which big bank stocks have joined JPMorgan Chase in a buy zone this week.Store Capital is the only property REIT in the IBD 50. Store — an acronym for Single Tenant Operational Real Estate — focuses on single-occupant commercial real estate. Earnings growth has been strong, with a 4.1% dividend yield.But shares fell below the 50-day moving average last week. Store Capital sank 3.75% to close at 27.49 on the stock market today, hitting the lowest levels since late June.Simon Property Group owns many malls. That's a tough business with many retailers slashing stores in the face of competition from Amazon (AMZN).Simon Property fell below its 50-day moving average in early August, and found resistance at that line over the next several weeks. Recently shares have crumbled, tumbling through the 200-day line on Monday. Shares closed down 1.6% at 195.72, and are off 5.5%% so far this week.Crown Castle (CCI) and American Tower (AMT) are both REITs that own cellphone towers used by telecoms.Crown Castle has been trading below its 50-day line since early August, with a couple of exceptions. Shares fell 2% Wednesday, through its 200-day line. Crown Castle hasn't closed below that key level since early February.American Tower plunged below its 50-day on Sept. 9. It tried to retake that line on Friday but reversed lower. Shares have plunged 5% so far this week to a 3-month low, including 2.9% on Wednesday, heading for the 200-day line.Public Storage (PSA) owns self-storage facilities across the country. Shares peaked in April, then decisively undercut the 50-day and 200-day lines in late July. Public Storage has continued to fall. Shares slid 1.8% Wednesday afternoon, hitting a 52-week low.RELATED:Real Estate Is Newest S&P Sector

10,SPG,"Investing in real estate may help to build a strong foundation in your investment portfolio. These securities diversify portfolios, generate income and hold potential for capital growth -- a trifecta of benefits for ETF investors.And several REIT exchange traded funds may be poised for a sizable rally, having found support around their 200-day moving averages after a recent pullback. They include Vanguard REIT (VNQ), iShares U.S. Real Estate (IYR) and Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE), which are among the five largest funds in the sector.Real estate debuted as the 11th S&P 500 sector Monday, commanding a roughly 3% weighting in the large-cap index. It's a timely move, given the performance and popularity of REIT exchange traded funds with investors in 2016.As a stand-alone sector, REITs will gain added visibility that may serve to further increase asset flows into this asset class, says Adam Patti, CEO of IndexIQ, the firm behind IQ US Real Estate Small Cap ETF (ROOF). Active managers, many of whom underweighted real estate when it was part of the financial sector, may be forced to adjust.Demand for U.S. real estate securities held strong ahead of the industry's elevation as a new S&P 500 sector. Investors poured $1.33 billion into real estate ETFs in August, following $1.60 billion in July, according to Morningstar data.""The popularity of REIT ETFs persisted last month"" even as other yield-focused ETFs, such as rate-sensitive telecom services and utilities, saw significant outflow, Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research for S&P Global Market Intelligence, wrote Sept. 13.On the stock market today, VNQ showed bullish momentum, extending Wednesday's gains from the Federal Reserve's decision to leave interest rates unchanged in September. The Fed left the door open to hikes later this year. Several other REIT ETFs showed similar action.Investors in REITs should monitor interest rates closely. Lower rates typically make it easier to buy, sell and refinance property, which boosts demand for real estate. Conversely, the sector tends to sell off when rates trend up.IBD'S TAKE: Recent changes to a widely used classification system for equities could significantly impact how fund investors allocate resources.Among real estate ETFs, Vanguard's VNQ dominates in terms of net inflow so far this year, raking in $5.75 billion through August. The $34.83 billion ETF holds traditional real estate such as self-storage company Public Storage (PSA) and health care REIT Welltower (HCN).By comparison, its iShares rival IYR also holds newer ""specialty REITs"" focused on timber, communications or other areas. They include American Tower (AMT) and Crown Castle (CCI), former telecoms that have restructured as REITs, Rosenbluth noted.And the young XLRE invests exclusively in S&P 500 components. This ETF launched in late 2015 in anticipation of the landmark change to the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) -- a taxonomy for equities -- that carved out real estate from financials as a stand-alone sector.XLRE swelled from a few hundred million in assets to $2.82 billion as the GICS changes took effect this month. The five largest real estate ETFs skew toward big REITs like Simon Property Group (SPG) and Vornado Realty (VNO).IndexIQ describes ROOF as the only way for investors to gain access to the small-cap segment of REITs and real estate holding companies. It invests across the commercial, residential and specialized REIT sectors.The ETF is relatively small in assets and thinly traded, but has vaulted over the five largest funds so far in 2016.ROOF jumped 16.2% on the stock market year to date through Sept. 21. By comparison, VNQ gained 11.8% over the same period, XLRE 6.8%, and ETFs tracking the S&P 500 7.5%.Index IQ's Patti thinks ""REITs still have room to run"" because they got hit fairly hard in 2015. Funds holding smaller REITs may offer an especially attractive opportunity for investors.Small caps as a group provide higher dividend yield than large caps, according to Patti. ROOF currently has a 12-month yield of 3.80% and VNQ 3.27%.The former invests in the bottom 10% of the domestic REIT market in terms of market capitalization, while filtering out the smallest and most illiquid names. Patti described ROOF's 67 stock holdings as ""hidden gems"" that are underowned and offer attractive relative value. They include First Industrial (FR).Added flow of money to real estate as a new sector could further extend valuations for large caps, while reducing their dividend yield, according to Patti. That dividend income is a big reason why investors seek out REITs in the first place. Real estate investment trusts generate yield by distributing 90% of their earnings as dividends.""The reality is if you're investing in REITs for yield and diversification, you should look at small caps,"" Patti said. He suggests that investors carve out 15% of their overall REIT exposure for the small caps in ROOF.RELATED:The First New S&P 500 Sector Since 1999 Is A Big Deal For InvestorsWith Yields As High As 10%, Real Estate Funds Drum Up Assets And AppealKey Debut For Real Estate Is A Big Opportunity For ETF InvestorsMeet The First New Sector SPDR ETFs In 17 Years

11,SPG,"While exchange traded funds are ideal for producing short- and long-term investment gains, many ETFs can be deployed to generate steady income from stock dividends and bond interest.ETF investment strategies for generating income fall into five main categories:The highest yielding U.S. bond ETF tracked by Morningstar Inc. right now is SPDR Barclays High Yield Bond (JNK). Its 12- month yield sits near 6%. It's followed by First Trust Tactical High Yield (HYLS) yielding 5.6% and SPDR Short-Term High Yield Bond ETF (SJNK) yielding 5.5%.But seeing a fat yield on an ETF can be misleading. A big payout doesn't mean as much if the fund's total return is slipping. JNK has returned 11.31% year to date and an average annual 2.53% the past three years. That compares with 7.16% and 4.13% for HYLS and 10.8% and 1.64% for SJNK.Ranked by three-year returns, the top performer is Pimco 25+ Year Zero Coupon U.S. Treasury (ZROZ), up an average annual 18.39% the past three years and 20.44% year to date, and yielding just over 2%. It is followed by Vanguard Extended Duration Treasury (EDV), up 17.1% and 18.6% over the respective periods, and yielding 2.4%. Next is iShares 20 Year Treasury Bond, at 11.8% and 13.1%, and yielding 2.2%.Junk bonds and long-duration Treasury bonds are subject to bouts of heightened volatility, which investors looking for income often seek to avoid. So they're better off using ETFs that track these kinds of bonds as part of a diversified portfolio that contains steadier bonds.The benchmark for diversified bond portfolios is the Barclays Aggregate Bond index, which is made up of a broad array of investment-grade bonds. The index is tracked by iShares Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Fund (AGG), which has $190 billion in assets. It's up 5% year to date and an average annual 3.96% the past three years. It yields 2.3%.Those who prefer bonds need to be aware that anticipated interest-rate hikes could affect potential returns.In general, bond ETFs with higher durations will be more negatively impacted than those with shorter durations as expectations increase for higher rates. Duration is a measure of the sensitivity of bond price to changes in interest rates. Duration is tied to a bond's maturity, or the date at which the bond's principal is repaid to lenders. Investors can check an ETF's website for the average duration.For example, if rates rise, a long-term ETF such as iShares 20 Year Treasury (TLT) incurs more interest rate risk than iShares 3-7 Year Treasury (IEI), notes Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF Research at S&P Global Market Intelligence.""In short, if rates trend higher over time, returns for bond ETFs will be negatively impacted, but not equally,"" he said. ""However, one rate hike by the Fed should not be that impactful.""The highest yielding ETFs can bring big payouts, but if the quality of their holdings declines, the total return could be sapped by declining prices in unfavorable markets. The top yielding dividend stock ETF is Global X SuperDividend Alternatives (ALTY), paying out 8.2% of its stock price annually. It's a small, young ETF with just $3 million in assets and without a three-year record. It's up almost 19% this year.Its older and bigger sibling, $807.4 million Global X SuperDividend (SDIV), yields 6.7% and has gained 12% this year and an average annual 11.27% the past three years.High-yield stock investors tend to prefer stocks whose declines are about over. In that way investors can reap big payouts for each dollar invested with the hopes of capital appreciation as the business turns around. Not all ETFs screens for stocks in this way. One that does is Global X SuperDividend U.S. ETF (DIV). Its index methodology screens for stocks that have exhibited low betas relative to the S&P 500 in an effort to produce low-volatility of returns. It's up 9% this year and has risen an average annual 6.8% the past three years. Top holdings include Cone Midstream Partners (CNNX) and Invesco Mortgage Capital (IVR).At the other end of the spectrum, lower yielding ETFs invest in companies that have a long history of increasing dividends. Only top quality companies can increase payouts year after year, and they tend to be in big demand by investors looking for steady capital appreciation. Their stock prices rarely get whacked to the point where they have big yields.Vanguard Dividend Appreciation (VIG) tracks the Nasdaq U.S. Dividend Achievers Select Index. It holds 185 stocks, each of which has grown dividends annually for 10 years or more. It yields 2.1% vs. SPDR S&P 500's (SPY) 2%. Top holdings include Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Microsoft (MSFT) and Pepsi (PEP)ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats (NOBL) holds 50 stocks, a smaller list that reflects a higher barrier to entry -- each holding has raised dividends every year for 25 years or more. It yields 1.8%. Top holdings include Cintas (CTAS), W.W. Grainger (GWW) and S&P Global (SPGI).SPDR S&P Dividend (SDY), which invests in dividend aristocrats from the S&P Composite 1500, has jumped 15% year to date. It yields 2.4%. Top holdings include property REIT HCP (HCP), People's United Financial (PBCT) and Caterpillar (CAT).Safe to say, MLPs are best left to the pros who know when to get in or out, or how to use them as portfolio diversifiers.Morningstar tracks 20 REIT ETFs. The top-performing one year to date is Global X SuperDividend REIT (SRET). It's up 27.4% this year and yields about 8%, the third-highest. The index it tracks, the Solactive Global SuperDividend REIT index, invests in 30 of the highest dividend-yielding REITs in the world with the least amount of volatility.Nearly all of the $33 million ETF's assets are invested in North America. Top holdings include mortgage REITs Annaly Capital Management (NLY), which yields 10.1%, and Chimera Investment (CIM), yielding nearly 12%, as well as property REIT Senior Housing Properties Trust (SNH) yielding 6.6%. The REIT was launched in March 2015.The biggest REIT ETF is $35.59 billion Vanguard REIT (VNQ). It's up 14% year to date and yields 3.3%. Its top holdings along with their year-to-date price performance include Simon Property (SPG), up 12%, Public Storage[ticker symb=PSA] down 7%, and Prologis (PLD) up 30%. They all yield about 3%.Convertible bonds are bonds that can be exchanged for a set number of the issuing company's common stock. They tend to carry lower interest than normal corporate bonds but have the potential for greater price appreciation.The top performing ETF in this area year to date is $471 million VanEck Vectors Preferred Securities ex Financials (PFXF). It's up 12% and yields 5.6%. The largest is $17.86 billion iShares U.S. Preferred Stock (PFF). It's up 3.8% this year and yields 5.74%.RELATED:The Latest ETF News

13,SPG,"Major index-tracking ETFs traded lower in the afternoon session, giving back solid early gains in tandem with oil prices. Investors have their sights trained on the two-day Fed policy meeting that starts tomorrow.Real estate on Monday made its debut as the newest S&P 500 sector, the first new sector since 1999.The others are energy, materials, industrials, consumer discretionary, consumer staples, health care, financials, information technology, telecommunication services and utilities.The change reflects the popularity of real estate investment trusts (REITs) with investors. Real estate now accounts for roughly 3.1% of the large-cap S&P 500's $18.959 trillion market cap vs. 0.19% at the end of 2001.As a result of the change, the financial sector sees its weight in the S&P 500 come down to roughly 12.8%. Equity REITs were carved out of financials to become the new real estate sector, although mortgage REITs remain within financials.Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE) added 0.6% in late trading Monday.

Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE) was down the most, by 2.8%.Comments from Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, traditionally seen as a dovish policymaker, fueled negative sentiment.

16,SPG,"Real estate securities continue to shore up their popularity with ETF investors, with demand for these income-producing assets accelerating in recent months.Vanguard REIT (VNQ) saw $860.4 million net inflow in the month ended July 25 to take its asset haul this year to $4.12 billion, according to analytics firm XTF.com. Investors have poured fresh money into VNQ every month since the February stock market pullback, including $1.33 billion in June alone.In search of yield, investors are favoring real estate investment trusts (REITs), according to Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research for S&P Global Market Intelligence. These companies own and operate income-producing properties such as shopping malls and warehouses. They typically pay out 90% of their taxable income as dividends to shareholders. It doesn't hurt either that REITs as a group are inwardly focused at a time when Japan and Europe are wracked with a negative or uncertain market outlook.""Investors sought out securities offering stable income with limited exposure to non-U.S. markets,"" Rosenbluth wrote in a July 19 note. He noted that many actively managed mutual funds have also been buying this asset class ahead of the elevation of real estate as a new S&P 500 GICS sector in September.With $35.96 billion in assets, VNQ is not only the largest REIT exchange traded fund, but also the largest ETF investing in U.S. sector equities.It offers low-cost and diversified exposure to the real estate markets. Its 0.12% expense ratio makes it one of the cheapest options around.VNQ focuses on equity REITs -- firms that manage various commercial properties -- and shuts out mortgage REITs and specialty REITs.The property REIT group ranks No. 39 out of 197 industry groups tracked by IBD; the mortgage REIT group ranks No. 95.The Vanguard real estate ETF's top three holdings out of 150 are Simon Property Group (SPG), Public Storage (PSA) and Welltower (HCN). VNQ yields 3.3%.REIT ETFs average a 4.5% yield. That equity income is a big draw for investors at a time when bond rates are mired at historic lows. But Kevin Mahn, president of Hennion & Walsh Asset Management, likes them just as much for their growth potential and relatively low correlation with stocks and bonds.""REITs continue to fly under the radar"" of many investors, Mahn told IBD in a phone interview. VNQ has jumped 17% on the stock market so far in 2016 vs. a 7% gain for SPDR S&P 500 (SPY).Mahn maintains a small allocation to REITs in client portfolios and is bullish on the sector. ""REITs have historically shown they can fare well, even in the face of rising interest rates,"" he said.The fear of rising rates was a headwind for the sector in 2015. But Mahn noted that higher rates driven by economic growth and job growth can be a plus. When people have more money to spend, retail REITs like Simon benefit. When more Americans are working, and earning more, health care REITs like Welltower gain.Mahn invests in REITs for both attractive income and ""good, strong total return characteristics."" CoreSite Realty (COR), a highly rated IBD stock, has jumped 74% over the past year on the back of consistent profit and sales growth. The REIT operates nationwide data centers -- a booming business as companies migrate key operations to the cloud. CoreSite releases its Q2 results Thursday.IBD'S TAKE: Mortgage REITs hold no real estate and are vulnerable to interest-rate hikes. However, the outlook for rates is murky, and the Federal Reserve may have boxed itself in on monetary policy.When choosing an ETF, Mahn looks first for ""an index that is recognized and established."" Vanguard REIT, iShares U.S. Real Estate (IYR) and SPDR Dow Jones REIT (RWR) are among the funds that make that cut.A younger rival, Schwab U.S. REIT (SCHH), offers a rock-bottom 0.07% expense ratio. Among 20-odd options, iShares Mortgage Real Estate Capped (REM) offers the highest yield at 10.6%.

20,SPG,"According to U.S. mall landlords, the rumors of the death of brick-and-mortar retail are greatly exaggerated.“There is no question there is a lot of change,” Taubman Centers Chief Operating Officer Bill Taubman said in an interview at the International Council of Shopping Centers annual convention, which was held in Las Vegas this past week. “But retail has always been about evolution. Someone is always bemoaning the change in the market and how it’s impacting things.”Bleak earnings forecasts from department-store companies, including Macy’s (M) and Nordstrom (JWN), along with bankruptcy filings by firms such as Sports Authority and teen-clothing chain Aeropostale, have rattled investors in retail landlords. A Bloomberg index of regional mall landlords, which includes the shares of Taubman Centers (TCO) and Simon Property Group (SPG), has dropped almost 8% recently, double the decline in the broader Bloomberg Real Estate Investment Trust Index.Retailers are being hurt by the rise of Internet shopping, changes in consumer tastes and declining visits to big-city shopping districts by tourists deterred by the strong dollar. Retail rents on Madison Avenue in Manhattan have fallen to $1,644 a square foot on average, down 3% from last year, according to a report this month by the Real Estate Board of New York.Sales have suffered this year at malls that rely on shoppers from Europe and Latin America, said Taubman, whose properties include high-end destinations such as the Mall at Short Hills in New Jersey and Beverly Center in Los Angeles. Spending by travelers from China hasn’t dropped off much, he said.Despite the turmoil, demand for space has held up, Kimco Realty (KIM) Chief Executive Officer Conor Flynn said during a panel discussion at the Las Vegas convention. New Hyde Park, N.Y.-based Kimco is adding more grocery stores to anchor its shopping centers, a reliable source of business, he said.The market will get more clarity on retailers’ demand for space when Sports Authority auctions off its stores, Flynn said. Once the largest U.S. sporting-goods retailer, the company filed for bankruptcy in March after saddling itself with $643 million of debt.“We are watching shadow supply,” Flynn said. “We don’t want a shock to the system where there is a ton of square-footage coming online at the same time.”Plenty of retailers are thriving, said Matt Lougee, a senior vice president at DDR (DDR), a company that owns shopping centers across the U.S. Lougee cited TJX (TJX), the owner of discounters T.J. Maxx and Marshalls that last week boosted its earnings forecast, as an example of a company that is benefiting from the shift away from full-price apparel. The perception that lost revenue is all going online isn’t accurate, he said.“Those dollars are going somewhere,” Lougee said in an interview in Las Vegas. “They went to a different channel, not necessarily the Internet.”Property owners in the retail business will always have to contend with filling empty stores as part of the normal course of business, Vereit (VER) Chief Executive Officer Glenn Rufrano said on a panel in Las Vegas.“Retailers will always lose space, not because they are retailers, but because they are bad merchants,” he said.Related: Dollar Tree, Discount Retailers Dominate New-Highs ListWal-Mart Re-Thinks Small Format Strategy As Dollar Stores SwarmSluggish Retail Sales?

21,SPG,"Real estate investment trusts are proving worthy of some serious Tubmans, as President Obama recently put it.Several REIT ETFs bolted to new highs on the stock market today, making last week's run-up seem like a prelude to bigger moves.The asset class is proving to be a foundational piece for investors' portfolios in an unsettled stock market. It offers both attractive yields and solid fundamentals.An allocation to real estate can substantially improve risk-adjusted returns, experts say. REITs tend to have lower beta -- a measure of volatility -- than the broad stock market. Plus, their tasty dividends boost total returns when capital growth in stocks is hard to come by.Income-yielding utilities and real estate ETFs have drawn roughly $7 billion in fresh assets in 2016 through May 6, according to Mizuho Securities. Technology and health care exchange traded funds, respectively, saw $10 billion and $5.9 billion in net outflow over the same period.Here is a look at three REIT ETFs showing leadership in terms of both price performance and inflow of new money:VNQ holds $31.91 billion in assets, has a 0.12% expense ratio and yields 4.32%. It's one of the oldest and cheapest options in its segment.The fund holds 150 mostly equity REITs, including Simon Property Group (SPG) and Public Storage (PSA).California-based Public Storage, an IBD 50 stock, has a 97 Composite Rating out of a best-possible 99. It has grown revenue 9% a year over the past three years. Its dividend has grown at a 15% annual pace over the past three to five years.VNQ tracks the MSCI U.S. REIT Index, which requires holdings meet certain liquidity and size requirements. Companies are weighted by their free-float-adjusted market cap. It shuts out mortgage REITs and specialty REITs, such as timber and prisons, according to investment research firm Morningstar. The index rebalances quarterly.Investors are liking REITs more and more as the odds of a near-term rate hike grow less and less. Higher bond yields can dent the appeal of utilities and REITs' dividends by comparison.VNQ has absorbed $2.26 billion in investor money while surging 8.6% so far in 2016.It has less exposure to small-cap and midcap stocks than does VNQ. However, the two funds have significant holdings overlap.RWR also excludes specialty and mortgage REITs.The returns on REITs come from a combination of rental income and property appreciation, says Morningstar analyst Robert Goldsborough.""Many of these firms use leverage, which can magnify the gains and losses from fluctuations in the value of their properties,"" he said. REITs are a capital-intensive business. The use of debt to finance operations and acquisitions also makes them sensitive to interest rates.RWR has $3.66 billion in assets, a 0.25% expense ratio and a 3.73% yield.The ETF absorbed $214.5 million in net inflow over the first four months of 2016. It has gained 6.7% year to date.""As most REIT ETFs use similar methodology and perform almost identically, price is an important factor when choosing an ETF,"" writes Goldsborough.SCHH holds $2.23 billion in assets and yields 2.45%. Its 0.07% expense ratio is the lowest in this segment.Its low-cost edge has helped SCHH outperform peers that track the same index by roughly the difference in their expense ratios, Goldsborough said.RWR soaked $122.7 million in net inflow in 2016 through April's end. It has risen 6.8% so far in 2016.
"
22,SPG,"Real estate investment trusts are preparing for a surge of attention as they get their own grouping in major U.S. stock indexes. Their first task: educating investors who have no idea how to evaluate the industry.The companies -- which own properties such as apartment complexes, hotels, office towers and shopping malls -- are tweaking their disclosures, adding glossaries to their earnings statements and reaching out to investors to break free of the reputation of REITs as a quirky niche. The new industry classifications, which take effect in September, will separate real estate stocks from financials and make them their own category.The separate grouping means REITs will lure more generalists, defined as any money manager that doesn’t specialize in the area. The trouble is, such investors have little background in an industry that favors measures such as funds from operations or net asset value. Generalist funds are underinvested in REITs relative to their benchmarks by roughly $100 billion, in part because some of the concepts underpinning their analysis are unheard of elsewhere on Wall Street, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) analysts wrote in a note this month.“Everyone has shopped in a mall or lived in an apartment or driven past a warehouse,” said Alexander Goldfarb, an analyst at Sandler O’Neill & Partners in New York. “It should be really easy to understand, but it becomes very complicated because of the terminology.”While REITs have been around since the 1960s, the industry ballooned following the real estate bust in the 1990s as cash-strapped companies turned to public markets when private funding dried up. The trusts are being carved out into their own category by S&P Global’s S&P Dow Jones indexes and MSCI (MSCI) after a surge in valuations. Equity REIT market capitalization more than doubled to $886 billion from 2007 to 2015, according to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts.The property companies now make up about 3% of the S&P 500 Index. With the new classification, money managers who track benchmark gauges will be adjusting their portfolios to include REIT stocks. Cohen & Steers (CNS) estimates $100 billion will flow into the shares.REITs began taking steps in their first-quarter earnings reports to make it easier for fund managers who aren’t versed in the industry’s idiosyncratic lingo to understand their business. Equity Residential (EQR), the apartment owner taken public by billionaire Sam Zell in 1993, introduced a list of key terms and definitions.The Chicago-based landlord reached out to a broader pool of investors to prepare for the new classification about a year ago, and found that investors who hadn’t bought REIT shares didn’t find commonly cited measures such as per-square-foot rent helpful in understanding earnings power, said Chief Financial Officer Mark Parrell.Equity Residential added the glossary so investors who have never looked at a real estate company before can make some sense of its financial statements, he said. The landlord also changed its investor presentation to start with thematic topics such as the preference for urban living rather than diving straight into detailed data on its properties, he said.“This doesn’t mean we won’t communicate to our real estate investors,” Parrell said. “It’s important for us to be bilingual.”It’s easy for a novice in any industry to get tripped up by jargon, but REIT jargon is particularly hard for the uninitiated. For example, analysts eschew the familiar measure of earnings per share when gauging REIT performance. Instead, they look at a company’s funds from operations, or FFO, which excludes items such as the cost of depreciation. That’s because while a telecommunications company can expect its fiber optic cables to lose value over time, an office landlord expects the value of its properties to rise.“Unless you own really bad buildings, real estate tends to hold its value or appreciate over time,” said Sandler O’Neill’s Goldfarb. “Depreciation isn’t really a factor.”In order to get at just how much all those buildings are worth, analysts and investors work out a company’s NAV, or net asset value. It’s one of the most important calculations for understanding the intrinsic value of a REIT, and something generalists who might not know the real estate market could wrestle with, Goldfarb said.At shopping-center owner Kimco Realty (KIM), the glossary was moved to the front of the company’s first-quarter financial disclosures to make them easier for investors to digest, according to David Bujnicki, a senior vice president at the New Hyde Park, N.Y.-based company. Previously, it was buried in the back, he said. In addition to FFO, disoriented investors can look up ABR (annualized base rent), GLA (gross leasable area) and economic occupancy, too.“Real estate has its own vernacular,” said Owen Thomas, chief executive officer of Boston Properties (BXP), which owns stakes in marquee real estate including Manhattan’s General Motors Building and San Francisco’s Embarcadero Center. “Once an investor takes the time to learn the terminology, I think it can be understood relatively quickly.”Boston Properties is extending its investor-relations efforts to include more dialogue with managers who oversee broader portfolios, Thomas said.Yet it may be a precarious moment to jump into real estate. Commercial-property prices are flattening after six years of record-shattering growth, hurt by concerns ranging from slumping oil prices to slowing economic growth in China.REIT shares have taken a hit recently on speculation that the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates again as soon as June. Higher rates increase the companies’ borrowing costs and diminish the attractiveness of their dividend yield.Simon Property Group (SPG) -- the largest REIT, with a market value of about $60 billion -- is “very focused” on soliciting new investors, said Les Morris, a spokesman for the Indianapolis-based mall owner.“We do feel this is an opportunity for us as these investors are focused on cash flow growth, earnings and dividend growth, and strong balance sheet metrics, which plays to our strengths,” Morris said in an emailed statement.Meeting face-to-face is crucial in getting generalist investors comfortable, said Kimco’s Bujnicki. The company, credited with jump-starting the modern REIT era with its initial public offering in 1991, has set a goal to schedule half of its meetings at conferences and on road trips with non-REIT fund managers, he said.“The idea for us is to get in front of these investors and start to get face time,” Bujnicki said.Related:REITs Attract Investor Interest In Volatile MarketHealth-Care REITs: A Dividend Play On An Aging PopulationHotel REITS Offer Hefty Yields, But Not All Are Equal

23,SPG,"Powered by robust demand and lean supply, high-end mall owners and quality shopping center operators are primed to perform in 2015.They are riding the crest of a stronger economy and healthy consumer spending climate, and are now luring shoppers with enhanced services and experiences.The bright prospects come at a time when the stars are also aligned for the retail industry.""Retailers are heading into 2015 with the most momentum they've had since the Great Recession,"" Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, told IBD.A healthy consumer spending climate at retail would bode well for big mall owners such as Simon Property Group (SPG), Macerich (MAC), General Growth Properties (GGP), and Taubman Centers (TCO) as well as community and neighborhood shopping center operator and owner Kimco Realty (KIM), all of which benefit when their tenants get more financially fit.Malls And The MarketRetail mall real estate investment trusts are part of IBD's Finance-Property REIT industry group, and several get high Composite Ratings. Out of a possible 99, Kimco Realty has a 98, Simon Property Group a 91 and General Growth Properties an 87, factoring in metrics such as earnings growth and stock-price gains.All three have run up in the stock market. Kimco Realty shares rose 27% in 2014 and are up 11% this year. General Growth Properties jumped 40% in 2014 and is up 9% in 2015. Simon Property Group lifted 27% in 2014 and is up 11% this year.Macro tailwinds should help malls this year.""There should be a lot of momentum with the (stronger) economy and (lower) energy prices,"" Ryan Severino, senior economist for commercial real estate tracker Reis (REIS), told IBD via email. ""The decline in energy should add billions in spending. Some of that will accrue to malls. The real question is how much and will that be enough to offset the impact of store closings?""The top firms should still be regional mall REITs that focus on ""A"" malls — those that sell the most per square foot and tend toward more upscale retailers and trade areas — real estate experts say.""Class A malls should continue to have low vacancy and strong rent growth (in 2015),"" said Severino. ""But for the remainder of the subsector, vacancy could actually rise, and rent growth will probably accelerate only slightly.""At year end, the national mall vacancy rate was 8%, up 10 basis points for in 2014. Rents grew by 1.8% during that year, says Severino. He forecasts that in 2015, rents should grow by roughly 2% to 2.5%.But the national vacancy rate is not likely to change much in 2015 as store closures will offset rising demand and the outlook for lower-caliber malls ""is murkier,"" he said. ""Although a strengthening recovery in the economy and labor market, coupled with a decline in energy prices, should bolster the subsector, this will compete against the store closings (in lower-caliber malls) of some important retailers such asJ.C. Penney (JCP) and Sears (SHLD).""Class A OverachieversStifel Nicolaus analyst Nathan Isbee is also upbeat about prospects for ""A"" malls. ""Retailer demand for high-quality mall space will remain robust in 2015 from international and domestic retailers,"" he wrote in a report, calling high-quality mall space is ""extremely limited.""General Growth Properties is his top regional mall pick for 2015. The REIT focuses exclusively on owning, managing, leasing and redeveloping Class A regional malls and urban flagship locations in the U.S., spokesman Kevin Berry told IBD.He says the firm believes that owning these retail properties positions it well for the long term.Generally, he adds, the properties' leases have ten-year terms with annual contractual increases in rent. ""On average, 10% of the leases expire,"" he said. ""The majority of the annual revenue (is) in place when the year begins.""General Growth Properties' strategy since Sandeep Mathrani became CEO in 2011 has been the creation of a redevelopment/expansion pipeline of projects, Berry says. As of Dec. 31, the firm had development and redevelopment activities totaling about $2.4 billion ""at share,"" of which projects totaling about $418 million have opened, $1.2 billion are under construction and $825 million are in the pipeline.Redevelopment is all tenant driven, says Berry. General's largest redevelopment project is at Ala Moana Center in Honolulu, which it is expanding with a new luxury wing anchored by Bloomingdale's and Nordstrom (JWN). General also focuses on improving the shopping experience by adding options such as movie theaters and restaurants, which give shoppers more reasons to come to the malls and spend time.""Mall vacancies in the U.S. are currently at a five-year low of 5.7% and at 5.5% for just the major markets,"" said Greg Maloney, CEO of the Americas Retail Group at commercial real estate firm Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL), citing real estate data company CoStar as the source.He says that malls are going into 2015 with probably the best fundamentals seen in the past five years.""Liquidity and appetite for product has been here for a few years, but now consumers are feeling much better about the economy, and that is the driving force,"" he adds. ""We now have positive momentum. Retailers are looking to expand with new stores, and there's a renewed interest in terms of retailers looking for new space.""He says that there's some new mall development for the first time in a long time, including three or four projects that JLL is doing.Isbee notes that shopping center REIT fundamentals are ""healthy as occupancies are approaching or exceeding pre-recession levels.""Kimco Realty is among REITs he rates a buy. It operates North America's largest publicly traded portfolio of neighborhood and community shopping centers. CEO David Henry calls fundamentals for such shopping centers strong. ""We've been very fortunate that there's been no new building of shopping centers for six years,"" he told IBD.While the supply of centers hasn't grown, the U.S. population has grown at between 2.5 million and 3 million people a year. And the need for restaurants, grocers, dry cleaners and other businesses has grown with the population.""That's why occupancies are moving up and all the vital signs are looking good for shopping centers,"" he said, adding that shopping centers are still in ""recovery mode"" and rents not back to all-time highs. But he says Kimco is benefiting from more demand and limited supply.Henry says that occupancy at ""quality"" centers is at 95%, close to Kimco's all-time high of 96% before the recession.Redevelopment Vs. New MallsKimco has been doing a lot of redevelopment, he says, and the best place to invest capital is in its own properties — the value of projects in the pipeline is nearing $1 billion.Most of the new development among the mall REITs has been concentrated on outlet centers, with six opened in 2014, says Isbee.David Ober, president of Global Outlet Management, says that among the reasons behind building more outlet centers is retailers' desire to include outlet stores as a part of their ""omnichannel"" distribution mix along with full-price stores.Still, Garrick Brown, vice president of research at property services firm DTZ, says, ""We are nearing a saturation point"" in outlet center building and adds that there's room for only ""a little more product.""""Everyone wants to jump on this bandwagon to build these because they have performed so well in recent years,"" he said by email. ""But they will probably build too many.""

The deal also makes $10 billion available immediately to shore up Greece's faltering banks, but requires the government to privatize a $55 billion portfolio of assets — most of the proceeds from which will go to repay debt and recapitalize weakened banks.

52,SPG,"Brick by brick, REITs continue to solidify their place within investors' ETF strategies.The industry is relatively young in terms of stock market history. The first real estate investment trusts (REITs) launched in 1960. Continental Mortgage Investors became the first REIT to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1965.Now another seminal moment nears.In September, real estate gets promoted to a standalone sector by index providers S&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI. The change is described as reflecting ""the position of real estate as a distinct asset class and a foundational building block of a modern portfolio, rather than an alternative.”Real estate will join 10 existing sectors.The move does more than raise the profile of REITs. It will significantly change the way that investors conduct sector ETF investing, says Todd Rosenbluth, director of fund research for S&P Global Market Intelligence.For starters, many mutual fund managers benchmarked to the S&P 500 may have to increase their real estate stake. Plus, it is likely to firm real estate's place among the income-oriented and more defensive sectors that investors have flocked to this year.""This creates an opportunity for REITs to do well, as investors and fund managers become more cognizant of their exposures,"" said Rosenbluth.Real estate has a 3.8% share of the S&P Composite 1500 -- more than the 3.3% weighting for materials, 2.5% for telecommunications and 3.7% for utilities, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.However, it is currently lumped within the financial sector, where REITs get dwarfed by big commercial banks, insurers and other financial service firms.The portfolios of most U.S. investors are under-allocated to this asset class, according to investment management firm Gerstein Fisher.""Our research has shown that an allocation to the asset class can substantially improve a portfolio’s risk-adjusted return,"" said Gregg Fisher, the firm’s chief investment officer.REIT companies also tend to be less volatile than the overall financial sector, and that's luring investors in a herky-jerky stock market.Vanguard REIT (VNQ), the largest exchange traded fund in its segment, has jumped 7.4% year to date through May 5. It made a 52-week high of 84.90 Friday as investors discounted the odds of a near-term rate hike following a glum jobs report.Over the first four months of 2016, VNQ saw $2.14 billion in net inflow, more than any other equity sector ETF. Assets have grown to $31.49 billion. It yields 4.3%.By comparison, Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) has given up 2.8% so far in 2016, and assets have shrunk to $16.27 billion. The real estate sector has a 15% weighting within XLF.While offering exposure to the real estate sector, VNQ skews significantly towards midcap stocks, Rosenbluth said.""It's not a perfect bolt-on product"" for an S&P 500 investor who wants to overweight the real estate sector, he said. He finds a new ETF worthy of attention for a more tactical approach to sector investing.Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE) invests in S&P 500 companies. Its top holding out of 27 is mall operator Simon Property Group (SPG).XLRE joined the Select Sector SPDR ETF suite -- popular with tactical sector-based investors -- in 2015, ahead of the planned index changes. XLRE is thinly traded and has a meager $11.3 million in assets, but that could change with the elevation of real estate as a sector.Fidelity MSCI Real Estate (FREL), benchmarked to an MSCI index, also launched in 2015. Like VNQ, it has a midcap tilt. However, these two ETFs have significant differences in holdings and industry exposure.VNQ sold off in 2015, when interest rates were projected to rise. Dividend-paying REITs struggle to compete with other yield-bearing investments in a rising-rate environment.Property REITs rank No. 19 out of 197 industry groups tracked by IBD. They were No. 53 a week ago.

"
55,SPG,"Last year, investors' fears of rising interest rates battered real estate investment trusts, but REIT stocks are on the rise again, as evidenced by market-beating share gains in recent weeks.The Federal Reserve's indication in its policy statement this week that fewer rate hikes were likely this year gave another jolt to REIT shares across the board, from apartment and hotel sectors to industrial properties and shopping malls.Investors tend to shy away from REITs in rising-rate environments because of concern of higher borrowing rates to fund real estate transactions. Since REITs return at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends, operators don't have much excess cash on hand for such purposes.But the Fed statement alone is not the only reason REIT stocks are back in favor, real estate experts say. They cite renewed merger and acquisition activity and increased visibility due to the upcoming breakout of real estate into a separate global industry classification. Plus, federal legislation enacted late last year that reduces taxes on the sale of U.S. real estate by foreign investors may also positively impact REIT stocks.""It's a number of factors, which is often the case when markets change direction,"" said Michael Grupe, executive vice president of research at the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts.China's Anbang Insurance Group isn't a REIT, but its aggressive moves into U.S. real estate ""provide hard evidence that the changes to the (real estate tax) legislation put in place last year may be having a positive effect on REIT stock prices,"" Grupe said.Anbang just upped its bid for Starwood Hotels & Resorts (HOT) to $78 per share from $76 per share, or $13.2 billion.IBD's Finance-Property REIT industry group hit an intraday high of 324.22 Friday, a number not seen since last April and near a 52-week high. The group was up 2.3% for the week and 7% so far this month.The REIT group has risen by around 9% from a month ago and is roughly 16% higher from a trough hit on Feb. 11.Some of the better performers of late have been Avalonbay Communities (AVB), Simon Property Group (SPG) and Rexford Industrial Realty (REXR). Among the highest rated are CubeSmart (CUBE), CoreSite Realty (COR), Store Capital (STOR) and National Storage (NSA).Stock prices in the broader SNL Financial U.S. equity REIT index, which includes all publicly traded equity REITs in the U.S., are up 3.3% this year. REIT prices in the index fell 1.6% last year.""REIT investors don't like it when interest rates rise,"" said Jason Lail, manager of real estate research at S&P Global Market Intelligence, the parent of SNL. ""The market has a knee-jerk reaction to rising rates. The Fed holding off an interest rate hike had a positive impact.""Investors are also following the money. Fund managers and others have started moving more money into REITs ahead of the creation of a new real estate category under the Global Industry Classification Standard, or GICS, which goes into effect after the market close on Aug. 31.""It's getting closer,"" Grupe said of the deadline. ""It's another positive change (for REITs).""Real estate experts estimate that as much as $100 billion of new investment dollars will flow into real estate securities, mostly REITs, as a result of the new real estate sector, though some estimates are far lower.It will be the first new sector class since GICS was formed in 1999 by Standard & Poor's and MSCI Barra. Real estate is currently sheltered within the broader ""financials"" category.""Investors look at depressed share prices and see a good valuation opportunity (in REITs),"" Grupe said.That may be one reason M&A REIT activity, which went quiet in 2007, is revving up. Since 2015, 13 publicly traded REITs announced deals, with total transaction value of $50.9 billion, Lail said. Blackstone (BX) scooped up three REITs last year, and it is now selling its hotel portfolio to Anbang.Brookfield Asset Management (BAM) said in late February it would buy REIT and mall operator Rouse Properties (RSE). A month ago, Weyerhaeuser (WY) acquired Plum Creek Timber.

58,SPG,"UPS (UPS) has acquired a stake in same-day delivery startup called Deliv, shifting it into competition with e-tail giant Amazon.com (AMZN).Palo Alto-based Deliv delivers products from brick-and-mortar retailers to shoppers at their nearby homes -- attempting to figure out an efficient solution to the most expensive part of delivery: the last mile.The $28 million of announced funding brings Deliv's total haul to $40.5 million from funders such as Upfront Ventures, RPM Ventures and mall operators such as General Growth Properties (GGP) and Simon Property Group (SPG). The Wall Street Journal reported that its valuation was unavailable.Deliv has struck deals with Alphabet (GOOGL) subsidiary Google for its Express delivery service, among other clients including several startups.""Same-day is absolutely the new standard. That’s exactly what’s happening in the market. Look what Amazon is doing,"" Deliv CEO Daphne Carmeli told IBD.As part of the funding arrangement, UPS will gain a seat on the Deliv board -- an opportunity to gather intelligence about a business and market it doesn't operate in.Currently UPS only offers same-day delivery for high-margin sectors such as health care. Next-day delivery is available for evening pickups -- customers generally place orders online in the evening when returning from work.“I struggle to understand what it is that I need in less than a few hours,” Rimas Kapeskas, head of UPS’s Strategic Enterprise Fund, told the Wall Street Journal. UPS is specifically interested in Deliv's software that connects it directly with a retailer's website.UPS and Amazon have an uneasy relationship. At the moment Amazon.com is UPS's largest customer but as the e-tailer's delivery costs continue to soar, the company has begun to seek alternatives and is widely rumored to be building its own freight operation.Amazon.com offers free two-day shipping and other perks via it's loyalty program Amazon Prime. The e-tailer offers same-day delivery service via its Prime Now app.On the company's Q4 earnings call, executives characterized the speedy delivery options as very difficult and expensive but said customers love it.To support its various shipping options Amazon has entered the ocean freight shipping business, is rumored to be flying several flights a day from an airfield in Ohio to locations near its fulfillment centers, has bought a fleet of truck trailers, and is leasing a number of Boeing 767 cargo aircraft.But, it's still unclear who is going to crack the code on same-day delivery. It's a complex and expensive business with low margins. Others, such as San Jose-based eBay (EBAY) tried to launch in the U.S. but ultimately ended the pilot program. CEO Devin Wenig said at the time the company had ""mixed results"" for the delivery service.

63,SPG,"Even in a market correction, some stocks will show little or no evidence of frantic institutional selling.This week's Big Cap 20 reflects this truth.Focusing on the upper half of the list, it's apparent that a few stocks are indeed building bases. That's to be expected when the overall market is taking a break.Yet the current action by top-rated companies with market values north of $15 billion is remarkable on two fronts.One, among the stocks that are in a correction of their own, the decline from 52-week or all-time highs so far has not been dramatic.Consider Visa (V), No. 3 in today's list. The world-class provider of credit and debit payment services fell nearly 5% last week in the heaviest weekly turnover since late September.That drop took the stock as much as 8% below a high of 125.35.As IBD's Investor's Corner column points out, the typical cup with handle shows a decline of at least 12% and usually no more than 33%. The flat base features a drop of no more than 15%.Visa's pullback falls within both of these potential patterns. That's a plus.You'd want to avoid those stocks that are falling like a rock. Visa's modest pullback, in contrast, indicates the demand for shares is still relatively healthy.Priceline.com (PCLN) is behaving in a similar fashion.The leading online travel agent recently tested its 10-week moving average (see the accompanying weekly chart), then rallied back above the key support line.At the nadir of the recent drop to 678.04, Priceline was merely 12.5% below its recent high of 774.96.Again, this is an illustration of unenthusiastic institutional selling.Priceline's pullback appears headed toward evolving into a new base. But for now, it's too narrow, time-wise, to qualify as a cup.A cup must be at least six weeks long. A corresponding handle should be at least one week.The mild correction opens the possibility of a flat base forming. But at least five weeks must pass.Two, several other stocks have fallen so mildly that it's hard to say they are base-building yet.They include Yum Brands (YUM), the highly successful operator and franchisor of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell fast-food restaurants.Yum, No. 5 in today's rankings, has rallied 33% from a 56.05 double-bottom-with-handle buy point. Since its late-November breakout, the stock has made only a handful of very mild pullbacks, such as a 4.7% decline from March 27 to April 10. Thanks to a nice gain Monday, it's now just 2% off a 74.44 peak.Dollar General (DG) and Simon Property Group (SPG) have also retreated in similar fashion.

Expectations of a retroactive deal would also ease uncertainty, he added.Dividend StocksOne of the first signs of concern could show up in dividend stocks, because ObamaCare and the fiscal cliff will sharply raise taxes on investment income, said Dan North, North America chief economist at Euler Hermes.Companies like Simon Property Group (SPG), Comcast (CMCSA) and Polaris (PII) have top dividend yields, with Apple (AAPL) set to join them later this year.And when the cliff gets closer, the issue will get bigger and consumers will start to lose confidence too, just as they did during last year's debt debate, he said.But given all the other turmoil going around, fears about the fiscal cliff may not necessarily worsen the picture that much more.General uncertainty has been a drag on businesses, which have been tentative for a while, said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank, adding that he hasn't heard of the fiscal cliff specifically affecting decisions.""It's probably no more uncertain now than it was,"" he said.

87,SPG,"A quick glance at the IPO Leaders making Thursday's issue of IBD is telling. Only four stocks made the screen. The recent correction in the market made it tough for new issues and most other stocks to gain much ground. The four stocks all hail from the same industry group: property REITs. The group ranked No. 26 in Wednesday's IBD…
"
88,SPG,"Do you have some mad money that's looking for a place to work in the stock market? Consider some REITs, which have boosted dividends this year. Likewise, consider sector mutual funds or ETFs that hold them.Why mad money? Because REITs still carry a risk of price declines if investors rotate out of them into higher-paying bonds if the Federal Reserve raises interest rates or the investors anticipate a rate hike.And real estate sector mutual funds as a group have lagged the S&P 500 so far this year through Nov. 5.Still, if you can wait out the storm — assuming that the storm actually passes — dividends paid by several have grown.And that trend might continue, writes Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF & mutual fund research for both S&P Capital IQ and SNL Financial.That makes them attractive to income-hungry investors.""Recent research from SNL Financial reveals that REITs are hiking dividends at a rapid clip,"" Rosenbluth wrote in a report on Monday.One hundred and one, or 45%, of U.S. publicly traded REITs and property companies tracked by SNL real estate analyst Chris Hudgins have raised dividends at least once in the first 10 months of 2015, Rosenbluth reported.That was a faster pace than in prior years. The 101 REITs outnumber the 88 and 92 that increased dividends in the same periods of, respectively, 2013 and 2014, Hudgins' research says.Rosenbluth added: ""This is a pleasant surprise for many investors. The case against REITs is that their relatively high dividend yields (for stocks) will be less appealing as the yield on the 10-year Treasury moves higher as the Federal Reserve prepares to initiate a rate-hike sequence. Yet as Hudgins notes, 12 U.S. REITs and property companies raised their dividends in October, up from seven in September.""S&P Capital IQ likes three of the REITs, based on fundamentals.Here's what Rosenbluth wrote about each, with some updated yield figures: Simon Property Group (SPG) raised its quarterly dividend in late October by 3.2% to $1.60. Simon raised its dividend during all four quarters of 2015, and its annual dividend of $6.40 is 56% higher than it was three years ago.Simon has a 3.1% dividend yield. Crown Castle (CCI) increased its quarterly dividend 7.9% in October, which elevated the wireless-focused specialized REIT's dividend yield to 4.2%, higher than its peers' 3.9%.""CCI began paying dividends in February 2014 as it converted to a REIT, but in 18 months its quarterly dividend has nearly tripled to $0.89 per share,"" Rosenbluth wrote. Duke Realty (DRE), a diversified REIT, raised its dividend 5.9% in October.REIT HoldingsRosenbluth also noted that Duke, Simon and Crown were among the top 25 holdings for iShares U.S. Real Estate ETF (IYR) at the end of October. The ETF has $4.6 billion in assets spread across specialized REITs (24% of assets), retail REITs (20%), residential REITs (15%), office REITs (11%), and others. IYR has a 3.7% yield and a 0.43% expense ratio.Vanguard REIT ETF (VNQ) — the largest REIT ETF, with $26 billion in assets — has large stakes in Simon and Duke. ""It has more exposure to retail and residential REITs but less exposure to specialized REITs,"" Rosenbluth wrote. ""It has an 0.12% expense ratio and a 3.9% yield.""Some mutual funds have exposure to those REITs as well.The $51.5 billion Vanguard REIT Index Fund has the same holdings as VNQ.Simon Property and Duke Realty are top-10 holdings of $4.5 billion Fidelity Real Estate Investment Portfolio .All three REITs took price hits last week. Simon and Crown fell after Fed Chair Janet Yellen said that a rate hike in December is possible. Duke fell on Friday.S&P Capital IQ thinks the three are still good to buy and own based on fundamentals, attractively low valuations and appealing dividends.""Yes, those REITS were negatively impacted by (the) likelihood of higher rates and actions by the Fed,"" Rosenbluth told IBD. ""(But all) of them are buy recommends. No changes made, but there is more upside than before.""Follow Paul Katzeff on Twitter: @IBD_PKatzeff.

Contributing to investor enthusiasm is the point that the company has delivered financial results beyond expectations.In the fourth quarter, its first quarterly report to shareholders as a public company, Store Capital logged net income of 18 cents a share, topping the consensus forecast of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for 11 cents. Rental revenue was $53 million. Total revenue rose 65% to $55.2 million. The REIT reported adjusted funds from operations of 35 cents a share for the quarter and $1.39 a share for the year.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect 2015 net income to slip 3% to 59 cents a share. But they see an 18% gain in 2016.""The triple net lease space is a very vibrant subsector in REITs,"" said Kim. ""We've seen a tremendous amount of transactions occur in the past couple of years. There's no sign of that slowing down for an acquirer with the right cost of capital. The business model continues to work for the triple net lease.""In 2014 the company invested $1.1 billion in 341 properties at an initial weighted average capitalization rate (a measure of return) of 8.3%.""This significant level of volume speaks to the important need we address in the marketplace as companies increasingly focus on managing capital more efficiently,"" said Store Capital CEO Christopher Volk in a statement.As of December 2014, the company's real estate portfolio totaled $2.8 billion in gross investment, representing 947 property locations, substantially all of which are profit centers for the company's customers, in 46 states. A hefty 97% of its properties are under triple net leases, which will serve to lessen its property cost, Volk added. In the fourth quarter, it originated $289.5 million of gross investments in 105 properties at an initial weighted average cap rate of 8%.""In their first earnings report (as a public company), they closed on more than expected acquisitions at a very healthy percentage yield,"" said Kim in commenting on the quarter. ""They did pretty well coming out of the gates.""Store Capital's assets have three payment sources, while other commercial real estate assets have just two, noted Volk on the fourth-quarter conference call.""The differentiator lies in the primary payment source, which is embedded in the profits produced at the properties that we own,"" he added. ""The remaining two payment sources reside in tenant credit quality and real estate residual values, which are payment sources that are common to all commercial real estate investments.""Fine In Dining And ShoppingThe service sector, which includes restaurants and fitness centers, is the company's biggest target market at 47%. Retail represents 37% and industrial is at 16%.The company invests primarily in retail properties, says Stifel analyst Simon Yarmak. He says its top industry is the restaurant sector, which accounts for 28% of Store Capital's rental revenue.How does Store Capital profit?""They hope to earn a spread on their cost of capital,"" said Yarmak. ""Say they're getting an initial 8% yield on the purchase. They hope to fund the acquisition with a cost of capital below that yield.""Here's how he explains it: ""Say the cost of capital is 6.5% and the yield is 8%. The company would earn an initial 150-basis-point spread on the transaction. If the lease is locked in for the next 15 to 20 years, Store Capital knows it's getting at least a 150-basis-point spread on the leases for the next 15 to 20 years.""Store Capital differs from its peers, which include REITs such as Realty Income (O), in a few ways.One way it differs is in the credit quality of its tenants, says Kim. ""It's not chasing investment-grade tenants,"" he said. ""To gain conviction and understanding regarding the tenant credit risk, it obtains information on the profit/loss details of the tenants they work with.""It also differs from its peer group in terms of the length of its leases, he adds. He says Store Capital's average lease term is 15 years vs. 11 years for its peer group.In terms of the outlook for Store Capital and its peers, ""the direction of interest rates will be an important determinant,"" said Kim.Store Capital is in IBD's Finance-Property REIT industry group, which also includes Simon Property Group (SPG) and Kimco Realty (KIM). Store Capital has an IBD Composite Rating of 93 out of a possible 99.

166,SPG,"When it comes to developing cutting-edge real estate for Big Pharma and tech firms, Alexandria Real Estate Equities CEO Joel Marcus has refined a tried-and-true formula.Started by Marcus back in 1994, Alexandria (ARE) is a real estate investment trust focused on developing science and technology campuses in top urban clusters, adjacent to leading academic and medical institutions, in order to create a collaborative environment.The company's activity is centered on science hubs — such as Cambridge, Mass., the San Francisco Bay Area, San Diego and New York City.""Our platform focuses on irreplaceable urban innovation centers,"" Marcus told IBD.""They're great places to recruit talent, the transportation is good and they have a 24/7 work-play environment,"" he added. ""We try to own and operate and dominate the market in these irreplaceable markets.""The facilities are high tech and advanced, he says, and they include the kind of infrastructure that companies need to do research and development.""We take the campus location and state-of-the-art facilities and marry them at the intersection of science and technology,"" Marcus said. ""That's really been the secret of our success.""Building For Big NamesUsing this approach, Alexandria has developed campuses for drugmakers such as Eli Lilly (LLY), Novartis (NVS) and Pfizer (PFE), plus IBD Leaderboard stock Illumina (ILMN), a genetic-testing equipment maker.This year, which marks Alexandria's 20th anniversary, the company has had plenty of cause to celebrate. Earnings have started to grow again, with double-digit increases the past two quarters, after no gains from the end of 2011 through 2013.In the third quarter, earnings rose 14% to $1.21 a share. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect 2014 earnings to rise 11% to $4.79 a share following declines the prior four years. They see an 8% rise in 2015 and a 4% increase in 2016.Alexandria's stock price has lifted 36% this year.What's been fueling its growth? Marcus says Alexandria has several factors working in its favor.""We're in a very good economic environment, the Fed has kept interest rates low and we've seen substantially rising rents in urban innovation markets,"" he said. ""There's also a constrained supply. The demand we're seeing from the life science and tech sectors are the highest levels we've seen in the 20-year history of the company.""Marcus adds that the company is seeing ""strong internal growth,"" driven by high occupancy and increasing rental rates in its core markets of Cambridge, San Francisco and New York.Alexandria has a $1 billion pipeline of projects under construction, around 85% of which are leased or under negotiations, says Marcus. That's the highest pre-lease level Alexandria has had.The company has another $1 billion pipeline of projects it will put into play in 2015, he says, adding that both pipelines will help drive ""strong demand and continued up earnings"" over the next few years.Marcus, who used to work as a capital markets lawyer, founded Alexandria to address the real estate infrastructure needs of the biotech industry, which he says were unfilled at the time.""We have a first-mover advantage in almost every market in real estate development,"" he said. ""We focus on urban innovation campuses, and no one else really does that.""Healthy Outlook?RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Carroll says one competitor is BioMed Realty Trust (BMR). It's a REIT focused on providing real estate to the life science industry. Other REITs also dabble in the space, he adds, but it's the location of Alexandria's campuses in urban cluster markets that's the differentiating factor.Carroll said the macro environment for the life science industry looks good: ""You're starting to see the pharma tenants that used to own their own real estate in other locations are finding they're getting better results (in terms of) their ability to do research and collaborate more with people within the industry when they move to these core cluster markets owned by other landlords.""Alexandria has been able to create cluster market campuses in some of the major markets in the U.S., Carroll adds.""Now that tech tenants are finding that they like that atmosphere, they're getting demand from tech tenants too,"" he said.One recent tech project, announced in September, is a strategic partnership with app developer Uber Technologies, whose low-fare ride-sharing service has caught on as a taxi alternative. The project includes the acquisition of two key parcels in the Mission Bay area of San Francisco.What's The Deal With Uber?These parcels will support 422,980 rentable square feet of new, ground-up facilities. The joint venture will be 51% owned by Alexandria and 49% by Uber. It will let Uber expand its corporate headquarters in San Francisco in conjunction with a 15-year lease for the entire project.Alexandria is expected to break ground on the project in January 2015 and finish it by the end of 2016.Mission Bay is home to a campus of the University of California, San Francisco, as well as Alexandria's science and technology cluster, which was recently selected to house the future arena of the Golden State Warriors of the NBA.Marcus said the Uber venture is ""very significant because it has very strong yields, and shareholders will reap the benefits with great cash flow.""It represents a milestone to bring more tech companies to Mission Bay, which historically was more of a life science destination, Marcus adds.Carroll also called the venture with Uber significant: ""There's a lot of demand in that area ... in Mission Bay South of Market (SoMa) in San Francisco.""With a market cap around $6.2 billion, Alexandria is one of the smaller companies in IBD's Finance-Property REIT industry group; the largest is Simon Property Group (SPG) with a market cap of $56.6 billion.The group ranks No. 79 in performance of the 197 that IBD tracks.The Medical-Ethical Drugs industry group, where several of Alexandria's customers reside, ranks No. 23, and Medical-Biomed/Biotech ranks No. 4.

181,SPG,"After shunning real estate investment trusts last year, investors are rebuilding their positions in companies that buy and rent real estate.REIT ETFs have been among the few sectors beating the stock market so far this year. Vanguard REIT Index (VNQ), the largest in its category with $22 billion in assets, has jumped 11% year-to-date, far surpassing the SPDR S&P 500's (SPY) 1% gain. It's a remarkable turnaround after adding only 2% when SPY popped 32% in 2013.IShares Residential Real Estate (REZ) has also vaulted 13% year-to-date, while IShares Cohen & Steers REIT (ICF) is up 12%.Investors have been flocking to income-generating assets as interest rates fell this year despite the Federal Reserve's plan to scale back its unprecedented economic stimulus, which was expected to lift interest rates. Yields on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes are down 28 basis points so far this year to 2.72% as of Wednesday from 3.00% at the start of the year.""The average public REIT has a yield of 3.5% — much better than other alternatives and more sustainable if the economy does recover from its current anemia,"" Christian Wagner, CEO of Longview Capital Management in Wilmington, Del., said in an email. ""Builders continue to bring more product online due to low costs of funds. And in the event that we do have a significant upturn, their inventory will be sufficient to fulfill demand.""VNQ currently shows a 12-month yield of 2.9%, REZ 3.6% and ICF 3.2%, according to Morningstar.

They each account for less than 0.5% of VNQ's assets.REITs such as Simon, which invest in shopping centers and retail locations, should benefit from rising consumer spending and retail sales anticipated over the next year, says Robert McMillan, an analyst at S&P Capital IQ.""Most of the retail REITs have long-term leases with their customers, with embedded rent adjustments that should help insulate them from economic fluctuations,"" he wrote in an equity report April 5.""We expect tight credit conditions, though not as restrictive as they were at the height of the financial crisis in late 2008 and 2009, to continue to squeeze smaller, undercapitalized players from the market as larger retailers seek to do business with shopping -center operators that can execute in a still tight and volatile credit environment.""Although REITs are heavily indebted, their mortgages are secured by the underlying properties — which makes lenders amiable to refinancing the debts, McMillan added. But traditional brick-and-mortar stores could suffer if online shopping continues to win over customers. Retail landlords would have to focus on expanding overseas, which entails more risks, wrote Todd Lukasik, an analyst with Morningstar, in a report dated April 8.Rate-Rise RiskReal estate ETFs have absorbed $2.25 billion year -to-date after taking in $3.21 billion last year, according to ETF.com.

In this year alone, the company has increased its dividend by 5 cents a share in all four quarters.Meanwhile, the stock has climbed 22% this year, outpacing the S&P 500's 14% rise. It's currently just 3% below an all-time high as it climbs the right side of a saucer base. The annual dividend yield is 2.8% at the current share price, well above the S&P average of 2.1%.Simon owns, develops and manages more than 300 malls and other properties in North America, Europe and Asia.Profit, revenue and the dividend have bounced back after declining in the 2008-09 recession. Earnings dropped 7% in 2009, were flat in 2010 and grew 14% in 2011. The Street sees 14% growth this year.As a real-estate investment trust, or REIT, Simon must pay 90% of its taxable income as dividends.Simon's base shows tight trading, with a modest shakeout on the left side of the pattern followed by an uptick in accumulation on the right side. The bottom of the base shows an upside reversal in strong volume, a bullish sign.Accordingly, the stock's Accumulation-Distribution Rating has risen from D+ at the Nov. 16 bottom to B- now, indicating net positive demand for the shares.Yet Simon remains vulnerable to any hiccups in the economy that might affect consumer spending. The Commerce Department said Friday that personal income and spending for November rose 0.6% and 0.4%, respectively, beating expectations. But the Reuters-University of Michigan consumer sentiment index for December plunged 9.8 points to 72.9 amid worries about the fiscal cliff.And while annual pretax margin and cash flow have risen solidly in the past two years, the company's debt-to-equity ratio is a hefty 397%.Nevertheless, Citigroup (C) on Monday upgraded Simon Property from neutral to buy, saying the company's outlets and malls should provide solid income growth.

217,SPG,"Mall magnate Melvin Simon knew how to bring people together.
"
218,SPG,"In the 1960s, when retail stores clung to their downtown locations, Simon (1926-2009) pioneered the indoor mall concept.
"
219,SPG,"Talk about a sales job.
"
220,SPG,"""We were trying to lease a dream. No one had an idea of what a shopping center was,"" he said in ""The Malling of America"" by William Severini Kowinski.
"
221,SPG,"Sears (SHLD), for one, was reluctant to anchor Simon's Bloomington, Ind., shopping center. ""I remember one of their VPs for real estate said, 'Well, we're against it. We don't need the mall,'"" he told the Indianapolis Star.
"
222,SPG,"Simon insisted they did. More stores under one roof meant increased shopper traffic, which boosted everyone's bottom lines.
"
223,SPG,"""Melvin was a man who was only interested in win-win situations,"" friend Barton Kaufman told the Indiana Business Journal. ""He wanted to win in the transaction, but he also wanted you to win.""
"
224,SPG,"Win they did.
"
225,SPG,"By the time of his death, Simon Property Group (SPG) was the largest mall operator in the world, with almost 400 properties in North America, Europe and Asia. The New York Times reported sales from 2.8 billion shopper visits a year to be more than $60 billion. Forbes magazine placed Simon's wealth at $1.3 billion.
"
226,SPG,"Over and over, Simon drew crowds by delighting shoppers with the unexpected.
"
227,SPG,"His Mall of America in Bloomington, Minn., set records as a mammoth, 4.2 million-square-foot attraction complete with roller coasters and ice rinks.
"
228,SPG,"""It was magical,"" Paco Underhill, author of ""Call of the Mall,"" told IBD. ""He recognized in the Mall of America there was not much shopping between Chicago and San Francisco.""
"
229,SPG,"For a Las Vegas development, Simon went big in a different way. The Forum Shops at Caesars Palace wowed visitors with over-the-top opulence, upscale shops and a 50,000-gallon saltwater aquarium.
"
230,SPG,"The extra frills heightened the shopping experience.
"
231,SPG,"Good Shot
"
232,SPG,"Then came Simon's foray into professional sports. In 1983, he and brother Herb bought the Indiana Pacers of the National Basketball Association. The deal made sure the franchise stayed in the city, consistent with Mel's old-school class. ""His handshake was as good as a 1,000-page contract,"" said Pacers Sports & Entertainment President Jim Morris. ""The man was brilliant, a business genius, a man absolutely of his word.""
"
233,SPG,"Simon was born in Brooklyn, N.Y., to Max, a tailor, and Mae and grew up in the Bronx.
"
234,SPG,"After excelling in school — Simon received an accounting degree from City College of New York in 1949 — he joined the Army.
"
235,SPG,"That military stint landed Simon at Fort Benjamin Harrison in Indianapolis in 1953. After being discharged in the late '50s, Simon took a $100-a-week leasing agent job with Albert Frankel Co., an Indianapolis retail developer.
"
236,SPG,"He was finding his niche.
"
237,SPG,"""In a couple of years, I decided I wanted to be the person to make the decisions. That's how we got into developing,"" Simon told Indiana Business in 1991.
"
238,SPG,"The ""we"" were Mel and Herb, who took a one-third share in the company they formed in 1960 — Melvin Simon & Associates — to Melvin's two-thirds. Another brother, Fred, also worked for the firm until 1983.
"
239,SPG,"It was Mel who built relationships with retailers and made the deals. Herb headed up operations.
"
240,SPG,"They started with strip malls anchored by grocery stores and pharmacies, but Simon saw something bigger on the horizon.
"
241,SPG,"Families were moving to suburban developments connected by interstates, which would surely change how they shopped.
"
242,SPG,"""He was smart enough and savvy enough to realize that retail has to follow housing,"" Underhill said. ""We needed to provide American women with a place to go.""
"
243,SPG,"That place was the mall.
"
244,SPG,"Simon's first enclosed shopping center — University Mall in Fort Collins, Colo. — opened in 1964.
"
245,SPG,"His development blueprint went like this: Lure big retailers like Sears, J.C. Penney (JCP) and Dillard's (DDS) into taking the anchor slot by offering reasonable lease rates.
"
246,SPG,"Based on that key pact — even before breaking ground — Simon could finance an entire development and attract smaller stores.
"
247,SPG,"By 1967, the company had built 3 million square feet in retail property. When 1980 rolled around, the firm was adding three malls a year.
"
248,SPG,"""He was able to ramp up his company everywhere,"" said Steve Bergsman, author of ""Maverick Real Estate Investing."" ""Simon went national quickly.""
"
249,SPG,"So did others, but Simon welcomed competition.
"
250,SPG,"Norman Kranzdorf, a developer and founding member of the International Council of Shopping Centers, recalls struggling to nail down a lease contract with persnickety Woolworth's, so he called Simon.
"
251,SPG,"""He said: 'Forget it; I'll make a copy of the last lease I got off them and mail it to you,'"" Kranzdorf said. ""Mel was the kind of guy who never turned anybody down for a favor.""
"
252,SPG,"Filling 'Em Up
"
253,SPG,"As the mall market matured, Simon concentrated on better serving his customers.
"
254,SPG,"His early innovations included the ubiquitous food court and reeling in movie theater tenants, something he did after lamenting late-evening empty mall parking lots.
"
255,SPG,"Simon's knack was for knowing what shoppers wanted.
"
256,SPG,"""He was a great industry leader, but, most importantly, he was a great follower"" of people and their tastes, Underhill said.
"
257,SPG,"As the mall market became saturated, Simon responded spectacularly. ""Survival meant change. He thought that the shopping center had to be bigger and more elaborate ... and become an attraction in and of itself,"" Bergsman said. ""The commonplace shopping mall had seen its day.""
"
258,SPG,"By 1992, Simon was teaming with Canada's Ghermezian family to build the gargantuan Mall of America. The size of seven Yankee Stadiums, the complex ranks as the largest mall in the U.S.
"
259,SPG,"Simon enjoyed going big.
"
260,SPG,"Kranzdorf recalls the year Simon outshone every other booth at a shopping center developer's convention in New Orleans.
"
261,SPG,"""He found an old warehouse and transformed it into a nightclub so everyone could come and have a good time,"" Kranzdorf said. ""Nobody else ever did that.""
"
262,SPG,"The Fade
"
263,SPG,"Simon learned from the occasional misstep.
"
264,SPG,"A venture into movie production peaked with the smash hit ""Porky's"" in 1982. Mediocre films and outright flops followed, so Simon shuttered the effort.
"
265,SPG,"""I did about 25 movies and I got out of it, thank God. It didn't cost me any money ultimately,"" he told the Indianapolis Star in 2002. ""It was a good lesson, and I wouldn't do it again.""
"
266,SPG,"A prolific philanthropist, Simon and his second wife, Bren, donated millions to cancer research and Indianapolis' Museum of Art.
"
267,SPG,"All the while, Simon stayed humble. ""I have never heard Mel or Herb talk about themselves,"" Morris said. ""They will immediately deflect the conversation.""
"
268,SPG,"When Simon Property Group went public in 1993, it raised nearly $1 billion in the largest real estate stock offering of its time. The stock has bounced back over 300% since bottoming out in 2009.
"
269,SPG,"Simon's son David, one of five offspring, took the CEO seat from Herb in 1995 after serving as chief financial officer since 1990.
"
270,SPG,"In the next few years, Simon Property Group went into acquisition mode, cementing its No. 1 spot in the industry.
"

272,SPG,"""Whatever we have accomplished, I know in my heart he's a legend of all legends for me,"" he said. ""He started this thing.""Mall magnate Melvin Simon knew how to bring people together.In the 1960s, when retail stores clung to their downtown locations, Simon (1926-2009) pioneered the indoor mall concept.Talk about a sales job.""We were trying to lease a dream. No one had an idea of what a shopping center was,"" he said in ""The Malling of America"" by William Severini Kowinski.Sears (SHLD), for one, was reluctant to anchor Simon's Bloomington, Ind., shopping center. ""I remember one of their VPs for real estate said, 'Well, we're against it. We don't need the mall,'"" he told the Indianapolis Star.Simon insisted they did. More stores under one roof meant increased shopper traffic, which boosted everyone's bottom lines.""Melvin was a man who was only interested in win-win situations,"" friend Barton Kaufman told the Indiana Business Journal. ""He wanted to win in the transaction, but he also wanted you to win.""Win they did.By the time of his death, Simon Property Group (SPG) was the largest mall operator in the world, with almost 400 properties in North America, Europe and Asia. The New York Times reported sales from 2.8 billion shopper visits a year to be more than $60 billion. Forbes magazine placed Simon's wealth at $1.3 billion.Over and over, Simon drew crowds by delighting shoppers with the unexpected.His Mall of America in Bloomington, Minn., set records as a mammoth, 4.2 million-square-foot attraction complete with roller coasters and ice rinks.""It was magical,"" Paco Underhill, author of ""Call of the Mall,"" told IBD. ""He recognized in the Mall of America there was not much shopping between Chicago and San Francisco.""For a Las Vegas development, Simon went big in a different way. The Forum Shops at Caesars Palace wowed visitors with over-the-top opulence, upscale shops and a 50,000-gallon saltwater aquarium.The extra frills heightened the shopping experience.Good ShotThen came Simon's foray into professional sports. In 1983, he and brother Herb bought the Indiana Pacers of the National Basketball Association. The deal made sure the franchise stayed in the city, consistent with Mel's old-school class. ""His handshake was as good as a 1,000-page contract,"" said Pacers Sports & Entertainment President Jim Morris. ""The man was brilliant, a business genius, a man absolutely of his word.""Simon was born in Brooklyn, N.Y., to Max, a tailor, and Mae and grew up in the Bronx.After excelling in school — Simon received an accounting degree from City College of New York in 1949 — he joined the Army.That military stint landed Simon at Fort Benjamin Harrison in Indianapolis in 1953. After being discharged in the late '50s, Simon took a $100-a-week leasing agent job with Albert Frankel Co., an Indianapolis retail developer.He was finding his niche.""In a couple of years, I decided I wanted to be the person to make the decisions. That's how we got into developing,"" Simon told Indiana Business in 1991.The ""we"" were Mel and Herb, who took a one-third share in the company they formed in 1960 — Melvin Simon & Associates — to Melvin's two-thirds. Another brother, Fred, also worked for the firm until 1983.It was Mel who built relationships with retailers and made the deals. Herb headed up operations.They started with strip malls anchored by grocery stores and pharmacies, but Simon saw something bigger on the horizon.Families were moving to suburban developments connected by interstates, which would surely change how they shopped.""He was smart enough and savvy enough to realize that retail has to follow housing,"" Underhill said. ""We needed to provide American women with a place to go.""That place was the mall.Simon's first enclosed shopping center — University Mall in Fort Collins, Colo. — opened in 1964.His development blueprint went like this: Lure big retailers like Sears, J.C. Penney (JCP) and Dillard's (DDS) into taking the anchor slot by offering reasonable lease rates.Based on that key pact — even before breaking ground — Simon could finance an entire development and attract smaller stores.By 1967, the company had built 3 million square feet in retail property. When 1980 rolled around, the firm was adding three malls a year.""He was able to ramp up his company everywhere,"" said Steve Bergsman, author of ""Maverick Real Estate Investing."" ""Simon went national quickly.""So did others, but Simon welcomed competition.Norman Kranzdorf, a developer and founding member of the International Council of Shopping Centers, recalls struggling to nail down a lease contract with persnickety Woolworth's, so he called Simon.""He said: 'Forget it; I'll make a copy of the last lease I got off them and mail it to you,'"" Kranzdorf said. ""Mel was the kind of guy who never turned anybody down for a favor.""Filling 'Em UpAs the mall market matured, Simon concentrated on better serving his customers.His early innovations included the ubiquitous food court and reeling in movie theater tenants, something he did after lamenting late-evening empty mall parking lots.Simon's knack was for knowing what shoppers wanted.""He was a great industry leader, but, most importantly, he was a great follower"" of people and their tastes, Underhill said.As the mall market became saturated, Simon responded spectacularly. ""Survival meant change. He thought that the shopping center had to be bigger and more elaborate ... and become an attraction in and of itself,"" Bergsman said. ""The commonplace shopping mall had seen its day.""By 1992, Simon was teaming with Canada's Ghermezian family to build the gargantuan Mall of America. The size of seven Yankee Stadiums, the complex ranks as the largest mall in the U.S.Simon enjoyed going big.Kranzdorf recalls the year Simon outshone every other booth at a shopping center developer's convention in New Orleans.""He found an old warehouse and transformed it into a nightclub so everyone could come and have a good time,"" Kranzdorf said. ""Nobody else ever did that.""The FadeSimon learned from the occasional misstep.A venture into movie production peaked with the smash hit ""Porky's"" in 1982. Mediocre films and outright flops followed, so Simon shuttered the effort.""I did about 25 movies and I got out of it, thank God. It didn't cost me any money ultimately,"" he told the Indianapolis Star in 2002. ""It was a good lesson, and I wouldn't do it again.""A prolific philanthropist, Simon and his second wife, Bren, donated millions to cancer research and Indianapolis' Museum of Art.All the while, Simon stayed humble. ""I have never heard Mel or Herb talk about themselves,"" Morris said. ""They will immediately deflect the conversation.""When Simon Property Group went public in 1993, it raised nearly $1 billion in the largest real estate stock offering of its time. The stock has bounced back over 300% since bottoming out in 2009.Simon's son David, one of five offspring, took the CEO seat from Herb in 1995 after serving as chief financial officer since 1990.In the next few years, Simon Property Group went into acquisition mode, cementing its No. 1 spot in the industry.Melvin Simon remained chairman emeritus until his death in September 2009. At a public event a few months earlier, Herb Simon saluted his brother's legacy.""Whatever we have accomplished, I know in my heart he's a legend of all legends for me,"" he said.

276,SPG,"Boston Properties, Inc. (BXP  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 24, after the market closes.Last quarter, this REIT, which mainly owns and develops Class A office real estates in the United States, delivered lower-than-expected performance in terms of funds from operations (FFO) per share, witnessing a negative surprise of 2.61%.However, over the trailing four quarters, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two occasions and missed in the other two. It delivered an average positive surprise of around 0.28% during this period.The graph below depicts this surprise history:Boston Properties, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Boston Properties, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Boston Properties, Inc. QuoteShares of Boston Properties have declined 0.3% over the past three months compared with the industry’s descend of 4.7%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors That Might Influence Q1 ResultsBoston Properties, based in Massachusetts, concentrates on a few select high-rent and high barrier-to-entry geographic markets. The company’s solid tenant and industry base, including several bellwethers, ensure steady rental revenue growth. Further, Boston Properties has achieved an annual compounded revenue growth rate of 7.09% over the last five years. Given the company’s improving core operations, we anticipate this trend to continue, going forward. Moreover, the company is likely to experience solid contribution in 2018 from its non-same-property portfolio, mainly driven by development deliveries.In fact, with economic improvement and recovery in the job market, healthy demand for office spaces is likely to have continued in the company’s markets in the quarter under review. Particularly, growth in demand for office spaces is anticipated to have been fueled by technology and life sciences businesses.Nonetheless, the company faces intense competition from other operators of office properties. Further, growth in the supply of office spaces in the market remains a concern because higher supply usually leads to lesser absorption and also curtails the landlord’s capability to demand more rent.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the base rent of $514 million reflects marginal growth from the prior-quarter figure.Over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for the first quarter remained stable at $1.50, reflecting year-over-year projected increase of 1.35%. The company projects first-quarter FFO per share to be in the range of $1.47-$1.49.However, consensus estimates for revenue for development and management services are projected to be $8.62 million, down 13.5% sequentially. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $604.5 million, indicating decline of 4.4% year over year.Earnings WhispersOur proven model cannot conclusively predict if Boston Properties will beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time. That’s because it doesn’t have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of -0.32%.Zacks Rank: Boston Properties carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

277,SPG,"Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report) has been making concerted efforts to drive footfall at its properties. The company has been actively restructuring its portfolio and is aiming at premium acquisitions and transformative redevelopments.In sync with these efforts, Marriott International and Simon are planning to open five new hotels in the next several years at Simon’s shopping centers. This will be beneficial for both the companies as mixed-use properties are becoming a popular choice among hotel companies.  This is because, leisure and business travelers prefer to explore shopping, dining and entertainment zones next to their hotels.In fact, Marriott already has more than 15 hotels situated at Simon Properties and several other hotels by Marriott are located near the company’s properties.Further, to beat the blues of declining mall traffic, Simon announced that it will be opening seven UNTUCKit stores at its properties in 2018 as it is one of the fastest-growing retail brands and wants to expand their business by opening physical stores. The company plans to open 25 stores across the United States in 2018.Notably, mall traffic continues to suffer due to the rapid shift in customers' shopping preferences, with e-retail taking precedence. In fact, with e-commerce gaining market share from the brick-and-mortar stores, retailers are compelled to reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures while others, unable to cope with competition, have been filing bankruptcies.This also resulted in tenants demanding substantial lease concessions, which mall landlords find unjustified. Retail REITs like Simon Property, GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM  -  Free Report), Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report) and others have felt the heat, and the companies’ share prices have been suffering for the past 12 months.However, amid these, Simon is sparing no efforts to survive the changing market and make the best use of its properties. The company is making heavy investments not only to elevate the value of its retail properties but also for exploring mixed-use development option, which has gained immense popularity in recent years. Such developments lower the distance between housing, workplaces, retail businesses, and other amenities and destinations. Hence, the developments enable companies to grab the attention of people who prefer to live, work and play in the same area — a trend that drove development in several other cities in the United States.Encouragingly, in the past month, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has outperformed the industry.

278,SPG,"When store closures and retailer bankruptcies are creating a wreck for retail REITs, industry leader, Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report), surely knows how to turn around. The company has now launched a $4+ billion of investment plan to transform its properties aimed at creating value and drive footfall at its properties.Specifically, for Phipps Plaza in Buckhead (Atlanta), Georgia, its transformational efforts comprise inclusion of a boutique hotel and a restaurant from the luxury brand Nobu, a LifeTime wellness center, a Class-A office building and a dining experience. Moreover, enhancements at the King of Prussia (Greater Philadelphia), Pennsylvania property will include outdoor plaza, residences, a hotel and Class A office building.In the thriving Denver market, the company will open its latest Premium Outlets center — Denver Premium Outlets — in Thornton, CO, this fall. The company has also announced transformative measures at The Colonnade Outlets in Sawgrass Mills, Sunrise, FL, and The Edit@Roosevelt Field, Long Island, NY. Moreover, the prior pure-play e-tailers, including Casper, UNTUCKit, Bonobos, and Blue Nile are seeking to bring their brands in new ways at Simon centers. In fact, the experiential concepts are gaining traction and Simon is banking on it while transforming its properties.Moreover, in April, Simon Property announced the company’s transformational redevelopment plans for the former Sears stores, at five major locations. This move will help the retail REIT draw more traffic to these malls in order to benefit the existing retailers. The properties included in the refurbishment plan are Brea Mall (Brea, CA), Burlington Mall (Burlington, MA), Midland Park Mall (Midland, TX), Ocean County Mall (Toms River, NJ), and Ross Park Mall (Pittsburgh, PA). Enhancements to the properties include entertainment, fitness, restaurants and dining pavilions, residential, hotel and office, as well as new retail brands.Admittedly, mall traffic continues to suffer due to the rapid shift in customers' shopping preferences, with e-retail taking precedence. In fact, with e-commerce gaining market share from the brick-and-mortar stores, retailers are compelled to reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures, while others unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies.This has also resulted in tenants demanding substantial lease concessions, which, however, mall landlords find unjustified.

279,SPG,"Retail REITs are not in the pink of health, as mall traffic continues to suffer due to the rapid shift in customers' shopping preferences, with e-retail taking precedence. In fact, with e-commerce gaining market share from the brick-and-mortar stores, retailers are compelled to reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures, while others unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies.This environment has also resulted in tenants demanding substantial lease concessions, which, however, mall landlords find unjustified.

In fact, among those, reputed retail REIT — Simon Property Group — has been making concerted efforts focused on overhauling its properties, aiming premium acquisitions and transformative redevelopments, and increasingly adopting omni-channel strategies. These will help the company counter the retail blues and make its shopping malls more alluring.In April, Simon Property announced the company’s transformational redevelopment plans for the former Sears stores, at five major locations. This move will help the retail REIT draw more traffic to these malls in order to benefit the existing retailers.The properties included in the refurbishment plan are Brea Mall (Brea, CA), Burlington Mall (Burlington, MA), Midland Park Mall (Midland, TX), Ocean County Mall (Toms River, NJ), and Ross Park Mall (Pittsburgh, PA). Enhancements to the properties include entertainment, fitness, restaurants and dining pavilions, residential, hotel and office, as well as new retail brands.  In fact, over the past five years, this retail REIT invested more than $5 billion in development projects, and further intends to invest substantially for development and redevelopment projects. Such initiatives are expected to draw more traffic at the company’s properties.Moreover, at the end of first-quarter 2018, Simon Property had redevelopment and expansion projects, including the addition of new anchors, in progress at 28 properties across the United States, Canada and Asia. The company has also resorted to micro-retail modeling that offers store units ranging from 20-200 square feet of space. With such a huge pipeline, the company is poised to effectively leverage the improving spending habits of wealthier customers amid improving economy.Also, total portfolio net operating income growth for first-quarter 2018 came in at 4.8%. This reflected increase in operating income from comparable properties, as well as additions from new development, redevelopment, expansion and acquisitions. As such, the company managed to surpass expectations in the first quarter and also raised its outlook for 2018.In addition, Simon Property boasts a strong and improving balance sheet. At the end of first-quarter 2018, the company had more than $7.0 billion of liquidity. This comprised cash on hand, including its share of joint-venture cash, and available capacity under the company’s revolving credit facilities.Furthermore, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT shareholders and Simon Property remains committed to that. The company has steadily raised its dividend over the past years, increasing from $3.50 in 2011 to the present annualized rate of $7.80 per share.Nevertheless, though Simon Property is putting in every effort to enhance the value of its assets, implementation of such measures requires a decent upfront cost. This would, therefore, limit any robust growth in its near-term profit margins.Additionally, rise in interest rate remains another concern as this might restrict the company’s ability to refinance existing debt and increase the interest cost on new debt. This might impact the company’s financial results and dividend payout.Simon Property has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The stock has gained 3.8% in a month’s time, while the industry rallied 2.4%.

280,SPG,"Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results after the market closes on Apr 24. The company is expected to experience growth in both revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share in the quarter.Last quarter, this Chicago, IL-based residential real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a better-than-expected performance in terms of FFO per share. Results mirrored enhanced same-store and lease-up net operating income (NOI). However, the company incurred higher corporate overhead in the quarter.Over the trailing four quarters, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two occasions and met in the other two, delivering an average positive surprise of around 0.9%. The graph below depicts this surprise history:Equity Residential Price and EPS Surprise  Equity Residential Price and EPS Surprise | Equity Residential QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for Equity Residential prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayEquity Residential has been making concerted efforts to reposition its portfolio in high barrier-to-entry/core markets. The company's current focus is on the acquisition and development of assets primarily in six core coastal metropolitan areas — Boston, New York, Washington D.C., Southern California (including Los Angeles, Orange County and San Diego), San Francisco and Seattle.Moreover, the home ownership cost in most markets of Equity Residential is significantly higher than the national average. Considering the current macroeconomic environment, such a trend is expected to continue, which in turn, would drive demand for rented apartments.Further, corporate profits are up, and corporate tax cuts are encouraging companies to deploy capital and increase wages. As such, consumer confidence is high, driven by job growth and rising wages, promising solid prospects for Equity Residential. In addition, favorable demographics, lifestyle transformation and creation of new households amid improving economy will further accelerate demand for the company’s properties.Amid these, Equity Residential projects normalized FFO per share of 74-78 cents for first-quarter 2018. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at 78 cents, which denotes a projected increase of 5.4% year over year. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s revenues is pegged at $631.3 million, reflecting expected growth of 4.5% year over year.However, the latest report from the real estate technology and analytics firm — RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report) — states that the national apartment market moderated in first-quarter 2018, with occupancy shrinking slightly and rent growth slowing down. Nevertheless, the first quarter marks a slow leasing period, thanks to the cold weather that inhibits shift of households and limits growth in demand.Going by statistics, the annual rent growth shrunk to 2.3% in Q1. This marked moderation from the 2.6-2.9% growth rate experienced throughout 2017. Occupancy level of 94.5% this March edged down from the prior-year tally of 95%, with metros having subdued construction activity faring well and recording the strongest occupancy. Nevertheless, the overall occupancy level is still healthy.Moreover, there is an increasing apartment supply in a number of the company’s markets. This high supply is likely to put pressure on rental rates in the to-be-reported quarter. In addition, there is high concession activity amid elevated supply, which remains a concern.Furthermore, the company’s activities during the quarter were inadequate to gain analysts’ confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Equity Residential has the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Equity Residential is +0.25%.Zacks Rank: Equity Residential carries a Zacks Rank of 3.A positive Earnings ESP is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely beat in terms of FFO per share.

281,SPG,"Retail REIT GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report) delivered first-quarter 2018 funds from operations (FFO) per share of 35 cents, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 37 cents. The figure also came in lower than the prior-year quarter tally of 36 cents.    Results reflect year-over-year decline in same-store NOI.The company posted revenues of $574.2 million, which lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $603 million. However, the figure compared favorably with the year-ago tally of $566.3 million.Quarter in DetailsSame-store leased percentage was 95.3% at the quarter’s end. Initial NOI weighted rental rates for signed leases that have commenced in the trailing 12 months (on a suite-to-suite basis) expanded 13.4%, when compared to the rental rate for expiring leases. Further, tenant sales (all less anchors) inched up 0.9%, on a trailing 12-month basis, and excluding apparel sales, increased 2.5%.GGP’s development and redevelopment activities totaled $1.5 billion. Of this, projects worth $1.4 billion are under construction and $0.1 billion in the pipeline.The company ended the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $178.2 million, up from $164.6 million as of Dec 31, 2017.Dividend UpdateGGP announced a second-quarter common stock dividend of 22 cents per share. This dividend will be paid on Jul 31 to stockholders of record on Jul 13, 2018.Our TakeGGP continues to upgrade its tenant composition and customer experience by investing in recaptured anchor boxes at attractive returns.GGP’s portfolio of high-quality retail properties across attractive locations has enabled the company to enjoy higher rents. Additionally, the company continues to improve its tenant roster and is making efforts to strengthen customer relationships. Further, GGP has been focusing on omni-channel retailing and other initiatives, which looks encouraging.Notably, on Mar 26, 2018, GGP accepted the revised acquisition offer extended by Brookfield Property Partners.

282,SPG,"Annaly Capital Management, Inc. (NLY  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 core earnings, excluding premium amortization adjustment (PAA) of 30 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, earnings came in marginally lower compared with the prior-quarter figure of 31 cents.Results, to a great extent, benefited from higher gains on disposal of investments and an increase in interest income. Also, the company witnessed further diversification of funding sources relating to residential mortgage loans during the reported quarter. However, higher interest expenses, and general and administrative expenses remained major headwinds.Results highlight an increase in net interest income (NII) in the first quarter, which totaled $512.1 million, representing sequential growth of 20%.The company also announced that it will acquire MTGE Investment Corp., for $900 million, in a cash-and-stock deal. This values MTGE at $19.65 per share of MTGE common stock. The transaction is a strategic fit, as it will provide further scale and diversification options to the company’s investment platform, increasing the number of options to 37. Moreover, it is estimated that Annaly will have 27% of its capital allocated to credit assets. Also, it is accretive to the company’s 2018 core earnings per common share. The acquisition is expected to strengthen Annaly’s capital base and support its long-term growth. The transaction is likely to close in third-quarter 2018.Quarter in DetailIn the reported quarter, average yield on interest-earning assets (excluding PAA) was 2.99%, down from 3.02% reported in the previous quarter.Net interest rate spread (excluding PAA) of 1.09% for the first quarter edged down from 1.19% reported in the prior quarter.

The company offered an annualized core return on average equity of 10.7% in the reported quarter, marginally up from 10.67% in the prior quarter.Our TakeWe are impressed by Annaly’s in-line results. The company significantly increased its hedge ratio to 94% during the quarter from 70% as of Dec 31, 2017. Amid a high volatility and rising interest-rate environment, this favors the company’s performance for the long term.Moreover, the company made efforts to diversify its funding source relating to residential mortgage loans and increased allocation to credit business to 26%.Annaly Capital Management Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Annaly Capital Management Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Annaly Capital Management Inc Quote Currently, Annaly carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

283,SPG,"Mall traffic continues to suffer from the rapid shift in customers' shopping preference through online channels. In fact, with e-commerce gaining market share from brick-and-mortar stores, retailers are compelled to reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures in recent years, while others unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies. Such an environment has also led to tenants demanding substantial lease concessions which mall landlords find unjustified.These have cast a pall on retail REITs like Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report), GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM  -  Free Report), Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report) and others, and their share prices have suffered in the past 12 months.However, not all are equally likely to fall behind. In fact, Kimco is making every effort to unlock the embedded value of its portfolio through development and re-development initiatives. Most recently, the company has achieved more than 75% of preleasing for its $108-million Mill Station Signature Series development project. The shopping center is being constructed on the site of the previous Owings Mills Mall in Baltimore County, MD.The company is on track with its 2020 Vision that envisages the ownership of high-quality assets, concentrated in major metro markets which offer several growth levers. Particularly, the company is aimed at improving its portfolio mix and experiencing decent demand from high-growth category retailers, including off-price and home improvement.In fact, amid transformation in the retail landscape, Kimco remains well poised to navigate through mall traffic blues, with focus on service and experiential tenants and omni-channel players who generate 56% and 39% of annual base rent, respectively. Moreover, the company is aiming to expand its small shops’ portfolio. These shops basically comprise service-based industries, such as restaurants, salons and spas, personal fitness and medical practices. The shops enjoy frequent customer traffic and are Internet resistant. Amid limited new supply and favorable demographics, this diversification is likely to help Kimco limit its operating and leasing risks.Further, Kimco is engaged in the execution of strategic measures to boost its capital structure, and enhance the company’s growth profile and tax efficiency as well. The company maintains a strong liquidity profile, with $2.25-billion unsecured line of credit, and aims at growing its unencumbered asset pool which consists of 75% of its properties.However, in connection to its strategic efforts, the company is making significant disposition of its assets. The company disposed 21 shopping centers for $219.5 million in the first quarter, with its share of the sales price being $210.2 million. Furthermore, the company expects to be a net seller of properties in 2018 and projects its pro-rata share of dispositions, net of any acquisitions, to be in the range of $700-$900 million. While such efforts are encouraging for the long term, the dilutive effect on earnings from high disposition activity cannot be averted in the near term.Addition, hike in rate of interest is expected to affect the REIT’s rate-sensitive business. It would restrict the company’s ability to refinance existing debt while increasing the interest cost on new debt. This has the power to adversely impact the company’s financial results and its dividend payout as well. In addition, amid rising interest rates, the common stock buyers demand a higher dividend yield and this may negatively impact the market price of the common stock.Kimco currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The company’s shares have appreciated 12.4% in the past three months compared with its industry’s growth of 3.4%.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

284,SPG,"Retail REIT The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report) delivered first-quarter 2018 funds from operations (FFO) per share of 82 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a cent.Results were backed by robust growth in re-leasing spreads and tenant sales growth. However, the company recorded lower portfolio occupancy.The company posted revenues of $212 million for the first quarter, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $215 million. Further, the figure came in 3.5% lower than the prior-year quarter figure.Quarter in DetailAs of Mar 31, 2018, mall portfolio occupancy shrunk 30 basis points (bps) year over year to 94%. Mall tenant annual sales increased 7.4% year over year to $686 per square feet. Re-leasing spreads for the year ended Mar 31, 2018, increased 14.7%. Average rent per square foot ascended 3.8% to $58.44 from $56.31 as of Mar 31, 2017.Also, same-center net operating income for the reported quarter inched up 0.07% from the prior-year period.As of Mar 31, 2018, Macerich’s cash and cash equivalents summed $118.2 million, up from $91 million reported as of Dec 31, 2017.GuidanceMacerich reaffirmed its guidance for 2018. The retail REIT expects FFO per share of $3.92-$4.02. This is backed by the same-center NOI growth rate projection of 2-2.5%, and no asset sales or acquisitions assumptions. Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year FFO per share is pegged at $3.95.Our ViewpointThe company has resorted to non-core asset dispositions and recycling the proceeds toward higher quality assets. It continued with this strategy in the Jan-Mar quarter as well. Such moves are expected to improve Macerich’s portfolio quality.   However, it is feared that dwindling footfall amid shift of consumers toward online channels, store closures and bankruptcy of retailers might affect the company’s near-term performance. While Macerich has been striving to counter the pressure through efforts to support omni-channel retailing and bringing online retailers to its stores, implementation of such measures requires a decent upfront cost. Therefore, this might consequently limit any robust growth in profit margins in the near future.Macerich Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Macerich Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Macerich Company (The) QuoteCurrently, Macerich has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The FFO per share figure also came in 4.7% higher than the year-ago tally of $2.74.Results highlight increase in base minimum rent per square foot and leasing spread per square foot at its U.S. malls and Premium Outlets. Moreover, the company recorded growth in net operating income (NOI) for the total portfolio that was backed by contribution from new development, redevelopment, expansion and acquisitions. Simon Property also raised its outlook for 2018.During the quarter, the company posted revenues of around $1.4 billion, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.38 billion. It also compared favorably with the year-ago number of $1.35 billion.Inside the Headline NumbersFor the U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets portfolio, occupancy was 94.6% as of Mar 31, 2018. Retailer sales per square foot came in at $641 for the trailing 12-month period, marking growth of 4.2%. Base minimum rent per square feet rose 3.2% year over year to $53.54 as of Mar 31, 2018. Further, leasing spread per square foot for the trailing 12-month period ended Mar 31, 2018, increased 12.6% to $8.45.Total portfolio NOI growth for the reported quarter came in at 4.8%. This reflects increase in operating income from comparable properties, as well as additions from new development, redevelopment, expansion and acquisitions. Comparable-property NOI growth for the same period came in at 2.3%.At the end of the reported quarter, Simon Property had redevelopment and expansion projects, including the addition of new anchors, in progress at 28 properties across the United States, Canada and Asia.The company exited first-quarter 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of $367.2 million compared with nearly $1.5 billion reported at the prior-year end.Additionally, as of Mar 31, 2018, Simon had more than $7.0 billion of liquidity.

It boasts a strong and improving balance sheet. Moreover, the company is focusing on overhauling its properties and increasingly adopting omni-channel strategies. In fact, recently, Simon Property announced substantial redevelopment program at five properties. This move will help the retail REIT transform the former Sears stores and draw more traffic to these malls, in order to benefit the existing retailers.Admittedly, Simon Property is putting in every effort to enhance the value of its assets. However, the implementation of such measures requires a decent upfront cost and therefore, would limit any robust growth in its profit margins in the near term.

286,SPG,"Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM  -  Free Report) has provided an update of its Q2 transaction activity and reported that it has sold 17 shopping centers, aggregating 2.7 million square feet of space, in the quarter. With these dispositions, the company’s second-quarter sales volume has surpassed $330 million and for the first half of the year, the same aggregated $556 million. This retail REIT now remains on track to meet its full-year disposition target of $700-$900 million.Specifically, the 17 shopping centers were sold off for $334.0 million, of which Kimco’s share of dispositions amounted to $319.3 million. The bunch of properties that were sold off included a 368,000-square-foot property in Springfield, MO — Primrose Marketplace — that was sold for $51.8 million, a 356,000-square-foot property in Chula Vista, CA — Broadway Plaza — for $58.5 million as well as a 269,000-square-foot center in Downers Grove, IL — Downers Park Plaza — for $26.7 million. The company also disposed a 145,000- square-foot property in Hoover, AL — The Grove — for $21.0 million which marked its exit from the state of Alabama.The company witnessed solid demand for open-air shopping centers and the Q2 property sales’ blended cap rate came in line with its expected range of 7.5-8%.Notably, mall traffic continues to suffer from the rapid shift in customers' shopping preference through online channels, resulting in store closures and retailers bankruptcies.

287,SPG,"The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report) enjoys a premium portfolio and the presence of well-capitalized tenants in its roster. Additionally, the company’s increasing adoption of the omni-channel model in retailing is anticipated to enhance shopping experience and bolster sales volume at the tenant stores, thereby raising demand for Macerich’s properties.Notably, Macerich has a high concentration of premium malls in some vibrant U.S. markets. The company has been diversifying its traditional tenant base by including several emerging digital and store-based retailers for offering enhanced shopping experience at the company’s retail centers.Additionally, Macerich has been focusing on an aggressive capital-recycling program, involving divestiture of non-core and slower-growth assets, and usage of the proceeds in higher-growth properties through acquisitions, developments, and redevelopment initiatives. As part of such measures, since 2013, Macerich sold 21 non-core retail centers for an aggregate of $1.8 billion in proceeds.Moreover, the company remains on track with its redevelopment pipeline and pre-leasing deals.  Further, Macerich is aiming to enhance its assets quality as well as customer relationships. Going forward, we expect such moves to offer an upside potential to the company and strengthen its high-end portfolio.Nevertheless, with e-retail taking precedence, retail real estate investment trusts (REIT) continue to suffer as mall traffic has taken a beating. In fact, with e-commerce gaining market share from the brick-and-mortar stores, retailers are compelled to reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures, while others unable to cope with competition have been filing for bankruptcies.This dreary environment has also resulted in tenants demanding substantial lease concessions, which, however, mall landlords find unjustified. As such, retail REITs like Macerich, GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM  -  Free Report), Simon Property Group (SPG  -  Free Report) and others have been affected, and the companies’ share prices have been suffering for the past 12 months.Further hike in interest rate can also pose a challenge for the company. Essentially, rising rates imply higher borrowing cost for the company, which would affect its ability to purchase or develop real estate and lower dividend payouts as well. Moreover, the dividend payout itself might become less attractive compared to the yields on fixed income and money market accounts.Amid such retail woes, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have underperformed the industry it belongs to in the past three months.

288,SPG,"SL Green Realty Corp. (SLG  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 18, after the market closes. While funds from operations (FFO) per share will likely increase on a year-over-year basis, revenues are expected to decline.Last quarter, this real estate investment trust (REIT) met its FFO estimates. The office landlord experienced an increase in occupancy rate in its Manhattan portfolio. However, the company’s Q4 results reflected an overall fall in revenues.Over the trailing four quarters, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in one occasion, missed in another and met in the remaining two. The company delivered an average positive surprise of around 1.2% during this period. The graph below depicts this surprise history:SL Green Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise SL Green Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | SL Green Realty Corporation QuoteShares of SL Green have declined 7.5% over the past six months compared with the industry’s descend of 11.1%.Factors That Might Influence Q1 ResultsThe company has been enhancing its capacity to offer office space through an opportunistic investment policy. This bodes well for SL Green amid an improving economy and job-market environment.Nonetheless, the company faces intense competition from developers, owners and operators of office properties, and other commercial real estate, including sublease space available from its tenants. This restricts its ability to attract and retain tenants at relatively higher rents than its competitors. Further, elevated supply of office space is adding to its woes.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter property net rental revenues is currently pegged at $262 million, reflecting a decline of 1.3% from the previous-quarter figure. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for investment income is projected at $48.4 million, indicating 7.2% growth sequentially.Over the past seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for the first quarter increased marginally to $1.65, reflecting analysts’ bullish sentiments. Also, it denotes a projected year-over-year improvement of 5.1%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model cannot conclusively predict if SL Green will beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time.

290,SPG,"We are in the heart of the first-quarter earnings season and 154 members of the S&P 500 index have already reported their financial numbers. Per the latest Earnings Preview, performances of these index participants indicate a 25.4% increase in total earnings on 10.3% higher revenues compared to the prior-year period. The beat ratio is impressive, with 80.5% companies surpassing bottom-line expectations and 72.1% outperforming top-line projections.In fact, the real estate investment trust (REIT) space is bustling with activity, and Simon Property Group (SPG  -  Free Report), Ventas, Inc. (VTR  -  Free Report) and New Residential Investment Corp. (NRZ  -  Free Report) are set to release their quarterly numbers on Apr 27.With underlying asset categories and the location of properties playing a crucial role in determining REITs’ performance, rate hike and cautious approach of investors have affected returns for this industry. In fact, healthcare REITs are most sensitive to spiking interest rates, courtesy long-term leases and narrow re-leasing spreads. Also, taking into consideration high dividend yield, healthcare REITs have comparatively higher correlation with the 10-year US Treasury yield and perform poorly relative to other REIT sectors in a rising interest rate scenario. While there are pockets of strengths in this sector, like strong demand stemming from favorable demographics, oversupply in senior housing facilities and tilt toward outpatient care remain immediate concerns. Further, operators of skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) have been disadvantages, thanks to the fall in private-pay healthcare, low margins and heavy government control. Deteriorating fundamentals of this sector also remain headwinds.Retail REITs are facing a different set of challenges. Recent data from real estate research firm — Reis — states that U.S. retail real estate vacancies persisted at the 10% levels for first-quarter 2018. Additionally, mall traffic continues to suffer as e-commerce has been increasingly capturing market share from the traditional brick-and-mortar stores, compelling retailers to resort to online options or file bankruptcy. In fact, the first few months of the year witnessed several preeminent retail bankruptcy filings and record-high defaults by retail corporates.In addition, the latest report from the real estate technology and analytics firm — RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report) — states that the national apartment market moderated in the Jan-Mar quarter. Nevertheless, the first quarter marks a slow leasing period, thanks to the cold weather that inhibits shift of households and curbs growth in demand. Going by statistics, annual rent growth shrunk to 2.3% in Q1.Let’s have a look at what can be expected from the above mentioned REITs.Simon Property has been quickly adapting to the changing retail landscape by increasingly adopting omni-channel strategies and overhauling properties. Importantly, the company is entering into several partnerships for upgrading services and amenities provided to its customers. It has also re-launched its brand and marketing programs, and has resorted to micro-retail modeling as well. Such moves make its shopping malls appealing and are expected to have been conducive to revenue growth in the to-be-reported quarter.Also, during the quarter, Simon Property improved its financial strength by amending and extending its 3.5-billion unsecured multi-currency revolving credit facility. This, when combined with the existing $4.0-billion revolver, offers the company $7.5 billion of total revolving credit capacity. Increased financial flexibility supports the company’s active redevelopment and expansion pipeline. (Read more: What's in the Cards for Simon Property Q1 Earnings?)The funds from operations (FFO) and revenues of the company are projected to register 3.3% and 2.3% year-over-year growth in first-quarter 2018.Furthermore, according to our quantitative model, chances of Simon Property likely beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter The Earnings ESP for Simon Property is +0.32% and it carries a favorable Zacks Rank of 3.Simon Property Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Simon Property Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Simon Property Group, Inc. QuoteVentas is anticipated to have benefited in the first quarter from increasing healthcare spending and aging population. Also, Ventas accomplished the sale of its 36 skilled nursing facilities (SNF), which were being operated by Kindred Health care. The move helped it reap $700 million in proceeds and enabled the company to “de-emphasize” this particular healthcare real estate category.Nonetheless, impact of oversupply in some markets might reflect in the performance of Ventas’ senior housing assets. Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $204 million for triple net-leased rental income underscores a sequential decline from the prior-quarter figure of $205 million. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for office building and other services revenues is $3.83 million, highlighting a 1.8% decline sequentially.

As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for the soon-to-be-reported quarter remained unchanged at 55 cents, over the past month.

291,SPG,"Retail REIT Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM  -  Free Report) is experiencing decent demand for its Mill Station Signature Series Development project. In fact, recently, the company announced addition of a number of retailers to its tenant lineup at this project, including Lowe’s Home Improvement (LOW  -  Free Report), Marshalls, TJX’s new HomeSense concept, Burlington and Five Below (FIVE  -  Free Report).With these retailers joining Costco and AMC Theatre in the tenant roster, the company has been able to achieve more than 75% of preleasing for this $108-million Signature Series development project. The shopping center is being constructed on the site of the previous Owings Mills Mall in Baltimore County, MD. While Costco is slated to open later this year, the other retailers are likely to open their stores throughout the first half of 2019.Spanning around 620,000-square-foot of space, the Mill Station development will have a dynamic line-up of up to 30 retailers and restaurants. It will have retail outlets and offices interconnected through an extensive walkway network.The property is likely to command more attention since it is easily accessible, backed by its favorable positioning directly off I-795 and next to the Owings Mills Station stop on Baltimore’s Metro SubwayLink. The site also boasts favorable demography, with a population of 167,000 in the surrounding five-mile area, having average household income of around $95,000. As such, mall traffic is likely to be high and the property is expected to witness decent demand from tenants.Admittedly, a rapid shift in customers' shopping preferences to online channels has jeopardized traffic flow in malls. In fact, with e-commerce grabbing market share from brick-and-mortar stores, retailers are compelled to reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures, while others unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies.Amid these, tenants are also demanding substantial lease concessions, which, however, mall landlords find unjustified. Such an environment has cast a pall over retail REITs including Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report), GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), Kimco Realty and others, and the companies’ share prices have been suffering for the past 12 months.Nevertheless, Kimco is countering the tepid scenario, and the company’s 2020 Vision envisages the ownership of premium assets in major metro markets in the United States as well as a reduction of its non-core portfolio. Particularly, the company is aimed at improving its portfolio mix with development and redevelopment efforts, and experiencing decent demand from high-growth category retailers, including off-price and home improvement.However, in line with its 2020 vision, the company is making substantial dispositions. While such efforts are encouraging for the long term, the dilutive effect on earnings from high disposition activity cannot be averted in the near term.Kimco currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

292,SPG,"Ushering in good news for its shareholders, Agree Realty Corporation (ADC  -  Free Report) announced that it has received investment grade rating from Moody's Investors Service. Particularly, the rating agency has assigned a Baa2 issuer rating to the company, with a stable outlook.Agree Realty cited that the rating agency’s Baa2 issuer rating highlights the company’s enduring operating history, adherence to conservative leverage policy, solid balance-sheet strength with sufficient liquidity for growth, as well as a well-laddered debt maturity schedule.The rating agency also recognized the company’s considerable investment grade tenant roster, large pool of unencumbered asset, a healthy net lease portfolio having long-term leases and nominal lease expirations in the near term.The conferring of this investment grade credit rating to Agree Realty boosts the company's creditworthiness in the market and is likely to enhance investors' confidence in the stock. In fact, such moves provide companies an opportunity to enjoy favorable costs on debts and solid access to capital, and are therefore encouraging.With the ownership and operation of a portfolio of 468 properties across 44 states, Agree Realty primarily deals with properties net leased to industry-leading retail tenants. Recently, the company announced a hike in its quarterly cash dividend. It will now pay a dividend of 54 cents per share, marking a 3.8% increase from the prior dividend payout. The raised dividend will be paid on Jul 13, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on Jun 29, 2018.Notably, retail REITs have been displaying a lackluster performance as traffic at their properties continues to suffer due to the rapid shift in consumers’ shopping preferences toward e-retail. In fact, with e-commerce grabbing market share from the brick-and-mortar stores, retailers are compelled to reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures in recent years while others unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies. As a result even industry stalwarts like Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report), GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report) and Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM  -  Free Report) have been affected.However, with focus on retailers having omni-channel strategy, a value-oriented business model, or a service base component, Agree Realty remains well poised to navigate through the broader market blues.

293,SPG,"Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report) is making every effort to boost its portfolio quality through substantial redevelopment program. Recently, the company announced the continuation of its plan to recapture former Sears locations across its portfolio, transforming those into retail, fitness, dining and entertainment hubs, and thereby drawing more traffic at these shopping destinations.In fact, earlier in April, Simon Property announced the company’s transformational redevelopment plans for the former Sears stores, at five major locations. The properties included in the refurbishment plan were Brea Mall (Brea, CA), Burlington Mall (Burlington, MA), Midland Park Mall (Midland, TX), Ocean County Mall (Toms River, NJ) and Ross Park Mall (Pittsburgh, PA). Enhancements to the properties included entertainment, fitness, restaurants and dining pavilions, residential, as well as new retail brands.Admittedly, a rapid shift in customers' shopping preferences to online channels has jeopardized the traffic flow in malls. In fact, with e-commerce grabbing market share from brick-and-mortar stores, retailers are compelled to reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures, while others unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies.Amid these, tenants are also demanding substantial lease concessions, which, however, mall landlords find unjustified.

(KIM  -  Free Report), Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report), and others, and the companies’ share prices have been suffering for the past 12 months.However, Simon Property is making every possible move to counter this challenging situation. The company is making heavy investments not only to elevate the value of its retail properties, but also for exploring mixed-use development option which has gained immense popularity in recent years.Such developments lower the distance between housing, workplaces, retail businesses, and other amenities and destinations. Hence, such developments enable companies to grab the attention of people who prefer to live, work and play in the same area — a trend that drove development in several other cities in the United States.Nevertheless, the implementation of such measures requires a decent upfront cost and therefore, would limit any robust growth in its near-term profit margins.

294,SPG,"Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust (PEI  -  Free Report) — better known as PREIT — is making every possible move to strengthen its balance sheet. The company recently announced execution of a recast of $700-million revolving credit and term loan facility.The accomplishment of these transactions prior to their scheduled maturities offers flexibility to the company because although the terms and conditions remain the same as its existing loans, their maturities now get extended to 2023.This makes the company’s maturity schedule well-laddered and the company now has no material debt maturities until 2021. Thus, the company has accomplished more than $1 billion in transactions in the financing market, in the year so far.Specifically, the facilities included $400-million unsecured revolver and two $150-million 5-year term loans. For the $400-million revolver, the interest rate is unchanged at LIBOR plus a range of 120-155 basis points (bps), based on a calculation of Liabilities to Gross Asset Value (GAV). Notably, the rate is 130 bps over LIBOR on the basis of the company’s current leverage. Considering term, this facility now has 4 years plus 1 year extension option (maturity in 2023).For the $300-million term loan, interest rate is unchanged at LIBOR plus a range of 135-190 bps. The rate is 160 bps over LIBOR based on the company’s current leverage. The loan’s term is five years, with maturity in 2023.  Admittedly, shrinking mall traffic and store closures amid aggressive growth in online sales have kept retail REITs, including PREIT and others like Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report), The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report) and GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), on tenterhooks. Furthermore, tenants are demanding substantial lease concessions owing to a turbulent retail real estate market scenario. Nonetheless, retail REITs are countering this dreary situation and putting in every effort to enhance the malls’ productivity, by focusing to grab attention from new and productive tenants, and disposing the non-productive ones, on the other hand.PREIT, too, along with its remerchandising, redevelopment and anchor-repositioning program, has resorted to a portfolio rejig, selling lower productivity malls, as well as other non-core properties over the past several years. The company also recently announced scope for densification including addition of 5,000-7,000 residential units in the Philadelphia and Washington DC markets, and 1,500-3,000 hotel units across its several properties.While such measures are a strategic fit for the long term, these efforts tend to drag down margins in the near term. Therefore, amid the choppy retail real estate environment, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company underperformed the real estate market in the past three months. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Shares of PREIT have ascended 3% as compared with the real estate market’s rally of 5.5%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

295,SPG,"Extra Space Storage Inc. (EXR  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 1, after the market closes. Both its revenues and funds from operations (FFO) are expected to register year-over-year growth.In the last reported quarter, this Salt Lake City, UT-based self-storage real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a positive surprise of 3.7%, in terms of FFO per share. Results reflected growth in property-rental revenues and improvement in same-store net operating income (NOI). Higher occupancy and rental rates also supported growth.The company has a decent surprise history. In fact, it exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 3.8%. This is depicted in the graph below:Extra Space Storage Inc Price and EPS Surprise  Extra Space Storage Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Extra Space Storage Inc QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors That Might Impact Q1 ResultsExtra Space Storage is the second largest self-storage operator in the United States, as well as the largest self-storage management company in the nation. The company offers a wide array of well-located storage units to its customers, including boat storage, recreational vehicle storage and business storage. It enjoys high brand value and robust presence in key cities.The company also made concerted efforts to consistently grow its business, and achieve geographical diversity through accretive acquisitions, mutually beneficial joint-venture partnerships and third-party management services.In addition, the self-storage industry is anticipated to witness solid demand, backed by favorable demographic changes and events like marriages, shifting, death, and even divorce. Amid these, in the soon-to-be-reported quarter, the company is anticipated to benefit from steady demand in the self-storage industry, and record growth in same-store revenues and NOI.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $251 million for property rental revenue reflects a sequential rise from the prior-quarter figure of $246 million. The estimate for management fees and other income is pegged at $10.5 million, up from $10.1 million in the previous quarter. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter total revenues is pegged at $286.8 million, indicating a year-over-year rise of 9.0%.However, Extra Space Storage operates in a highly fragmented market in the United States, with intense competition from numerous private, regional and local operators. In addition, there is a development boom of self-storage units in many markets. This will likely fuel competition for the company, curb its power to raise rents, and turn on more discounting.Prior to the first-quarter earnings release, there is lack of any solid catalyst for raising optimism about the company’s business activities and prospects. As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for the first quarter remained unchanged at $1.09, over the past month. However, it indicates a year-over-year increase of 5.8%.Additionally, shares of Extra Space Storage have gained 3.0% in the past three months, outperforming the 6.7% decline registered by its industry.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Extra Space Storage will likely beat estimates this season. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) — for this to happen.

296,SPG,"American Tower Corp. (AMT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release first-quarter 2018 results, before the opening bell on May 1. Revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share are expected to witness a rise year over year.The company’s bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 0.97%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.American Tower Corporation (REIT) Price and EPS Surprise American Tower Corporation (REIT) Price and EPS Surprise | American Tower Corporation (REIT) QuoteFactors at PlayAmerican Tower faces fierce competition in the global wireless tower market from large incumbents like Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications Corp. (SBAC  -  Free Report).The company has a substantially leveraged balance sheet. At the end of fourth-quarter 2017, the company had $802.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, and around $19,430.3 million of outstanding long-term debt, compared with $787.2 million and $18,294.7 million, respectively, at the end of December 2016. Such high debt levels may impede sufficient cash flow generation which is needed to meet future debt obligations. Moreover, this may keep the company from accessing the debt market and refinancing at suitable rates.Customer concentration is very high for American Tower and the top four customers account for nearly 65% of its quarterly revenues. Further, American Tower is rapidly expanding in the international markets, especially in the emerging Asian and Latin American markets. Although this geographic diversification will boost revenues, it might jeopardize the bottom line. Tower operations in the emerging markets are not as profitable as that in the mature U.S. market.Further, American Tower’s activities during the quarter could not gain adequate analyst confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share of $1.76 for the first quarter remained unchanged over the past month. However, the figure witnessed rise of 11.4% from the prior-year quarter.Meanwhile, the company generates most of its revenues from long-term (typically 5-10 year) tower leases with major wireless carriers. Additionally, it provides on-site maintenance and servicing of antennas, amplifiers and base-station equipment. Since moving equipment from one tower to another is cumbersome, carriers normally renew these contracts upon expiration. This generates a strong long-term lease upcycle.Revenues generated from the leasing and management of such networks are remarkable and more than 95% are recurring in nature. Moreover, most of its towers are over 210 feet tall, consequently providing sufficient space for the company's customers to install transmission equipment. The company also owns 29% of the land under its towers in the United States.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.74 billion, indicating a year-over-year improvement of 7.5%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that American Tower is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to beat estimates. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with the Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of +1.14%, representing the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Zacks Rank: American Tower has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Key PickSimon Property Group, Inc.

Also, increasing consumer confidence on the back of job growth, higher wages and a healthier balance sheet promises bright prospects for this Arlington, VA-based REIT.Amid these, the company is likely to continue experiencing high occupancy.  Moreover, in a March-issued operating update for the first quarter, AvalonBay stated that it expects total rental revenues for established communities to be up 2.3-2.4% year over year.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of average rental rates at established communities is pegged at  $2,539, indicating a marginal rise sequentially. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is $558.5 million, denoting an expected increase of 6.9% year over year.However, per the latest report from the real estate technology and analytics firm — RealPage, Inc. — the national apartment market was moderated in first-quarter 2018, with occupancy shrinking slightly and rent growth slowing down. Nevertheless, the first quarter marks a slow leasing period, thanks to the cold weather that inhibits shift of households and limits growth in demand.Going by statistics, the annual rent growth shrunk to 2.3% in Q1. This marked moderation from the 2.6-2.9% growth rate experienced throughout 2017. Occupancy level of 94.5% in March edged down from the prior-year tally of 95%, with metros having subdued construction activity faring well and recording the strongest occupancy. Nevertheless, the overall occupancy level is still healthy.Moreover, there is an increasing apartment supply in a number of markets of the company. This high supply is likely to put pressure on rental rates in the to-be-reported quarter. In addition, there is high-concession activity amid elevated supply, which remains a concern.Furthermore, the company’s activities during the quarter were inadequate to gain analysts’ confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate witnessed a marginal decline over the last 30 days and is currently pegged at $2.19. Nevertheless, this indicates a 4.8% increase year over year.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that AvalonBay is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: AvalonBay has an Earnings ESP of -1.06%, representing the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Zacks Rank: AvalonBay’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP.

301,SPG,"Vident Financial launched a new fund on Mar 27, focused on providing exposure to the real estate space of the United States equity market.U.S. Diversified Real Estate ETF (PPTY  -  Free Report) seeks to track, before fees and expenses, the performance of the U.S. Diversified Real Estate Index.Fund CharacteristicsThe fund’s index seeks to employ a rules based approach to offer investors a multi-factor alternative to traditional market cap-weighted real estate funds. “If you ask for the three most important factors when investing in real estate, you’ll probably hear ‘location, location, location.’ To this we’d add property type and leverage,” per a Business Wire article citing Fred Stoops, head of real estate investments at Vident.The fund amassed $9 million in AUM within a few days of trading. It charges a fee of 53 basis points a year.  The fund’s top three holdings include Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report), Avalonbay Communities Inc (AVB  -  Free Report) and Terreno Realty Corp (TRNO  -  Free Report), with 3.8%, 3.4% and 3.0% exposure, respectively.How Does it Fit in a Portfolio?The Real Estate segment of the U.S. market has played an integral role in the expansion of the U.S. economy. Although it requires immense knowledge about the sector and bears significant risks, equity funds providing exposure to the sector are a great way to diversify traditional portfolios.  Owing to its low correlation with other asset classes, the real estate sector is a great diversifier. Moreover, real estate investments are a great way to gain inflation protection, as rising prices increase the resale value of the property and it can also be used to generate rental income.   CompetitionThe fund faces intense competition. Below we discuss a few ETFs that seek to provide exposure to the real estate sector.iShares U.S. Real Estate ETF (IYR  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to real estate stocks and tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Real Estate Index.

302,SPG,"Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report) announced that it will expand the Happy Returns services available at its malls to several other locations. This will enable an increasing number of customers to return purchases made online at malls where Simon Guest Services is available.Notably, Happy Returns already has a significant presence in Simon’s malls. The recent agreement will see the company expanding in additional 16 centers owned by Simon Property.Using the Happy Returns platform, shoppers will be able to return online purchases made from select retailers to the Simon Guest Services desk, with an immediate credit. Hence, customers can effectively skip the lengthy return process of packing and shipping items. Moreover, refunds can be made faster.While customers can experience an easy return process, it also provides them an opportunity to find what they need at Simon Property’s retail centers.  Notably, this transaction is Simon Property’s trump card — there is a high tendency of shoppers making returns to make additional purchases from malls — thereby boosting mall footfall.Notably, with e-retail becoming the latest favorite shopping channel, traffic flow in malls has taken a backseat. In fact, with e-commerce grabbing market share from brick-and-mortar stores, retailers are now forced to reconsider their footprint and opt for store closures, while those unable to match up with competition are filing bankruptcies. Amid these, tenants are also demanding substantial lease concessions, which, however, mall landlords find unjustified. This turbulent environment has cast a pall over retail REITs like Simon Property, The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report), Taubman Centers (TCO  -  Free Report) and Kimco Realty Corporation (KIM  -  Free Report) among others.Nonetheless, Simon Property is making every possible move to bridge the gap between Internet retail, and the brick and mortar stores. The company is undertaking strategic measures to help online retailers fortify their physical presence. And the well-planned expansion of the Happy Returns services to other locations will enable online brands, with insignificant physical presence, to better serve customers.In addition to the above, the company recently announced that comfort-focused lifestyle brand — Tommy John — will expand its retail footprint by opening a store at the SouthPark shopping mall in Charlotte, NC. The physical store development will be helped by Simon Property through its New Business Team which assists online brands to transition from 'Clicks to Bricks.’ (Read more: Simon's SouthPark Mall Picked for Tommy John's Next Store)Currently, Simon Property has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

303,SPG,"Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report) announced that comfort-focused lifestyle brand — Tommy John — will expand its retail footprint by opening a store at SouthPark shopping mall in Charlotte, NC.The new store is slated to open later this summer in a 3,000-square-foot space between Neiman Marcus and Belk. This will mark Tommy John’s second brick-and-mortar outlet at a Simon property after its retail store launch at the iconic King of Prussia mall in suburban Philadelphia last October.Tommy John's physical store development is being helped by Simon Property through its New Business Team. This team makes diligent efforts with online brands to go from 'Clicks to Bricks.’The opening of a new store by Tommy John at SouthPark is a strategic fit. Developed in 1970 in the affluent SouthPark neighborhood, it is the largest shopping mall between Atlanta and Washington, D.C. The mall, which is anchored by Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report), Belk, Dillard's (DDS  -  Free Report), Macy's (M  -  Free Report) and Neiman Marcus, enjoys elevated demand for space.Notably, a rapid shift in customers' shopping preferences to online channels has jeopardized the traffic flow in malls. In fact, with e-commerce grabbing market share from brick-and-mortar stores, retailers are compelled to reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures, while others unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies. Amid these, tenants are also demanding substantial lease concessions, which, however, mall landlords find unjustified. Such an environment has cast a pall over retail REITs like Simon Property and others.However, Simon Property is making every possible move to counter this challenging situation. The company is undertaking strategic measures to help online retailers fortify their physical presence, besides taking steps to support omni-channel strategy.Moreover, recently, the company announced the continuation of its plan to recapture the former Sears locations across its portfolio, transforming those into retail, fitness, dining and entertainment hubs, and thereby drawing more traffic at these destinations. In fact, it is making heavy investments not only to elevate the value of its retail properties, but also for exploring mixed-use development option which has gained popularity in recent years.Nevertheless, the implementation of such measures requires a decent upfront cost and therefore, would limit any robust growth in the company’s near-term profit margins. Also, rate hike has added to its woes.Simon Property has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

307,SPG,"Regency Centers Corp. (REG  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 30, after the market closes. Both its revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share are expected to experience year-over-year growth.Last quarter, this Jacksonville, FL-based retail real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered in-line FFO per share. Results reflected growth in same-property net operating income (NOI) and strong leasing activity during the quarter.Further, the company has a solid surprise history. It beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters with an average surprise of 4.04%. This is depicted in the graph below:Regency Centers Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Regency Centers Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Regency Centers Corporation QuoteHowever, the stock has lost 12.5% in the last three months, underperforming the 11.4% decline witnessed by the industry it belongs to.Factors That Might Impact Q1 ResultsRegency focuses on building a premium portfolio of grocery-anchored shopping centers and neighborhood centers. Such centers are usually necessity driven and bring a dependable traffic. Also, the company has solid experience in the retail real estate industry and enjoys presence of well-known grocers as tenants.Moreover, Regency’s merger with Equity One in 2017 helped the company in creating a high-quality portfolio of over 400 properties that were mainly grocery-anchored. The efficient moves have permitted Regency to already realize the anticipated $27 million of general and administration (G&A) cost synergies. In fact, management anticipates realizing another $27 million in G&A synergies in 2018. In the first-quarter too, we anticipate this merger to drive robust growth in rental rates and occupancy levels.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $263.1 million, indicating a year-over-year improvement of 38.9%.However, with online retailers venturing into the grocery business, the shift of sales from the brick and mortar space to online stores is emerging as a pressing concern. This is adversely affecting the retail tenants’ sales, leading them to reconsider their footprint and opt for store closures, thereby, resulting in lesser demand for retail real estate space.Regency’s activities during the quarter could not gain adequate analyst confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share of 94 cents for the first quarter remained unchanged over the past month. However, the figure witnessed rise of 4.4% from the prior-year quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Regency Center will likely beat estimates this season.

308,SPG,"Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report) has a diversified exposure to retail assets in the United States and abroad. Further, the company’s efforts to support omni-channel retailing, portfolio-restructuring initiatives and healthy balance sheet augur well for long-term growth.However, as Simon Property is trying to counter the choppy retail real estate environment through various initiatives, these require upfront costs and thus, it is likely to limit any robust growth in the company's profit margins in the near term. Also, stiff competition from online sales and rise in interest rate pose challenges for the company.Notably, Simon Property has been active in restructuring its portfolio, and is aimed at premium acquisitions and transformative redevelopments. In fact, at the end of the first quarter, it had redevelopment and expansion projects, including the addition of new anchors, in progress at 28 properties across the United States, Canada and Asia.In May, Simon Property launched a $4+ billion of investment plan to transform its properties aimed at creating value and drive footfall at the company's properties. The transformational plans included addition of hotels, restaurants and luxury stores.Also, later in May, Simon Property announced the continuation of its plan to recapture former Sears locations across its portfolio, transforming those into retail, fitness, dining and entertainment hubs.In fact, earlier in April, Simon Property announced the company’s transformational redevelopment plans for the former Sears stores, at five major locations. The properties included in the refurbishment plan were Brea Mall (Brea, CA), Burlington Mall (Burlington, MA), Midland Park Mall (Midland, TX), Ocean County Mall (Toms River, NJ) and Ross Park Mall (Pittsburgh, PA). Enhancements to the properties included entertainment, fitness, restaurants and dining pavilions, residential, as well as new retail brands.The company has also resorted to micro-retail modeling that offers store units ranging from 20-200 square feet of space. With such a huge pipeline, the company is well poised to effectively leverage the improving spending habits of wealthier customers amid improving economy.Such initiatives are expected to draw more traffic at the company’s properties.In addition, Simon Property boasts a strong and improving balance sheet. At the end of first-quarter 2018, the company had more than $7.0 billion of liquidity. This comprised cash on hand, including its share of joint-venture cash, and available capacity under the company’s revolving credit facilities.Furthermore, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT shareholders and Simon Property remains committed to that. The company has steadily raised its dividend, over the past years, increasing from $3.50 in 2011 to the present annualized rate of $7.80 per share.Nevertheless, with e-retail taking precedence, retail REITs continue to suffer as mall traffic has taken a beating. In fact, with e-commerce gaining market share from the brick-and-mortar stores, retailers are compelled to reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures, while others unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies.This tepid environment has also resulted in tenants demanding substantial lease concessions, which, however, mall landlords find unjustified. As such, retail REITs like Simon Property, GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM  -  Free Report), Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report) and others have felt the heat, and the companies’ share prices have been suffering for the past 12 months.Further, though Simon Property is putting in every effort to enhance the value of its assets, implementation of such measures requires a decent upfront cost. This would, therefore, limit any robust growth in its near-term profit margins.Rise in interest rate remains another concern as this might restrict the company’s ability to refinance existing debt and increase the interest cost on new debt. This, in turn, is feared to negatively impact the company’s financial results and dividend payout.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have outperformed the industry it belongs to in the past three months. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Simon Property has gained 6.2%, while the industry has rallied 4%.

309,SPG,"Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report) recently announced the company’s substantial redevelopment program at five properties. This move will help the retail REIT transform the former Sears stores and draw more traffic to these malls to benefit the existing retailers.The properties included in the refurbishment plan are Brea Mall (Brea, CA), Burlington Mall (Burlington, MA), Midland Park Mall (Midland, TX), Ocean County Mall (Toms River, NJ), and Ross Park Mall (Pittsburgh, PA).Per the plan, Brea Mall will have additional mixed uses. This comprises a new three-story, 120,000-square-foot Life Time Athletic healthy living, healthy aging, healthy entertainment destination, residential, entertainment, restaurants and new retail brands. In the Burlington Mall, the spaces will be revamped into new shops and restaurants, while in Ross Park Mall, the refurbishment plan includes a new dining hall, new retailers, restaurants, entertainment on three levels.Further, the Ocean County Mall plan comprises inclusion of new stores and transformation into dining and fitness spaces. At the Midland Park Mall, renovations include additions of two new restaurants and a new bigger Dillard's store, along with a new-to-the-market large format retailer, per the company’s press release.Notably, for the past few years, mall traffic has been plagued with challenges thanks to the shift in shopping patterns, with e-retail taking precedence, keeping retail REITs on tenterhooks. This has shrunk demand for retail real estate space, as changing shopping patterns are compelling retailers to reconsider their footprint, and eventually opt for store closures or file bankruptcies.This has been a prevailing concern for retail REITs like Simon Property, GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM  -  Free Report), Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report) and others.Amid these, Simon Property has been making concerted efforts focused on overhauling its properties and increasingly adopting omni-channel strategies. These will help the company counter retail blues and make its shopping malls more alluring.In line with this, the company is initiating programs and events, as well as entering into several partnerships for upgrading services and amenities provided to its consumers. In fact, over the past five years, this retail REIT invested more than $5 billion in development projects, and further intends to invest around $1 billion annually through 2018 for development and redevelopment projects.   At the end of fourth-quarter 2017, the company had redevelopment and expansion projects, including the addition of new anchors, in progress at 25 properties across the United States, Canada and Asia. With such a huge pipeline, Simon Property is well poised to effectively leverage the improving spending habits of wealthier customers amid a strengthening economy.Simon Property has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

310,SPG,"For the past few years, mall traffic has been plagued with challenges thanks to the shift in shopping patterns, with e-retail taking precedence, keeping retail REITs on tenterhooks.

However among those, reputed retail REIT — Simon Property Group — has been making concerted efforts focused on overhauling its properties and increasingly adopting omni-channel strategies. These will help the company to counter the retail blues and make its shopping malls more alluring.In line with this, the company has re-launched its brand and marketing programs. Moreover, with the omni-channel strategy gaining popularity among retailers, Simon Property is initiating programs and events, as well as entering into several partnerships for upgrading services and amenities provided to its consumers. In fact, over the last five years, this retail REIT invested more than $5 billion in development projects, and further intends to invest around $1 billion annually through 2018 for development and redevelopment projects.   Simon Property has been active in restructuring its portfolio, and is aimed at premium acquisitions and transformative redevelopments.

With such a huge pipeline, it is well poised to effectively leverage the improving spending habits of wealthier customers amid a strengthening economy.In addition, Simon Property boasts a strong and improving balance sheet. At the end of the last reported quarter, the company had around $8.0 billion of liquidity. Also, this February, Simon Property announced amendment and extension of its 3.5-billion unsecured multi-currency revolving credit facility. The newly refinanced credit facility, when combined with the existing $4.0-billion revolver, offers the company $7.5 billion of total revolving credit capacity.Furthermore, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT shareholders and Simon Property remains committed to that. Concurrent with the fourth-quarter earnings release, the company announced a quarterly dividend of $1.95 per share, denoting an increase of 5.4% sequentially and 11.4% year over year. It has steadily raised its dividend over the past years, increasing from $3.50 in 2011 to the current annualized rate of $7.80 per share.Nevertheless, though Simon Property is putting in every effort to enhance the value of its assets, implementation of such measures requires a decent upfront cost.

311,SPG,"GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report) enjoys a portfolio of high-quality retail properties across attractive locations in the United States. Further, its tenant roster includes a number of reputed names. GGP also focuses on omni-channel retailing and other initiatives which are encouraging. Nevertheless, declining traffic at malls, store closures and bankruptcies have emerged as a pressing concern for GGP as the trend is curtailing demand for the retail real estate space.Though the company is making efforts to counter the pressure through various initiatives, the implementation of such measures requires a decent upfront cost and will likely limit any robust growth in profit margins in the near term.In February, the retail REIT, GGP reported fourth-quarter 2017 funds from operations (FFO) per share of 48 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a cent. The figure was also higher than the prior-year quarter tally of 43 cents. Results indicated growth in same-store net operating income of 1.3% from the prior-year period.Notably, retailers are continuously evolving and in order to maximize revenues, they are using brick-and-mortar presence and internet together. Amid this, GGP is focusing on omni-channel retailing as it generates higher sales. Since early 2011, the company invested around $2.86 billion, improving its centers.  It is providing tenants with access to retail, dining and entertainment hubs in some of the best trade areas in the United States.Such moves are strategic fits as they boost the shopping experience and enhance sales volume at tenant stores, consequently raising demand for the company’s assets. Furthermore, GGP has been making efforts to add residential units to its retail centers in order to densify its retail centers. Such developments lower the distance between housing and retail destinations while steering a dependable traffic.Recently, as per a Reuters report, asset manager, Brookfield Property Partners made a revised acquisition offer to GGP. Per people familiar with the matter, the revised offer boasts of an elevated cash component. Notably, in November 2017, Brookfield offered $14.8 billion or $23 per share in a cash-and-stock offer to acquire the remaining 66% stake in GGP. However, GGP’s special board committee rejected the offer. The negotiations between the companies are ongoing and the exact value of the new offer is not known. The special board committee has yet to accept the offer.However, the U.S. retail real estate market has been plagued with issues like downsizing and bankruptcies of retailers in recent times. This is because mall traffic continues to suffer amid a rapid shift in customers’ shopping preferences and patterns with online purchases growing by leaps and bounds.This has emerged as a pressing concern for retail REITs including Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report), The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report), Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT  -  Free Report), GGP and others as the trend is curtailing demand for the retail real estate space considerably and curbing the landlord’s pricing power and occupancy level of properties. Moreover, such a choppy environment has led tenants to demand substantial lease concessions but mall landlords are finding these unjustified.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock outperformed its industry in the past six months.

312,SPG,"We are in one of the busiest weeks of the current reporting cycle, and it’s natural for investors to be lured by big profits and huge surprises of companies that have already released their quarterly numbers. But instead of accumulating the stock later, investing in ones that are poised for a beat can be far more rewarding. This is because earnings beats essentially raise investors’ confidence in a stock and results in further price appreciation.And if you believed that the rate hike in March and projections for the number of increases this year and in the next have put REITs in the back foot, then perhaps you need to reconsider. Because not only have the REITs made their balance sheets less leveraged, they have locked in the low rates by borrowing at a fixed rate and extending the average maturity of their debt outstanding to more than six years. This financial flexibility is encouraging down the line for their operational efficiencies.Moreover, high consumer confidence in an improving economy and job market gains are fueling consumption levels. In fact, with one eventually requiring “real space” for economic activities, prospects of the real estate sector are getting a boost as growth in the economy translates into greater demand for real estate and higher occupancy levels.Particularly, consider the industrial REITs where availability fell for 31 straight quarters to 7.3% for the U.S. industrial market in first-quarter 2018, per a study by the commercial real estate services firm — CBRE Group Inc. (CBRE  -  Free Report). High consumption levels, strengthening e-commerce market, and a healthy manufacturing environment amid a recovering economy and job market are fueling demand.Also, despite several preeminent retail bankruptcy filings and record-high defaults by retail corporates, recent data from Reis shows that for the neighborhood and community shopping centers, the vacancy rate remained moderately unchanged at 10% for first-quarter 2018.This stability clearly reflects the concerted efforts of the retail landlords to boost productivity of retail assets by trying to grab attention from new and productive tenants. Also, with limited retail supply, refurbishment of existing properties is gaining traction. Retail REITs are now avoiding heavy dependence on apparel and accessories, and rather expanding dining options, opening movie theaters, offering recreational facilities and opening fitness centers in particular.Moreover, in the national apartment market, despite high supply and a seasonally slow first-quarter leasing period, thanks to the cold weather that inhibits shift of households, occupancy level remained elevated and came in at 94.5% this March, just a notch lower than the prior-year tally of 95%, per the latest report from the real estate technology and analytics firm — RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report). This is clearly reflective of decent apartment demand.In the office sector too, though the supply of new office space has slightly pushed up occupancy levels (by 20 bps) to 13.3% (per CBRE Group data), demand for high-quality, efficient space remains strong. This is indicated by the pre-leasing of around 70% of space being delivered in Q1. Also, improved business travel demand with lower cancellations and higher group spends, plus strong demand from leisure division signal better prospects for hotel REITs.The Zacks MethodologyHowever, in spite of the drivers, choosing the right stock could be quite difficult unless one knows the proper method. To make the task simple we rely on the Zacks methodology, combining a favorable Zacks Rank — Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — and a positive Earnings ESP.Our proprietary methodology, Earnings ESP, shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. And research shows that for stocks with this combination of rank and ESP, chances of a positive earnings surprise are as high as 70%.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Here are three REITs that have the right combination of elements to deliver an earnings beat when they release their quarterly numbers:Pebblebrook Hotel Trust (PEB  -  Free Report) has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +8.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at 58 cents, denoting a year-over-year projected increase of roughly 7.4%. The company has been a steady performer, having exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 11.4%.Bethesda, MD-based Pebblebrook Hotel Trust is a hotel REIT focusing on opportunistic acquisitions and investments in mainly upper upscale, full-service hotels located in urban markets in major gateway cities in the United States.

313,SPG,"Recently, Prologis Inc.’s (PLD  -  Free Report) board approved a 9% hike in its annualized dividend rate to $1.92 from the $1.76 paid earlier. As a result, the company will now pay 48 cents per share as against 44 cents paid in the prior quarter.The new dividend will be paid on Mar 29 to shareholders of record on Mar 15, 2018. Based on this hiked value, annualized yield comes in at about 3.2%, considering Prologis' closing price of $59.94 on Feb 22.We believe Prologis has an adequate capacity to support its dividend policy. Last month, the company reported decent fourth-quarter 2017 core funds from operations (FFO). It experienced solid operating results and higher net promote income. Net effective rent change improved in the quarter, while period-end occupancy also remained at a record high.Notably, the industrial real estate market has been enjoying elevated demand for logistics infrastructure amid an e-commerce boom, recovering economy and job market, as well as healthy manufacturing environment. This has been providing Prologis ample scope to tap growth opportunities.In addition, Prologis’ build-to-suit activity remained solid in 2017. The company completed 33 build-to-suit projects, covering more than 12 million square feet of space, in the year. It also started 38 projects, which have a total expected investment of nearly $1.1 billion, in 2017. Furthermore, the company’s ratio of built-to-suit activity to overall development starts achieved the highest level since 2013. This high number of build-to-suit development projects highlights the advantageous location of the company’s rich land bank and the robust network of multi-site customers which is increasingly focusing on e-commerce.Prologis is also focused on bolstering its liquidity. The company continues to have significant liquidity of $3.6 billion. In addition, for the full year, the company reported a 340-basis-point contraction in leverage to 23.7% on a market capitalization basis and debt-to-adjusted EBITDA improved around 0.2x-4.6x. Given its balance-sheet strength and prudent financial management, the company remains well poised to capitalize on growth opportunities and reward shareholders accordingly.However, a whole lot of new buildings are slated to be completed and made available in the market in the near term, leading to higher supply, and lesser scope for rent and occupancy growth. Also, rate hikes have added to the company’s woes.Prologis currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The stock has dropped 10.6% in the past three months, outperforming the 12.5% loss incurred by the industry it belongs to.Solid dividend payouts remain arguably the biggest enticement for REIT investors. Apart from Prologis, some other REITs which announced dividend hikes in recent months include Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report), AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report) and Realty Income Corporation (O  -  Free Report).Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represent funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

314,SPG,"Vornado Realty Trust (VNO  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 30, after the closing bell. Revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share are expected to decline year over year.In the prior quarter, this NY-based real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a positive surprise of 5.4% in terms of FFO per share. The results reflected growth in occupancy and same-store net operating income (NOI) in the New York portfolio.Over the trailing four quarters, Vornado surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three occasions and missed in one, witnessing an average negative surprise of 0.22%. This is depicted in the graph below:Vornado Realty Trust Price and EPS Surprise Vornado Realty Trust Price and EPS Surprise | Vornado Realty Trust QuoteShares of Vornado have underperformed the industry in the last three months. While the company’s shares have lost 9.6%, the industry has witnessed a decline of 7.3%.Let’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderVornado boasts a concentration of high-quality assets and a strategic focus on expanding its market share in New York City office and Manhattan street retail. In addition, the company owns 555 California Street in the heart of San Francisco's Financial District as well as the MART in Chicago's River North District, which are iconic assets in signature cities. This focus on having assets in such a few select high-rent, high barrier-to-entry geographic markets, as well as a diversified tenant base that includes several industry bellwethers, are expected to drive steady cash flows and fuel growth engine in the to be reported quarter.Vornado has been actively repositioning its portfolio. In line with this, it has been involved in opportunistic acquisitions and divestitures along with business spin-offs. Though such efforts to streamline its business are commendable, the dilutive effects of these moves cannot be avoided in the near term.Moreover, the company announced that the first-quarter 2018 financial results will include certain items that will have a negative impact of 37 cents on its total FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions. However, this amount will be excluded from its corresponding adjusted figure.Vornado will be recording $34.7 million worth of expenses, relating to the change in fair value of marketable securities as a result of new GAAP accounting standard effective Jan 1, 2018.  Earlier, the same was recognized through “accumulated other comprehensive income” on the company’s consolidated balance sheets and did not impact its consolidated statements of income.Moreover, Vornado will be recording $23.5 million of expenses that are linked to its share of possible additional New York City real property-transfer taxes.The company will also record expenses of $14.5 million, relating to the write off of issuance costs of Series G and Series I, which were redeemed in January 2018.Vornado will also report net loss from other items, amounting to $6.5 million.The company stated that the aforementioned figures are preliminary estimates and are conditioned on the completion of the financial closing procedures. Hence, it does not assure any consistency between these estimates and the final results.We also anticipate a fall in the company’s total revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues for the first quarter is pegged at $533 million. This reflects a decline of 14.1% as compared with the prior-year quarter.Further, the company’s management and leasing fees are expected to remain flat, sequentially. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.71 million indicates no change from the prior quarter.Prior to the first-quarter earnings release, there is lack of any solid catalyst for raising optimism about the company’s business activities and prospects. As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share, which is now 88 cents, witnessed a decline of 1.1% over the past month. Also, this indicates a year-over-year decline of 18.5%.In addition, over the past month, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2018 FFO per share, stands at 88 cents decreased 1.1%, reflecting analysts’ bearish sentiments.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict FFO beat for Vornado this time around. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.(You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.)Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Vornado is -10.63%.Zacks Rank: Vornado has a favorable Zacks Rank #3. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive surprise.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT sector that you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this quarter:Taubman Centers, Inc.

This is depicted in the graph below:Simon Property Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Simon Property Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Simon Property Group, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsWhile challenges faced by retail REITs have been well documented, recent data from Reis states that U.S. retail real estate vacancies remained moderately unchanged at 10% for first-quarter 2018. Although the first few months of 2018 witnessed several preeminent retail bankruptcy filings and record-high defaults by retail corporates, stability in the vacancy rates indicates an encouraging picture for retail REITs this year.Simon Property has been quickly adapting to the changing retail landscape by increasingly adopting omni-channel strategies and overhauling properties. Importantly, the company is entering into several partnerships for upgrading services and amenities provided to its customers.It has also re-launched its brand and marketing programs to strengthen the company’s relationship with customers and drive traffic. These efforts by the company to beat retail blues raise our optimism.Simon Property has resorted to micro-retail modeling that offers store units ranging from 20-200 square feet of space. Such moves make its shopping malls appealing and will be conducive to revenue growth in the to-be-reported quarter.  Further, Simon Property has improved the company’s financial strength by amending and extending its 3.5-billion unsecured multi-currency revolving credit facility. In fact, the credit facility, when combined with the existing $4.0-billion revolver, offers the company $7.5 billion of total revolving credit capacity. Increased financial flexibility supports its active redevelopment and expansion pipelineFinally, shares of Simon Property have depreciated 10.5%, versus the 11.8% loss incurred by the industry, in three months’ time. Earnings WhispersAccording to our quantitative model, chances of Simon Property likely beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first quarter are high.

We also see better-than-expected results from ADP’s (ADP  -  Free Report) monthly private sector payroll report.In fact, the 234K new jobs created for January was well ahead of the 180K anticipated, and although December’s results were revised downward by 8000 jobs, it still tallied 242K.

319,SPG,"Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust (PEI  -  Free Report) — better known as PREIT — is leaving no stone unturned to attract consumers to its shopping malls. In fact, the company recently announced the remerchandising of Dartmouth Mall with a few new retailers taking up space, which is situated in southeast Massachusetts.This comes as part of PREIT’s proactive anchor redevelopment initiative, which aims at diversifying the tenant mix, meeting demand of the shoppers and boosting sales per square foot of the retail property. With its continuous efforts, the company was successful in increasing the comp sales year over year in Dartmouth Mall by 9% to $509 per square foot for past 12 months, calculated as of January 2018.This latest efforts include the addition of the brand Newbury Comics, which focuses on music, movies and pop culture items. It is intended to open in spring and will take up 3,900 square feet of space.  Forever 21 will be occupying 11,500 square feet of retail space for its outlet. Another new tenant that is slated to open its doors this fall is Eblens, which is a fashion label in England. It will be leasing 6,000 square feet.Recently, a few retailers have also opened stores in Dartmouth Mall. Specifically, H&M opened a brand new store, spanning 23,000 square feet of space in the property. Encore, a shoe brand and Torrid, a brand specialized in fashion, have also launched their stores recently. Moreover, earlier in 2015, AMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC  -  Free Report) renovated their theaters by adding reclining seats and a bar in the mall.Joseph F. Coradino, CEO of PREIT informed, ""With a well-balanced and high performing mix of retail, dining and entertainment options for local consumers, Dartmouth Mall has become the dominant shopping hub within a 30-mile radius – with growing market share and more new additions slated.""Notably, the shrinking mall traffic, store closures and retailer bankruptcies, amid aggressive growth in online sales, have kept retail REITs, including PREIT and others like Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report) and Kimco Realty (KIM  -  Free Report), on tenterhooks. In addition, tenants are demanding substantial lease concessions, owing to a turbulent retail real estate market scenario.Nonetheless, retail REITs are countering this dreary situation and putting in every effort to enhance the productivity of the malls by revamping their properties and trying to grab attention from new and productive tenants, and disposing off the non-productive ones. While portfolio-redevelopment efforts are a strategic fit for the long term, such measures tend to drag margins in the near term.Amid the dull retail real estate environment, this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company underperformed its industry in the past three months.

320,SPG,"We are in the heart of the Q4 reporting cycle and the real estate investment trust (REIT) space is buzzing with activity. In fact, there are a number of Q4 earnings releases queued for this week, of which AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report), Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report), Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. (MAA  -  Free Report) and Duke Realty Corporation (DRE  -  Free Report) will release quarterly numbers on Jan 31.No doubt, the December rate hike and possibilities of further increases in rates this year have kept investors in the REIT space worried to some extent. However, with underlying asset categories and the location of properties playing a crucial role in determining the performance of REITs, not all players in the space have equal chances to excel or fall behind.Going by numbers, per a study by the commercial real estate services’ firm — CBRE Group Inc.  — the overall U.S. office vacancy rate expanded 10 basis points (bps) to 13.0% during fourth-quarter 2017 amid an uptick in supply. Nevertheless, the national office vacancy rate still hovers near its post-recession low and vacancy continues to drop in majority of the U.S. office markets. Moreover, solid demand, recovering economy and job market, strengthening e-commerce market and healthy manufacturing environment are helping the industrial asset category to grab attention.Further, per a study by the real estate technology and analytics firm — RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report) — the U.S. apartment market reported moderate rent growth for the calendar year 2017 and seasonal pricing cuts in the fourth quarter. While U.S. apartment rents increased at a modest rate of 2.5% in 2017, effective rents for new leases edged down 0.9% during the quarter. However, national apartment occupancy came in at 95.1% at the end of the quarter, remaining stable year over year.Finally, mall traffic has been severely affected and retail landlords have consequently felt the heat due to consumers’ preferences inclining more and more toward online retail. However, retail REITs are putting in every effort to boost productivity of malls, by trying to grab attention from new and productive tenants, and disposing the non-productive ones. Retail REITs have been avoiding heavy dependence on apparel and accessories, but expanding dining options, opening movie theaters and offering recreational facilities to boost traffic. However, the upfront costs associated with such efforts are likely to limit near term margin improvement.Per our latest Earnings Preview, overall earnings for the Finance sector, of which REITs are part, are expected to be up 8.4% year over year on 2.4% higher revenues. This represents the Q4 earnings and revenue expectations for the sector as a whole — i.e. after combining the reported actual results with the still-to-come estimates.Therefore, surprises might be in store for some REITs, while others might disappoint this earnings season. So let’s have a close look at the factors that will impact the above-mentioned REITs’ fourth-quarter results.Residential REIT — AvalonBay Communities — is well poised to grow on the back of rising demand from household formation and favorable demographics. Also, increasing consumer confidence backed by job growth, higher wages and a healthier balance sheet promise bright prospects for this Arlington, VA-based REIT.In fact, the company is also likely to continue experiencing high occupancy. Although the pace of rental growth has slowed down from the prior years, it is now likely to achieve stability. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $555.2 million, denoting an expected increase of 7.1% year over year. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for funds from operations (FFO) per share in the soon-to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $2.24, indicating a 5.7% increase year over year.However, the fourth quarter is seasonally sluggish. Moreover, there is presence of elevated supply in quite a few of the company’s markets. In addition, there is high concession activity amid elevated supply, which remains a concern. (Read more: AvalonBay to Post Q4 Earnings: What's in the Offing?)AvalonBay has a Zacks Rank # 3 (Hold) and Earnings ESP of -0.07%. Though the Zacks Rank is favorable, the negative ESP lowers chances of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Notably, in the preceding four quarters, the company surpassed estimates on one occasion and missed in the other three, as shown in the chart below:AvalonBay Communities, Inc.

QuoteIndianapolis, IN-based retail real estate investment trust (REIT) — Simon Property Group — has been undertaking various initiatives, of late, to strengthen its relationship with customers. In addition, it is focusing on omni-channel strategies to gain popularity among retailers. Further, in the fourth quarter, the company initiated various programs and events to steer mall traffic.Nevertheless, with more and more consumers shifting to online purchases, mall traffic continues to remain considerably depressed. This has resulted in an increasing number of retailers joining the dot-com bandwagon. Also, retailers are reconsidering their footprint and opting for store closures. While Simon Property is making efforts to beat these retail blues through various initiatives, implementation of such measures requires a decent upfront cost. Consequently, this might impede any robust growth in the company’s profit margins in the quarter under review.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth-quarter 2017 revenues is currently pegged at $1.4 billion — indicating projected growth of around 0.5% year over year. Moreover, The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter FFO per share is currently pegged at $3.12.

Further, favorable demographics and strong job growth in target markets are anticipated to drive demand for MAA’s properties. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter total revenues is currently pegged at $386.3 million, denoting projected growth of 25.8% year over year.However, it should be noted that the fourth quarter is seasonally sluggish. In addition, supply of new units increased in a number of markets, including Dallas and Austin. Hence, any robust growth in its same-store portfolio is likely to remain restricted in the quarter to be reported. Also, high concession activity amid higher supply adds to its woes.As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for the quarter is pegged at $1.48, projecting a 1.3% decrease year over year. (Read more: What to Expect From Mid-America Apartment Q4 Earnings?)Mid-America Apartment Communities carries a Zacks Rank of 3.

Price and EPS Surprise  Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. QuoteIn recent years, Indianapolis, IN-based Duke Realty has made concerted efforts to enhance its industrial portfolio. This augurs well because the industrial-asset category has been grabbing attention as it is experiencing high demand, with the economy and job market displaying signs of recovery and the manufacturing environment remaining healthy.Moreover, to simplify the company’s business model and turn it into a leading domestic pure play industrial REIT, Duke Realty has made rigorous efforts to lower its suburban office assets. Subsequently, in May 2017, the company inked a deal to sell its medical office buildings (MOB) portfolio for a price of $2.8 billion.While such streamlining measures are a strategic fit for the long term, the near-term dilutive effect cannot be bypassed. In fact, such short-term impact will likely drag the company’s quarterly results. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $175 million, indicating a decline of 14.3% year over year. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth-quarter FFO per share of 30 cents denote a projected descend of 3.2% from a year ago.

321,SPG,"Benchmarks closed in negative territory on Thursday following concerns over a likelihood of a government shutdown. Sectors like real estate and utilities, which are considered as alternatives to bonds, declined after yield on 10-year Treasury notes reached its highest level since 2014. Additionally, increase in U.S. gasoline inventories and sharp rise in domestic crude production weighed on oil prices, which in turn led the energy sector downward.How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) decreased 0.4%, or 96.32 points to close at 26,115.65. The S&P 500 fell 0.2% to close at 2,798.03. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,296.05, losing 2.23 points. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 2.6% to close at 12.22. A total of around 6.93 billion shares were traded on Thursday, higher than the last 20-session average of 6.3 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 2.64-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.74-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.Shutdown Specter Weighs on BenchmarksAfter closing at new all-time highs on Wednesday all the three key U.S. indexes fell on Thursday following concerns of partial government shutdown.  On Thursday, the House voted 230 to 197 in favor of passing a short-term spending bill, in order to avoid government shutdown. However, the bill is expected to face a setback in the Senate, which in turn raised concerns of a possible government shutdown. Following this development, nine of the 11 key S&P 500 sectors fell during the day.Higher rate environment and optimism of a steady economic growth weighed on bond prices. Lower bond prices supported the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, which increased from 2.579% to 2.611% on Thursday, reaching its best level since September 2014. Higher treasury yields weighed on steady dividend paying sectors like real estate and utilities.The Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE) declined 1%, becoming the worst performing sector of the S&P 500. Some of its key holdings, including Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report) and American Tower Corporation (AMT  -  Free Report) fell 1.9% and 1.1%, respectively.

Also, U.S. crude production increased 258,000 barrels per day to 9.75 million barrels, after falling in the preceding week. Increase in gasoline inventories and stronger domestic crude production led both WTI and Brent crude to decrease 0.03% and 0.1% to $63.95 per barrel and $69.31 a barrel, respectively.Fall in oil prices led the Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) to decline 0.8%, which was second biggest loser among the S&P 500 sectors. Some of its key components, including Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) and Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) fell 0.6% and 0.7%, respectively.

322,SPG,"Retail REIT Realty Income Corporation (O  -  Free Report) has announced a hike in its common stock monthly cash dividend, rejoicing shareholders. This marks the company’s 95th dividend increase since its NYSE listing in 1994. The company will now pay 21.90 cents per share against 21.25 cents paid earlier. The new dividend also denotes a 4% increase compared to the same month in the prior year.Realty Income will pay the dividend on Feb 15 to shareholders of record as of Feb 1, 2018. The latest dividend rate marks an annualized amount of $2.628 per share versus the prior rate of $2.55 per share.Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT investors and Realty Income remains committed to boosting shareholders’ wealth. The company enjoys a trademark on the phrase “The Monthly Dividend Company” and the February 2018 dividend payment not only marks its 571 consecutive monthly dividend payouts throughout its 49-year operating history, but also 81 consecutive quarterly increases.In fact, the company has generated a compound average annual dividend growth of around 4.7% since its listing on the NYSE. Given its financial position and lower debt-to-equity ratio compared to that of the industry, this dividend rate is likely to be sustainable.Notably, dwindling mall traffic amid shift of consumers toward online channels, store closures and bankruptcy of retailers have emerged as pressing concerns for most retail REITs, including Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report), GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report) and Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report). However, not all are facing the brunt, as a few companies are still gaining even in this dismal scenario, backed by the robust business models.In fact, this freestanding retail REIT — Realty Income — derives more than 90% of its annualized retail rental revenues from tenants belonging to service, non-discretionary and low-price retail business. Such businesses are less susceptible to economic recessions and competition from Internet retailing.Moreover, the company’s solid underlying real estate quality and prudent underwriting at acquisitions have helped maintain its high occupancy levels consistently. Additionally, its same-store rent growth displayed limited operational volatility.Realty Income also adheres to a conservative capital structure. It has modest leverage, robust liquidity, and continued access to attractively priced equity and debt capital. In addition, it has a well-laddered debt maturity schedule.Nonetheless, the company’s substantial exposure to single-tenant assets raises its risks associated with tenant default. Further, generation of notable rental revenues from assets leased to drug stores and rate hike add to its woes.Shares of Realty Income have underperformed the industry it belongs to, in three months’ time. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have descended 5.9%, while the industry incurred loss of 2.8% during this time frame.

323,SPG,"Retail REIT Regency Centers Corporation (REG  -  Free Report) recently revised its outlook for 2017 and provided the preliminary guidance for 2018. Moreover, the company reported its fourth-quarter 2017 acquisitions and dispositions.Specifically, the company projects core funds from operations (FFO) per share for 2017 in the band of $3.68-$3.70, backed by same-property net operating income (NOI) growth, excluding termination fees, of +/- 3.6% on a pro-rata basis. The company had earlier estimated core FFO per share in the range of $3.66-$3.70 on 3.2-4.0% growth in same-property NOI. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is $3.69.Moreover, the preliminary guidance for 2018 includes core FFO per share projection of $3.76-$3.83, on same-property NOI growth, excluding termination fees, of 2.25-3.25% on a pro-rata basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $3.83. The company has also introduced an operating FFO per share outlook in the band of $3.48-$3.54 for the year. Notably, the company is considering operating FFO to measure earnings growth because the purchase accounting adjustments required with the Equity One merger would have an uneven impact on earnings.Regarding investment activity, Regency Centers stated that it closed acquisitions worth around $150 million during fourth-quarter 2017. This included the 132,000-square foot neighborhood shopping center — Scripps Ranch Marketplace (San Diego, CA) — for $81.6 million. This property is anchored by Vons. The other asset is 150,000-square foot infill retail center — Roosevelt Square (Seattle, WA) — anchored by Whole Foods Market which was purchased for $68.3 million.On the other hand, the company reaped approximately $103 million of gross proceeds from the sale of five shopping centers during the quarter. Further, it commenced the development of two projects, with Regency’s share of net estimated development costs aggregating $39 million. This included Wegmans anchored 174,000-square foot shopping center — Midtown East — in Raleigh, NC, and Publix Greenwise anchored 51,000-square foot shopping center Indigo Square in Charleston, SC.In addition, Regency received around $89.1 million of net proceeds following the final settlement of its forward sale agreement that took place on Dec 14, 2017, through delivery of 1,250,000 shares of the company’s common stock.Notably, at a time when shrinking footfall at malls amid rise in online channels, store closures and bankruptcy of retailers have emerged as a pressing concerns for most retail REITs, including Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report), GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report) and Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report), Regency is focused on building a premium portfolio of grocery-anchored shopping centers. Such centers are usually necessity driven and steer a dependable traffic.The company has considerable experience in the retail real estate industry and has developed several real estate projects over the years. However, recent efforts of e-retailers to expand in the grocery business have emerged as a concern. Rate hike and stiff completion also add to its woes.Over the past three months, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have outperformed the industry it belongs to.

324,SPG,"Digital Realty Trust (DLR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release first-quarter results on Apr 26, after the market closes.Last quarter, this San Francisco, CA-based date center real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a positive surprise of 1.97%. Results were supported by growth in revenues and rental rates on renewal leases.Over the trailing four quarters, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all four occasions, the average beat being nearly 2.18%. This is depicted in the graph below:Digital Realty Trust, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Digital Realty Trust, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Digital Realty Trust, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for Digital Realty prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderData-center REITs are experiencing a boom market. In fact, growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data, and an increasing number of companies opting for third-party IT infrastructure remain primary catalysts.Additionally, demand has been outpacing supply in top-tier data-center markets and despite enjoying high occupancy, these markets are absorbing new construction at a faster pace. Additionally, according to a Cisco forecast, data-center IP traffic is projected to witness a compound annual growth rate of 25%, over the 2016-2021 period. Further, per Gartner’s report, worldwide IT spending is projected to increase 3.2% in 2018, while worldwide server shipments are expected to rise 3.5%. This, along with an improved outlook for economic growth, is anticipated to drive demand for data centers.Notably, Digital Realty, with its high-quality date centers, is well poised to benefit from this trend. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for occupancy of 90% for the first quarter indicates year-over-year growth of 1.1%.In addition to this, accretive acquisitions are likely to stoke the company’s top-line growth. On Apr 4, this REIT announced a partnership with the Singapore Internet Exchange. This move is aimed at providing local peering at the company’s Singapore data-center facilities in Jurong West and Loyang East. This move is a strategic fit as Singapore serves as the Internet gateway to Asian markets and hence, it will enable Digital Realty establish a strong foothold in the continent. Also, the company has been actively adding data centers to its portfolio. Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net rentable area at 26,780 million square feet compares favorably with the 22,680-million-square-foot portfolio which was owned by the company in the prior-year quarter.Furthermore, the company aims to have an investment grade balance sheet and is committed to a conservative capital structure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fixed charge coverage ratio is 4.31 as compared to the year-earlier quarter ratio of 4.2. This reflects higher solvency and efficient capital management.However, Digital Realty faces intense competition in its industry. In fact, the company competes with several data-center developers, owners and operators, many of which enjoy ownership of similar assets in locations same as Digital Realty. Also, there are a number of local developers in the United States, and several regional operators in Europe, Asia and Australia. Amid this, aggressive pricing pressure is predicted to have been prevalent in the data-center market in the quarter to be reported.Hence, prior to the first-quarter earnings release, there is lack of any solid catalyst. As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of funds from operations (FFO) per share for the first quarter remained unchanged at $1.57 over the past month.Also, Digital Realty’s shares have declined 7.7% in the past three months, underperforming the 7.3% loss incurred by the industry. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Digital Realty will likely beat estimates this season.

325,SPG,"Iron Mountain Inc. (IRM  -  Free Report) is set to release first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, before the market closes.Last quarter, this real estate investment trust’s (REIT) normalized funds from operations (FFO) of 53 cents per share lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 57 cents. Nonetheless, fourth-quarter 2017 revenues of $991 million improved 6.1% year over year.Over the preceding four quarters, the company missed the FFO per share estimates in three occasions and beat in the other, resulting in an average negative surprise of 2.23%. This is depicted in the graph below:Iron Mountain Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise  Iron Mountain Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Iron Mountain Incorporated QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderIron Mountain’s focus on setting up data-center businesses bodes well for the company.  Internal storage rental growth rate for 2018 is expected in the 3-3.5% range, backed by volume growth and pricing improvement. We believe stellar organic growth and the company’s initiatives to expand its core storage business will benefit the first-quarter results.In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for storage rentals from North- America data management of $72 million indicates a sequential increase of 4.3%. Likewise, the consensus estimate for storage rentals from Western European business of $80 million reflects an increase of 1.3% from the previous quarter.In addition, the company’s service revenues, which comprise charges for related core service activities and a wide array of complementary products and services, are also expected to moderately improve sequentially. Service revenues from its North American records and information management business will likely be up 0.5% moderately, while the same from the Western Europe business is anticipated to rise nearly 2%.  Nonetheless, Iron Mountain has grown its business principally through acquisitions, which have affected its balance sheet in the form of a high level of goodwill. Hence, a highly leveraged balance sheet is predicted to limit any robust margin improvement.In the past six months, the company has underperformed the industry it belongs to.  The stock has dipped 16.5%, while the industry incurred a loss of 9.8% during this time frame. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Iron Mountain is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

326,SPG,"Kimco Realty (KIM  -  Free Report) has initiated a program, Pop It Up Here!, which will help retailers discover locations for pop-up shops from within its portfolio.With the increased demand for pop-up shops among consumers, retailers are trying to benefit from the growing trend. Generally, pop-up shops are meant to occupy a vacant space for a short period and that’s how retailers can test the demand for the particular product.David Jamieson, chief operating officer of Kimco Realty, thinks retailers like the idea of short-term leasing.  He further added, “Pop-up shops have become a way for retailers to test market ideas, create a customer following, or transition from clicks to bricks without the liability of a long-term lease, and we’re proud to offer a program that assists them in their journey.”Pop It Up Here!, developed by Kimco’s LABS (Leaders Advancing Business Strategy) Program, enables brands to look through the available spaces online that are pre-approved and ready to be moved in. Currently, 34 units across 13 shopping centers are available in six markets for this initiative. The markets include Denver, CO; Dallas, TX; San Francisco, CA; Phoenix, AZ; Bellevue, WA and Wilton, CT.To make its shopping malls more appealing, Kimco is leaving no stone unturned to attract consumers in its shopping malls with such initiatives.Although such revolutionary initiatives are encouraging for the company, retail landlords, including Kimco, Regency Centers Corp.

327,SPG,"Benchmarks ended in negative territory on Wednesday as investors remained indifferent even as Congress passed the much-awaited Republican tax Bill. During the day, all the three key U.S. indexes reached record high levels initially, but finished lower following a pullback. Markets have already traded higher in the last few sessions on optimism over the passage of the tax cut Bill and witnessed a sell-off after both the Houses actually passed the Bill on Wednesday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) decreased 0.1%, to close at 24,726.65. The S&P 500 Index (INX) fell 0.1% to close at 2,679.25. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,960.96, losing 2.39 points. A total of 6.17 billion shares were traded on Wednesday, lower than the last 20-session average of 6.84 billion shares. However, advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.01-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.01-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues. The CBOE VIX decreased 4.4% to close at 9.59.Congress Finally Pass Republican Tax BillOn Tuesday, the House of Representatives passed the Republican tax overhaul Bill. Although, the House passed the tax Bill, it violated Senate rules during this process. The three provisions which were included in the Bill did not fulfill the Byrd Rule. These include criteria used to determine whether private university grants are subject to excise taxes, allowing families to utilize 529 plans to bear home-schooling costs and the name of the Bill itself.The Senate Republicans passed the tax overhaul Bill early Wednesday, excluding the provisions. The Senate voted 51-48 in favor of the Bill, with majority of the Republicans present in the Senate supporting the new tax code. The Bill permanently slashes corporate tax rates from 35% to 21%. Further, companies will be allowed to pay a 5% tax on reinvested earnings and 10% tax on deferred cash earnings. After the Senate passed the tax Bill, the House of Representatives re-voted 224-201 in favor of the Bill, complying with the Senate rules.Optimism regarding lower corporate tax rates has already boosted sentiment for the last few sessions. However, markets witnessed a slight pullback on Wednesday as investors had already priced in the impact of the legislation, which in turn weighed on all the three key U.S. indexes.In the of S&P 500, out of its 10 key sectors, seven of them declined yesterday with both real estate and utilities sectors being key decliners. The Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE) fell 1.1%, becoming the worst performer among the S&P 500 sector. Some of its key holdings including Simon Property Group, Inc.

328,SPG,"With the holiday season in full swing, Simon Property Group (SPG  -  Free Report) is leaving no stone unturned to attract consumer to its shopping malls. In its latest efforts to counter the e-retail pressure, this mall giant launched “Santa Messenger Bot” which will link retail experience with the digital world through Facebook Messenger.The Santa Bot add-on on Facebook Messenger will guide shoppers to purchase gifts by locating an appropriate retail outlet based on their interests and preferences. The company has also organized a series of interesting activities and programs at selective malls. It is set to roll out an augmented reality game — Santa’s Helpers — on a new Simon Family app, which will require gamers to help Santa get ready for Christmas.For added consumer convenience, Simon Property has arranged the “Santa by Appointment” option through which shoppers can make reservations online. Also, the ‘Fast Pass’ option will help customers book an exclusive two-hour window to meet Santa. Further, Simon Properties Malls will be buzzing with programs like “I Saw Santa,” “Pet Photo Night” and “Caring Santa.”Given the ability of people to spend more during the holiday season, such recent efforts to enhance shopping experience will likely drive mall traffic and boost sales.Notably, in a bid to beat the retail blues, Simon Property is focused on offering a comprehensive digital experience to its customers. In August, it rolled out the industry’s first concierge bot service, available on Facebook Messenger, to guide customers at its 208 malls. This chatbox seeks to offer real-time information about Simon’s malls, including store locations, hours of operation, promotions, and other amenities offered in the mall.To make its shopping malls more appealing, the company is overhauling its properties and increasingly adopting omni-channel strategies. It has also resorted to micro-retail modeling that offers store units ranging from 20-200 square feet of space. Further, amid rising popularity of Internet purchases, Simon’s efforts to introduce online brands in the showroom retail space bode well.Although such revolutionary initiatives are encouraging for the company, retail landlords, including Simon Property, Regency Centers Corp.

329,SPG,"Shareholders of Simon Property Group (SPG  -  Free Report) have reasons to cheer. The company recently clinched a victory over Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) in a lawsuit to refrain the latter from proceeding with its plan to close Teavana stores in Simon’s malls.Specifically, according to the New York Post, Starbucks has been temporarily barred by an Indiana judge from shutting down its 77 Teavana stores in Simon’s malls. Per the order, the company can better absorb the financial loss by keeping the stores open than Simon bearing the brunt of withering vacancies.Notably, in July, Starbucks had made an announcement of store closures involving a shutter down of all 379 of its Teavana stores in the next year, with majority expected to close by spring. Though some of the Teavana stores in Simon malls have leases slated for expiry before the spring of 2018, majority of the leases run through January 2027. Starbucks cited disappointing traffic in malls for its decision to close the stores.Simon fought back and alleged that Starbucks’ Teavana store closures in its malls would result in a breach of lease obligations. However, there were no specifications in the lawsuit about the amount of financial relief or damage sought by Simon, per the Indianapolis Business Journal news.Simon further alleged that this was just a lame excuse by Starbucks to refract the blame from itself. In fact, the mall landlord pointed out that the decision of store closures from several retailers like Sports Authority, Gap Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) and Macy’s Inc. (M  -  Free Report), among others, was an outcome of either bankruptcy or financial ruin.However, this is not the case with Starbucks, which has earned reputation for being “one of the largest and most recognized companies in the world.” Rather, the Teavana store-closure move came as the business failed to expand at Starbucks’ anticipated pace, going by Simon’s allegations.As a matter of fact, mall traffic continues to suffer amid rapid shift in consumers’ shopping preferences shifting to online retail. This has made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures over the last several quarters.Further, retailers unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies. This comes as a pressing concern for retail REITs, as this trend has been considerably curtailing demand for the retail real estate space.Moreover, the choppy retail real estate market situation is said to have led to tenants demanding substantial lease concessions, which is considered unjustified by landlords. Also, significant store closures in the middle of the lease term not only harm mall landlords, but also the tenants occupying space in the mall because their shop visits also depend on the mix of specific type of retailers.Shares of Simon Property have underperformed the industry it belongs to, in the year so far. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have dropped 8.4%, while the industry recorded growth of 11.4% during this time frame.

330,SPG,"The end of Cyber Monday, a day which witnesses the single largest volume of online purchases, is possibly a good time to take stock of e-commerce’s fortunes. Fresh estimates from Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE) indicate that expenditure via the e-commerce route registered a near 17% increase to hit $6.6 billion this Cyber Monday.In fact, the holiday season as a whole will see online expenditure touch nearly $107 billion, more than 11% of total retail holiday sales. While this is great news for the likes of Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), brick and mortar retailers are an embattled lot. But the fallout of the e-commerce assault isn’t limited to this segment alone. Retail REITs are also increasingly feeling the heat.General Growth Property’s DilemmaThe problems faced by U.S. retail REITs are best illustrated by the case of GGP, Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report). On Nov 11, GGP received a $15 billion offer from Brookfield Property Partners, aimed at buying the shares it still doesn’t in this major mall owner.Reportedly, GGP had already been in talks with Brookfield about going private. But Brookfield offered to pay only $23 per share, only marginally higher than Nov 10’s closing price of $22.20 in a cash and equity deal.  This case serves to illustrate how acute the situation seems for retail REITs. This Chicago-based REIT is believed to be well above its peers in terms of the quality of its real estate portfolio. Most of its malls are considered to be “Class A” level, those which generate the highest level of sales per square foot.Has E-commerce Caused Retail Overcapacity?But GGP is already facing a large number of problems, store closures and retail bankruptcies to name a few, all of which are a fallout of the switch to online purchases. Share prices of several major retail REITs are down year to date. This includes the likes of Simon Property Group (SPG  -  Free Report), Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT  -  Free Report) and Kimco Realty Corporation (KIM  -  Free Report) which have lost 12%, 8% and 27.7% over the last one year.And yet, most of these REITs enjoy occupancy levels of 95%, according to most industry estimates. This means that demand from multiple sources remains high. In fact, year to date leasing volumes for Kimco Realty are at a record high, a fact which serves to illustrate the sector’s inherent strength. Rental prices and leasing volumes continue to remain high and earnings have been mostly promising.Is Diversification the Way Forward?Coming back to the GGP story, a deal with Brookfield would provide the mall owner with an opportunity to diversify across various segments of the REIT industry. For instance, it could follow a mixed usage strategy, putting office space and apartments into several of its properties. This is because Brookfield itself holds a more diversified real estate portfolio, including retail stores, offices and multifamily housing.This is likely a situation which retail REITs across the board are facing. As brick and mortar retailers increasingly come under fire, retail REITs are having to make rapid changes, sometimes only in order to combat falling share prices. Though stock fundamentals continue to look solid, activist investors are demanding rapid changes in the face of the e-commerce boom.Price Declines Likely OverdoneThere is no denying that the retail REIT segment is facing a number of challenges. Among them is increased competition, both at malls and at shopping centers anchored by groceries. This could lead to a significant decline in margins for retailers who would in term pay lower levels of rent.REITs are suffering because it is difficult to predict the outcome of the so called retail apocalypse. But strong earnings and leasing volumes indicate that the extent to which prices of retail REIT stocks have declined is difficult to justify.2 Retail REIT ChoicesDespite the troubles plaguing the industry currently, retail REITs remain solid prospects. Strong fundamentals imply that price declines are overdone. This is why investing in select retail REITs remains a good option.A favorable EV/EBITDA ratio is desirable for any REIT given the large levels of debt which they utilize to funds their operations. Both of our picks have EV/EBITDA levels which are lower than the industry average of 23.3. Additionally, each of them has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

331,SPG,"Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report) is putting in every effort to enhance the value of its assets. Most recently, the company announced the premier mixed-use development at Atlanta's Phipps Plaza. The transformative redevelopment is marked by the arrival of a new Nobu Hotel and Nobu Atlanta Restaurant. Notably, Nobu Hotels is a notable name among global luxury brands.Other features of this portfolio revamp plan include a 90,000-square-foot Life Time Athletic healthy living and entertainment destination, as well as a 12-story Class A office building with a three-story lower level parking garage. These will be added to Phipps Plaza’s current footprint. The construction work is slated to commence in 2018, while the opening will take place in phases, starting in spring 2020.Positioned at the center of the Buckhead district and conveniently connected to the Midtown and Downtown Atlanta regions, Phipps Plaza will continue to be anchored by Nordstrom Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report) and Saks Fifth Avenue stores.At a time when mall traffic has been dwindling amid a rapid change in shopping patterns, with online shopping taking precedence over in-store purchase, these transformative efforts of Simon at Phipps Plaza are likely to boost the overall footfall.In fact, in recent years Simon Property has already made efforts to transform Phipps Plaza by adding residential units, hospitality components, as well as food and dining options. This included adding The AC Hotel Atlanta Buckhead, with 166 guest rooms and suites, as well as The Domain comprising 319 mid-rise, urban-style luxury residences.Amid the ongoing changes in consumer behavior, retail REITs are avoiding heavy dependence on apparel and accessories, and transforming their boring shopping hubs into swanky entertainment zones. These companies are expanding dining options, opening up movie theaters and offering recreational facilities. Eventually, such measures are likely to push up traffic.Moreover, the shift toward mixed-use development by Simon Property for Phipps Plaza is a strategic fit. In fact, mixed-use developments too have gained popularity for solid neighborhood character, greater housing variety and density.Such developments lower the distance between housing, workplaces, retail businesses, and other amenities and destinations. Hence, these developments enable companies to grab the attention of people who prefer to live, work and play in the same area — a trend that drove development in several other cities in the United States. In recent years, retail REITs like Regency Centers Corp. (REG  -  Free Report) and Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT  -  Free Report) also directed their investments toward such projects.Simon Property currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.However, the stock has declined 3.0% in a month’s time, underperforming 0.3% growth recorded by the industry it belongs to.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

332,SPG,"Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report) finally declared an increase in its first-quarter 2018 dividend. The company will now pay 54 cents for the quarter, which reflects a hike of 7.2% from the prior dividend of 50.375 cents.Notably, during the fourth-quarter 2017 earnings release, the company announced its decision to no longer fix the common share dividend as a fixed percentage of estimated normalized funds of operations (FFO). Rather, the company will embrace a more conventional policy that is based on actual and projected financial conditions, actual and projected liquidity and operating results, projected cash needs for capital expenditures and other investment activities. Therefore, with its development spend reduced substantially and solid growth in property operations, the company anticipates experiencing considerable increase in available cash flow in the near future.Based on the hiked rate of 54 cents for the quarter, the annual dividend comes to $2.16 per share. This new dividend will be paid on Apr 13, to shareholders of record on Mar 26, 2018. At this new rate, annualized yield comes at 3.62% based on the stock’s closing price of $59.72 on Mar 15.The company also announced that its Annual Meeting of Shareholders will be held on Jun 14, 2018 in Chicago, IL.  We believe Equity Residential has adequate capacity to support its dividend policy. Later this January, the company reported fourth-quarter 2017 normalized FFO per share of 83 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 81 cents. The figure also came in higher than 79 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.Quarterly results at this apartment real estate investment trust (REIT) mirrored enhanced same-store net operating income (NOI) and lease-up NOI. However, the company incurred higher corporate overhead in the quarter.Notably, Equity Residential has been making concerted efforts to reposition its portfolio in high barrier-to-entry/core markets. It is anticipated to benefit from favorable demographics, lifestyle transformation and creation of new households. As such, we believe the company remains well poised to boost shareholders’ wealth.However, new apartment supply across Equity Residential’s markets might continue to put pressure on new lease rates, occupancy, retention and result in high concessions as well. Furthermore, rate hike remains another concern.Notably, solid dividend payouts remain arguably the biggest attraction for REIT investors as the U.S. law requires these companies to distribute 90% of the annual taxable income in the form of dividends to shareholders. Apart from Equity Residential, some other REITs which announced dividend hikes in recent months are Digital Realty (DLR  -  Free Report), Prologis Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report) and Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report).Shares of Equity Residential have outperformed the industry it belongs to, over the past month. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have gained 3.0%, while the industry recorded growth of 2.2% during this time frame.

333,SPG,"Ventas, Inc. (VTR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 27, before the market opens. The company’s revenues and funds from operations (FFO) are anticipated to witness a year-over-year decline.Last quarter, this Chicago, IL-based healthcare REIT delivered in-line results. The results reflected improved property performance and accretive investments.Further, Ventas posted an average positive surprise of 0.73% in the trailing four quarters, surpassing estimates twice and posting in-line results in the other occasions. The graph below depicts this surprise history:Ventas, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Ventas, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Ventas, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Factors That Might Influence Q1 ResultsVentas is anticipated to benefit in the to-be-reported quarter from increasing healthcare spending and aging population. In fact, according to the Census Bureau, the number of citizens with more than 85 years of age is estimated to reach 8.7 million by 2030.In addition, Ventas is focusing on achieving an optimum mix of healthcare real estate assets. The company has made sound efforts to expand its portfolio in the university-based life science and medical office businesses. Such investments will likely help the company capitalize on the growing health-care-driven research and development, supported by top-tier research universities.Also, Ventas accomplished the sale of its 36 skilled nursing facilities (SNF), which were operated by Kindred Health care. The move helped it reap $700 million in proceeds. The move is in sync with Ventas’ strategy of “de-emphasis” of this particular healthcare real estate category. Notably, though seniors housing, medical office buildings and hospitals have been able to record solid revenue growth in recent years, amid healthcare reforms, SNFs are becoming more susceptible to top-line pressure due to the change in medical billing procedure. The company efficiently spun-off majority of its SNF business in 2015 and following the sale of the aforementioned 36 SNFs, Ventas successfully brought down its net operating income from SNFs. Thus, such moves are anticipated to support the company’s operating margin in the quarter under review.Nonetheless, oversupply in some markets is likely to burden the performance of Ventas’ senior housing assets. Since this curtails landlords’ pricing power and limits growth in occupancy level, we expect the prevalent oversupply situation to impact the company’s first-quarter numbers.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $204 million for triple net-leased rental income reflects a sequential decline from the prior-quarter figure of $205 million. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for office building and other services revenues is $3.83 million, reflecting a 1.8% decline sequentially.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for rental income from office building is currently pegged at $193 million, indicating a rise from $192 million recorded in the prior-quarter.Amid these, prior to the first-quarter earnings release, there is lack of any solid catalyst for raising optimism about the company’s business activities and prospects. As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share in the soon-to-be-reported quarter remained unchanged at $1.01, over the past month. Also, this indicates a year-over-year decline of 2.9%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first-quarter revenues is pegged at $850.6 million, indicating a year-over-year fall of 3.7%.Moreover, shares of Ventas have underperformed the industry in the past three months. While the company’s shares have lost 16%, the industry has witnessed a decline of 7.7%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model cannot conclusively predict if Ventas will likely beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time. That’s because it doesn’t have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of -0.87%.Zacks Rank: Ventas carries a Zacks Rank #3 that increases the predictive power of ESP.

334,SPG,"Public Storage (PSA  -  Free Report) is slated to release quarterly numbers on Apr 25, after the market closes. Its funds from operations (FFO) per share as well as revenues are anticipated to be up year over year in the quarter.Last quarter, this self-storage real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered better-than-expected performance, witnessing a positive surprise of 1.1%. Results highlight an improvement in net operating income (NOI) from both same-store and non-same store facilities.  The company has a mixed surprise history. In fact, it exceeded estimates in two occasions and missed in the other two, over the trailing four quarters, resulting in an average negative surprise of 3.00%. This is depicted in the graph below: Public Storage Price and EPS Surprise  Public Storage Price and EPS Surprise | Public Storage QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderPublic Storage is one of the largest owners and operators of storage facilities in the United States. The ‘Public Storage’ brand is the most recognized and established name in the self-storage industry, with presence in all major metropolitan markets of the nation. Further, the company has managed to create significant presence in the European markets as well, with the Shurgard Storage Centers’ acquisition.Moreover, the self-storage industry is anticipated to experience solid demand backed by favorable demographic changes, improving job market and rising incomes, as well as events like marriages, shifting, death, and even divorce. Also, due to shorter leasing periods, this REIT has the power to adjust its rents quickly to any rate hike. In fact, the company is likely to be able to achieve reasonable rate hike for its existing customers. Further, acquisition and expansion initiatives are likely to stoke growth.Amid these, the company remains well poised to experience growth in revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $668.9 million, depicting projected growth of 3.6%.Furthermore, the company’s activities during the quarter gained analysts’ confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate, which witnessed a marginal increase over the last 30 days, is currently pegged at $2.46. The figure also indicates a 5.1% rise year over year.Nevertheless, supply has been rising in a number of markets and this adversely affects the company’s pricing power. In fact, the company operates in a highly fragmented market in the United States, with intense competition from numerous private, regional and local operators. This limits its power to raise rents and turn on more discounting.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Public Storage will likely beat estimates this season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP is 0.00%.

335,SPG,"Following a Bloomberg report that outlined a potential buyout of GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), shares of the retail real estate investment trust (REIT) ascended more than 16% to $22.10 on Tuesday. Per the report that cited a person familiar with the matter, asset manager Brookfield Asset Management Inc. has held preliminary talks with GGP Inc. to increase its ownership stake in the shopping mall investor and take the company private. Both companies have discussed a possible premium of around 10-15% above GGP Inc.’s share price as of the start of the week.Although the takeover deliberations are in the nascent stage, there is a possibility that the pricing may change or the deal might be called off.Currently, Brookfield owns 35% stake in the U.S. domiciled company. Brookfield first acquired interest in GGP Inc. to back the company during its troubling bankruptcy times in 2010. In January 2013, it acquired additional GGP warrants and agreed to limit ownership in the company to 45% for four years. In third-quarter 2017, Brookfield’s real estate unit exercised the outstanding GGP warrants, purchasing 68 million shares for a total consideration of $462 million.The agreement that restricted the asset manager to increase its stake above the threshold limit expired in January 2017. Hence now, the company has complete flexibility to increase its ownership in GGP Inc. and bid for a takeover. Interestingly, a report had earlier surfaced in January 2016, according to which Brookfield was considering taking the retail REIT private. Notably, GGP Inc. has a portfolio of high-quality retail properties across prospective locations in the United States and a well capitalized tenant roster as well.Following the buyout news, other mall REITs like Simon Property Group (SPG  -  Free Report), The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report) and Taubman Centers, Inc. (TCO  -  Free Report) rejoiced as these companies’ shares also traded higher on the news.Shares of Simon climbed 2.6% to $159.1 during regular trading session on Nov 7, while shares of Macerichwere up 8.43% to $58.76. Taubman stock also rallied4.97% to $48.6 during yesterday’s trading session. The U.S. retail real estate market has been plagued with issues like downsizing and bankruptcies of retailers in recent times. This is because mall traffic has been shrinking considerably amid rapid shift in consumers’ shopping patterns, with e-retail taking center stage. This has emerged as a key concern for retail REITs, like GGP, as the trend is curtailing demand for the retail real estate space significantly, and limiting landlords’ pricing power and occupancy level of properties.Shares of GGP Inc. have underperformed the industry it belongs to, year to date. The company’s shares have lost 11.1% as against the industry’s growth of 6.8% during the period. Further, GGP Inc. currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

336,SPG,"Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report), a retail real estate investment trust (REIT), reported third-quarter 2017 funds from operations (FFO) of $2.89 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. The FFO per share figure also expanded 7.0% from the year-ago tally of $2.70.Results highlight improved property performance and growth in revenues. The company also announced a hike in quarterly dividend.During the quarter, the company posted revenues of $1.4 billion, which nearly came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. It compared favorably with the year-ago figure of $1.36 billion.Inside the Headline NumbersFor the U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets portfolio, occupancy was 95.3% as of Sep 30, 2017. Base minimum rent per square feet rose 3.3% year over year to $52.42 as of Sep 30, 2017. Further, leasing spread per square foot for the trailing 12-month period ended Sep 30, 2017 increased 11.2% to $7.21.Total portfolio net operating income (NOI) growth for the nine-month period ended Sep 30, 2017, was 4.8%. Moreover, comparable property NOI growth for the same period came in at 3.6%.At the end of the quarter, Simon Property had redevelopment and expansion projects, including the addition of new anchors, in progress at 31 properties across the United States and Canada. The company’s share of costs of all new development and redevelopment projects under construction at quarter end was around $1.0 billion.The company exited the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $508.4 million compared with $560.1 million recorded at the prior-year end.Additionally, as of Sep 30, 2017, Simon had more than $6.5 billion of liquidity. This comprised cash on hand, including its share of joint-venture cash, and available capacity under its revolving credit facilities.2017 OutlookSimon Property revised its full-year 2017 FFO per share guidance and expects it to be in the range of $11.17-$11.22 compared with the prior guidance of $11.14-$11.22. This incorporates an expected 3 cents per share negative impact in the fourth quarter as a result of the ongoing repair and restoration work at the company’s two centers in Puerto Rico.Dividend HikeSimon Property announced a quarterly dividend of $1.85 per share, marking an increase of 2.8% sequentially and 12.1% year over year. The new dividend will be paid on Nov 30 to stockholders of record on Nov 16, 2017.Our ViewpointWe are encouraged with the better-than-expected performance of Simon Property. The company’s diversified exposure to retail assets in the United States and abroad, efforts to support omni-channel retailing, portfolio-restructuring initiatives and healthy balance sheet augur well. Nevertheless, stiff competition from online sales and rise in interest rate pose challenges.Currently, Simon Property carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

339,SPG,"Delighting its shareholders, retail REIT Realty Income Corporation (O  -  Free Report) has announced a hike in its common stock monthly cash dividend. This is the company’s 96th dividend increase since its NYSE listing in 1994. The company will now pay 21.95 cents per share compared with 21.90 cents paid earlier.Realty Income will pay the dividend on Apr 13 to shareholders on record as of Apr 2. The latest dividend rate marks an annualized amount of $2.634 per share versus the prior rate of $2.628 per share.Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT investors and Realty Income remains committed to boosting shareholders’ wealth. The company enjoys a trademark on the phrase “The Monthly Dividend Company”. The April 2018 dividend payment not only marks its 573 consecutive monthly dividend payouts throughout its 49-year operating history, but also 82 consecutive quarterly increases as well as payment of more than $5.3 billion.In fact, the company has generated a compound average annual dividend growth of around 4.7% since its listing on the NYSE. Given its financial position and lower debt-to-equity ratio compared to the industry, this dividend rate is likely to be sustainable.Apart from Realty Income, some other REITs which announced dividend hikes in recent months are Digital Realty (DLR  -  Free Report), Prologis Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report) and Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report).Realty Income is well poised to grow and reward shareholders backed by its superior business model. This freestanding retail REIT derives more than 90% of its annualized retail rental revenues from tenants belonging to service, non-discretionary and low-price retail business. Such businesses are less susceptible to economic recessions and competition from Internet retailing.Additionally, Realty Income’s solid underlying real estate quality and prudent underwriting at acquisitions have helped the company maintain high occupancy levels consistently. In fact, since 1996, its occupancy level has never been below 96%. For 2018 too, the company projects occupancy to remain at approximately 98%. Additionally, its same-store rent growth underlines limited operational volatility.The company continues to maintain a conservative capital structure. It has modest leverage, robust liquidity and continued access to attractively priced equity and debt capital. Moreover, it has a well-laddered debt maturity schedule.Nonetheless, the company’s substantial exposure to single-tenant assets raises risks associated with tenant default. Further, generation of notable rental revenues from assets leased to drug stores and rate hike add to its woes.Shares of Realty Income have outperformed the industry it belongs to, in the past month. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have gained 4.4% while the industry inched up 0.6% during this time frame.

340,SPG,"Ushering in good news for its shareholders, recently Digital Realty (DLR  -  Free Report) announced that its board has approved an 8.6% hike in quarterly common stock cash dividend rate to $1.01 from the 93 cents paid earlier.The new dividend for the first quarter of 2018 will be paid on Mar 30 to shareholders of record on Mar 15, 2018. Based on this hiked value, annualized yield comes in at about 4.1%, considering Digital Realty' closing price of $98.20 on Mar 2.Notably, Digital Realty has a solid track record of enhancing shareholders’ wealth. The company has raised dividend every year since its initial public offering and the March 2018 hike marks the 13th consecutive year of increase.We believe Digital Realty has solid scope of generating steady growth in cash flow to support its dividend policy. Last month, the company reported fourth-quarter 2017 core funds from operations (FFO) per share of $1.55 which exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.52. The core FFO per share also came in higher than the year-ago quarter’s tally of $1.43. Results were supported by growth in revenues.With growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data, and an increasing number of companies opting for third-party IT infrastructure, data-center REITs are experiencing a boom market. In fact, demand is outpacing supply in top-tier data center markets and despite enjoying high occupancy, the top tier markets are absorbing new construction at a faster pace. This, along with an improved outlook for economic growth, is anticipated to drive demand for data centers. Amid these, accretive acquisitions and development efforts are expected to drive top-line growth.In September 2017, Digital Realty announced the completion of a merger with DuPont Fabros in an all-stock deal, for an enterprise value of about $7.8 billion. This move enhanced Digital Realty’s portfolio in the top U.S. data center metro areas across Northern Virginia, Chicago and Silicon Valley. It helped Digital Realty enhance hyper-scale product offering and grow its blue-chip customer base.Further, the company focuses on maintaining an investment grade balance sheet and is committed to a conservative capital structure. It enjoys ample and growing liquidity, with diversified sources of capital and has a well-laddered debt maturity schedule with no material maturities until 2020.However, the company faces intense competition in the industry. Amid this, aggressive pricing pressure is likely to continue in the upcoming period. Moreover, Digital Realty’s earnings have a notable exposure to foreign currency translation. Also, the company has a substantial debt burden. Further, rate hike adds to its woes.Digital Realty currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The stock has depreciated 8.8% over the past year, outperforming the 9.3% loss incurred by the industry it belongs to.Solid dividend payouts remain arguably the biggest enticement for REIT investors.

341,SPG,"After three consecutive days of gains, benchmarks finished in the red on Tuesday after Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s comments renewed concerns over increase in the pace of rate hikes. Powell in his speech to Congress indicated that the U.S. economy is strengthening and signaled that the key rate might be increased at a gradual pace. However, investors fretted that the central bank’s move to stop the economy from overheating might lead to not just three but even four more rate increases this year. How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) decreased 1.2%, or 300.96 points, to close at 25,410.03. The S&P 500 fell 1.3% to close at 2,744.28. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,330.35, losing 1.2%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 17.7% to close at 18.59. A total of 7.4 billion shares were traded on Tuesday, considerably lower than the last 20-session average of 8.3 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 3.38-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 3.07-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.Markets Stumbles as Rate Hike Fears LoomIn his first appearance on Capitol Hill, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell presented an encouraging picture of the U.S economy. Powell expressed confidence that the coming few years will be “good years for the economy”. After all, Americans are willing to spend more and business houses have ramped up their investments, helping to boost productivity.Consequently, traders predicted that an upbeat economy will fuel inflation further and prompt the Fed to step in and hike rates at a faster pace.  Many of them are already predicting the Fed will increase rates four times instead of three. According to data from the CME Group, odds of four rate hikes by year-end rose to 33% on Tuesday from about 20% on Monday.For the time being, Powell maintained that the Fed would keep to its plan of hiking rates three times this year. But, he did mention that “we’ve seen some data that will in my case add some confidence to my view that inflation is moving up to target”.Following a three-day long rally, all the key U.S. indexes declined as investors remained wary of an increase in the pace of rate hikes. The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted their worst daily performance in percentage terms since Feb 8. The Dow registered a slump of more than 300 points. For the S&P 500 index, all the 11 sectors finished in the red, with the real estate and consumer discretionary sectors emerging as the biggest drags on the S&P 500.The Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE) fell 2.14%, becoming the biggest loser among the S&P 500 sectors. Some of its key holdings, including Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report) and American Tower Corporation (REIT) (AMT  -  Free Report) fell 3.2% and 1.4%, respectively.Additionally, the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY) decreased 2.12%, which was the worst performing sector in the S&P 500. Its key components like Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) and The Home Depot, Inc. (HD  -  Free Report) declined 0.7% and 1.9%, respectively. Both the retailers have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

342,SPG,"Ushering in good news for its shareholders, Armada Hoffler Properties, Inc. (AHH  -  Free Report) recently announced a 5.3% hike in its quarterly cash dividend. The company will now pay a dividend of 20 cents per share, up from 19 cents paid earlier. The raised dividend will be paid on Apr 5, 2018, to shareholders of record as on Mar 28.Based on the increased rate, the annual dividend comes to 80 cents a share, resulting in a yield of about 5.9%, considering Armada Hoffler’s closing price of $13.47 on Feb 23. Since the company’s dividend yield surpassed the industry average of 4%, the stock is likely to draw investors’ attention.In fact, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT investors and this represents Armada Hoffler’s 4th hike in common stock dividend in four years, reflecting 25% dividend growth during that time frame.Investors interested in this self-managed real estate investment trust (""REIT"") stock can have a look at its fundamentals and growth prospects.Earnings Strength: Armada Hoffler depicts a stable earnings picture.

343,SPG,"More than a month has gone by since the last earnings report for Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 3.1% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Simon Property Q2 Result Solid, View and Dividend UpSimon Property reported second-quarter 2017 FFO of $2.47 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.44. However, the FFO figure came in lower than $2.63 per share reported in the prior-year quarter.Results highlight improved property performance and growth in revenues. The company also raised its full-year outlook and announced a hike in quarterly dividend.During the quarter, the company posted revenues of $1.36 billion, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.33 billion. The figure compared favorably with the year-ago figure of $1.32 billion.Quarter in DetailFor the U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets portfolio, occupancy was 95.2% as of Jun 2017. Base minimum rent per square feet rose 3.3% year over year to 52.10 as of Jun 30, 2017.

Moreover, comparable property NOI growth for the same period came in at 4.4%.At the end of the quarter, Simon Property had redevelopment and expansion projects in progress at 25 properties across the U.S. and Canada.The company exited the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $488.6 million compared with $560.1 million at the prior-year end.Additionally, as of Jun 30, 2017, Simon had around $6.5 billion of liquidity. This comprised cash on hand, including its share of joint-venture cash, and available capacity under its revolving credit facilities.Moreover, during the quarter, the company repurchased over 1.5 million shares of its common stock.2017 Outlook RaisedSimon Property raised its full-year 2017 FFO per share guidance and projects it to be in the range of $11.14–$11.22.

344,SPG,"Retail REIT Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT  -  Free Report) is likely to remain on the growth curve backed by its premium retail assets, diverse tenant base and efforts to improve operating performance through expansion, renovation and re-tenanting support long-term profitability. However, the choppy retail real estate environment and portfolio redevelopment efforts might limit the company’s growth tempo in the near term.Recently, Federal Realty reported fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted funds from operations (FFO) per share of $1.47, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Adjusted FFO per share also compared favorably with the prior-year quarter tally of $1.45. Results reflect growth in revenues. However, the company’s proactive releasing efforts to reposition properties had an adverse impact on its quarterly results.Specifically, Federal Realty has a portfolio of premium retail assets — mainly situated in the major coastal markets from Washington, D.C. to Boston, San Francisco and Los Angeles — which positions it well for decent growth. Again, due to the strong demographics and in-fill nature of its properties, the company has been able to maintain a high occupancy and rental rates.In addition, Federal Realty has a decent balance-sheet position, with ample liquidity and is continuing with its efforts to boost shareholders’ wealth. The company has paid uninterrupted dividends since its inception in 1962 and its compound annual growth rate of dividend increases over the past 50 years is above 7%. Given the company’s financial position and lower debt-to-equity ratio compared to that of the industry, this dividend rate is expected to be sustainable.However, shrinking footfall at malls amid shift of consumers toward online channels, store closures and bankruptcy of retailers have emerged as pressing concerns for most retail REITs, including Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report), GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report), Federal Realty and others.Additionally, amid a fast changing retail environment, the company is making commendable efforts to reposition, redevelop and re-merchandise its portfolio. This includes an upgradation of the tenant mix. Although repositioning and redevelopment are a strategic fit for long-term growth, such initiatives involve considerable upfront costs and tend to drag down near-term profitability. In fact, the company’s proactive releasing efforts to reposition properties had an adverse impact on its recently-reported quarterly results.Moreover, rise in interest rate can pose a challenge for Federal Realty. This is because the company’s ability to refinance its existing debt would be restricted, while interest cost on new debt will increase. This could adversely affect the company’s financial results and consequently dent its dividend payout. Also, the dividend payout might become less attractive than the yields on fixed income and money market accounts.Amid these, shares of Federal Realty have underperformed the industry it belongs to, over the past three months, depreciating 11.3% as against the 8.0% loss incurred by the industry. Nevertheless, reflecting bullish analyst sentiment, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for first-quarter 2018 being revised 0.7% upward in a month’s time.

345,SPG,"Duke Realty Corp. (DRE  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 25, after the market closes. Revenues and funds from operations (FFO) are expected to decline on a year-over-year basis.Last quarter, this commercial real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered in-line FFO per share. Results witnessed same-property net operating income growth on the back of decent rental growth.The company exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the trailing four quarters and met estimates on one occasion, with the average beat being 5.1%. The graph below depicts this surprise history:Duke Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Duke Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Duke Realty Corporation QuoteNotably, Duke Realty’s fundamental strength has helped its shares gain 0.9% in the past three months, outperforming decline of 4.3% recorded by the industry.Will the stock’s rally continue post the first-quarter earnings release? Let’s see how things are shaping up.Factors That Might Influence Q1 ResultsIn recent years, Duke Realty has made concerted efforts to enhance its industrial portfolio. Admittedly, this asset class is witnessing improving fundamentals amid economic recovery and growth of e-commerce business. This is driving demand for warehouse space as companies are compelled to enhance and renovate their distribution and production platforms, which is helping the industrial real estate market to grow.In fact, per a study by the commercial real estate services firm — CBRE Group Inc. — availability fell for 31 straight quarters to 7.3% for the U.S. industrial market in first-quarter 2018. The figure not only marked a contraction of 6 basis points (bps) sequentially but also a decline of 20 bps year over year, on average, across 50 markets that are followed by CBRE.However, Duke Realty is enhancing its portfolio mix through continued divestitures, which includes the significant disposition of suburban office assets and medical office buildings. While such efforts are a strategic fit for the long term, the near-term dilutive effect on earnings cannot be bypassed.Further, the company faces significant competition from developers, owners and operators of the commercial real estate. This influences its ability to attract and retain tenants at relatively higher rents than its competitors.Moreover, over the past month, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the first quarter remained unchanged at 30 cents, reflecting a lack of solid catalyst. Also, it points to a year-over-year decline of 6.3%.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $183.8 million, indicating a decline of 15.7% year over year.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Duke Realty will likely beat estimates this season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Duke Realty is -1.70%.Zacks Rank: Duke Realty has a Zacks Rank #3 that increases the predictive power of ESP.

Results reflect better-than-expected growth in revenues.Total revenues for the quarter came in at $306.9 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $299.0 million. Revenues were also up 10.7% year over year.Realty Income Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Realty Income Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Realty Income Corporation QuoteNote: All EPS numbers presented in this write up represent funds from operations (“FFO”) per share.Quarter in DetailDuring third-quarter 2017, same-store rents on 4,272 properties under lease expanded 1.0% to $244.9 million from the prior-year quarter. Portfolio occupancy of 98.3% as of Sep 30, 2017, remained unchanged year over year.Further, the company had 86 properties available for lease, out of a total of 5,062 properties in the portfolio as of Sep 30, 2017, compared with 76 properties as of Jun 30, 2017. Moreover, during the reported quarter, it re-leased 79 properties to existing and new tenants, at a rent recapture rate of 103.7%, representing the fifth consecutive quarter in excess of 100%.Portfolio ActivityDuring the reported quarter, Realty Income invested $264.9 million in 56 new properties and properties under development or expansion, situated in 16 states. The assets are fully leased, with a weighted average lease term of around 15.2 years, and an initial average cash lease yield of 7.0%. Around 10% of the rental revenues from acquisitions during the third quarter are from investment grade-rated tenants.On the other hand, during the quarter, the company sold 17 properties for $25.5 million, with a gain on sales of $4.3 million.LiquidityFinally, Realty Income exited the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $3.2 million, down from $9.4 million at the end of the prior year.However, the company has a $2.25-billion unsecured credit facility comprising $2.0 billion revolving credit facility and a $250-million five-year unsecured term loan. The credit facility also bears a $1.0 billion expansion feature. As of Sep 30, 2017, Realty Income had borrowing capacity of $1.34 billion available on its revolving credit facility.OutlookFor 2017, Realty Income reiterated its adjusted FFO per share guidance in the range of $3.03-$3.07, marking annual increase of 5.2-6.6%.Our TakeRealty Income’s focus on leasing to service, non-discretionary, and low price-based retailers, accretive acquisitions and conservative capital structure augur well. Rising monthly dividend payouts enhance shareholders’ confidence. Nevertheless, substantial exposure to single-tenant assets raises its risks associated with tenant default. Further, generation of notable rental revenues from assets leased to drug stores and rate hikes add to its woes.Realty Income currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

348,SPG,"Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 27, before the market opens.In the last reported quarter, this Indianapolis, IN-based retail real estate investment trust (REIT) witnessed a positive surprise of 0.82% in terms of funds from operations (FFO) per share.However, over the trailing four quarters, the company exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three occasions and missed in the other, the average beat being 4.20%. This is depicted in the graph below:Simon Property Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Simon Property Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Simon Property Group, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderSimon Property enjoys a wide exposure to retail assets across the United States. Moreover, the company’s international presence fosters sustainable long-term growth as compared with its domestically-focused peers. This diversification, with respect to both product and geography, largely insulates Simon Property from market volatility and helps it stay ahead of its peers by delivering a decent performance.Further, Simon Property has been undertaking various initiatives, of late, to strengthen its relationship with customers. In addition, with the omni-channel strategy gaining popularity among retailers, the company is initiating programs and events, as well as entering into several partnerships for upgrading services and amenities offered to its customers. This retail REIT has invested more than $5 billion in development projects in five years’ time and intends to spend around $1 billion each in 2017 and 2018. These initiatives are anticipated to draw more traffic at the company’s properties.Nevertheless, with more and more consumers opting for online purchases, mall traffic continues to remain depressed considerably. This, again, has resulted in an increasing number of retailers joining the dot-com bandwagon. These latest developments have made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures in recent times.Further, retailers unable to keep up with the intense competition in the industry are filing bankruptcies. This is a pressing concern for retail REITs, as the trend has been significantly dragging down demand for the retail real estate space. This choppy retail real estate market situation is also said to have led to tenants demanding substantial lease concessions, though the mall landlords find it unjustified.While Simon Property is grappling to battle this pressure through various initiatives, the implementation of such measures requires a decent upfront cost. Consequently, this would limit any robust growth in the company’s profit margins in the to-be-reported quarter.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $1.4 billion, indicating projected growth of around 3.1% year over year.Moreover, prior to the third-quarter earnings release, there is lack of any solid catalyst. As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the quarter remained unchanged at $2.87 over the past month.Shares of Simon Property have climbed 2.4%, versus the 1.1% loss incurred by the industry, in three months’ time.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Simon Property will likely beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -0.77%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Simon Property’s Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT sector that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this quarter:CoreSite Realty Corporation (COR  -  Free Report), slated to release third-quarter results on Oct 26, has an Earnings ESP of +1.01% and a Zacks Rank of 2.

350,SPG,"UDR Inc. (UDR  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 25, after the market closes. Revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, this Denver, CO-based residential real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered in-line FFO per share. Results reflected growth in revenues from same-store and stabilized non-mature communities.Over the trailing four quarters, the company met the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the four occasions. The graph below depicts the same:United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. QuoteFactors to ConsiderUDR boasts a vast experience in the residential real estate market. Additionally, it has a superior portfolio in targeted U.S. markets and adheres to disciplined capital allocation. These are likely to drive results in the to-be-reported quarter.Specifically, the company is anticipated to benefit from favorable demographic trends. There is a steady demand for rental apartments from both new millennial households and empty nesters. Along with this, the healthy job market is estimated to drive demand for apartments.Per the latest report from the real estate technology and analytics firm — RealPage, Inc. — the national apartment market moderated in first-quarter 2018, with occupancy shrinking slightly and rent growth slowing down. Nevertheless, the first quarter marks a slow leasing period, thanks to the cold weather that inhibits shift of households and limits growth in demand.Going by statistics, annual rent growth shrunk to 2.3% in Q1. This marked moderation from the 2.6-2.9% growth rate experienced throughout 2017. Occupancy level of 94.5% in March edged down from the prior-year tally of 95%, with metros having subdued construction activity faring well and recording the strongest occupancy. Nevertheless, the overall occupancy level is still healthy.Amid these, we remain apprehensive about UDR’s performance in Q1. The company has been dealing with escalating deliveries in a number of its markets. This remains a concern as elevated levels of supply curtail a landlord’s ability to demand higher rents and result in lesser absorption. Consequently, concession levels are likely to remain at the higher end while pricing power of UDR is expected to remain limited in the quarter.Further, prior to the first-quarter earnings release, there is a lack of any solid catalyst for raising optimism about the company’s business activities and prospects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for the soon-to-be-reported quarter remained unchanged at 47 cents over the past month. Nevertheless, this indicates a 4.4% increase year over year. For the first quarter, management projects FFO per share in the band of 46-48 cents.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $253 million, indicating year-over-year improvement of 3.8%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that UDR will likely beat estimates this season. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: UDR has an Earnings ESP of -0.53%.

351,SPG,"Kimco Realty Corporation (KIM  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, before the market opens. Its revenues are expected to inch up in the quarter, while funds from operations (FFO) per share will witness a year-over-year decline.Last quarter, this New Hyde Park, NY-based retail real estate investment trust (REIT) reported in-line results with respect to FFO per share. In 2017, the company recorded the strongest leasing volume in the past decade.Over the trailing four quarters, Kimco beat estimates in one occasion and posted in-line results in the other three, recording an average beat of 0.68%. The graph below depicts this surprise history:Kimco Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Kimco Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Kimco Realty Corporation QuoteFactors to Influence Q1 ResultsKimco is taking long strides and is progressing well with its strategic 2020 Vision. In fact, the company is reducing its portfolio size and channeling the proceeds toward high-quality assets. Further, the company is engaged in boosting the capital structure while enhancing its growth profile and tax efficiency.Kimco revealed transaction activities for first-quarter 2018. The company disclosed dispositions of 21 shopping centers, spanning 2.3 million square feet, for a total $219.5 million. Of this, the company’s share included $210.2 million. A portfolio of five properties in the St. Louis market was disposed of for $49.5 million. Along with that, five-property portfolio, located in Florida and Georgia, was sold for $72.7 million.However, the retail real estate market continued to bear the brunt as mall traffic continues to suffer amid a rapid shift in customers’ shopping preference through online channels, resulting in an increasing number of retailers joining the dot-com bandwagon. These made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures in recent years, while others unable to cope with competition, are filing for bankruptcies.These emerged as serious concerns for retail REITs as it is limiting demand for the retail real estate space considerably. Moreover, the choppy retail real estate market situation is said to have led to tenants demanding substantial lease concessions, which mall landlords find unjustified.Although retail REITs like Kimco are actively enhancing omni-channel capabilities and heavily investing in redevelopment to draw customers, it may take a while for these efforts to offset the dent created in the operating results.Furthermore, as part of its portfolio-upgrade strategy, Kimco is aggressively disposing of non-core assets. Also, the company expects to be a net seller of properties in 2018. While such efforts are encouraging for the long term, the earnings dilution, led by high-disposition activity, cannot be averted in the near term. Therefore, these moves are expected to hurt Kimco’s growth momentum in the to-be-reported quarter.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $298.4 million for the quarter under review, reflecting projected growth of 3.1% from the year-ago period.Kimco’s activities during the quarter could not gain adequate analyst confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share of 36 cents for the first quarter remained unchanged over the past month. The figure also witnessed a decline of 2.7% from the prior-year quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Kimco will likely beat FFO estimates this time around. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

354,SPG,"After two days of market sell-off, suddenly everything’s coming up roses again: President Trump’s State of the Union address last night was followed by strong Q4 earnings results before today’s opening bell. We also see better-than-expected results from ADP’s (ADP  -  Free Report) monthly private sector payroll report.In fact, the 234K new jobs created for January was well ahead of the 180K anticipated, and although December’s results were revised downward by 8000 jobs, it still tallied 242K. This is outstanding jobs growth over the past two months, especially considering we have been near peak employment for quite some time now. Services led the way with 212K new jobs, with Manufacturing adding 12K and Construction +9K.Non-farm payroll figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) on Friday morning should be very interesting in light of today’s results. One thing analysts will certainly be looking at - aside from the Unemployment rate, which is expected to dip to 4.0%  - with be Average Hourly Wage Growth. With a jobs market this tight, it would stand to reason employees will start to see a rise in their take-home pay. The proof, as they say, will be in the pudding.Q4 Earnings on a RollEven before the strong ADP report came out this morning, the Dow was already trading in the pre-market up more than 200 points - not quite erasing the losses from earlier this week, but definitely helping fill the hole. A big part of this came from a huge earnings report home run from Boeing (BA  -  Free Report).The airplane-making giant brought in $4.80 per share in its Q4 earnings report, far ahead of the $2.91 per share expected in the Zacks consensus estimate. Revenues of $25.78 billion trounced the $24.83 billion analysts were looking for. Backlog was up compared to a year ago for the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company, but guidance was also sharply raised for full-year 2018 compared to expectations. As a result, shares shot up 3.6% initially and are approaching +6% at this hour in the pre-market. For more on BA’s earnings, click here.Big Pharma’s Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) also topped estimates for both earnings and revenues ahead of the opening bell, with $1.14 per share beating by 6 cents and revenues of $6.16 billion up $200 million from the Zacks consensus. Guidance was also upped for full-year to $4.81-4.91 per share, while revenue guidance stayed pat for now.

356,SPG,"Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report) announced the ground breaking at the Denver Premium Outlets — a Thornton, CO-based open air shopping center— encompassing 330,000 square feet of space.Scheduled to open in the fall of 2018, the project is Colorado’s first premium outlet in development. The center is positioned at the intersectionof Interstate 25 and 136 Avenue, and will house around 80 high-end brands and retailers, similar to those found in other Simon Premium Outlets. The center will offer everyday savings of 25-65% on a wide range of outdoor and fitness apparel and footwear, electronics, fashion accessories and home furnishing, among others.The property will likely draw high footfall as the Denver metro area demonstrates solid economic and population growth. Moreover, development projects worth nearly $350 million are currently under construction in close vicinity to the shopping center. This reflects the strong trade demographics and retail-growth potential of that area.The property will serve the Greater Denver community with a wide array of offerings, including premium brands, shopping and dining options. The overall project will generate substantial construction and permanent jobs in the area, creating as many as 500 construction jobs, and 700 part- and full-time jobs.Notably, at a time when increasing consumer purchases through the Internet have emerged as a pressing concern for retail real estate investment trusts (REIT), Simon Property is making concerted efforts to make its property stand out from the rest. Hence, such omni-channel retailing initiatives augur well for the company’s long-term profitability. Further, as the city’s only premium outlet, Denver Premium Outlet is anticipated to enjoy competitive advantage over other retail malls.Denver Premium Outlets is Simon Property’s 92nd Premium Outlets center. Additionally, over the last five years, the retail REIT invested over $5 billion in development projects, and intends to spend around $1 billion in each 2017 and 2018. With such a huge pipeline, the company is well poised to effectively leverage the improving spending habits of wealthier customers amid an improving economy.However, due to the gloomy retail market, Simon Property has underperformed its industry year to date. Shares of the company have descended 9.8%, as compared to the industry’s decline of 6.4%.Currently, Simon Property carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the REIT space include Wheeler Real Estate Invest Trust, Inc. , EPR Properties (EPR  -  Free Report) and DDR Corp.

357,SPG,"Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust (PEI  -  Free Report) — better known as PREIT — is making every effort to enhance and diversify its tenant mix. Recently, the company announced the opening of a 46,000-square foot Burlington at Magnolia Mall in Florence, SC. Along with this, a 20,000-square foot HomeGoods and 8,500-square foot Five Below, Inc. (FIVE  -  Free Report) are set to open in Spring 2018. Also, a 20,000-square-foot H&M store is slated to open in 2018.This comes as part of PREIT’s proactive anchor redevelopment initiative aimed at diversifying the tenant mix, meet shoppers’ demand and boost sales per square feet of the retail property.In fact, the Burlington store has come up in the space which was previously occupied by Sears. PREIT recaptured the spaces previously occupied by Sears and fully leased the box in less than nine months. Also, this year for PREIT, this tenant marked the fourth of six stores opening in the previous department store boxes. Notably, with value retail and fast fashion segments gaining market share, the move to add these retailers seems a strategic fit which is likely to boost the retail asset’s importance in the market.Not only is PREIT focusing on the Magnolia Mall, the company also recently announced the opening of a 100,000-square-foot store by Herberger's at Valley View Mall in La Crosse, WI. This store came up in the previous Macy's Inc. (M  -  Free Report) location, thereby backfilling a store which shut down six months ago.   In addition, earlier in September, PREIT announced the opening of three new retailers — DICK’S Sporting Goods (DKS  -  Free Report), Field & Stream and HomeGoods — at Viewmont Mall in Scranton, PA, within the space which was previously occupied by Sears Holdings Corp.Admittedly, the shrinking mall traffic and store closures amid aggressive growth in online sales have kept retail REITs, including PREIT and others like Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report) and GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), on tenterhooks. In addition, tenants are demanding substantial lease concessions owing to a turbulent retail real estate market scenario. Nonetheless, retail REITs are countering this dreary situation and putting in every effort to enhance the productivity of the malls, by trying to grab attention from new and productive tenants, and disposing the non-productive ones on the other hand.PREIT, too, along with its remerchandising efforts, has resorted to a portfolio rejig, selling 17 lower productivity malls, as well as other non-core properties since January 2013. This helped the company reap more than $750 million in gross proceeds. (Read more: PREIT Closes Sale of 17th Low-Productivity Mall for $33.2M)Such steps are likely to help PREIT efficiently tide over the lackluster retail real estate environment and ride on the growth curve as well.4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax HackCybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

359,SPG,"Simon Property Group (SPG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 31, 2018 before the market opens. Both its funds from operations (FFO) per share and revenues are anticipated to improve year over year.In the last reported quarter, this Indianapolis, IN-based retail real estate investment trust (REIT) witnessed a positive surprise of 0.35% in terms of funds from operations (FFO) per share. Results highlighted improved property performance and growth in revenues.Nonetheless, over the trailing four quarters, the company exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three occasions and missed in the other, the average beat being 4.10%. This is depicted in the graph below:Simon Property Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Simon Property Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Simon Property Group, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to Influence Q4 ResultsSimon Property has been undertaking various initiatives, of late, to strengthen its relationship with customers. In addition, it is focusing on omni-channel strategies to gain popularity among retailers. Further, in the fourth quarter, the company initiated various programs and events to steer mall traffic.Simon Property has also resorted to micro-retail modeling that offers store units ranging from 20-200 square feet of space. Such moves make its shopping malls more appealing and will be conducive to revenue growth in the to-be-reported quarter.  In addition, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $1.4 billion — indicating projected growth of around 0.5% year over year.Nevertheless, with more and more consumers shifting to online purchases, mall traffic continues to remain considerably depressed. This has resulted in an increasing number of retailers joining the dot-com bandwagon. Retailers are also reconsidering their footprint and opting for store closures.Furthermore, retailers unable to keep up with the intense competition in the industry have been filing bankruptcies. This is a pressing concern for retail REITs, as the trend has been significantly dragging down demand for the retail real estate space. This choppy retail real estate market situation is also said to have led to tenants demanding substantial lease concessions, though the mall landlords find it unjustified.While Simon Property is making efforts to beat these retail blues through various initiatives, implementation of such measures requires a decent upfront cost. Consequently, this might impede any robust growth in the company’s profit margins in the quarter under review.In addition, during the third-quarter earnings release, Simon Property had revised its full-year 2017 FFO per share to the range of $11.17-$11.22 compared with the prior guidance of $11.14-$11.22. The company had incorporated an expected 3 cents per share negative impact in the fourth quarter as a result of the ongoing repair and restoration work at the company’s two centers in Puerto Rico. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $11.21.Moreover, prior to the fourth-quarter earnings release, there is lack of any solid catalyst. As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the quarter remained unchanged at $3.11 over the past month.Finally, shares of Simon Property have climbed 3.9%, versus the industry’s gain of 14.7%, in six months’ time.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Simon Property will likely beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.(You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.)Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Simon Property is 0.00%.Zacks Rank: Simon Property currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which actually reduces the predictive power of ESP.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this time around:EPR Properties (EPR  -  Free Report), slated to release fourth-quarter results on Feb 28, has an Earnings ESP of +0.69% and a Zacks Rank of 3.

360,SPG,"Retail REIT Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report) and Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) have reached a settlement over a lawsuit to refrain the latter from proceeding with its plan to close Teavana stores in Simon’s malls, per a report from American City Business Journals.An email from Starbucks, that was cited in the report, read, “We are thankful to our customers who have enjoyed Teavana tea at these specialty retail locations and will continue to emphasize Teavana tea in new and different ways at Starbucks.” The terms of the settlement were not disclosed, but the move removes the litigation overhang issue from Simon.In July 2017, Starbucks had made an announcement of store closures involving a shutter down of all 379 of its Teavana stores in 2018, with majority expected to close by this spring. While some of the stores in Simon malls have leases slated for expiry before this spring, majority of the leases run through January 2027. Starbucks cited lackluster traffic in malls for the decision to close these stores.However, Simon fought back and alleged that Starbucks’ Teavana store closures in its malls would result in a breach of lease obligations. Further, it claimed that this is just a lame excuse by Starbucks to refract the blame from itself.  The mall landlord pointed out that while the decision of store closures from several retailers like Sports Authority, Gap Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report), Macy’s Inc. (M  -  Free Report) among others was an outcome of either bankruptcy or financial ruin that was not the case with Starbucks. Rather, going by Simon’s allegations, the Teavana store-closure move came as the business failed to expand at Starbucks’ anticipated pace.Later in 2017, according to the New York Post, Starbucks was temporarily restrained by an Indiana judge from shutting down its 77 Teavana stores in Simon’s malls. Per the order, Starbucks can better absorb the financial loss by keeping its stores open than Simon bearing the brunt of withering vacancies. Although Starbucks planned to make an appeal, this week the company announced reaching a settlement. Notably, retail REITs have continued to bear the brunt as mall traffic continues to suffer amid a rapid shift in customers’ shopping preference through the online channel, resulting in an increasing number of retailers joining the dot-com bandwagon. These have made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures in recent years, while others unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies.Such an environment has led to tenants demanding substantial lease concessions but mall landlords are finding these unjustified. In addition, when there are substantial store closures in the middle of the lease term, not only are mall landlords hurt, but tenants occupying space in that mall are equally affected because their shop visits depend on the mix of specific types of retailers.Shares of Simon Property have underperformed the industry it belongs to, over the past year. This Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company’s shares have dropped 11.6%, while the industry has recorded growth of 5.1% during the same time frame.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

361,SPG,"Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report) recently sued Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) to refrain the latter from going in for its plan to close the Teavana stores in Simon’s malls. The move comes amid a wave of store closure announcements in recent times which have served a severe blow to the retail real estate market.The AllegationsSimon’s lawsuit alleged that Starbucks’ 78 Teavana store closures in its malls would result in a breach of its lease obligations. Further, the company claimed that this store closure announcement by Starbucks has led to an adverse impact on the value of Simon’s properties. However, there were no specifications in the lawsuit about the amount of financial relief or damage sought by Simon, per the Indianapolis Business Journal news.Notably, the Starbucks’ July announcement of store closures involves a shutter down of all 379 of its Teavana stores in the next year, with majority occurring by spring 2018. However, only two of the Teavana stores in Simon malls have leases slated for expiry before the spring of 2018, but the leases for the rest 76 stores run through January 2027.Starbucks cited lackluster traffic in malls for the decision to close the stores. However, Simon alleged that this is just a lame excuse by Starbucks to refract the blame from itself. In fact, the mall landlord pointed out that the decision of store closures from several retailers like Sports Authority, Gap Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report), Macy’s Inc. (M  -  Free Report) among others was an outcome of either bankruptcy or financial ruin.But this is not the case with Starbucks, which has earned its reputation for being “one of the largest and most recognized companies in the world.” Rather, the Teavana store closure move came as the business failed to expand at Starbucks’ anticipated pace, according to Simon’s allegations.Impact of Store ClosuresAs a matter of fact, mall traffic continues to suffer amid rapid shift in customers’ shopping preferences and patterns, with online purchases growing by leaps and bounds. These have made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures in recent times.Further, retailers unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies. This comes as a pressing concern for retail REITs, as this trend has been considerably curtailing demand for the retail real estate space.In fact, year to date, the REIT Retail industry has underperformed the broader market. This industry has declined 6.5% over this time frame, as against a 9.9% gain of the S&P 500.Amid these, mall landlords have already decided to go to the mattresses. These companies are continuing to make concerted efforts to turn their boring retail hubs into swanky entertainment zones, digitizing their malls and turning into distribution hubs.However, the choppy retail real estate market situation is also said to have led to tenants demanding substantial lease concessions, which the mall landlords are finding it unjustified. Moreover, significant store closures in the middle of the lease term not only hurt the mall landlord, but also the tenants occupying space in that mall because their shop visits also depend on the mix of specific type of retailers.Currently, Simon Property carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

362,SPG,"Realty Income (O  -  Free Report) is likely to remain on the growth curve with strategic acquisitions. During the nine-month period ended Sep 30, 2017, the company invested around $956.9 million in 177 new properties and properties under development or expansion, situated in 35 states. The assets are fully leased with a weighted average lease term of approximately 14.9 years.Per a video interview at REITworld 2017 with Nareit, the company’s CEO, John Case, mentioned that the company continues to witness solid investment opportunities and expects to complete around $1.5 billion of acquisitions in 2017. In fact, according to him, a bigger number of acquisitions are backing the 6% earnings per share increase projected by the company for the year.Moreover, in December, Realty Income announced a hike in its common stock monthly cash dividend, giving shareholders another reason to rejoice. This marks the company’s 94th dividend increase since its NYSE listing in 1994. The company will now pay 21.25 cents per share against 21.20 cents paid earlier. The increased dividend will be paid on Jan 12, 2018, to shareholders of record as of Jan 2, 2018.Notably, the company enjoys a trademark on the phrase “The Monthly Dividend Company”. The January 2018 dividend not only marks its 570th consecutive monthly payout in its 48-year operating history but also is the 81st consecutive quarterly increase. In fact, the company has generated a compound average annual dividend growth of around 4.6% since its listing on the NYSE. Given its financial position and lower debt-to-equity ratio compared with the industry, this dividend rate is likely to be sustainable.Realty Income’s portfolio comprised 5,062 properties, situated in 49 states and Puerto Rico as of Sep 30, 2017, containing more than 86.4 million leasable square feet of space. These properties are leased to 251 different commercial tenants, belonging to 47 separate industries. The company leases its properties under long-term, net lease agreements.Lately, shrinking footfall at malls amid shift of consumers toward online channels, store closures and bankruptcy of retailers have emerged as a pressing concerns for most retail REITs including Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report), GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report) and Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report). However, not all are facing the brunt, as a few among these companies are still gaining even in the tepid scenario, thanks to the business models.In fact, this freestanding retail REIT, Realty Income, derives more than 90% of its annualized retail rental revenues from tenants belonging to service, non-discretionary and low-price retail business. Such businesses are less susceptible to economic recessions and competition from Internet retailing.Additionally, Realty Income’s solid underlying real estate quality and prudent underwriting at acquisition have helped the company maintain high occupancy levels consistently. In fact, since 1996, the company’s occupancy level has never been below 96%. Additionally, its same-store rent growth has displayed limited operational volatility.The company also maintains a conservative capital structure. It has modest leverage, robust liquidity and continued access to attractively priced equity and debt capital. Additionally, it has a well-laddered debt maturity schedule.However, Realty Income’s substantial exposure to single-tenant assets raises risks associated with tenant default. Moreover, despite the company’s efforts to diversify the tenant base, its tenants in the drug store industry accounted for around 10.8% of its rental revenue in third-quarter 2017. This makes the company’s results susceptible to any adverse changes in this industry, because a downturn in the industry or a change in legislation relating to prescription drugs, could substantially affect Realty Income’s tenants and in turn affect the revenue stream of the REIT. Further, rate hike add to its woes.Shares of Realty Income have outperformed the industry it belongs to, in a month’s time.

363,SPG,"Welltower  has been making efforts to bring together modern healthcare centers and major health systems. Through these efforts the company is also enhancing the quality of its assets. Furthermore, this industry-leading healthcare real estate investment trust (REIT) has been resorting to innovative initiatives in a bid to add value to its portfolio.Most recently, the company collaborated with Simon Property Group (SPG  -  Free Report) — a preeminent leader in the ownership of high quality retail and mixed-use properties — to provide an outpatient facility. Specifically, the outpatient facility will be opened in Simon-owned — The Shops — in Mission Viejo, CA. The 105,000-square-foot best-in-class center will offer a range of health and medical services, and focus on cancer care.Moreover, Welltower is set to join forces with a prominent local health system which also has a hospital adjacent to the mall. Notably, the mall serves many nearby communities such as Ladera Ranch, Rancho Santa Margarita, San Juan Capistrano and Mission Viejo city. Further, it is conveniently located at the intersection of the I-5 and Crown Valley Parkway. Hence the facility will enjoy decent demand and the mall will witness higher footfall.Importantly, this arrangement is the first time that a healthcare REIT, health system and Simon have come together to offer healthcare services in a dynamic location such as The Shops.In other remarkable moves, Welltower has secured an institutional investor as a joint-venture partner for the development of a senior living building. Specifically, Welltower, in partnership with Hines, will develop the new senior living community at 56th Street and Lexington Avenue in Midtown Manhattan.    Notably, the company’s business is focused on senior housing operating assets and the steady performance of this asset class demonstrates the rationale behind the increasing interest of institutional investors toward senior housing assets.Also, Mark Shaver, currently the VP of Business Development and Strategic Alliances at Johns Hopkins Medicine, is set to join management of Welltower as SVP, Strategy. He has 20 years of experience in executing strategic initiatives at leading health systems and will work toward bringing together health systems, heath-care services providers and technology companies at Welltower.  While Welltower is actively expanding its portfolio, the company continues to follow a disciplined deleveraging strategy and aims to reduce corporate overheads. In fact, it anticipates 2017 disposition proceeds to be around $2.4 billion, an increase from the previous outlook of $2 billion. Welltower is also set to dispose healthcare facilities leased to the skilled nursing giant — Genesis HealthCare (GEN  -  Free Report). This will make the company’s capital structure more sustainable.However, increased supply of senior housing assets remains a concern for the company.

364,SPG,"Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report) has agreed on a settlement with Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman over its “anticompetitive tactics” that limit the development of competing outlet centers in New York City. The company is the owner of Woodbury Common center in Hudson Valley region and Roosevelt Field in Garden City.In an Attorney General’s Office investigation, it was established that retailers at Woodbury Common Premium Outlets were under contractual restrictions restraining them from opening a second store within the radius of 60 “air miles,” or about 70 land miles. Those in violation of the condition faced penalty charges.Thus, Woodbury Common enjoyed “monopoly power” in the New York City area among 200 other outlet centers across the country. The restriction also foiled efforts of several developers who faced a hard time in signing key retailers for their outlet centers. Moreover, it confined competitive outlet centers from thriving in the New York City, limiting the choices available for consumers and retailers.Per the settlement, the largest mall operator in the United States will pay $945,000 to New York State in addition to dissolving the radius restriction in its existing leases.Moreover, the company will restrain from using radius restrictions or other similar privileged agreements for the next 10 years that might hinder the growth of other outlet centers. To ensure unbiased compliance with the settlement, Simon has agreed to appoint an independent monitor.This agreement will accordingly allow new outlet malls to flourish in Queens, Brooklyn, The Bronx and Staten Island, benefiting the consumers and several retailers. It is anticipated to boost the growth of New York economy.In a statement, Simon defended that its radius restrictions have a “lawful” and “reasonable” basis, and these restrictions were used long before the company acquired Woodbury Common in 2004. Moreover, it also “granted exception” and waived off the provision on several occasions.  Woodbury Common’s annual revenues total more than $1.3 billion. Some popular retailers at the outlet center are Michael Kors, Coach, Dior, Gucci, Fendi and Armani.The settlement has increased the company’s litigation expenses and is anticipated to drain its resources. Moreover, Simon has been facing challenges to retain its customers with online shopping taking precedence over in-store purchase.Year to date, shares of Simon have underperformed the industry. While the company’s shares fell 13%, the industry declined 7.2% over this period. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks in the REIT space are American Asset Trust, Inc (AAT  -  Free Report), PS Business Parks, Inc.

365,SPG,"With the Q2 earnings season on its last leg, this is the right time to gauge the performance of the real estate investment trust (REIT) industry.Admittedly, rate hikes and a cautious approach of investors have affected gains in this industry so far this year. However, investors need to keep in mind that operating performance of this special hybrid asset is highly determined by the dynamics of the individual asset categories. A number of asset categories displayed strength in second-quarter 2017, with the economy and the job market showing signs of recovery.In fact, per a NAREIT media release, occupancy rates remained high in the second quarter, while funds from operations (“FFO”), a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs, reported growth.Specifically, the Q2 scorecard reveals that the total FFO of the listed U.S Equity REIT industry of $15.6 billion in the reported quarter increased 7.9% sequentially. The figure also came in 7.3% higher than the prior-year quarter tally.Same-store net operating income (NOI) reported 3.3% year-over-year growth. Results were driven by segments like Single Family Homes, Data Centers and Manufactured Home Communities, which witnessed robust same-store NOI growth of 6.8%, 5.8% and 5.7%, respectively.Furthermore, properties owned by the listed Equity REITs enjoyed solid occupancy levels. In fact, the occupancy rate remained unchanged at 93.4%, slightly below the record high occupancy rate of 93.7% recorded in the third and fourth quarters of 2016.Admittedly, growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data is not only helping tech companies, but also driving demand for data center REITs. Moreover, the industrial asset category hogged the limelight for experiencing high demand, with the economy and job market displaying signs of recovery, ecommerce gaining strength, and the manufacturing environment remaining healthy.Also, the residential real estate market benefited from healthy demand levels and a delay in deliveries that kept the supply number in check. No doubt, the shrinking mall traffic and store closures amid aggressive growth in online sales kept retail REITs on tenterhooks. However, retail REITs managed to grab attention from new and productive tenants, and were able to replace with the ones which departed.Among the S&P 500 REIT constituents, data center REIT Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (DLR  -  Free Report) and industrial REIT Prologis, Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report) delivered better-than-expected results in the quarter, with positive surprises of nearly 3.4% and 7.7%, respectively, in terms of FFO per share. Also, retail REIT Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report) and residential REIT Essex Property Trust, Inc. (ESS  -  Free Report) surpassed estimates, registering positive surprise of 1.2% and around 1.7%, respectively.Currently, Digital Realty, Prologis, Simon Property Group and Essex Property carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

366,SPG,"Simon Property Group’s (SPG  -  Free Report) constant efforts to enhance its portfolio through transformative redevelopments and acquisitions were reflected in its second quarter earnings. The company exited the quarter with various redevelopment and expansion projects in progress at 25 properties across the U.S. and Canada and its share of costs was around $1.3 billion.The company raised its full-year 2017 FFO per share guidance and projects it to be in the range of $11.14-$11.22. This was mainly driven by improved property performance and growth in revenues.The company has been actively restructuring its portfolio and is aiming at strategic acquisitions. It recently opened the Norfolk Premium Outlets in Norfolk, VA and Genting Highlands Premium Outlets, its second Premium Outlet Center in Malaysia. The move marks the company’s effort to enhance its portfolio with premium properties in vibrant locations.The company’s focus on global expansion augurs well for long-term growth. Its ownership stake in Klépierre gives it access to premium retail assets in the high barrier-to-entry markets of Europe. We believe this geographical diversification cushions Simon Property from market volatility and helps it post a decent performance.As noted above, Simon Property has an active redevelopment and expansion pipeline, comprising high-end projects, on national and international levels. This increases operational risks, exposing the company to escalating construction costs, entitlement delays and lease-up risks.Such ventures and initiatives come at a point when mall traffic has been shrinking due to a shift in shopping patterns, with online shopping taking precedence over in-store purchase. As a result, demand for retail real estate space has been diminishing, of late, as changing shopping patterns are compelling retailers to reconsider their footprint, and eventually opt for store closures or file bankruptcies.While Simon Property has been striving to counter the pressure through various initiatives, the implementation of such measures requires a decent upfront cost. This, in turn, will limit any robust growth in the company’s near-term profit margins.Moreover, the stock has lost 11.4% year to date, underperforming 1.7% growth recorded by the industry it belongs to. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks in the REIT space include American Asset Trust, Inc. (AAT  -  Free Report), Regency Centers Corp. (REG  -  Free Report) and Liberty Property Trust (LPT  -  Free Report). All three stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here..While American Asset Trust and Regency Centers have expected long-term growth rates of 5.9% and 7.7% respectively, Liberty Property Trust has expected long-term growth rate of 6%.Note: All EPS numbers presented in this write up represent funds from operations (“FFO”) per share.
