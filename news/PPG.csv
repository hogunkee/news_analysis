The Dow, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 all ended the session above their 50-day moving averages, but the Russell 2000 broke below its 50-day line after a four-day stint above that level of support.Overseas, Japan took the hardest hit among major indexes.

7,PPG,"United Technologies (UTX) predicted Wednesday its Pratt & Whitney unit will ramp up deliveries of its latest jet engine this year, as production problems come under control.Delays with the new geared turbofan prompted Qatar Airways to cancel an order last year for Airbus (EADSY) A320neo jets.United Tech earlier had cut its 2016 forecast for turbofan deliveries to 150 from 200. On Wednesday, the company said it sees 2017 deliveries of 350-400, including about 50 spares.The industrial conglomerate also reported fourth-quarter earnings rose 13.9% to $1.56 a share, in line with Wall Street forecasts, as revenue rose 2.5% to $14.66 billion, missing views for $14.7 billion.Sales at Pratt & Whitney rose nearly 4% to $3.99 billion. Sales at its Otis elevator unit dipped 1% to $3.06 billion. Sales at the climate, control and security business rose 3% to $4.25 billion. Aerospace systems sales grew 4% to $3.6 billion.The company also backed its full-year 2017 EPS view of $6.30-$6.60, with the midpoint below consensus for $6.56, on revenue of $57.5 billion-$59 billion,  also light vs. Wall Street views for $58.86 billion.United Tech said it plans to buy back $3.5 billion in shares this year and is setting aside $1 billion-$2 billion for acquisitions.""Despite an uncertain global macro environment, our growing aerospace backlog and strategic investments in the commercial businesses position us well to generate higher organic growth in 2017,"" Chief Executive Officer Gregory Hayes said in a statement.Shares fell 0.6% to 110.95 on the stock market today, staying in buy range and finding support at their 50-day line after undercutting both key points intraday.In the latter part of last year, other industrials, like Dover (DOV), Honeywell (HON) and PPG Industries (PPG), gave dim forecasts about the months to come.Last week, General Electric (GE) reported fourth-quarter results that offered up more of the same: slow growth globally, volatility, an oversupplied oil & gas sector that has less need for GE's oil-related equipment. GE, however, said it remained more upbeat heading into this year.When asked about how potential regulatory changes under the new administration might affect its businesses, CEO Jeff Immelt said they ""could see some caution"" over the Affordable Care Act, which the GOP has been eager to dismantle, from customers who buy medical equipment from its health care division.GE shares were up 1.2% Wednesday.RELATED:Trump Claims Twitter Win On Indiana Jobs; Carrier Stresses State IncentivesTrump Touts Carrier Deal, Says Companies Leaving U.S. Face 'Consequences'United Technologies, Costco Upgraded; Shale Producers Mixed

8,PPG,"General Electric (GE) reports fourth-quarter earnings on Friday, after several months of lamenting an environment marked by ""slow growth.""And while CEO Jeff Immelt in October said the industrial giant's orders and organic growth would pick up steam in the fourth quarter, analysts remain cautious.""GE had a rough 2016 and 4Q is an important quarter to show order stability, margin gains, and cash flow improvement,"" Barclays analyst Scott Davis said in a research note, also predicting sequential improvement in 2017.Wall Street expects fourth-quarter earnings per share to fall 11.5% to 46 cents, with revenue dipping 0.5% to $33.66 billion.The company's power and renewables segments are expected to be strong, while transportation and oil & gas — which are still shaking off the effects of a global commodity oversupply — are expected to be weaker, Credit Suisse said in a recent research note.And despite GE's attempts to cut costs, strip back its finance operations to focus on its core industrial segments as well as become more of an industrial analytics firm, Credit Suisse sees earnings lagging those of its peers due to ""sluggish"" orders while consensus forecasts for the first half of the year look too high.But, as with other sectors, investors could be more focused on any guidance. The energy sector has rallied as crude prices recovered late last year, and investors will look for an update on GE's prospects in that market.In October, GE and Baker Hughes (BHI) in October announced a deal to combine GE's oil and gas operations with the oilfield services giant, whose merger with Halliburton (HAL) was called off earlier in the year due to antitrust concerns. Halliburton has said it's willing to sacrifice market share to boost profits as discounts offered during the oil bust are rolled back.Meanwhile, the U.S. oil-rig count has shot up and shale companies are ramping up 2017 exploration and production budgets, boosting demand for oilfield services and equipment.GE shares were down 0.1% at 31.21 on the stock market today. The stock broke out last month but dropped below its 31.59 entry last week. A strong Q4 report could send GE back in buying range.IBD'S TAKE: General Electric has attempted to turn more into a tech company, with a big, long-term focus on the so-called Industrial Internet. GE's Q4 report kicks off big industrial earnings and will come after a Q3 earnings season in which a variety of industrials offered cloudier forecasts. Honeywell (HON), citing in part weakness in aerospace, cut its sales and profit outlook, while Dover (DOV) and PPG Industries (PPG) warned of a weaker economy.The election sent industrials surging on expectations of an infrastructure spending package and corporate tax cuts. But the market appears to be tiring of its fling with President-elect Donald Trump, and Q4 results will test the sentiment of new shareholders.""Are the new owners in it just for the Trump infrastructure/tax trade and likely to jump at the first sign of weakness?"" Barclays analyst Davis wrote. ""Are they prepared for what will likely be another very soft quarter?""He said investors are likely to ignore short-term struggles and look ahead toward the second half of the year, when the rebound in oil and gas could strengthen and Trump's policy proposals become clearer either at that time or later.""We think 2017 is a year to buy into any dips,"" Davis said, ""and we do expect some.""RELATED:Apple, General Electric, Microsoft Lead Field In Stock Buybacks

Adjusted earnings came to $4.23 per share, missing estimates from nine analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research, who called for earnings of $4.34 per share.The paint and coatings maker posted revenue of $3.28 billion in the period, also missing Street forecasts. Three analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $3.29 billion.Shares of the company fell 27.87 to 250.01 in recent action.Sherwin-Williams expects full-year earnings to be $11.30 to $11.40 per share.Sherwin-Williams shares had increased 7% since the beginning of the year, while the Standard & Poor's 500 index has risen slightly more than 5%. The stock had risen 13% in the last 12 months.Now, however, Sherwin-Williams has given back much of those gains, and dragged others in the sector with it. Shares of PPG Industries (PPG) gapped down by more than 2%, as did RPM International (RPM), and Axalta Coating Systems (AXTA) fell more than 1%.
"
10,PPG,"General Electric (GE) on Friday cut its full-year organic growth outlook, making it the latest industrial to offer a cloudier forecast amid a sluggish global economy.Despite a rebound in oil prices, management sees GE's oil and gas business to remain weak, though the strong dollar should have less of an impact.The company said it now anticipates full-year organic growth being flat to up 2%, compared with a forecast for 2%-4% the company stuck with during its second-quarter earnings call in July. Back then, the company said it expected strong organic growth in the second half of the year.General Electric held to the midpoint of its earnings-per-share guidance for 2016, but narrowed its outlook. The company said it expects full-year EPS of $1.48-$1.52, compared to an earlier forecast for $1.45-$1.55. Analysts see $1.49. A tough foreign exchange environment continues to weigh on the company.The industrial conglomerate also upped its stock repurchase program by $4 billion.GE shares fell as low as 28.33 on the stock market today, undercutting the low end of the flat base that was forming, but recovered to closed down just 0.3% at 28.98. Honeywell (HON), which reported earnings in line with views, rose 0.8%.Prospects for the industrial sector are looking grimmer. Honeywell earlier this month cut its profit and sales outlook, partly on aerospace woes. Dover (DOV) and PPG Industries (PPG) also warned on financial results, in part due to a weaker economy.General Electric's Q3 earnings per share rose 10% to 32 cents, topping views for 30 cents. Revenue rose 4% to $29.27 billion, missing estimates for $29.64 billion.Industrial segment organic revenue rose 1%. Oil and gas revenue fell 25%, with the effect of low oil prices still making its way through the energy sector. Power unit revenue jumped 37%, and aviation revenue rose 5%.Organic industrial orders fell 6% during the quarter. Digital and software orders, however, rose 11%.The results come as General Electric undergoes an evolution into more of an industrial tech and analytics company. The company in June also shed its ""systemically important financial institution"" label as it offloads GE Capital's assets.IBD'S TAKE: Even as General Electric makes its way through messier short-term conditions, its long-term ambitions are vast. For more information, see this story about GE's plans to become a leader in industrial Internet technology.  GE said in September it plans to buy two European 3D printing companies, raising speculation it might buy U.S. counterparts, though a Pacific Crest Securities analyst has said GE probably wouldn't buy 3D Systems (DDD).But GE said Friday that it won't raise its price for one of those European companies, Germany's SLM Solutions, after shareholder Elliott Management called it too low.""Elliott Management's objection to the terms of GE's offer for SLM won't likely impact GE's strategy to make bolt-on acquisitions in adjacent product markets like 3-D printing,"" Fitch said in an email. ""There will still be opportunities in other businesses to target acquisitions that offer relatively high sales growth or synergies, and where GE can leverage its technological expertise and scale.""RELATED:General Electric HQ Is Now In Boston, But GE Stock Isn't MovingApple, General Electric, Microsoft Top Q2 In Stock Buybacks

11,PPG,"Since July 21, the day before General Electric (GE) reported second-quarter results, the conglomerate's shares have lost around 10% of their value.Even though earnings per share and sales jumped during that quarter, orders fell 16% organically, and industrial organic revenue missed some expectations. Revenue in the company's oil and gas segment sank 22%, with low oil prices continuing to hurt the business. Lower commodity carloads in North America hurt the company's transportation segment. A difficult foreign exchange environment also weighed.On the second-quarter earnings call, CEO Jeff Immelt said General Electric faced a ""slow growth and volatile environment."" However, he added that GE was ""positioned for strong organic growth in the second half.""For the third quarter and further out, analysts will be looking to see if GE can deliver on that position. Wall Street expects General Electric's Q3 earnings per share to rise 3% to 30 cents on revenue up 6% to $29.636 billion. But industrial orders and organic revenue will watched closely.Investors will likely also be watching for continued strength in the company's aviation and power segments.And oil prices have rebounded, potentially shoring up future demand for GE's oil equipment, or at least stopping the bleeding. Analyst forecasts indicate that the drag the energy sector has put on the S&P 500 in recent quarters could subside in Q4.Immelt in July said that GE's oil and gas segment ""faces major cyclical headwinds but by the second half, they have easier comps."" However, he also said improvement in that segment and GE's transportation business was unlikely next year.IBD'S TAKE: Even as General Electric makes its way through messier short-term conditions, its long-term ambitions are vast. For more information, see this story about GE's plans to become a leader in industrial Internet technology.  Barclays analyst Scott Davis said the third quarter was likely to be ""sloppy"" for industrials, according to commentary cited by Barron's. He added that ""business spending hiccupped"" during the period, though it was unclear why, and that the quarter tends to suffer from seasonal weakness.""Some blame the Presidential election, some just cite recovery uncertainty,"" he said. ""It doesn't appear to be a long-term issue, and we have spoken to folks who have seen more stabilization in October and expect projects to move forward post the U.S. election.""""At this point, however, 2016 seems a lost year and all eyes will likely move toward 2017 order books to see if even a modest recovery is realistic,"" Davis later added.Elsewhere in the sector, Honeywell (HON) this month cut its profit and sales outlook, partly on aerospace woes. Dover (DOV) and PPG Industries (PPG) also warned on financial results, in part due to a weaker economy.The results will come as General Electric undergoes an evolution into more of an industrial tech and analytics company. While General Electric in September said it plans to buy two European 3D printing companies, a Pacific Crest Securities analyst has said GE probably wouldn't buy 3D Systems (DDD).General Electric rose 0.3% to 69.42 in the stock market today, after falling last week to its lowest level in nearly eight months. The stock's 50-day line this week crossed its 200-day line, a bearish sign. Honeywell rose 0.4% while PPG dipped 0.3%.Dover closed up 2.8% as it released official Q3 results before the open.RELATED:General Electric HQ Is Now In Boston, But GE Stock Isn't MovingApple, General Electric, Microsoft Top Q2 In Stock Buybacks

12,PPG,"Manufacturer Dover (DOV) on Monday cut its full-year sales and profit forecasts, due in part to weakness in some oil and gas markets, and a global economy that it expects to remain sluggish, adding to similar warnings from industrials like Honeywell (HON) and PPG Industries (PPG).Dover — which makes equipment that helps oil and gas producers, as well as refrigeration equipment — slashed its full-year earnings per share forecast to $3.00-$3.05 from an earlier outlook for $3.35-$3.45. Dover also now sees full-year revenue down 4% to 5%, compared to earlier guidance for a 3%-5% decline.Analysts see EPS of $3.34 on a 1.3% revenue decline.""The primary factors driving this revision are generally weaker capital spending across several industrial end-markets, continued weakness in longer cycle oil & gas exposed markets, and continued headwinds in our retail refrigeration business related to production inefficiencies,"" the company said in a statement.Shares sank 7.7% to close at 66.69 in the stock market today, breaching support at their 50-day line and nearly blowing through the bottom of a cup base after climbing closer to a breakout last week. Among other diversified manufacturers, General Electric (GE) fell 0.8% and United Technologies (UTX) lost 0.6%.Dover also said it would complete its acquisition of Wayne Fueling Systems in the first quarter of 2017, later than initially expected, due to U.K. regulators' concerns over competition. In June, the company said that acquisition would likely close in the back half of 2016.Dover's downbeat forecast comes after Honeywell late Thursday trimmed its own full-year guidance, saying a weaker oil industry, along with struggles in emerging markets, have hurt aircraft demand.IBD'S TAKE: Even as energy markets remain a concern, IBD's Oil & Gas U.S. Exploration and Production group has surged to the second best among 197 groups tracked. To learn about some of the most promising stocks in the group, read this Industry Snapshot. PPG Industries, which makes paints and coatings for the construction, industrial and other markets, on Friday also warned on its third-quarter results.PPG said it was ""disappointed with this quarter's EPS growth rate as we continue to operate in a sluggish economic environment with no clear near-term catalyst for improving global GDP growth.""Honeywell stock dipped 0.1% Monday after sinking 7.5% Friday, while PPG edged up 0.1% Monday after diving 8.3% Friday.Despite concerns about the energy sector, it is expected to cease being a drag on the overall S&P 500 in the fourth quarter as oil prices rebound.RELATED:Diamondback Raises 2016 Production Outlook, Ends Buyout TalksU.S. Oil Tops $50 On Hopes For Output Deal; Saudis Hint At $60

18,PPG,"The stock market finished higher but off session highs with the S&P 500 unable to close above its 50-day moving average, as a duel over cancer drugs sparked major moves in pharmaceuticals Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY).The Nasdaq rose 0.7% as biotechs and generic drugs ranked among the day's leaders. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.5%, but closed below their 50-day lines after trading above that support level for much of the day. The small-cap Russell 2000 led with a 1.2% advance.Volume was lower, with the Columbus Day holiday contributing to the slower pace of trading.The energy sector led as U.S. crude futures jumped more than 3% to $51.15 a barrel, the highest since July 2015. Russia said it is willing to join other producing countries in limiting output to give oil prices a boost. Exploration, drilling, oilfield services and other related groups were among Monday's top 10.Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), an exploration company that operates in Texas, broke out of a base-on-base pattern with a 191.04 buy point. Volume was lackluster, though.In the software sector, Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) broke out of an odd cup-with-handle base, topping the 26.31 buy point intraday. But volume was average also, and shares pulled back to a gain of 2.8% to 26.25. DA Davidson upgraded the publisher of electronics-design software to buy from neutral and raised the target price to 30 from 25.One of the keynote moves in today's market was in Big Pharma. Bristol-Myers was the stock under most selling on Stocks On The Move.

One of the darlings of the fiber-optics rally, Acacia tumbled 7.5% in heavy volume after diving 9% on Friday, breaking below its 50-day moving average.  It was the main reason why the fiber-optics industry group was the worst performing Monday, down nearly 2%.Banking stocks were active, and two small-caps are close to buy points. Centerstate Banks (CSFL), based in Davenport, Fla., poked above a 18.37 buy point of a flat base intraday but faded to close at 18.26.

"
19,PPG,"The third quarter could finally be the bottom — after a year of the embattled, oversupplied energy sector pulling earnings of S&P 500 companies into negative terrain.Earnings for S&P 500 companies are forecast to dip 0.5% from a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data. Given that actual results usually top analyst forecasts by a couple of percentage points, this could end a four-quarter earnings decline as the hangover from the oil price crash subsides. Revenue is set to grow 2.6%, ending six quarters of declines.Energy earnings are seen plunging 67%, but that's an improvement from declines of 85% in Q2 and an outright loss in Q1. In Q4, energy earnings are expected to see 3.8% growth as crude prices have rebounded from 12-year lows early this year to above $50 a barrel on Thursday. Leaving out the energy sector, S&P 500 earnings are estimated to grow 2.9% in Q3.""The idea is that the worst is behind us,"" said Sheraz Mian, who manages Zacks' equity research department. ""We saw some early tentative signs of improvement in the last earnings season as well, even though growth was in the negative.  . . . But results were nevertheless an improvement over what was expected.""Financials will add a lift, with sector earnings forecast to tick up 1% vs. drops of 4% in Q2 and 12.6% in Q1. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) report on Friday, Oct. 14. Most banking stocks — with the notable exception of scandal-hit Wells Fargo — have been rallying in recent weeks on expectations for a Federal Reserve rate hike.Broadly, the estimates reflect easier comparisons, particularly in energy and materials, whose results have slumped with the price of commodities. And the strong dollar still weighed during the quarter. But it didn't weigh as much as it could have because expectations have dimmed over the year for the Fed to be more aggressive about raising interest rates.Expectations in the months to come — including 8.4% earnings growth for Q4 — are higher but obtainable, Thomson Reuters analyst David Aurelio said. But while loftier forecasts typically get revised downward as the reporting season advances, earnings are still likely to grow in Q4 and early 2017 despite lingering economic anxiety.""I think the overall sentiment doesn't seem to have this positive outlook,"" he said. ""But when you look into the numbers, they're telling you a very different story.""The tech sector's earnings are expected to grow 4.5% in Q3 and 10.1% excluding Apple (AAPL), Aurelio said, demonstrating the company's weight in the index. In fact, taking Apple out of the S&P 500 overall would result in a slim 0.1% profit gain.But Aurelio pointed to pockets of resilience in the tech sector outside of Apple, which has been bogged down on concerns about slowing iPhone demand.In particular, he likes the odds of the semiconductor equipment segment, whose earnings are expected to grow 61% amid greater demand for technology that provides efficient memory storage. Applied Materials (AMAT) is among the leaders in the group, with earnings seen jumping more than 125% on nearly 40% revenue growth.""It's historically always been a gauge for where things are going, because it's supplying the equipment to make the devices that go into other devices,"" he said. ""It's supplying the equipment to make the chips.""The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index of stocks has climbed 50% from a mid-February low to a 16-year closing high Thursday.Elsewhere, there are mixed signals. After posting double-digit-percentage earnings gains over the past year, the consumer discretionary sector is poised to slow to only 4.1% growth, according to Thomson Reuters.The expected slowdown comes largely from the auto industry, in particular Ford (F), with its anticipated 51% drop in earnings. The automaker in July indicated that sales could soon hit their peak, amid concerns about discounts and an auto-loan bubble. Take Ford out of the equation, and consumer discretionary's earnings would grow 7.9%, Aurelio said. General Motors' (GM) earnings should dip 4% after several quarters of more than double-digit gains.Amazon (AMZN), which is included in the consumer discretionary group, is seen doing some heavy lifting for the sector, with earnings growth expected to surge 371% in Q3.Elsewhere in the consumer-facing sector, restaurants across the board have warned of less customer spending, and retailers continue to suffer at the hands of Amazon.The materials sector, forecast to rebound to 7.1% earnings growth after a year of declines, is also seen getting a boost from a single heavy lifter.The section's drive into positive territory was due to the copper sub-industry, Aurelio said. The lone S&P 500 member of that mining subsector is Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), whose earnings are projected to soar 227%. Excluding Freeport, the materials sector's earnings would decline 0.6%.Labor costs in a variety of businesses — in retail, restaurants and even the airlines — could also mean lower profits. And while the health care sector is often immune to the cycles that hurt other businesses, earnings growth for the space is expected to slow to 5.5%. The sector overall is heading into tougher comparisons after getting a boost from the biotech industry in the past.So just as the shock from the oil bust is finally starting to fade, there's the sense that other big companies are losing momentum.""The growth cycle effectively has run its course for large-cap America as a whole,"" Mian said.Analysts expect industrial firms to report a 1.2% earnings decline, and that likely doesn't reflect Honeywell (HON) news. Honeywell late Thursday cut the top end of its 2016 earnings forecast, citing weak Q3 aerospace sales. Honeywell shares plunged 7.5% Friday, with aerospace customers and rivals also slumping.PPG Industries (PPG), maker of industrial coatings, paints and glass, crashed 8.3% Friday on a Q3 profit warning. Fellow S&P 500 paint component Sherwin-Williams (SHW) retreated 1.9%.

70,PPG,"Valspar CEO Gary Hendrickson paints a bright picture of the company's business, which dates back to 1806. Recent buys, market share gains, expanded distribution and a strong showing in hot spots such as China put it on a path to grow.
"
71,PPG,"A maker of paints, varnishes and stains for the consumer market, Valspar (VAL) also sells industrial coatings for the automotive sector and equipment manufacturers. Some of its products go into floor finishes and others into packaging, such as food and beverage cans.
"
72,PPG,"The company has shown five straight quarters of double-digit-percentage earnings growth. In its third quarter of fiscal 2014, which ended July 25, earnings per share rose 13% from a year earlier to $1.21. Sales gained 10% to $1.2 billion.
"
73,PPG,"Prospects remain rosy: Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect earnings will climb 16% to $4.12 a share for all of fiscal 2014, which ends in October. They forecast the same growth rate in earnings for fiscal 2015 and 12% for fiscal 2016.
"
74,PPG,"These expectations follow a nice pop in key overseas markets for Valspar and the 2013 acquisitions of Ace Hardware's paint-manufacturing assets and Inver Group, an industrial coatings maker in Europe.
"
75,PPG,"""In the short term, paints has been a fast growing segment because of the acquisition of Ace Hardware we did last year and a couple of other growth initiatives,"" Hendrickson told IBD. ""Our coatings business has done extraordinarily well with growth in the last quarter of 16%.""
"
76,PPG,"How Ace Hardware Helps
"
77,PPG,"Besides acquiring Ace Hardware's manufacturing assets, Valspar signed a long-term deal to supply Ace-branded paint products and make a comprehensive line of Valspar-branded paints available to more than 4,000 Ace retail stores in the U.S. It launched Valspar ""paint studio"" displays in more than 3,200 Ace Hardware stores in May.
"
78,PPG,"Overall, says Hendrickson, Valspar's paints segment is about $1.6 billion in sales and global in nature. Its market share is No. 2 in Australia and No. 3 in China.
"
79,PPG,"Valspar is the third in size by market cap of four companies in IBD's Chemicals-Paints industry group, after PPG Industries (PPG) and Sherwin-Williams Co. (SHW), and before RPM International (RPM). Valspar gets the highest IBD Composite Rating among them, 93 of a possible 99.
"
80,PPG,"Valspar's deal with Ace brought a lot to the table.
"
81,PPG,"""Our agreement with Ace extends the Valspar brand while further strengthening and diversifying Valspar's industry-leading consumer paints in the North American market,"" Hendrickson said in a statement announcing the arrangement, in January 2013. ""This new business also positions Valspar well for further growth as the U.S. housing market continues to recover.""
"
82,PPG,"Hendrickson says for Valspar to be a national brand, it needed to be widely distributed.
"
83,PPG,"""Prior to the deal our distribution was mainly with Lowe's,"" he added. ""The Ace deal gave us a national distribution partner and a new platform to advertise the brand.""
"
84,PPG,"Because it's still relatively early days yet, the Ace deal hasn't yet contributed to profitability, says Hendrickson. It was dilutive to profits in the first half of 2014, and will be slightly accretive in the second half and accretive in 2015, he says.
"
85,PPG,"Sales in the paints segment increased 4% from a year earlier in Valspar's third quarter to $474 million, led by performance in China and Australia. The May launch of Valspar Reserve Paint + Primer ""super premium paint"" in 1,715 Lowe's (LOW) stores in the U.S. also contributed to the gain.
"
86,PPG,"China And Australia Sales Lift
"
87,PPG,"Hendrickson says Valspar's paints business has seen strong growth in China, where the company serves domestic industries and its largest business is consumer paint sold into the housing market.
"
88,PPG,"In Australia third-quarter sales grew high single digits in local currency, Valspar's best sales growth in Australia since it acquired its business there in 2010.
"
89,PPG,"Year-to-date through the third quarter, the coatings segment has had the highest growth driven by the Inver acquisition, wood coatings and packaging coatings.
"
90,PPG,"About 55% of sales are from coatings and 40% from paints.
"
91,PPG,"Valspar acquired the family-owned Inver for an undisclosed amount. Inver specializes in liquid and powder coatings as well as resin products used in applications such as auto and off-road parts and railways. It posted around $200 million in sales in 2012.
"
92,PPG,"Designs On Europe
"
93,PPG,"Hendrickson says prior to the Inver buy Valspar was a ""small player in the $6 billion, extremely fragmented"" industrial coatings market in Europe. The buy gave Valspar scale.
"
94,PPG,"""With Inver, we went from being a smaller player to the No. 2 or No. 3 player ,"" Hendrickson said.
"
95,PPG,"Valspar saw synergies from the buy. It consolidated the two companies' supply chains, closed several redundant factories and ""got the cost structure to a place where it could be competitive,"" he added.
"
96,PPG,"The Inver buy gave Valspar an opportunity to restructure its European operation and to scale up, says KeyBanc analyst Ivan Marcuse.
"
97,PPG,"""Take the Inver acquisition, the Ace business, how successful Valspar is at Lowe's and the improvement in the China and Australia businesses, and it adds up to be pretty (meaningful),"" he said. ""The combination of all these things — plus its other core businesses doing better — allows sales and earnings to grow at a pretty decent rate, which helps to explain the recent share performance.""
"
98,PPG,"The Inver buy allowed Valspar to expand in Europe ""at a good time in the cycle when Europe should be recovering,"" adds CLSA analyst Nils-Bertil Wallin.
"
99,PPG,"Hendrickson, a 20 year-veteran of Valspar, took the paint and coatings maker's helm in 2011 in the wake of a three-year restructuring program he helped develop, which set the company on a growth path again after the recession caused a slowdown in its markets and business.
"
100,PPG,"The program focused on improving the company's cost structure via efforts such as exiting some commodity businesses in order to give it the resources to invest in the businesses it wanted to be in for the long term, says Hendrickson. Valspar has now delivered double-digit-percentage earnings growth in all but four of the past 15 quarters. 
"
101,PPG,"""We simply stuck to our knitting,"" he said. ""We are a paint company and a materials company to a smaller extent and we haven't branched out beyond that.""
"
102,PPG,"Valspar has done more than 20 acquisitions in the last decade. Historically, that's how the company has grown, a method ""part and parcel the nature of"" the fragmented coatings market, Wallin says. And Valspar has been good at buys. 
"
103,PPG,"""It's been able to take a company that may not have been run efficiently and add an element of expertise,"" Wallin said. He estimates about 60% of the company's growth until end of 2012 was through acquisitions.
"
104,PPG,"""That's changed as the market has changed. They went from mainly acquisition growth to organic growth,"" he said. ""From an investor's perspective the shift from acquisition to organic growth could be interpreted as a change in strategy. But it makes sense if the company wants to grow, given its lack of company-owned stores.""
"
105,PPG,"That organic growth includes efforts such as bringing Valspar paint into Ace Hardware stores.
"
106,PPG,"Acquisitions are still a key part of Hendrickson's growth strategy: ""We are talking with a lot of people (about buyouts) all the time,"" he said. ""But the timing of the deals is not normally under our control.""
"
107,PPG,"Meanwhile, Hendrickson sees a lot of potential for Valspar when existing-home sales pick up further, noting they are just ""OK"" now.

150,PPG,"PPG Industries (PPG  -  Free Report) will exhibit its Teslin label stock during Labelexpo Europe 2017 at the Brussels Expo Center from Sep 25-28 for packaging specialists and label converters. Teslin label stock is durable, secure and easy to print. It enables printed data to remain on labels through demanding use and extreme environmental exposure.  The label stock is used extensively in security, medical, food and beverage applications owing to its reliability.

Sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,898.6 million. PPG Industries expects modest overall global economic growth. Also, the company anticipates a higher level of earnings-accretive cash deployment in the second half of 2017 including acquisitions and share repurchases. The company announced that it will resume share repurchases from the third quarter.  PPG Industries is taking steps for growing organically as well as cutting costs. The company also remains committed to deploy cash on acquisitions and share repurchases. It plans to deploy $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion of cash on acquisitions and share repurchases in 2017 and 2018 combined and is now targeting the top end of that range at a minimum. However, PPG Industries faces currency headwinds and macroeconomic challenges.

155,PPG,"PPG Industries (PPG  -  Free Report) has introduced a new line of corrosion-resistant, direct-to-metal (DTM) polyaspartic coatings, Kwikspar 600 and Kwikspar 600SG. These products, with advanced film-build and fast-cure characteristics, are geared to improve the throughput in field and shop applications.The new polyaspartic coatings can be overcoated on PPG Industries’ protective and marine coatings (PMC) products like Sigmafast 278 epoxy or Amercoat 370 primers, in highly corrosive environments. This provides an ultra-fast drying which is an alternative to conventional three-coat corrosion protection systems. In cases where the environment is low-to-moderately corrosive, one coat of Kwikspar 600SG or Kwikspar 600 can replace the usual two-coat urethane/ epoxy systems.The company’s PMC products help to protect assets in some of the most demanding environments and conditions including projects in infrastructure, energy and marine markets.According to PPG Industries, the technology behind Kwikspar polyaspartic coatings makes them very cost-effective solutions for structural and steel building components which usually require an excellent weathering, corrosion resistance, and color and gloss retention.When Kwikspar polyaspartic coatings are applied to steel, their fast curing abilities accelerate the production of finished parts and when used in the field for new construction or maintenance projects, their high film building characteristics enables applicators to attain a desired finish faster. This results in multiple benefits for the contractors and owners like saving time, labor and material cost and also helps them to ensure faster return-to-service.PPG Industries has announced that its Kwikspar coatings are formulated from 73% solids which cure up to eight times quicker than regular polyurethane coatings. They also exhibit outstanding properties like flexibility, durability and scratch resistance.PPG Industries has underperformed the Zacks categorized Chemicals-Diversified industry over the last one year. The company’s shares have moved up around 6.7% over this period, compared with roughly 7.1% gain recorded by the industry. PPG Industries is exposed to unfavorable currency exchange translation, especially in emerging markets. It also faces macroeconomic challenges and volatility in raw materials and energy costs.The company sees higher raw materials costs on a year-over-year basis in second-quarter 2017.

"
156,PPG,"The September quarter essentially mirrored the conditions witnessed in the first two quarters of the year. A feeble economic recovery in the U.S. and persistent recessionary conditions in Europe continue to lead to depleted demand for chemical products. Growth continues to struggle due to weaknesses across some key end-markets, including electronics.
"
157,PPG,"Companies in the chemicals space saw their profits sag in the September quarter, largely due to the fragile economic conditions in Europe and weak pricing. Activity across the emerging Asian economies remained subdued in the quarter given the slowdown in exports due to weak western demand. The U.S. economy, on the other hand, is treading on thin ice given the concerns regarding the looming “fiscal cliff.”
"
158,PPG,"While the scenario is not expected to change in the December quarter, the industry is expected to continue to see slack demand, amplified by the production disruptions associated with Superstorm Sandy and uncertainty in the U.S. economy. Nevertheless, the fledgling recovery in the housing market may represent a potential positive for the industry heading into 2013.Industry Fact File
"
159,PPG,"Chemicals are generally used to make a number of consumer goods and are also used in the agriculture, manufacturing, construction and service industries. In fact, the chemical industry itself consumes 26% of its own output. Major industrial consumers include rubber and plastic, textiles, apparel, petroleum refining, pulp and paper and primary metals.
"
160,PPG,"The chemical industry, a nearly $3 trillion global business, has grown at a brisk pace for more than five decades. The fastest growing areas have involved the manufacture of synthetic organic polymers used as plastics, fibers and elastomers. The chemical industry is mainly concentrated in three areas of the world: Western Europe, North America and Japan. Europe is the largest producer, followed by the U.S. and Japan.
"
161,PPG,"The U.S. chemical industry represents more than 15% of the global chemical output and employs nearly 800,000 people. It constitutes roughly 12% of the nation’s exports, aggregating $187 billion annually. Roughly 5.5 million additional jobs are backed by the purchasing activity of the chemical industry. The U.S. chemical industry supports roughly 25% of the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP). The industry shipped more than 759 million tons of products in 2011.
"
162,PPG,"The chemical industry is cyclical by nature and heavily linked to the overall condition of the U.S. economy. Chemical industry also touches 96% of manufactured goods, making the manufacturing industry the biggest consumer of chemical products.
"
163,PPG,"There are 170 major chemical companies in the U.S. operating internationally with more than 2,800 facilities abroad. The chemical industry is among the biggest industries in the U.S., a roughly $760 billion enterprise. It has been consistently leading the U.S. economy’s business cycle due to its early position in the supply chain.
"
164,PPG,"According to chemical giant BASF SE (BASFY), global chemical production (excluding pharmaceuticals) rose 4.8% in 2011, backed by healthy demand from major industries. In the EU, chemical production edged up 1.6% while declining 3.1% in Japan, hurt by the March 2011 quake.
"
165,PPG,"The sluggish economy took a toll on growth in the U.S. as the nation’s chemical production increased a nominal 2.1% in 2011. South America and Asia (excluding Japan) witnessed growth of 4.7% and 11.1%, respectively. Growth in Asia was led by strong contributions from China.Weak Manufacturing Hurting Production
"
166,PPG,"U.S. chemical output barely rose on a monthly basis in October, according to the latest monthly report from the American Chemistry Council (ACC). The Washington-based chemical industry trade group reported that the U.S. Chemical Production Regional Index (CPRI) edged up 0.2% in October, following an upwardly revised 0.3% gain in September. The tepid growth reflects the continued weakness in the overall manufacturing sector.
"
167,PPG,"The U.S. CPRI, which was created by Moore Economics to track chemical production in seven regions nationwide, is comparable to Federal Reserve’s industrial production index for chemicals. The ACC noted that chemical production improved across all regions other than West Coast, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast on a monthly comparison basis in October.
"
168,PPG,"The October reading showed that overall chemical production fell 0.2% when compared on a year-over-year basis. On a region-by-region basis, production rose across the Gulf Coast and Ohio Valley areas while the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, Northeast and West Coast regions saw declines. On a year-to-date basis (production for the first nine months of 2012 compared with the year-ago data), production inched up 0.1%.
"
169,PPG,"On a monthly comparison basis, chemical production in the Gulf Coast region, where key building block materials are produced, edged up 0.5% in October. The Midwest and Ohio Valley regions witnessed a 0.1% and 0.6% increase, respectively. Output slipped in the Mid-Atlantic (down 0.1%), Northeast (0.1%) and West Coast (0.2%) regions. Production crept up 1% in the Southeast.
"
170,PPG,"Output from the U.S. manufacturing sector dipped 0.5% in October after declining 0.2% a month ago. Within this sector, output rose in several key chemistry end-user markets including appliances, aerospace and structural panels.
"
171,PPG,"The manufacturing sector serves as a barometer to gauge the overall health of the U.S. economy and has a major influence on the chemical industry. Lower investment, given the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the fiscal cliff, led to the weakness in manufacturing. The U.S. market is gripped by the fear that the economy may slip back into recession should the Congress fail to avoid the roughly $600 billion in tax hikes and spending cuts scheduled to take effect in January 2013.
"
172,PPG,"The ACC said that output rose across many segments such as organic chemicals, plastic resins, consumer products, coatings, adhesives, and other specialty chemicals. This was, however, masked by declines in pesticides, fertilizers, man-made fibers, synthetic rubber industrial gases and pharmaceuticals.
"
173,PPG,"Chemical output continues its declining trend in Europe. According to the European Chemical Industry Council (“CEFIC”), chemicals production in the European Union fell 2.2% year over year in the first eight months of 2012. Production fell 2.2% year over year in August 2012. Chemicals prices rose 1% year over year in August, led by an increase in the price for basic inorganics.Raw Material Trends
"
174,PPG,"The chemical industry uses oil, naphtha and natural gas as energy and feedstock inputs. Oil prices remain high despite the sub-par growth outlook for the global economy, largely owing to geostrategic reasons. BASF report states that the price of Brent crude oil rose sharply in 2011 (averaging $110 a barrel), stirred by the combined impact of strong demand and political unrest in the Middle East and North Africa.
"
175,PPG,"Brent crude, which hit a four-year high of $128 a barrel in March 2012, is hovering between a high of $115 and a low of $105 since October 2012. Geopolitical tension in the Middle East, exacerbated by Iran's nuclear program and the unrest in Egypt, is keeping price from sliding given the concerns about a potential supply crunch.
"
176,PPG,"Price of the other key raw material, naphtha, averaged $930 per metric ton in 2011, representing more than 30% year-over-year surge. Naphtha prices are also expected to remain elevated relative to last year’s levels. The only bright spot for the industry on the feedstock front is natural gas. In fact, the price of natural gas has dropped to its lowest level in over a decade.
"
177,PPG,"Over the past five years, the U.S. natural gas markets have seen a dynamic shift due to the emergence of a new source of energy, shale gas, which exists in large quantities with sources close to many big energy-intensive cities. Shale gas is not only desirable for environmental reasons, given its low carbon footprint relative to oil or coal, but is at the same time cost effective.Weak View for 2012, Better Days Ahead
"
178,PPG,"The European debt crisis, weak U.S. manufacturing along with sluggish activity in China and other key emerging markets led to weak demand for chemical products in the September quarter, something which is expected to continue through 2012. While the U.S. is not headed toward another recession, the debt issue in Europe coupled with other economic uncertainty poses downside risks to the nation’s economic outlook.
"
179,PPG,"The ACC foresees modest production growth in 2012 followed by a stronger recovery in 2013. National chemical output is expected to slow to 0.5% in 2012 from 3.8% a year ago, and then rise to 2.3% in 2013.
"
180,PPG,"The ACC expects weaker growth in European chemicals output in 2012, in part, due to increased uncertainty. While developed economies, restrained by debt and stricter fiscal policies, are likely to increase chemical production at a modest pace, more rapid growth in output from the emerging markets is expected in 2012.
"
181,PPG,"The ACC sees global chemical industry output to grow 2.3% in 2012, 4.3% in 2013 and 4.7% in 2014. Stronger growth is expected in specialty chemicals, consumer products and agricultural chemicals in 2012.
"
182,PPG,"Growth in China is expected to be healthy, albeit at a slower pace, while production in other emerging markets is expected to expand in 2012. Chemical makers in the emerging economies are expected to deliver a 6.2% production increase in 2012 followed by a 7.5% growth in 2013.
"
183,PPG,"The ACC expects strong growth in capital spending in the coming years, stemming from new investments in petrochemicals and derivatives. It envisions capital spending to reach $35.5 billion in 2012 and steadily advance to $51.5 billion in 2017. A rebound across emerging markets is expected to contribute to accelerated growth over the next several years.
"
184,PPG,"A recent CEFIC report says that European chemical output will contract 2% year over year this year followed by a modest increase (of 0.5%) in 2013. The economic downturn in Europe and the region’s weak construction and automotive sector will contribute to lower output in 2012.
"
185,PPG,"Moreover, chemical production in the European Union is expected be 8% below its pre-recession level in 2012, as austerity measures adopted to staunch the high sovereign debt levels have led to higher unemployment levels and weak demand. The expectation for a slim recovery in 2013 stems from the anticipated modest growth in every quarter, partly driven by export markets.OPPORTUNITIES
"
186,PPG,"According to the ACC, emerging market growth and abundant shale gas should help drive U.S. chemical exports. A string of factors are driving growth in the export markets including favorable energy costs stemming from the abundance of shale gas and strong demand from the emerging markets. Affordable natural gas and ethane (derived from shale gas) offer U.S. producers a compelling cost advantage over their global counterparts who use a more expensive, oil-based feedstock.

187,PPG,"Further, cost-cutting measures implemented by chemical companies including plant closures and headcount reduction, should yield industry-wide margin improvements. Cash flows derived through these actions can be used for growth.
"
188,PPG,"Mergers and acquisitions offer chemical companies another means to shore up growth in this difficult scenario. These companies remain focused on exploring growth opportunities in the fast-growing emerging markets, particularly in the lucrative regions of Asia-Pacific and Latin America such as China and Brazil.
"
189,PPG,"We feel that chemical companies with strong earnings quality, healthy growth trajectory and liquidity profiles are better placed in the current rickety market environment considering their ability to leverage strong balance sheet and cash flows in maximizing shareholder value in form of dividends and share repurchases or use them for value acquisitions.
"
190,PPG,"We have a bullish view on Eastman Chemical Company (EMN  -  Free Report), which is delivering forecast-topping earnings and is well placed to benefit from its Solutia acquisition. The company’s diversified chemical portfolio and integrated and diverse downstream businesses represents the pillars of strength. It also benefits from business restructuring, cost-cutting measures and increased capacity additions.
"
191,PPG,"We are also optimistic about Celanese Corp. (CE  -  Free Report) despite the challenges it faces in Europe. We like the company’s initiatives to improve margins and profits by running its plants better and controlling expenses. The company’s strong presence in emerging markets, especially in China, will enable it to deliver incremental earnings in 2012. We are also upbeat about the prospect of its TCX ethanol process technology.
"
192,PPG,"In specialty chemical space, PPG Industries Inc. (PPG  -  Free Report) represents an attractive play. The company witnessed strong growth in its North American automotive OEM coatings business in the September quarter, enabling it to deliver better-than-expected earnings. It has a diversified base of products and markets, and looks to grow its businesses strategically along with controlling costs.
"
193,PPG,"We also hold a favorable view on specialty chemical company Methanex Corp. (MEOH  -  Free Report). The company has taken up a number of steps, including production ramp ups in New Zealand and the Medicine Hat unit, to boost capacity. We are upbeat about its Louisiana project, which is expected to create significant value for its shareholders and meaningfully contribute in cash generation.WEAKNESSES
"
194,PPG,"Commodity price hikes, though subsiding lately, is adding to feedstock costs for many of the U.S. chemical producers. Their ability to pass these costs on to end consumers is not always easy, given the competitive pressures at play. As a result, margins for a number of producers will continue to be under pressure.
"
195,PPG,"Given the industry’s sensitivity to the global economy, any negative current in the macro economy would be reflected in the prospects of the chemical companies. The turmoil in Europe and its impact on global growth remain sources of near-term uncertainty. Western Europe continues to pose challenges on chemical stocks due to weak demand (particularly in the construction industry) and the lingering impact of debt crisis.
"
196,PPG,"The U.S. housing sector, a key consumer of chemicals, has shown signs of recovery lately, manifested by a steady pick-up in home prices. However, demand from this industry still remains way below the historic levels. Weakness in the electronics and construction end-markets may continue to weigh on the results.
"
197,PPG,"Chemical companies generate a considerable amount of revenues outside the U.S., and therefore are exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations. Unfavorable currency exchange translation (stemming from a stronger dollar) dented most of these companies’ results in the most recent quarter.
"
198,PPG,"Another challenge comes in the form of production disruptions as a result of Hurricane Sandy, which wreaked havoc on the Northeast U.S. Production is expected to be hit by associated outages in the December quarter.
"
199,PPG,"Chemical titan The Dow Chemical Company (DOW) was hammered by several headwinds in the September quarter. Its profit slid on lower pricing across all regions. The company also saw weak demand for its products in the quarter, stemming from the challenging conditions in Europe and sluggish activity across major emerging markets.  
"
200,PPG,"Moreover, building and construction sales remain under pressure due to lower volume in Europe and recovery in electronics remains slow, partly due to sluggish growth China. Moreover, currency headwinds are expected to continue given the weak euro. The company announced a major restructuring program including headcount reductions, plant closures and capital spending cuts.
"
201,PPG,"The other chemical giant DuPont (DD) had a drab third quarter due to lower demand across titanium dioxide and photovoltaic markets. It witnessed weakness across a number of end markets in the quarter. The company reduced its earnings forecast for 2012 and announced a restructuring plan that includes retrenchment of 1,500 workers globally.
"
202,PPG,"DuPont also remains exposed to raw material cost inflation, which is expected to constrict its margin in the fourth quarter. Moreover, currency headwinds weighed on the performance of a number of segments in the third quarter and are expected to reduce its earnings for 2012.Air Products and Chemicals Inc. (APD  -  Free Report) also felt the heat in the September quarter as weak demand due to the sluggish economic conditions led to a big slide in its profit. Slowing U.S. manufacturing growth due to high unemployment and the concerns over the U.S. fiscal cliff coupled with the slowdown in Asia is expected to impinge its results moving ahead. We have downgraded our rating on the stock to Underperform factoring in the challenges it may face in the next fiscal year.
"
203,PPG,"Agricultural chemical company Agrium Inc. (AGU) has put up a lackluster third quarter on weak potash demand and is expected see a weak December quarter due to a significant decline in international potash demand and lower ammonia sales volume in Western Canada. Moreover, global phosphate market is expected to remain weak in the near term, partly due to lower demand from India.
"
204,PPG,"Specialty chemical company Valspar Corporation (VAL) is contending with the difficult global economic conditions. Persistent weakness in its Paints segment hurt its sales in the most recent quarter. The segment has been hit by a weak residential housing market in Australia, which may continue to affect revenues moving ahead.
"
205,PPG,"It is difficult to appreciate the market's response to last week's Fed comment on the health of the U.S. economy. The only way the market pullback would make sense is if we assume that the Fed's comment reflects that the economy is in even worst shape than currently appreciated. But it is quite easy to rule this scenario out given this Fed's communication policy and overall attempts to ensure transparency.  
"
206,PPG,"There was hardly any surprise factor in the Fed's acknowledgement of decelerating economic growth. The market has been singularly preoccupied with sizing up the economy's growth potential over the last few months, particularly following the boiling over of Europe's sovereign debt issues in the spring. The pullback in the market from its late-April highs was primarily a reflection of concerns about the sustainability of the economic recovery.  
"
207,PPG,"It was the solid second quarter earnings season that provided enough reassurance to the market that gave us the positive July performance. And notwithstanding the Fed comment, nothing substantive has changed in that backdrop. While estimates for GDP growth rates for the second half of the year have been moving downward in recent days, they remain in line with historical trend lines. And growth resumes from next year onwards, helped by a broad-based and sustainable recovery in all key segments of the economy. Proactive Fed is Reassuring 
"
208,PPG,"As part of its acknowledgement of economic softness, the Fed announced plans to purchase treasury bonds with the proceeds from the maturing mortgage bonds on its balance sheet. The Fed had stopped purchasing the mortgage-backed securities (MBS) in March. The significance of this otherwise symbolic move is the Fed's readiness to respond to economic softness and fears of deflation. A proactive Fed standing ready to act should help address deflationary concerns.  
"
209,PPG,"If anything, the Fed's plans for quantitative easing are a net positive for stocks. As such, I am looking for a reversal of the post-Fed statement's negativity in the coming days, though 'noise' surrounding the U.S. economy will continue to cause volatility. My sense is that as the market gets comfortable with a third-quarter GDP growth in the 2% range over the coming weeks, it will reflect positively on stock prices. Sustainable Growth Outlook
"
210,PPG,"Despite soft economic data, the overall growth trajectory for the U.S. economy remains sustainable. Estimates for the third and fourth-quarter GDP growth rates have been coming down in recent days, but remain in the 2% to 2.5% range. While household deleveraging remains a weak spot, particularly given the protracted labor market softness, the corporate sector remains in excellent shape. This was clearly borne out by recent earnings reports and the outlook for the rest of this year and next.  
"
211,PPG,"With Germany recently reporting its best economic performance in years and the Chinese authorities expected to ensure a soft landing, the international growth outlook remains supportive for the U.S. recovery. Portfolio Update
"
212,PPG,"We made five changes to the Focus List portfolio last week; adding two and deleting three. We didn't make any changes to the Growth & Income portfolio. There were changes to the Timely Buys list as well.  
"
213,PPG,"We added Lubrizol (LZ), the specialty chemicals producer with a leading market share in the lubricant additives market. We have long been Lubrizol fans, given the company's solid earnings and cash flow outlook, reflecting continued margin gains in a recovering global economy. Additionally, the market leader pays a growing dividend, currently yielding 1.6%. PPG Industries (PPG  -  Free Report), the other entrant to the Focus List, is also a specialty chemicals producer of coatings and glass, among others. This roughly $11 billion market capitalization firm has been around since the late 19th century and enjoys strong leverage to the continued economic strength in Latin America and Asia. The company also pays an attractive dividend, currently yielding 3.3%.  
"
214,PPG,"We deleted Dolan Media (DM) after the stock fell to a Zacks #4 Rank ('sell') following its earnings miss. We were close to breakeven in our DM position.  
"
215,PPG,"The other two deletions, G-III Apparel (GIII  -  Free Report) and Smith Micro Software , were meant to cut our losses in positions that didn't pan out as initially hoped. Our losses in GIII, down about 17%, essentially reflect the weak outlook for the U.S. consumer. Smith Micro shares have been weak lately, particularly following its underwhelming quarterly results. We will be taking a roughly 25% hit on this name. 
"
216,PPG,"PPG Industries (PPG  -  Free Report) has declared price increases for protective and marine coatings products globally. The price hike is effective immediately or as contracts permit.  The move comes after the company experienced broad inflation across a number of raw material categories. There has also been a steep rise in freight and logistics costs primarily due to increasing oil prices. Also. the company has been unable to fully offset its supply chain related inflation solely by ongoing productivity improvements and cost-saving initiatives.  This price hike will help mitigate rising raw material and operating costs experienced by the company. Products that have incurred the most significant increases include epoxy resins, zinc powders, titanium dioxide and solvents. The company sees healthy growth in target segments for its protective and marine coatings solutions. With the price hike, the company will be able to further invest in its operations to meet increasing customer demand. Shares of the company have moved up around 3.4% over a year, underperforming the roughly 7.9% growth recorded by its industry.    To improve cost structure, PPG Industries is pursuing significant restructuring actions that are mainly focused on regions and end-use markets with the weakest business conditions. The restructuring activities are projected to deliver around $125 million in annual savings with roughly $50 million of savings already realized in 2017 and another $45-$50 million expected in 2018. During the fourth-quarter call, PPG Industries stated that it is committed toward deploying at least $2.4 billion of cash in 2018 on acquisitions and share repurchases as part of its earlier communicated goal of deploying $3.5 billion in 2017 and 2018 combined. PPG Industries is also implementing appropriate pricing strategies to offset the impact of raw materials cost inflation.

219,PPG,"The chemical industry has gotten its mojo back on an upswing in the global economy and strength across major end-use markets. The highly cyclical industry put up a commendable performance in fourth-quarter 2017. A host of companies in the space posted better-than-expected earnings in the quarter, driven by strategic measures including productivity improvement, pricing actions, portfolio restructuring and earnings-accretive acquisitions.The Zacks Chemicals Diversified industry has outperformed the broader market in a year’s time. The industry has gained around 17.5% over this period, higher than the S&P 500’s corresponding return of roughly 16.4%.While the chemical industry still faces a few headwinds, its momentum is expected to continue this year on sustained demand strength across construction and automotive markets, a rebound in demand in the energy place and significant shale-linked capital investment.Cost-cutting measures and productivity improvement actions by chemical companies should continue to reap industry-wide margin improvements in 2018. Moreover, a number of chemical makers including Celanese Corp. (CE  -  Free Report) and PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG  -  Free Report) are taking appropriate pricing actions to offset raw materials cost inflation, which should also provide margin benefits.The U.S. Chemical Industry has recovered from the damaging effects of hurricanes and is set for solid growth in 2018. The American Chemistry Council (""ACC""), an industry trade group, envisions U.S. chemical production (excluding pharmaceuticals) to rise 3.7% in 2018. The growth is expected to be spurred by higher demand across light vehicles and housing markets, capital investments and strengthening export markets.The European chemical industry is also back in business after remaining in a rut for a spell. The business environment for the European chemical industry has improved on the back of a resurgent Eurozone economy and improving global economic sentiment.In this write up, we run a comparative analysis on two prominent chemical payers – LyondellBasell Industries N.V. (LYB  -  Free Report) and Eastman Chemical Company (EMN  -  Free Report) – to figure out which one is a better option for investment right now.LyondellBasell, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, has a market capitalization of around $41.6 billion and is among the leading plastics, chemical and refining companies globally. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.LyondellBasell is executing its expansion projects to leverage the U.S. natural gas liquids advantage. The company’s expansion initiatives are expected to boost capacity and add to its earnings. LyondellBasell expects capital spending of roughly $2.4 billion for 2018 with roughly 55% is targeted toward profit generating growth.LyondellBasell, last month, agreed to buy A. Schulman, Inc. (SHLM  -  Free Report), a leading supplier of high-performance plastic compounds, in a deal worth $2.25 billion. The buyout doubles the size of LyondellBasell's existing compounding business and creates a platform for future growth with reach into additional high-growth markets.Eastman Chemical, sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), is a global chemical company boasting a broad portfolio of chemical, plastic, and fiber products with a market capitalization of $13.1 billion.Eastman Chemical is gaining from strong growth of high-margin products in its specialty businesses and its strategic acquisitions. It remains focused on cost-cutting and productivity actions, which is helping it to offset raw material cost inflation and other cost headwinds.Let's take a closer look at how LyondellBasell and Eastman Chemical are stacked up against each other in terms of certain key metrics.Price PerformanceEastman Chemical’s shares have rallied 36.7% over the past year while LyondellBasell’s shares have gained 19.7%. While both stocks have outperformed the Zacks Chemicals Diversified industry over the same period, Eastman Chemical clearly scores above LyondellBasell. Debt-to-Equity RatioThe debt-to-equity ratio is a good indicator of the financial well-being of a company and is a good proxy for its debt-servicing capacity. Eastman Chemical has a debt-to-equity ratio of 112.2, while the industry has debt-to-equity ratio of 34.8. In contrast, with a debt-to-equity ratio of 96.3 LyondellBasell wins this round.Current RatioThis metric measures the ability of a company to meet its short-term debt obligations efficiently. In other words, it is the ratio of the current level of total assets and versus the current level of liabilities. Here, LyondellBasell is a clear winner with a current ratio of 2.46, which is superior to Eastman Chemical's reading of 1.59. ValuationGoing by the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) multiple, a preferred valuation metric for cyclical industries like chemicals, LyondellBasell looks cheaper compared with Eastman Chemical.Both LyondellBasell and Eastman Chemical are underpriced, with EV/EBITDA ratios of 8.6 and 11.8, respectively, compared with the industry’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 17. Clearly, LyondellBasell is cheaper and scores on this front. Return on Equity (ROE)ROE is a measure of a company’s efficiency in utilizing shareholder’s funds. ROE for the trailing 12-months for LyondellBasell and Eastman Chemical is 55.1% and 22%, respectively. While both stocks have scored above the industry’s level of 9.4%, LyondellBasell holds an edge here. Free Cash Flow YieldsCompanies with strong operations generally have high free cash flow yield, indicating that the amount of money investors are generating is more than the amount spent on the stock.Our proprietary model shows that free cash flow yield for LyondellBasell stands at 8.5%, higher than 6.6% of Eastman Chemical. Earnings Surprise HistoryEastman Chemical has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 17.7%. On the other hand, LyondellBasell has delivered positive earnings surprises in two of the trailing four quarters while missed twice, generating an average positive earnings surprise of 2.1%.Growth ExpectationsIn terms of earnings growth expectations, Eastman Chemical scores above LyondellBasell. The expected earnings per share growth rate for Eastman Chemical for the current year stands at 12.1% compared with an expected increase of 5.1% for LyondellBasell.The VerdictOur comparative analysis shows that Eastman Chemical holds an edge over LyondellBasell in terms of price performance, earnings surprise history and earnings growth projections. However, when considering valuation, free cash flow yields, ROE measures, current ratio and debt-to-equity ratio, LyondellBasell seems to be the preferred stock. As the scale is clearly tipped in favor of LyondellBasell, it makes a better investment proposition compared to Eastman Chemical.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

221,PPG,"The chemical industry is finding traction again after staying down for a while. Chemical makers should benefit from continued strong demand in major markets and strategic measures including expansion into high-growth markets, aggressive cost management, acquisitions and investment on capacity expansion. However, the industry is still exposed to certain headwinds. There are a few reasons to be mindful about the chemical industry in the near term, which we have outlined below:China Worries PersistFears of an economic slowdown in China -- a major market for chemicals -- is a deterrent over the short haul. The world’s second-biggest economy remains hampered by persistent industrial overcapacity, weak property investment and rising corporate debt. In particular, ballooning debt levels (manifested by rising debt-to-GDP ratios) and rapid credit expansion have raised a red flag on the Chinese economy.China’s GDP expanded 6.9% in 2017, better than the Chinese government’s growth target of roughly 6.5%, aided by a recovery in export. However, the country’s economy is expected to lose momentum this year and faces headwinds from tighter regulations, trade tensions with the United States and a weaker consumer sector.The Chinese government expects a slowdown in economic growth this year and sees a GDP growth of 6.5%. The expected slowdown, in part, is due to Beijing’s efforts to curb risks in the financial system, reduce poverty and clean up the environment (partly through reduction in steel and coal production).Moreover, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), its annual report on the Chinese economy, had issued a warning about the country’s surging debt level that has raised risks for a potential sharp decline in growth in the medium term. The IMF projects China’s growth to moderate gradually and sees GDP to grow 6.6% in 2018, further slowing to a 6.4% growth in 2019.Capital outflow pressures, rapid credit expansion, continued reliance on stimulus measures and geopolitical uncertainties are among the key risks to the country’s economic growth. As such, a sluggish Chinese economy may weigh on demand for chemicals in this significant market.Still-Difficult Fertilizer/Agrichemical SpaceAgriculture market fundamentals remain weak, and there is continuous negative sentiment among agriculture investors that can create uncertainty in the near term. Moreover, the prevailing softness in agricultural commodity pricing remains a concern for fertilizer and agricultural chemicals companies. Prices of major crops (such as corn and soybeans) remain at their multi-year lows as markets remain awash with grains.Adding to the concerns is the expected decline in U.S. farm income in 2018. U.S. farm profits are expected to hit 12-year low this year, per the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) outlook. The USDA envisions net U.S. farm income to tumble 6.7% year over year to $59.5 billion in 2018, the lowest level since 2006.The projected decline in profits is due to lower expected cash receipts from the sale of crop inventories as well as low crop prices. The USDA expects cash receipts for all commodities to go down 0.5% year over year to $363.1 billion in 2018. Cash receipts for crops have been forecast to dip 0.8% to $188.2 billion. The USDA also sees prices of corn and soybean to drop this year.As such, lower anticipated farm income is likely to negatively influence farmers’ nutrient-purchasing decisions this year. Lower profit is expected to lead to tightened spending by growers.Raw Material Cost PressureCommodity pricing remain a concern for many U.S. chemical producers. Their ability to pass these costs on to end consumers is not always easy, given the competitive pressures in play.A number of chemical companies including PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG  -  Free Report), Celanese Corp. (CE  -  Free Report) and Eastman Chemical Co. (EMN  -  Free Report) are witnessing a spike in raw material prices, exacerbated by short supply due to hurricanes. As a result, margins of these producers may be under pressure moving ahead amid an inflationary environment. A number of chemical makers, in their December quarter earnings calls, have warned of continued headwinds from elevated input costs through first-half 2018.Trump Trade Tariffs Pose HeadwindsWhile President Trump’s actions toimpose heavy tariffs on steel and aluminum imports would provide more protection to the domestic producers of these metals, it poses a headwind for the U.S. chemical industry. The move is expected to hurt new chemical investment in the United States and may lead to a slowdown in growth in the domestic chemical industry. These costly tariffs are likely to push up the costs of building chemical plants that use a significant amount of steel.According to the American Chemistry Council (“ACC”), the chemical industry has invested $185 billion in new factories, expansions and restarts of plants across the United States with more than half of these projects presently in the planning stage. The trade group has raised concerns that the hefty trade tariffs may force investors to consider doing business elsewhere.Stocks to Get Rid of NowAs you can see, there are certain reasons to be cautious about the chemical industry. As such, it would also be a prudent choice to get rid of certain companies in the space that show weak fundamentals and carry an unfavorable Zacks Rank.We hold a bearish view on Olin Corp. (OLN  -  Free Report), Compass Minerals International, Inc. (CMP  -  Free Report) and Ashland Global Holdings Inc. (ASH  -  Free Report), each holding a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). We also suggest staying away from stocks such as Innophos Holdings, Inc. (IPHS  -  Free Report), Innospec Inc. (IOSP  -  Free Report) and Axalta Coating Systems Ltd. (AXTA  -  Free Report), all carrying a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).(Check out our latest Chemical Industry Outlook for a more detailed discussion on the fundamental trends.)The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

222,PPG,"The chemical industry is riding an upturn in the global economy and strength across major end-use markets such as construction and automotive. Improving fundamentals in the energy space driven by an upswing in crude oil prices also augur well for the industry.Notwithstanding a few headwinds, including a spike in raw materials costs and softness in agricultural commodity prices, chemical companies are expected to continue the earnings momentum witnessed in Q1 into Q2 as the fundamental driving factors remain in place.Per the Zacks Industry classification, the chemical industry is grouped under the broader Basic Materials sector. The Basic Materials sector is among the Zacks sectors that racked up the strongest gains in Q1. Overall earnings for the sector climbed 56.4% while revenues spiked 24.3%. Earnings for the sector are projected to surge 54% in Q2 while revenues are expected to go up 24.1%, per our latest Earnings Preview.Cost-cutting measures and productivity improvement actions by chemical companies should continue to reap industry-wide margin improvements in Q2. Moreover, a number of chemical makers are taking appropriate pricing actions (reflected by hikes in chemical prices) to offset raw materials cost inflation, which should also provide margin benefits.Chemical companies also remain actively focused on mergers and acquisitions to diversify and perk up growth. Synergies from acquisitions should also lend support to earnings in Q2.  President Donald Trump’s business-friendly tax reform also contributed to the impressive performance of the U.S. chemical makers in Q1 and would continue to be a major tailwind in Q2. The newly introduced tax reform significantly reduces the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, which is a positive for chemical stocks. This is expected to boost their bottom line, improve cash flows and incentivize capital investment.In this write up, we run a comparative analysis on two major chemical stocks – Celanese Corporation (CE  -  Free Report) and PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG  -  Free Report) – to figure out which of these stocks is better placed ahead of their Q2 earnings report. Both companies are scheduled to report their Q2 numbers on Jul 19.While Celanese carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), PPG is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Let's take a closer look at how Celanese and PPG are stacked up against each other in terms of certain key metrics.ESP and Earnings HistoryEarnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in their upcoming earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Our research shows that for stocks with the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%.Celanese is likely to beat earnings in the quarter to be reported. This is because the stock has an Earnings ESP of +4.80% and a Zacks Rank #2. However, the picture is different for PPG with an Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank #3, a combination which makes surprise prediction difficult.With respect to surprise, Celanese beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 7%. On the other hand, PPG beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters while missed once and met expectations on the other occasion. In this timeframe, it came up with an average positive surprise of 0.1%.Growth ExpectationsIn terms of earnings growth expectations, Celanese scores above PPG. The expected earnings per share growth rate for Celanese for Q2 currently stands at 32.4% compared with an expected rise of 3.3% for PPG.Price PerformanceCelanese’s shares have rallied 16.7% over the past year and outperformed the industry over the same period. On the other hand, PPG’s shares have lost 6.3% and underperformed the industry. As such, Celanese clearly scores above PPG. Debt-to-Equity RatioThe debt-to-equity ratio is a good indicator of the financial well-being of a company and is a good proxy for its debt-servicing capacity. Celanese has a debt-to-equity ratio of 102.8, while the industry has debt-to-equity ratio of 34.5. In contrast, with a debt-to-equity ratio of 95.5 PPG wins this round. Current RatioThis metric measures the ability of a company to meet its short-term debt obligations efficiently. In other words, it is the ratio of the current level of total assets and versus the current level of liabilities. Here, Celanese is a winner with a current ratio of 1.88, which is superior to PPG’s reading of 1.76. Free Cash Flow YieldsCompanies with strong operations generally have high free cash flow yield, indicating that the amount of money investors are generating is more than the amount spent on the stock.Our proprietary model shows that free cash flow yield for PPG stands at 3.6%, which is higher than 3% for Celanese. ValuationGoing by the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) multiple, which is often used to value chemical stocks, PPG looks cheaper compared with Celanese.Both Celanese and PPG are underpriced, with EV/EBITDA ratios of 12.3 and 11.2, respectively, compared with the industry’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 12.5. Clearly, PPG is cheaper and scores on this front. Return on Equity (ROE)ROE is a measure of a company’s efficiency in utilizing shareholder’s funds. ROE for the trailing 12-months for Celanese and PPG is 35.2% and 26.5%, respectively. As such, Celanese hasan edge here. The VerdictOur comparative analysis shows that PPG holds an edge over Celanese in terms of valuation, free cash flow yields and debt-to-equity ratio. However, when considering price performance, earnings surprise history, earnings growth projections, ROE measures and current ratio, Celanese seems to be the preferred stock. On top of that, the company has a better ESP reading vis-à-vis PPG. As the scale is clearly tipped in favor of Celanese, it makes a better investment proposition.Some Other Stocks to Consider Apart from Celanese, investors interested in the chemical space may also consider FMC Corporation (FMC  -  Free Report) and LyondellBasell Industries N.V. (LYB  -  Free Report), both of which carry a Zacks Rank #2. FMC has an expected earnings growth of 258.3% for Q2. Its shares have gained roughly 23% over a year.LyondellBasell has an expected earnings growth of 4.3% for Q2. The company’s shares have rallied around 31% in a year.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!                   It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

Plastics are used in everything from car parts to doll parts; from soft drink bottles to refrigerators; our homes, cars, televisions, mobile phones; and countless other products that we use on a daily basis.

249,PPG,"Specialty chemical companies that manufacture plastics such as acrylics, polymers and resins are closely linked to the global economy. When the economy is expanding, these companies are growing. Conversely, if economic growth slows, these firms are some of the first to see sales decline.Global Economic Recovery
"
250,PPG,"During the recession, industrial firms reduced their orders to levels that matched demand. They also reduced the amount of inventory on hand to help reduce costs. When economic conditions began to stabilize and finally improve, those firms ramped up orders to specialty chemical companies.
"
251,PPG,"The economic recovery remains underway, and industrial markets around the globe continue to experience strong demand. This continued economic growth will lead to even more specialty chemical orders from autos, construction and technology, and plastics companies will continue to experience solid top-line growth.Operating Leverage
"
252,PPG,"Due to their economically-sensitive business models, specialty chemical companies were hit hard during the economic downturn. In response, the entire industry underwent massive cost-cutting efforts to deal with large revenue losses. When conditions finally stabilized, many of these same companies found themselves with vastly improved cost structures. More importantly, the leaner operations are enabling these specialty chemical companies to generate substantial operating leverage.
"
253,PPG,"In other words, sales are growing at a faster rate than operating expenses. This results in higher profit margins and robust earnings growth. And with global economic activity gaining steam, specialty chemical companies should continue to enjoy strong top-line growth and even stronger bottom-line growth.How to Profit

282,PPG,"Of course the fundamentals need to be there. And you should keep a watchful eye on valuations. But if you were in a stock making new highs and cheering it on, it seems silly to be afraid of one doing the same just because you haven't bought it.
"
283,PPG,"One question I like asking myself just to put things into perspective is: If I was in it, would I be excited and would I still want to be in it? If the answer is yes, then I'll look for the best opportunity to get in.

286,PPG,"He asked, ""Aren't you worried about buying a stocks at a 52-week high?"" I said of course not. So it just made a new 52-week high. That's great news. Guess what - last year it made a new 52-week high as well. And the year before that. And the year before that.

299,PPG,"The chemical industry is riding an upturn in the world economy and continued strength across major end-use markets such as construction, automotive and electronics. Another positive for the industry is a recovery in demand in the energy space – a key chemical end-market that had been out of favor for a spell. The recovery has been driven by the rebound in crude oil prices from their historic lows.The Zacks Chemicals Diversified industry has outperformed the broader market in a year’s time. The industry has gained around 19.4% over this period, higher than the S&P 500’s corresponding return of roughly 17.8%.Fourth-quarter earnings season had been a good one for chemical stocks. Notwithstanding a few headwinds including some lingering impacts of devastating hurricanes, chemical companies continued the earnings momentum in the December quarter. We note that a number of companies in the space – including prominent names such as Eastman Chemical Co. (EMN  -  Free Report), Celanese Corp. (CE  -  Free Report), PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG  -  Free Report) and Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (APD  -  Free Report) – produced earnings beats in the quarter.The outperformance was driven by solid demand across major end-markets as well as strategic measures including productivity improvement, pricing actions, portfolio restructuring and earnings-accretive acquisitions.Chemical companies continue to shift their focus on high-growth markets (driven by megatrends) in an effort to cut their exposure on other businesses that are struggling with weak demand and input costs pressure. These companies are also increasingly looking for cost synergy opportunities and enhanced operational scale through consolidations.Cost-cutting measures and productivity improvement actions by chemical companies should continue to reap industry-wide margin improvements in 2018. Moreover, a number of chemical makers are taking appropriate pricing actions to offset raw materials cost inflation, which should also provide margin benefits.Chemical makers also continue to see strong demand from construction and automotive sectors – major chemical end-use markets. The underlying trends in the housing space remain strong, backed by strong economic growth, steady buyer demand, high homebuilders’ confidence and low unemployment levels.The automotive sector also continues its good run amid certain challenges, supported by an improving job market, rising personal income, favorable credit conditions, improved consumer confidence and impressive vehicle launches. Rising demand for profitable crossovers, sports utility vehicles and pickups are also aiding the auto industry.A rebound in crude oil prices has also led to a recovery in demand for chemicals in the energy space, an important end-use market. The recent uptrend in oil prices has been supported by a decline in U.S. oil stockpiles and extension of oil production cuts by OPEC and other major world producers until the end of 2018. The recovery in oil prices has also led to a favorable pricing environment for chemical products.U.S. Chemical Industry Set to Ride Growth WaveThe U.S. Chemical Industry has recovered from the damaging effects of hurricanes and is set for solid growth in 2018. The American Chemistry Council (""ACC""), an industry trade group, envisions national chemical production (excluding pharmaceuticals) to rise 3.7% in 2018, further accelerating to a 3.9% growth in 2019. The growth is expected to be spurred by higher demand across light vehicles and housing markets, capital investments and improved export markets.The trade group also expects basic chemicals production to expand 4.7% in 2018 and further gain steam with a 5.2% rise in 2019 on the heels of new capacity additions. The specialty chemicals segment is also expected to see production growth of 2.3% in 2018, per the ACC.Surging Capital SpendingThe United States remains an attractive investment destination for chemical investment and domestic chemical makers continue to enjoy the advantage of access to abundant and cheaper feedstocks and energy. This is driving investment in chemical production projects.The shale gas boom has incentivized a number of chemical companies including industry heavyweights such as BASF SE (BASFY  -  Free Report) and LyondellBasell Industries N.V. (LYB  -  Free Report) to invest billions of dollars to beef up capacity. According to the ACC, roughly 320 chemical projects have been already announced worth more than $185 billion, 62% of which is foreign direct investment.Moreover, roughly 65% of the chemical investment announced since 2010 are complete or under construction. New capacity is expected to provide a boost to chemical production as these investments come on stream.The ACC expects chemical industry capital spending to rise 6.3% in 2018 and 6.8% in 2019 and eventually reach $48 billion by 2022.Strengthening Export MarketsThe ACC sees improving export markets to contribute to solid growth of the domestic chemical industry. Strengthening export markets and increasing capital spending are driving chemical demand across key end-use markets such as light vehicles and housing. Major export markets, such as Latin America and Asia, are also expected to play a significant role in basic chemical production growth this year and the next.EU Chemical Sector Back in BusinessThe European chemical industry has also swung back to life on the back of improving global economic sentiment and a resurgent Eurozone economy. Eurozone’s recovery has been backed by a pick-up in global economic activity, declining unemployment and strengthening business and consumer confidence.The outlook for the European chemical industry is positive. The European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC) expects chemical output in the European Union to rise 2% year over year in 2018.Per the CEFIC, the growth of manufacturing production across sectors such as automotive, construction, metal production and electronics in the European Union has led to higher demand for chemicals in the region. Exports of chemicals produced in European Union have also increased, particularly in Asia and Russia.A Few ConcernsThe chemical industry, however, faces certain headwinds. A number of chemical companies are witnessing a spike in raw material prices, exacerbated by short supply due to last year’s hurricanes. Some of these companies, in their fourth-quarter earnings call, had warned of continued headwinds from elevated input costs through the first half of 2018. As such, raw material cost inflation may unfavorably impact margins of these companies.Chemical makers also continue to feel the pinch of depressed demand in agriculture markets. Sustained pressure on agricultural commodity prices is scuttling a meaningful recovery in this key chemical end-market.The outlook for the fertilizer and agricultural chemicals space remains cloudy due to continued weakness in crop prices, low farm income and sluggish economic conditions in certain emerging markets, including Latin America.Moreover, concerns regarding China’s future growth remain a source of near-term uncertainty for the chemical industry. Uncertainties surrounding China – a key market for chemicals – is expected to remain an overhang on the industry in the short to medium term. Sustained overcapacity, weak private investment and high levels of corporate debt are still hurting the world’s second-largest economy.What Zacks Industry Rank SaysWithin the Zacks Industry classification, the chemical industry falls under the broader Basic Materials sector (one of 16 Zacks sectors), which had a 2.6% share of total earnings for the S&P 500 in 2017. We rank all of the more than 250 industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. (To learn more, visit: About Zacks Industry Rank.)We have three chemicals related industries – Chemical Diversified, Chemical Plastics and Chemical Specialty – at the expanded (aka ""X"") level. We put our X industries into two groups: the top half (industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank). Our back-testing shows that the top 50% of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The Zacks Industry Rank is #63 for Chemical Diversified (placing it at the top 25% of the 250 plus Zacks classified industries), #88 for Chemical Plastics (at top 34%) and #183 for Chemical Specialty (at bottom 29%).The location of these industries suggests that the general outlook for the chemical industry as a whole is leaning toward 'Positive.'Solid Q4 Earnings, Q1 Predictions Look PromisingThe Basic Materials sector is among the Zacks sectors that racked up the strongest gains in fourth-quarter 2017. Overall earnings for the sector climbed 45.2% while revenues spiked 21.3%. Roughly 89.5% of the sector participants posted earnings beat and around 73.7% surpassed revenue estimates.The Basic Materials sector is expected to continue the earnings growth momentum into first-quarter 2018. Earnings for the sector are projected to rise 42.1% in the first quarter while revenues are expected to go up 21%.For more details about the earnings of this sector and others, please read our Earnings Trends report.Valuation Looks Bit StretchedGoing by the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) multiple, a preferred valuation metric for cyclical industries like chemicals, valuation for the ‘Chemicals’ industry looks bit stretched at the moment when compared to its own range and the broader market.The industry has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 15.7, which is above its own average of 12.7 in the past year. Moreover, the industry compares unfavorably with the market at large, as the trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA for the S&P 500 is at 11.8. As such, there seems to be little room for an upside moving ahead.Final ThoughtsWhile the chemical industry still faces a few headwinds, its momentum is expected to continue this year on sustained demand strength across light vehicles and construction markets, a rebound in demand in the energy place and significant shale-linked capital investment. Strategic actions including expansion of scale through acquisitions, operational efficiency improvement and continued focus on cost and productivity should help chemical makers weather the macroeconomic and industry-specific headwinds in 2018.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

300,PPG,"PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG  -  Free Report) won a contract from Bell Helicopter, a unit of Textron Inc. (TXT  -  Free Report). Per the contract, PPG Industries will produce heated pilot and co-pilot windshields for the Bell 525 Relentless commercial helicopter. The windshields will be made available for customer specification for helicopters operating in hilly regions and cold environments and for off-shore rescue operations. PPG Industries demonstrated the functioning of Aircon heating system and provided a cross-section sample of the same to Bell Helicopter. Bell Helicopter approved PPG Industries’ design for the composite windshields by completing the critical design review. The windshield will have an outboard ply of stretched acrylic with a scratch-resistant coating and an inboard polycarbonate ply which enhance the product’s strength. The windshields can withstand the impact of a 2.2-pound bird at 185 knots — Bell Helicopter’s bird-strike requirement. PPG Industries, which is among the prominent chemical companies along with Air Products and Chemicals Inc. (APD  -  Free Report) and Eastman Chemical Company (EMN  -  Free Report), witnessed a roughly two-fold year-over-year jump in net earnings from continuing operations to $184 million or 72 cents per share in fourth-quarter 2017. Adjusted earnings of $1.19 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.18. Net sales rose around 8% year over year to $3,682 million and came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,605 million. The company gained from favorable currency translation in the quarter. For 2018, PPG Industries expects acquisitions to contribute to sales roughly $125 million. The company recently agreed to acquire Netherlands-based leading architectural paint and coatings wholesaler, ProCoatings. Through its network of 23 multi-brand stores, ProCoatings distributes a large portfolio of professional paint brands across the Netherlands. The transaction is expected to close in first-quarter 2018, subject to customary closing conditions. To improve its cost structure, PPG Industries is pursuing significant restructuring actions that are mainly focused on regions and end-use markets with the weakest business conditions. The restructuring activities are expected to deliver around $125 million in annual savings with roughly $50 million of savings already realized in 2017 and another $45-$50 million expected in 2018. During the fourth-quarter call, PPG Industries stated that it is committed toward deploying at least $2.4 billion of cash in 2018 on acquisitions and share repurchases as part of its earlier communicated goal of deploying $3.5 billion in 2017 and 2018 combined. However, the company is exposed to raw materials cost pressure. PPG Industries is seeing higher raw materials costs and implementing pricing strategies to offset the impact of inflation. The company anticipates raw material inflation to continue through first-half 2018.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

306,PPG,"PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG  -  Free Report) could be a stock to avoid from a technical perspective, as the firm is seeing unfavorable trends on the moving average crossover front. Recently, the 50 Day Moving Average for PPG broke out below the 200 Day Simple Moving Average, suggesting short-term bearishness.This has already started to take place, as the stock has moved lower by 4.6% in the past four weeks. And with the recent moving average crossover, investors have to think that more unfavorable trading is ahead for PPG stock.If that wasn’t enough, PPG Industries isn’t looking too great from an earnings estimate revision perspective either. It appears as though many analysts have been reducing their earnings expectations for the stock lately, which is usually not a good sign of things to come.Consider that in the last 30 days, 10 estimates have been reduced, while none has moved higher. Add this in to a similar move lower in the consensus estimate, and there is plenty of reason to be bearish here.That is why we currently have a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) on this stock and are looking for it to underperform in the weeks ahead. So either avoid this stock or consider jumping ship until the estimates and technical factors turn around for PPG.

(PPG  -  Free Report) and plans to sell the latter’s renowned OLYMPIC brand stains at its 2,000 domestic outlets by the end of second-quarter 2018. This liaison brings together the Home Depot’s exterior stains and the PPG’s latest Olympic wood stains like Olympic MAXIMUM, Olympic ELITE and Olympic WATERGUARD, offering customers a wider range of top-quality assortments.The Olympic products that are likely to be featured in Home Depot’s stores include Olympic Maximum Stain + Sealant in One with WEATHER-READY application, Olympic ELITE Advanced Stain + Sealant in One and Olympic WATERGUARD along with PPG premium paints, GLIDDEN paints and LIQUID NAILS adhesives.Apart from the stain and paints brands, the deal includes the PPG’s latest innovation — Olympic SmartGuard, which will be available soon at some of the Home Depot domestic stores for the spring season. It will be launched with an aim to eliminate difficulties related to the weekend projects with a super-concentrated formula in a lightweight and convenient pouch package. Unlike traditional products which dry in 24-48 hours and require brushing for application, the Olympic SmartGuard is likely to dry in about an hour of its application and needs no brushing. As the SmartGuard is a spray-on application, it is less time-consuming and gives a long-lasting, water-resistant seal.Among the America’s most trusted stain brand, PPG’s Olympic brand is expected to enhance the Home Depot’s product pipeline, leading to higher sales and profitability. Per sources, Home Depot’s arch-rival Lowe's Companies, Inc. (LOW  -  Free Report) is likely to cease the sale of Olympic paints and stains in its domestic stores this year. This, in turn, might give a boost to Home Depot’s sales.Recently, Home Depot unveiled plans to hire more than 1,000 employees for its technology team in 2018 to fortify its tech base. This is in sync with the company’s $11.1-billion three-year strategic investment plan that was announced in December 2017. The new hires will include software engineering, user experience design, network engineering and product management, bolstering Home Depot’s strength of 2,800 existing tech staff by a third. Apart from aiding the company’s investment plan, the hiring will help fend off competition from the online biggie, Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report).Meanwhile, this renowned home improvement retailer is gaining from strength in core business, relentless focus on affording innovative products and driving productivity.These laudable endeavors have aided this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock’s rally in a year’s time.

(PPG  -  Free Report) is set to release fourth-quarter 2017 results ahead of the bell on Jan 18. Last quarter, PPG Industries reported earnings from continuing operations of $1.52 per share against the year-ago loss of 79 cents. Earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Net sales increased 3.2% year over year to $3,776 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,748 million. PPG Industries surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 1.25%. However, the company underperformed the industry over the past six months. While PPG Industries’ shares have gained around 4.6%, the industry gained roughly 17.4%.   Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement. Factors at Play PPG Industries, in its third-quarter call, said that it expects continued moderate global economic growth. Post the mayhem caused by the recent natural disasters, the company does not anticipate any further decline in the level of raw material cost inflation. In the third quarter, currency exchange translation had favorable impact on the company’s performance and is expected to remain a tailwind in the to-be-reported quarter.  Furthermore, the company sees an additional increase in selling price. Also, it remains on track with its restructuring program that is expected to deliver savings of more than $45 million for full-year 2017.  PPG Industries is also taking steps for growing organically as well as cutting costs. The company also remains committed to deploy cash on acquisitions and share repurchases. The company’s board, last month, authorized it to buyback outstanding common stock worth $2.5 billion. However, lingering impacts of natural disasters (hurricanes and earthquakes) may continue to affect sales volume and margins in the fourth quarter. PPG Industries expects natural disasters to unfavorably impact fourth-quarter earnings by up to 5 cents per share. Some raw material inflation is also expected in the fourth quarter due to supply related issues. For the company’s the Industrial Coatings segment, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales is expected to be $1,523 million for the fourth quarter, reflecting an estimated 2.5% rise on a sequential comparison basis. Segment income is also expected to increase 7.1% sequentially as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is $240 million for the fourth quarter. Net sales for PPG Industries’ Performance Coatings segment, for the fourth quarter is expected to witness a 10.1% decline from the previous quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues for the unit is pegged at $2,059 million. Segment income is also expected to decline 35.1% sequentially as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $237 million for the fourth quarter. The segment is expected to be affected by the adverse impact of natural disasters.PPG Industries, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise PPG Industries, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | PPG Industries, Inc.

324,PPG,"PPG Industries Inc. (PPG  -  Free Report) is set to release third-quarter 2017 results ahead of the bell on Oct 19.In the last quarter, PPG Industries reported adjusted earnings of $1.83 per share, up 5.8% from the year-ago figure. Earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.81. Net sales inched up 1% year over year to $3,806 million, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,898.6 million.PPG Industries has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average of 1.09%.PPG Industries has underperformed the industry over the past three months. The company’s shares have inched up around 0.2% over this period, compared with roughly 8.9% gain recorded by the industry. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayPPG Industries, last month, said that it anticipates the impacts from recent hurricanes and earthquakes to affect its third-quarter earnings by 5 cents to 10 cents. This includes increased costs associated with transportation and logistics for raw materials and inventory to avoid customer disruptions, increased raw materials costs, facility and inventory damage net of any insurance recoveries, and the impact from lower sales in the affected areas.Moreover, PPG Industries expects third-quarter volume growth rate to be above 1.5%, exceeding the growth rate for first-half 2017. In the third quarter, moderate raw material cost inflation was earlier anticipated by the company. As a result of high levels of inflation persisting due to ongoing impacts from supplier outages in Europe and continued mandatory curtailments of raw material production in China, the company expects third-quarter inflation rate to match or possibly exceed the sequentially prior quarter, excluding the hurricane impacts.Inclusive of the recent business trends and hurricane effects, PPG Industries expect third-quarter earnings per share from continuing operations to be $1.48-$1.55.Net sales for PPG Industries’ Performance Coatings segment for the third quarter is projected to witness a 1.1% decline from the second quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is pegged at $2,276 million. Segment income is also expected to decline 7.5% sequentially as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is $382 million for the third quarter.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales for the Industrial Coatings segment is expected to be $1,488 million for the third quarter, reflecting an estimated 1.1% decline on a sequential comparison basis. Segment income is also expected to decline 5.3% sequentially as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is $250 million for the third quarter.Unfavorable currency exchange translation weighed on sales and income in the Performance Coatings segment in the second quarter and is expected to remain a headwind in the to-be-reported quarter.Moreover, some of the company’s end-markets including marine still remain sluggish. PPG Industries is also exposed to raw materials cost pressure which may continue to affect net income in the Industrial Coatings unit in the third quarter.PPG Industries, Inc.

327,PPG,"PPG Industries (PPG  -  Free Report) provided an update on the impact of the recent natural disasters on its operations and also issued its third-quarter guidance. The recent hurricanes that originated in the Atlantic Ocean and the earthquakes that occurred in Mexico impacted employees in Texas, Florida and the adjacent states, Mexico, Puerto Rico and other parts of Caribbean. The company reported that though its properties suffered damage, it is on its way to resume operations. Also, the company assumes certain amount of inventory that will not be recoverable. The disruption of supply chain has been the most significant impact from hurricanes. This has had a ripple effect on the company’s operations throughout the United States and Mexico.  The company anticipates the impacts from hurricanes and earthquakes to affect its third-quarter earnings by 5 cents to 10 cents. This includes increased transportation and logistics costs to move raw materials and inventory to avoid PPG Industries’ customer disruptions, increased raw materials costs, facility and inventory damage net of any insurance recoveries, and the impact from lower sales in the affected areas.  PPG Industries expects third-quarter volume growth rate to be above 1.5%, exceeding the growth rate for first-half 2017. In the third quarter, moderate raw material cost inflation was earlier anticipated by the company. As a result of high levels of inflation persisting due to ongoing impacts from supplier outages in Europe and continued mandatory curtailments of raw material production in China, the company expects third-quarter inflation rate to match or possibly exceed the sequentially prior quarter, excluding the hurricane impacts.  Inclusive of the recent business trends and hurricane effects, PPG Industries expect third-quarter earnings per share from continuing operations to be $1.48-$1.55.  PPG Industries has underperformed the industry over a year. The company’s shares have moved up around 5.1% over this period, compared with roughly 27.7% gain recorded by the industry.  PPG Industries expects modest global economic growth.

333,PPG,"June quarter results mostly reflect a slow economic recovery in the U.S. and persistent recessionary conditions in Europe, leading to weakening demand for chemical products. High input costs and weaknesses across some key end-markets (such as construction and electronics) remain the major impediments to growth.
"
334,PPG,"Companies in the chemicals space witnessed slowing economic activity in the quarter, largely due to the fragile economic conditions in Europe. Outlook for the U.S. economy has also suffered, though more recent data points seem to indicate some improvement.
"
335,PPG,"Even the emerging markets have not been immune from global downturn. Activity in China and some other emerging economies slowed in the June quarter. The Chinese economy has been going through a rough patch as government stimulus actions have not been successful failed to staunch the slowdown, at least for now. The problems were compounded by a slowdown in exports. These issues are expected to continue to weigh on the performance of the chemical stocks in the second half of 2012.Industry Dynamics
"
336,PPG,"Chemicals are generally used to make a number of consumer goods and are also used in the agriculture, manufacturing, construction and service industries. In fact, the chemical industry itself consumes 26% of its own output. Major industrial consumers include rubber and plastic, textiles, apparel, petroleum refining, pulp and paper and primary metals.
"
337,PPG,"The chemical industry, a nearly $3 trillion global business, has grown at a brisk pace for more than five decades. The fastest growing areas have involved the manufacture of synthetic organic polymers used as plastics, fibers and elastomers. The chemical industry is mainly concentrated in three areas of the world: Western Europe, North America and Japan. Europe is the largest producer, followed by the U.S. and Japan.
"
338,PPG,"The U.S. chemical industry represents roughly 19% of the global chemical output and employs more than 800,000 people. It is responsible for 10% of the nation’s merchandise exports, aggregating $145 billion annually. Roughly 5.5 million additional jobs are backed by the purchasing activity of the chemical industry.
"
339,PPG,"The chemical industry, by nature, is cyclical and heavily linked to the overall condition of the U.S. economy. Chemical industry also touches 90% of manufactured goods, making the manufacturing industry the biggest consumer of chemical products.
"
340,PPG,"There are 170 major chemical companies in the U.S. operating internationally with more than 2,800 facilities abroad. The chemical industry is among the biggest industries in the U.S., a roughly $760 billion enterprise. It has been consistently leading the U.S. economy’s business cycle due to its early position in the supply chain.
"
341,PPG,"According to chemical giant BASF SE (BASFY), global chemical production (excluding pharmaceuticals) rose 4.8% in 2011, backed by healthy demand from major industries. In the EU, chemical production edged up 1.6% while declining 3.1% in Japan, hurt by the March 2011 quake.
"
342,PPG,"The sluggish economy took a toll on growth in the U.S. as the nation’s chemical production grew a nominal 2.1% in 2011. South America and Asia (excluding Japan) witnessed growth of 4.7% and 11.1%, respectively. Growth in Asia was led by strong contributions from China.End-Market Scenario
"
343,PPG,"U.S. chemical production continues its monthly declining streak as reflected in the recently released data by the American Chemistry Council (“ACC”). The Washington-based chemical industry trade group said that the Chemical Production Regional Index (CPRI) fell 0.1% in June, following a downwardly revised 0.5% decline in May.
"
344,PPG,"The U.S. CPRI, which was created by Moore Economics to track chemical production in seven regions across the nation, is comparable to Federal Reserve’s industrial production index for chemicals. The ACC reported that chemical production dipped in the Gulf Coast, Midwest, Southeast and West Coast regions and was flat in the Ohio Valley, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions.
"
345,PPG,"On a region-by-region basis, production declined across all regions except the Gulf Coast and Ohio Valley areas. On a year-to-date basis (production for the first six months of 2012 compared with the year-ago data), production nudged up 0.2%.
"
346,PPG,"On a monthly comparison basis, chemical production in the Gulf Coast region, where key building block materials are produced, was down 0.4% in June. The Midwest region saw a decline of 0.2%. Productions in the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic regions were flat in June. Production slipped in the Southeast (down 0.2%) and West Coast (0.1%) regions during the month while remained unchanged in the Northeast.
"
347,PPG,"Output from the U.S. manufacturing sector, the largest consumer of chemical products, crept up 0.2% in June, following a 0.1% fall a month ago. Within this sector, output rose in several key chemistry end-user markets including appliances, motor vehicles, computers, apparel, structural panels, rubber products, paper and printing.
"
348,PPG,"Demand for U.S. manufacturing has been weak in recent months given the ongoing European predicament and slowdown in Chinese manufacturing sector. The ACC noted that output clipped in a number of key segments including plastic resins, fertilizers, adhesives, organic chemicals and pharmaceuticals. However, production rose across many segments such as inorganic chemicals, industrial gases, consumer products, pesticides, coatings and synthetic rubber.
"
349,PPG,"The decline in chemical output was also witnessed in Europe . According to the European Chemical Industry Council (“ECIC”), chemicals production in the European Union fell 2.1% year over year in the first five months of 2012. Production edged down 0.7% year over year in May 2012. Chemicals prices rose 2.7% year over year in May, led by a 4% increase in the price for basic inorganics.Raw Material Trends
"
350,PPG,"The chemical industry uses oil, naphtha and natural gas as energy and feedstock inputs. Oil prices remain high despite the sub-par growth outlook for the global economy, largely owing to geostrategic reasons. BASF report states that the price of Brent crude oil rose sharply in 2011 (averaging $110 a barrel), stirred by the combined impact of strong demand and political unrest in the Middle East and North Africa.
"
351,PPG,"Brent crude, which hit a four-year high of $128 a barrel in March 2012, recently exceeded $116 (highest in more than three months) on supply concerns stemming from Iran’s controversial nuclear program and a sharp decline in U.S. crude oil inventories.
"
352,PPG,"Price of the other key raw material, naphtha, averaged at $930 per metric ton in 2011, representing more than 30% year-over-year surge. Naphtha prices are also expected to remain elevated relative to last year’s levels. The only bright spot for the industry on the feedstock front is natural gas. In fact, the price of natural gas has dropped to its lowest level in over a decade.
"
353,PPG,"Over the past five years, the U.S. natural gas markets have seen a dynamic shift due to the emergence of a new source of energy, shale gas, which exists in large quantities with sources close to many big energy-intensive cities. Shale gas is not only desirable for environmental reasons, given its low carbon footprint relative to oil or coal, but is at the same time cost effective.2012: A Balanced View
"
354,PPG,"For the rest of 2012, the outlook for the global chemical industry is balanced, as the U.S. and European Union continue to contend with soft local economies while the emerging markets are expected to show higher growth in output despite the recent slowdown.
"
355,PPG,"The ACC foresees moderate production growth this year followed by a stronger recovery in 2013. National chemical output is expected to slow to 1.6% in 2012 from 3.8% a year ago, and then rise to 2.1% in 2013. A rebound across most of the key end-use markets is helping to maintain the industry's contribution to the nation’s economic growth.
"
356,PPG,"The chemicals outlook indicates moderate growth over the next few years, depending on certain factors including strengthening domestic demand and an improvement in overseas exports. Exports climbed nearly 11% to $189 billion last year and are projected to surpass $230 billion in 2014.
"
357,PPG,"While the U.S. economy is not headed toward another recession, the sovereign debt plight in Europe coupled with other economic factors poses downside risks to the U.S. economic outlook.
"
358,PPG,"The ACC projects weaker growth in the European chemicals output than its earlier forecast in 2012, in part, due to increased uncertainty. Most of last year’s output growth took place in the first quarter after a strong demand recovery with double-digit growth witnessed in 2010.
"
359,PPG,"The ECIC, however, sees growth resuming in 2012, strengthening steadily through the year. The group forecasts 1.5% chemical industry growth this year. While developed economies, restrained by debt and stricter fiscal policies, are likely to increase chemical production at a modest pace, more rapid growth in output from the emerging markets is expected in 2012.
"
360,PPG,"Asia and other emerging markets are expected to continue to lead in volume increases. Chemical makers in the emerging markets are expected to deliver a 6.2% production increase in 2012 followed by 7.5% in 2013.OPPORTUNITIES
"
361,PPG,"According to the ACC, emerging market growth and abundant shale gas should help drive U.S. chemical exports. A string of factors are driving growth in the export markets including favorable energy costs stemming from the abundance of shale gas and strong demand from the emerging markets. Affordable natural gas and ethane (derived from shale gas) offer U.S. producers a compelling cost advantage over their global counterparts who use a more expensive, oil-based feedstock.
"
362,PPG,"Further, cost-cutting measures implemented by chemical companies, such as plant closures, aggressive cost containment and production improvement initiatives, should yield industry-wide margin improvements. Cash flows derived through these actions can be used for growth.
"
363,PPG,"Mergers and acquisitions offer chemical companies another means to shore up growth in this difficult scenario. These companies remain focused on exploring growth opportunities in the fast-growing emerging markets, particularly in the lucrative regions of Asia-Pacific and Latin America such as China and Brazil.
"
364,PPG,"We feel that chemical companies with strong earnings quality, healthy growth trajectory and liquidity profiles are better placed in the current rickety market environment considering their ability to leverage strong balance sheet and cash flows in maximizing shareholder value in form of dividends and share repurchases or use them for value acquisitions.
"
365,PPG,"Some of the key end-markets for chemical products are on an uptrend. This has been evident from the recent earnings reports of leading chemical players. E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co. (DD), for example, put up a healthy performance in the recently reported quarter. The company saw strong performance in agriculture, food and bioscience businesses, along with its advanced materials business, which witnessed healthy results despite weak European markets. The Danisco acquisition contributed to higher sales in the quarter.Eastman Chemical Company (EMN  -  Free Report) is well placed to benefit from its acquisition of Solutia. The company’s diversified chemical portfolio, along with its integrated and diverse downstream businesses, is driving earnings. The company benefits from business restructuring, cost-cutting measures and increased capacity additions.
"
366,PPG,"We also hold a favorable view on Celanese Corp. (CE  -  Free Report) despite the challenges it faces in Europe. We like the company’s initiatives to improve margins and profits by running its plants better and controlling expenses, which should yield results through the rest of 2012. The company’s strong presence in emerging markets, especially in China, will enable it to deliver incremental earnings in 2012. We are also upbeat about the prospect of its TCX ethanol process technology.
"
367,PPG,"In agricultural chemical space, we like the prospects of Agrium Inc. (AGU). Fertilizer stocks like Agrium stands to gain from the U.S. Midwest drought in the remainder of 2012. The company has logged a solid second quarter and is poised to benefit from skyrocketing crop prices and overall strong fundamentals for the agriculture and crop input market. High crop prices (especially for corn) and tight grain inventories are expected to create huge demand for its nutrients.WEAKNESSES
"
368,PPG,"The global nature of the industry puts competitive issues into sharp focus. The U.S. producers have responded to competitive pressures by streamlining operations, relocating manufacturing facilities to low-cost regions closer to end-markets, and being overall more nimble and flexible in responding to market opportunities. And it is not always easy to pull this off.
"
369,PPG,"Commodity price hikes, though subsiding lately, is adding to feedstock costs for many of these producers. Their ability to pass these costs on to end consumers is not always easy, given the competitive pressures at play. As a result, margins for a number of producers will continue to be under pressure.
"
370,PPG,"Given the industry’s sensitivity to the global economy, any negative current in the macro economy would be reflected in the prospects of the chemical companies. The turmoil in Europe and its impact on global growth remain sources of near-term uncertainty. Western Europe continues to pose challenges on chemical stocks due to weak demand (particularly in the construction industry) and the lingering impact of debt crisis.
"
371,PPG,"Moreover, the U.S. housing sector remains a weak end-market. The domestic housing sector, a key consumer of chemicals, is likely to remain soft through the remainder of 2012. Weakness in the electronics and construction end-markets may weigh on the results in the back half of the year.
"
372,PPG,"Chemical companies generate a considerable amount of revenues outside the U.S., and therefore are exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations. Unfavorable currency exchange translation (stemming from a stronger dollar) dented most of these companies’ results in the most recent quarter.
"
373,PPG,"Chemical titan The Dow Chemical Company (DOW) was pummeled by several headwinds in the June quarter. The company’s results were hurt by the beleaguered economic conditions in Europe. Softness across electronics and construction markets may continue to impinge its results in the second half. Moreover, Dow is facing challenges in Western Europe due to the recessionary conditions and expects currency headwinds to continue given the weak euro.Air Products and Chemicals Inc. (APD  -  Free Report) also felt the heat in the June quarter as it faced challenging conditions in Europe and Asia and unfavorable currency exchange impact. The company has reduced its adjusted earnings per share target for fiscal 2012 factoring in the currency headwinds and slower economic growth.
"
374,PPG,"In specialty chemical space, PPG Industries Inc. (PPG  -  Free Report) is expected to face greater challenges going ahead. While the company had a decent second quarter recently, it expects the European market to remain under pressure and foresees inconsistent growth in North America and Asia. Moreover, the company expects higher input costs to continue to weigh on its results in the second half. Currency exchange also remains a sore point.
"
375,PPG,"Also in specialty chemical, Methanex Corp. (MEOH  -  Free Report) posted lower-than-expected results in the second quarter. The company’s production was hit by curtailment in natural gas supplies and eventually constrained revenues. Methanex remains exposed to tight economic conditions and uncertainties associated with the demand and pricing of methanol. We have downgraded our rating on the stock to Underpeform factoring in these issues.
"
376,PPG,"Another specialty chemical company Valspar Corporation (VAL) is contending with the difficult global economic conditions. Unfavorable currency exchange swings hurt the company’s sales in the most recent quarter. The uncertain macroeconomic backdrop, slow recovery in the U.S. and decelerating growth in China is expected to continue to impact its results moving ahead.
"
377,PPG,"PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG  -  Free Report) made the cut as one of the fastest-growing stocks on the Focus List this week. This manufacturer of coatings, glass and chemicals is a new addition to the portfolio. It was added on Aug 12, thanks, in large part, to an impressive track record of dividends that stretches back more than 100 years.  
"
378,PPG,"Some of the company's customers are getting back on track, but the housing and construction market looks like it will continue to be a problem. (This was underscored just yesterday with a worse-than-expected drop for existing home sales in July, see Home Sales Plunge, Prices to Follow.) Nevertheless, PPG continues to enjoy a longer-term ""Outperform"" recommendation and a Zacks #1 Rank ('strong buy').
"
379,PPG,"The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this year and next is currently $4.66 and $5.19 per share, respectively. Each of these outlooks is up approximately 9% over the past 2 months.  
"
380,PPG,"As far as its ""Outperform"" recommendation is concerned, we expect PPG Industries to experience healthy growth from improving macro trends, and also appreciate its increasing focus on emerging markets, especially in Asia.  
"
381,PPG,"For its second quarter, PPG Industries reported earnings per share of $1.64 that topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by more than 14%. It also improved substantially from the year-ago performance of 90 cents. Sales jumped 11% to $3.5 billion.  
"
382,PPG,"The company attributed these results to a 10% increase in volumes. The weak construction markets of the U.S. and Europe are being offset by higher industrial activity and strong demand in Asia/Pacific and Latin America.   
"
383,PPG,"PPG Industries has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for nine straight quarters now. If you average the last four quarters, the company has surprised by approximately 13%.   
"
384,PPG,"A few weeks ago, Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) reported 55 cents per share for its second quarter, which bettered the Zacks Consensus Estimate by almost 20%. This marked the company's fourth straight quarter with a positive earnings surprise, amassing an average of a little more than 24% in that time (thanks to a more than 46% beat for the first quarter).  
"
385,PPG,"Last year's second quarter marked the worst point in a very bad market environment for KSU, so the company had some good comparisons to work with. For example, EPS surged by almost eight times year over year from 7 cents per share. In addition, revenues of $461.6 million advanced 35% from last year, thanks to an improvement in volumes and a solid pricing environment.  
"
386,PPG,"We have a longer-term ""Outperform"" recommendation on KSU, but, for the shorter-term, the company has a Zacks #3 Rank ('hold').   
"
387,PPG,"Over the past two months, there have been nine upward revisions for this year and seven upward revisions for next. There are 15 total estimates for each period. There has also been one downward revision for 2010 and two downward revisions for 2011.  
"
388,PPG,"The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this year is up 2.6% in 30 days to $1.95 per share, but is down a penny in the past 7 days. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for next year is up 4.2% to $2.46 per share, which also suggests year-over-year improvement of more than 26%.   
"
389,PPG,"Kansas City Southern has been on the Focus List since Feb 10 of this year. In that time, the company is up 6.5%.

"
391,PPG,"The ever changing winds on Wall Street have once again shifted toward a bearish direction. And for good reason, but that doesn't mean your best bet is to hide in cash or throw a bunch of short ETFs into your portfolio. Timing is a Tough TaskTrading is one thing, but if you are an investor, trying to time the market can virtually guarantee that you will be missing out on profits. Gains come unexpectedly and are gone before you have time to right the ship. While the exact number may vary from study to study, the consensus says that the vast majority of the market's overall gains boil down to about 5% of the trading sessions, give or take a few percent. So, if you are not at least somewhat long on those days you have a 100% chance of missing out on hard earned profits.  Rather than sitting on the sidelines, opt for a more conservative portfolio that will pay you a healthy dividend. Collect the cash to soften the blow if the market does fall. And, if stocks head higher the regular payments can make it that much sweeter. Here are a few stocks, with a hearty dividend payment, good growth prospects and a favorable Zacks Rank. Allete (ALE  -  Free Report) is an electricity company in the U.S. The company also has other operations including gas and water service in parts of Minnesota and Wisconsin. Utilities typically have very stable cash flows that provide safe dividends, making them a popular target for those seeking safety and dividends. Allete is currently paying dividends with an annual yield of 4.8%.Additionally, estimates continue rise and now projecting double-digit growth in both 2010 and 2011. Currently Allete is a Zacks #2 Rank (Buy) stock. Nicor, Inc. (GAS) is a natural gas distributor for more than 2 million customers in northern Illinois. This Zacks #2 Rank (Buy) stock is currently paying a 4.3% dividend and is trading at under 14 time forward earnings. Textainer Group (TGH  -  Free Report) owns and leases intermodal containers and other related operations. This 3.8% dividend yield is attached to a Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stock that is coming off of its third consecutive earnings surprise. Analysts are unanimously raising estimates, which are now projecting a 37% growth rate this year and another 13% in 2011. PPG Industries (PPG  -  Free Report) is a coating and specialty products company. The global company serves a variety of industries. PPG is has a Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) and is paying a 3.2% dividend right now. The company is trading at 14 times this year's estimate, which are on the rise, and is currently on a 9 quarter earning surprise streak. TC Pipelines (TCLP) owns natural gas pipelines near the Great Lakes in the U.S and Canada. Pipelines are more or less immune to fluctuations in gas prices because they rely on volume rather than the commodity itself. In the past month each analyst has raised their earnings estimate, pushing the stock to a Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy). That 6.8% dividend will definitely attract long-term investors. Frontline Ltd. (FRO  -  Free Report) operates one of the largest transport fleets in the world. The company's ships primarily transport oil, but also move raw materials and dry cargo. First an foremost, the company's latest dividend was for 75 cents, after tripling the previous payment. This brings the yield to roughly 10%. Not too bad. Frontline will trim that when times are tough, but given the current yield you can stay safe and still have plenty of upside. Shares are trading at just 10 times forward earnings. Analysts are expecting earnings to more than double this year and increase another 12% in 2011. Don't Be Sorry, Be SmartWhen the market is tumultuous many investors seem to throw best practices out the window. Don't be one of them. Keep making smart decisions, play it safe and collect those dividends.

"
403,PPG,"Even during periods of economic growth, Alcoa Inc. (AA) often misses earnings estimates. So it is not shocking that brokerage analysts are lowering their expectations ahead of the company's fourth-quarter report. Over the past 30 days, cuts by 7 analysts have resulted in the consensus earnings estimate falling to a loss of 2 cents per share from a projected profit of 17 cents. The most accurate estimate is even more bearish and calls for a loss of 4 cents per share. As stated above, Alcoa will report on Monday, Jan 12, after the close of trading.
"
404,PPG,"Last Wednesday, Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) warned that fourth-quarter revenues would be about $8.2 billion, a 20% decrease from a year prior and below the chipmaker's previous forecast. The company did not provide an EPS figure, but 8 brokerage analysts cut their quarterly projections in response. The revisions led to a 2-cent drop in the consensus estimate, which is now at 20 cents per share. The most accurate estimate is more bearish at 14 cents per share.
"
405,PPG,"Though INTC does have a history of meeting or topping expectations, its 2009 guidance could dampen enthusiasm about fourth-quarter profits not being as bad as feared. INTC is scheduled to report on Thursday, Jan 15, after the close of trading.

"
412,PPG,"PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG  -  Free Report) exceeded analysts earnings expectations in five out of the last six quarters. PPGs second-quarter revenues marked the highest revenue in any quarter in the companys history. Consensus earnings estimates for both this year and nest year are up over the past two months. On Jul 19, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of 52 cents per share. PPG is currently trading at a valuation of 13.6x current fiscal-year estimated earnings and at 13.0x next fiscal-year estimated earnings.
"
413,PPG,"Full Analysis 
"
414,PPG,"PPG Industries, Inc. is a global supplier of paints, coatings, chemicals, optical products, specialty materials, glass and fiber glass. The company employs more than 34,000 people and has 125 manufacturing facilities and equity affiliates in more than 25 countries.
"
415,PPG,"On Jul 19, PPG posted second-quarter earnings per share of $1.53, beating the Streets estimate by two cents. The company has now surprised to the upside in five out of the last six quarters. PPG managed to match or beat the consensus earnings estimate in 11 out of the past 12 quarters. Revenues came in at $3.17 billion compared to $2.82 billion in the prior-year period. This marked the highest revenue in any quarter in the companys history and comes on the heels of a record performance set just last quarter.
"
416,PPG,"Chairman and CEO Charles E. Bunch stated, ""PPG's excellent performance this quarter is a result of our strongest organic volume growth in three years. This has been driven by our well-balanced geographic footprint and ongoing market penetration in both of our coatings segments and our Optical and Specialty Materials segment.""
"
417,PPG,"The consensus earnings estimate for this year is up 11 cents to $5.34 over the past 60 days. Profit forecasts for next year have risen 19 cents to $5.60 over the same period of time. Earnings per share are projected to grow 9% over the next 3-5 years.  
"
418,PPG,"On Jul 19, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of 52 cents per share. This represented a 4% increase, with PPG raising its dividend more than 10% over the past 15 months, with two increases in the past six months alone. The company has a current dividend yield of 2.87% and a five-year average dividend yield of 3.03%. 
"
419,PPG,"PPG is currently trading at a valuation of 13.6x current fiscal-year estimated earnings and at 13.0x next fiscal-year estimated earnings. The market, as represented by the S&P 500, is trading at a valuation of 15.7x current fiscal-year estimated earnings and at 14.7x next fiscal-year estimated earnings. PPG has a price-to-book ratio of 3.2, compared to 4.7 for the market.
"
420,PPG,"The companys return on equity tops that of the industry average24% compared to 18%.

421,PPG,"Investors will get their first look at fourth-quarter earnings next week when Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and Bear Stearns (BSC) report. Lehman Brothers (LEH) is also likely to report, though a firm date has not been announced. 
"
422,PPG,"The reports will break what otherwise is a seasonal lull for earnings. Fourth-quarter earnings warnings season will not start for a few more weeks and there are only a limited amount earnings reports coming out right now. Therefore, it is not surprising to see the number of estimate revisions drop. Using a four-week rolling period, there were only 1,728 revisions of as last Friday for S&P 500 companies, a significant drop from even a week ago. 
"
423,PPG,"The drop in the number of revisions comes at a time when the economic data has not been bullish. Yet, despite concerns about a hard landing for the economy, the outlook for growth remains strong. Analysts project the median S&P 500 company to generate 10.5% growth in the fourth quarter and 12.8% growth next year. Zacks Equity Research anticipates that the current economic headwinds will slow, allowing the economy to continue its expansion next year. This, coupled with cost-cutting and share buybacks, should allow corporations to continue to achieve profit growth throughout next year.

426,PPG,"The total number of 2006 earnings revisions over the past month was 1,728. This is down from the peak of 4-week revisions we recorded last week: 2,568. In the coming weeks, we should continue to see the total number of revisions fall off. 
"
427,PPG,"Over the last four weeks, there were 1,010 upward revisions and 718 downward. This makes for a total revisions ratio of 1.41, which is down from last weeks 1.53. For over a month now, the revisions ratio has remained above 1.0, reflecting the surprisingly strong third quarter. The ratio of firms with higher mean estimates to lower mean estimates was similarly strong at 1.31.
"
428,PPG,"The upward revisions have been very widespread, with nearly every sector seeing more upward than downward revisions. Looking more closely at individual revisions ratios, the Materials sector is the laggard with a ratio of 0.82. International Paper (IP  -  Free Report) and PPG Industries (PPG  -  Free Report) had the most significant downward EPS revisions. On the upside of the revisions story, Health Care remains at the front of the pack with an impressive ratio of 2.79. Big pharma continues to show strength. Over the last two months, Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report), Merck (MRK  -  Free Report), and Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) have all seen strong upward revisions.

"
430,PPG,"Looking ahead to next year, the revisions ratio has continued its uptrend and remains above 1.0, at 1.18. This is extraordinarily important. With the economy slowing, housing in a free fall and the yield curve inverted, one can easily make an intellectually coherent case for a recession next year. However, there has never been a recession where earnings grow at anything close to a double-digit rate. This is the elephant in the room that must be explained by any recession predictor. There is no way that the expected growth rate will come down unless estimate cuts exceed estimate increases.
"
431,PPG,"The bright point regarding 2007 revisions is clearly Financial Services. The sectors ratio has reached 1.83. Two positive revisions leaders in the sector are Apartment Investment & Management (AIV  -  Free Report) and Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report). On the downside, Utilities remains the 2007 revisions ratio laggard with a 0.51. For the S&P 500 as a whole the ratio of firms revised up to revised down was a slightly positive 1.03, although like the revisions ratio it was well below the stellar levels for this year.

"
433,PPG,"On a full-year1 basis, earnings growth for the S&P 500 is expected to remain solid. Double-digit gains are expected on both a median firm and total net income basis. On a median basis, growth for the current and next fiscal year is expected to be 13.6% and 12.8%, respectively. This growth rate has stayed relatively stable (slight upward drift for 2006) over the last several weeks. On a total earnings basis, the growth rates are more skewed towards this year, at 14.4% versus 9.8% next year. While the total growth rate is certainly predicted to slow, by no means is a 9.8% year-over-year growth rate tantamount to predicting a near term recession. Further, with the revisions ratios of both 2006 and 2007 above 1.0, a significant deterioration of the expected growth rate does not look likely at this point. 
"
434,PPG,"We would point to a couple of technical points which are affecting the expected growth rates. The rates are based on the forecasts of EPS, and then multiplied by current shares outstanding to get total earnings. Recently firms have been pumping enormous, and unprecedented, sums into share repurchase. In the first half, over $216 billion was spent by S&P 500 firms to buy back their own stock. The shrinks the number of shares outstanding and boosts the EPS growth rate. Add in dividends paid out and over 80% of earnings were returned to shareholders rather than reinvested by the companies. Countering this is the expensing of options this year. As recently as last year companies were allowed to use bogus intrinsic value accounting for stock options. In other words pretend that there was no cost to the company for making its executives extraordinarily rich in many cases. Now they have to realize that compensation is indeed an expense, which holds down reported earnings growth, even if there is no change in the economic earnings. Unlike some other earnings databases, our estimates fully include the effect of expensing options (which would explain why our numbers are somewhat lower than theirs).
"
435,PPG,"Unlike the growth rates in our Earnings Scorecard, the numbers in the table below represent the expected growth for all of a sectors firms. Energy is expected to post rock-solid growth for both years on a median basis, with earnings climbing nearly 39% this year and approximately 18% next year. However, there is a real disparity for 2007 in the Energy sector, where it is at the front of the pack on a median firm basis but near the back on a total earnings basis. The key to that difference is that a handful of giant super majors    Exxon Mobil (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhilips (COP  -  Free Report)    account for over half of the sectors total expected earnings. Their earnings are currently expected to be flat to slightly down in 2007 relative to 2006, while the oil service and many of the E&P firms are expected to continue growing at a rapid clip. The Materials sector shows a similar disparity for 2007. Going the other way, total earnings growth in 2006 is much higher than median growth from the Financial Services sector. This is largely due to the very large insurance losses in 2005 due to the storms. The Financial Services sector has more firms in it, and accounts for more of the S&Ps total earnings than the Energy and Industrial sectors combined.

"
442,PPG,"When making investment decisions, growth should always be looked at in conjunction with how much you are paying for a stock. Thus, it makes sense to look at the total earnings expected for a sector, relative to that sectors total market capitalization. This is basically a variation on looking at the P/E.
"
443,PPG,"The chart below shows the share of total earnings for 2005, 2006 and 2007, as well as the share of total market capitalization for each sector (the final bar shown). Since the S&P 500 is a market cap weighted index, this is the same as its index weight. On the chart below, the difference between the sizes of the first three bars shows if a sector is gaining or losing earnings share. The difference between the final bar and the first three bars shows if the sector is selling for an above or below market P/E. If the final bar is smaller than the other bars, the sector is selling for a below market P/E. However, as opposed to just showing the sector P/Es, it also shows the relative importance of the sectors to the overall index. 
"
444,PPG,"Clearly the Financials are the biggest influence on the market, with a weight of 21.1%, it has more influence than the Consumer Staples, Utilities, Materials and Telecom sectors combined. However, that sector is also relatively cheap on an earnings basis, and thus serves to hold the overall P/E of the index down. In other words, Financials deserve to be the biggest influence on the market, since they contribute 26.3% of the total expected earnings for 2006, or more than the total earnings of the Tech, Industrial and Utility sectors combined.
"
445,PPG,"Energy looks to be under represented in its influence on the market since it is expected to provide 14.6% of total earnings for 2006, but represents only 10% of the total market capitalization of the index. While its earnings share is currently expected to decline to 13.9% in 2007, even on this basis it is still much cheaper than the overall market. Clearly at 10%, Energy is far from being in a bubble phase. Frankly, I find the notion of an Energy stock bubble to be absurd. Even though the NASDAQ is at only half of its early 2000 peak, a much stronger case could be made for Tech being bubbly than for Energy.
"
446,PPG,"Looked at another way, Energy will provide 22% of the total incremental earnings in the S&P 500 this year, while that is down from the 41.6 % of the total it provided last year, it is still far above its weight in the index. In more conventional terms, the Energy sector is trading for 11.0x 2006, and 10.5x 2007 earnings. Tech on the other hand is trading for 22.8x 2006 and 19.3x 2007 earnings. The S&P is trading for 16.1x and 14.7x, respectively. The second chart below shows the sector P/Es ranked from lowest to highest based on estimated 2007 P/E ratios.
"
447,PPG,"Matt Thurmond contributed significantly to this report.1We follow the convention of referring to the most recently reported full fiscal year as 2005, and the next full fiscal year to be reported as 2006. There can thus be some shifting in the growth rates even for 2005 as not all calendar year firms have completed their fiscal years.
