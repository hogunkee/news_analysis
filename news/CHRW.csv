The property insurer posted earnings well below consensus views due to high levels of weather-related losses, according to the company, but revenue was better-than-expected. The loss sent shares below support at its 10-week moving average in heavy trade, a sell signal.Dow issue American Express (AXP) dropped 0.8% after reporting late Wednesday its second-quarter earnings and revenue were above analyst targets, but its loss provisions rose sharply due to loan write-offs.Sarepta Therapeutics' (SRPT) sparked 17% higher at the open. The Cambridge, Mass.-based biotech reported a much narrower-than-expected loss during the second quarter, and revenue nearly 60% above consensus targets.

16,CHRW,"Stocks pared losses Wednesday afternoon, as crude oil tumbled 4%. The major stock indexes appear to be cooling off their heels following strong gains since the middle of last week.Meanwhile, investors should take a close look at not only the upcoming Beige Book report (slated for release at 2 p.m. ET) on regional economies in the U.S. but also the Dow Jones transport average, often seen as a good indicator of the general economy. The Dow transports fell 0.1%; the Dow Jones industrial average turned fractionally higher.The Nasdaq composite nursed a loss of 0.1% after finding support at the 5000 level. That followed Nasdaq gains of 0.8%, 0.4%, 1.6%, 0.6% and 0.7% in the prior five sessions of trading.The S&P 500 slipped less than 0.1% despite a broad sell-off among oil and gas issues. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) fell 1.1%. However, the integrated global oil play is comfortably above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, which are both now rising, a good sign. Ditto for Chevron (CVX) and the U.K.'s BP (BP).On Wednesday, the Energy Information Administration reported a bigger than expected draw of crude oil inventories last week, down 2.5 million barrels vs. the 2.2 million seen by the Econoday consensus forecast.The Dow transports, up 2.2% Tuesday, got a nice boost by an across-the-board rebound among airlines that day. However, the Dow transports is more than 15% below an all-time high of 9310 set in November 2014. Go to a weekly chart at Investors.com and you'll see that this sector index is still locked in a long-term downtrend. A healthy rise in the Dow transports -- which include trucking and shipping stocks -- would indicate strength across a variety of industries, from energy and commodities to consumer goods.During the 2003 to 2007 bull market run, the Dow transports rallied strong enough to hit new highs, just as the S&P 500 did. But this has not been the case since last year. The Dow transports are up more than 4% since Jan. 1.Among IBD's 197 industry subgroups, Transport-Logistics is up 0.4%. Trucking parts and transportation equipment makers are down sharply. Within the logistics group, Hub Group (HUBG) and C.H. Robinson (CHRW) are the ones to watch because they are relatively mildly off their 52-week highs. But one can see that these stocks are struggling to surpass important resistance levels -- the 41 level for Hub and 75 for Robinson. The former has better ratings from IBD, including a decent but not stunning 73 for Relative Strength. In general, true stock market leaders show an RS Rating of 80 or higher when they break out to new highs and launch a big price run.Among IBD 50 names in the stock market today, innovative discount retailer Five Below (FIVE) sank nearly 2% to 47.75 in light trade. The decline is normal, given that the retail sector leader has rallied as much as 33% past an initial cup-with-handle buy point at 33.59.Five Below, which is rapidly expanding its stores across the Midwest and South, sells all of its items at five dollars or less each. The 99 Composite Rating from IBD Stock Checkup reflects its strong record of solid double-digit EPS and revenue growth (average 36% EPS increases over the past three quarters). Since the stock is currently one of seven IBD Sector Leaders stocks, an annotated daily and weekly chart of the 2014 IPO can be viewed at IBD Leaderboard.As seen in Tuesday's Big Picture column and Market Pulse table, the market is currently in a confirmed uptrend. This means an investor has a higher probability of making money when buying breakouts of high-quality growth stocks at proper buy points.

The loss put shares 40% below their November high and 6% above their September IPO price.Among leaders, Ambarella (AMBA), a leading developer of video processing chips, skidded 4% lower, to the bottom of the IBD 50 list. Key client GoPro (GPRO) was also 4% lower in early trade. Ambarella is struggling to hold its 50-day line of support for a second time in a month.

30,CHRW,"Jerry Dodson's Parnassus Endeavor Fund (PARWX) proves that you can have your socially responsible cake and eat it too.The $1.5 billion mutual fund favors companies that provide employees with ""outstanding workplaces."" So do the five other funds at Parnassus Investments, which Dodson founded in 1984. That includes things like offering workers profit-sharing, time off for working parents, paid time off for volunteer work, fair treatment and clear communication.The investment team at Parnassus, which has $16.5 billion under management, also screen out companies engaged in the extraction, exploration, production, manufacturing or refining of fossil fuels.None of those criteria have prevented Endeavor from outperforming its peers or the broad market in the past 10 years.It is the top-performing environmental, social and corporate-governance (ESG) fund over the 10 years ended June 30, with an 11.57% average annual return in that decade, says Morningstar Inc. The S&P 500 averaged a 7.42% yearly gain in that span.The fund also ranks in the top 1% of all large-cap growth mutual funds in that period and the top 2% over the past five years.And it is an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards winner, glowing in three categories — U.S. equity funds, growth funds and large caps. It outperformed the S&P 500 over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods ended Dec. 31.Through Q2, it was ahead of roughly 42% of all U.S. diversified stock funds so far this year.Dodson's affinity for ESG investing has deep roots. He founded Parnassus Investments at the age of 41 with those goals in mind. Earlier work was a harbinger of what was to come: A political science major as UC Berkeley, he got his MBA from Harvard Business School in 1971, then went on to work for a nonprofit outfit that helped minority-owned businesses. He helped organize Continental Savings of America, becoming the president and CEO of the S&L, which developed an innovative product for depositors to invest in solar energy projects.Dodson is lead manager on Parnassus Fund (PARNX) and Parnassus Asia Fund (PAFSX) and sole manager of Endeavor. From his office in San Francisco, 73-year-old Dodson talked with Investor's Business Daily about the ins and outs of his investment approach and how he began to use social screens.IBD: You're juggling two tough tasks: You not only use ESG criteria, you also run a concentrated portfolio. Which is tougher?Dodson: You know, the hard part was getting the philosophy and tweaking it with simulations, which was done over many years. Once we understood the strategy would work, the size of the portfolio just followed.You'll be surprised that we took advice from a journalist (about the size and strategy). I was social friends with Milton Moskowitz, who was writing a news story that started as a book. It was about the 100 best places to work.I looked at the returns of the 50% to 60% that were publicly traded ... and thought I should start a fund based on that. Milton thought I should stick with 100 companies. I disagreed. He said I'd screw it up.Anyway, it took years (of looking for fundamental metrics that correlated to good stock performance). It took about two years of back-testing on paper, then five more years of running the portfolio (before opening it to the public).IBD: Aside from ESG criteria, it looks to me as if you seek large-cap companies with wide moats or strong competitive advantages, and quality management teams that act in the best interests of shareholders. Have I got it right?Dodson: That's it, succinctly.IBD: Information technology is your largest sector, with a 50% weighting as of March 31. Is that a typical exposure to tech?Dodson: It's usually been our largest sector, but not 50%. Normally it's around 30%. The reason is that we know the sector well. Silicon Valley is down the road from us and more and more right here in the city.Also, in terms of workplace, technology companies seem a step ahead in providing a good environment. Google -- Alphabet (GOOGL) now -- has generous maternity leave, a gym where you can work out, days off for doing charitable events.Compared to, say, the steel industry, workplace issues score stronger at tech companies.IBD: Speaking of Alphabet, it's been trending sideways since late April. Do you still like the stock?Dodson: We started buying at 525 in December 2014. Now it's up to (the low 700s). We think it will make more gains. But you're right, it's been pretty flat. We regard it as a long-term holding. It's got a great moat and a good social story.IBD: Why do you think it has more room to run?Dodson: Primarily because of its moat, and it's looking to develop new products. It has a huge cash stake, a talented workforce. Its search engine gives them (revenue and earnings) stability. I don't know what new ideas they're working on, but I know they're looking for new products and they'll find something.IBD: In general, you emphasize some ESG criteria more than others, right?Dodson: We are more focused on the workplace, how a company treats employees. Then the environment. Workplace is a component of ""social.""IBD: How is workplace part of ""social""?Dodson: The word ""social"" covers a lot. For us, it means how a company treats its employees. It can mean safety record, privacy policy, relationship to the community where the company operates, diversity programs and good, clear, honest communication.IBD: Do you ever invest in a stock because its E, S or G features are very attractive, even though its financial performance is not so bright?Dodson: In the past we've done that. I did it before Endeavor Fund, with Parnassus Fund (PARNX). The stock was Control Data (a supercomputer company). They would hire former prisoners, do great social things. But the business strategy was just OK. We invested, and it was one of the worst mistakes I ever had. It cured me of picking for environmental or social reasons alone.IBD: Let's talk about individual holdings as of your latest disclosure. Citrix Systems' (CTXS) earnings per share rose 51% and 82% the past two quarters. A lot of people think the enterprise software developer, specializing in desktop virtualization, lost its focus. It's in a reorganization that has involved layoffs of staff and contractors. How does this situation look to you?Dodson: The reason we invested was because of their GoToMeeting app (which is being spun off). GoToMeeting is similar to Citrix's XenApp. You can be thousands of miles away from your server, doing applications, and you can use it on your smartphone or laptop, and it delivers it safely on your mobile device. That's what makes them successful. People want applications, this company delivers them where you want.IBD: Your stake in Applied Materials' (AMAT) is up. Are you satisfied with their progress?Dodson: It was in the doldrums when we initiated a position in May 2009 at 11.22. Equipment used to make semiconductors tends to be volatile. Sales and earnings are very cyclical. We tried to buy at a time when the stock had fallen off, then ride it up. Now it's (rising). We believe Applied will benefit from significant order growth with its leading etch and deposition tools.IBD: Ciena's (CIEN) earnings per share have slowed from 625% growth three quarters ago to 50% growth and a 3% decline the past two frames. Everything OK there?Dodson: We've owned it quite a while. It's more volatile than we expected. It makes communication glass wires, equipment that moves impulses, whether they are voice or data, along transmission lines. Earnings have been lumpy because any time you have an equipment maker, it has ups and downs. We've held it through cycles. It's more volatile than we expected. But we like the company, and we think it has more upside.IBD: Why do you own C.H. Robinson Worldwide (CHRW)? It's not a tech story. And revenue has declined three quarters in a row.Dodson: It's a freight forwarder, focusing on trucking. You're right. It hasn't done well. That's primarily because shipping has not picked up as much as anticipated. The economy is growing (at an annualized rate of) 2% or less. To get trucking and freight forwarding growing, the economy has to grow more. So it's a play that the economic recovery will accelerate. But our average cost is 55. The stock is in the mid-70s, so we've done well.IBD: Charles Schwab's (SCHW) EPS grow has accelerated for two quarters, but share price has been weak. What's your play here?Dodson: We're tied in to them. We pay Schwab if customers come in through them.But the key? A lot of brokerage firms, including Schwab, collect interest on margin loans. With interest rates so low, they don't make much. But if interest rates increase, then there's a huge earnings increase for Schwab. It's in the mid-20s now. It would go to the 40s.If our economy gets better, rates will go up and Schwab will take off.IBD: Intel's (INTC) EPS growth is speeding up. Where's the growth for their computer chips coming from?Dodson: They make chips for personal computers, smartphones and other applications. They also make chips for servers. Those sales are going up.They've been trying for years to get into the mobile (devices) market. They finally have semiconductors going into the iPhone. They're trying to get more into communications and other growth areas. With this Apple (AAPL) chip and other missions, that's what we're banking on to move Intel higher.IBD: Procter & Gamble (PG) is the classic defensive stock. But revenue per share has declined for eight quarters. Is this what you want?Dodson: You're right about revenue declining. They've got these amazing brands: Crest, Tide, Gillette, Head & Shoulders. But they need a new growth engine. We're looking at it. Does it have growth ahead? We haven't reached a conclusion.IBD: IBM (IBM) EPS is down four straight quarters. Sales are down 16 frames in a row. Why invest in it?
"
31,CHRW,"Dodson: My only defense is that Warren Buffett owns a lot more than I do. I first bought it at the end of 2013. I expected it to turn around as they cut emphasis on hardware. At some point, growth in (consulting and) software will offset declines in hardware. But it hasn't happened yet. At 10.7 times (forward) earnings, we believe share price is on the bargain table.IBD: Is Buffett selling?Dodson: No. We look when there's a filing, but we've seen no sign of (Buffett selling). I'm sure he's having the same regrets I have.IBD: W.W. Grainger's (GWW) EPS and sales finally notched gains after declining for two quarters. But shares are not making headway.Dodson: Grainger makes everything under the sun (for maintenance). This in some sense is a play on the overall economy. If the U.S. economy can grow fast enough, Grainger will do well because its products touch almost every sector of the economy.IBD: Gilead Sciences' (GILD) EPS and revenue growth have slowed in recent quarters. Do you still like this stock?Dodson: I was expecting sales to increase quite a bit for their hepatitis C product. But they had to cut prices because of competition. Both AbbVie (ABBV) and Merck (MRK) make therapies for hep C. Gilead is a great lab. They will develop new therapies. In time, the company should do well.IBD: This fund began with a different name. Why the name change, Jerry?Dodson: The way we pick stocks hasn't changed. We started out as the Workplace Fund. We had good performance early on, but the name Workplace Fund was not getting the attention we thought it should.People on our staff said we got strange reactions from brokers and advisors, who weren't sure what the name meant. ""Why not pick a more general name?"" they said. They said that would get more shareholder money, more acceptance.IBD: And why is the fund concentrated?Dodson: Primarily because I can't find enough companies that are undervalued that meet the workplace and social criteria.IBD: The fund has 25 names. How typical is that?Dodson: We would like to have 35 to 40 names. We're looking for more. The last couple years we went down to 25 or so.IBD: The fund had an 11% cash weighting as of May 31. Was that because it's hard to find your kind of stocks?Dodson: That's correct. I try to stay as fully invested as possible.IBD: Jerry, make my day: Before running this fund, did you run a totally non-PC fund -- you know, one that only invests in ammo, tobacco, oil?Dodson: Before Endeavor, I managed each of six (including one that no longer exists) other Parnassus funds prior to finding a manager for each of them. I founded Parnassus Investments in 1984. Prior to that, I worked for six years as president of a small bank in San Francisco. Before that, I spent four years as a foreign service officer with the Department of State, serving in Panama and Vietnam.IBD: What was your investment style before you embraced ESG?Dodson: We've embraced ESG since the firm was founded. It was one of our founding principles.IBD: What got you into ESG?Dodson: My personal philosophy had always revolved around ESG, but I wasn't sure it could be used as a business philosophy. At Continental, I started a program to allow savers to put their money into special savings accounts that would be lent out for solar energy installations. Much to my pleasant surprise, the program was very popular.It convinced me that there was a market out there for investors who wanted to make a positive impact with their money. This led to the founding of Working Assets Money Fund (1983-1984), which took ESG factors into account in investing in money market securities.This, in turn, led to the formation of Parnassus Investments.I took the ESG from my experience, then added the value-oriented philosophy of Benjamin Graham, whose writings I admired. These two strains formed the basis of the Parnassus investment philosophy.IBD: How did you come up with the Parnassus name?Dodson: I lived on a street near Parnassus Avenue in San Francisco. I looked up the mythology around Mount Parnassus in Greece and discovered it was the site of the Oracle of Delphi. I liked the image of the oracle often going against the prevailing wisdom. It fit my contrarian, value-oriented investment philosophy.IBD: Since you're 73, do you have plans to retire?Dodson: I plan to retire as chief executive officer in 2018 at 75. However, I plan to stay on indefinitely as manager of Endeavor until I find someone well-qualified to take over.

33,CHRW,"U.S. diversified large-cap mutual funds have slightly outperformed small-cap funds over the past decade, but have surrendered nearly all of their once-big lead.The lead between the two categories swung back and forth several times. Understanding that seesaw action can help you with future buy and sell decisions in the diversified portion of your portfolio that includes mutual funds and ETFs.And that can boost the octane of your retirement accounts.Overall, large-cap funds averaged a yearly gain of 6.18% between the end of 2005 and March 24, 2016. Small-cap funds averaged a 5.50% annual return, according to Morningstar Inc.Large-caps funds topped small caps in most quarters during the market meltdown from late 2007 through early 2009. Seeking safer ground, investors rotated into large caps, whose larger size and financial heft made them more likely to survive the market downturn.As the recovery picked up pace, small caps often outperformed.But large caps held off the charge by small caps in most of 2014 and again since mid-2015.If you had invested $10,000 in the average large-cap fund on Dec. 31, 2005, by March 24 of this year it would have grown into $19,328. That is just $67 more than the end result for the same amount invested in the average small-cap fund.Over those 10 years plus this year-to-date, $1.4 billion Parnassus Endeavor Fund (PARWX) was the top-performing large-cap portfolio with $100 million or more in assets. The fund racked up an 11.09% average annual gain. Its yearly return over the past three years has been 14.26%.Endeavor is one of the IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 award winners, and a top-five fund in IBD's large-cap category.The fund had 96% of its money at work in U.S. stocks as of Feb. 29.Fifty-seven percent of manager Jerome Dodson's stocks were giant- and large-cap stocks. Another 36% were midcaps.Technology was by far Dodson's largest sector, with a 51% weighting.Industrials and financial services were Dodson's next two biggest sectors, with 19% and 14% weightings respectively.Citrix Systems (CTXS) is one of Dodson's tech names. The software developer is up 11% from its Feb. 11 closing low. That leaves the stock just below breakeven for the year.As cloud-based Web apps proliferate, customers turn to Citrix for security and management solutions.Earnings per share growth has accelerated for three quarters, growing 2%, 20%, 39% and 51% in the past four stanzas.The stock has IBD's Composite Rating of 93. The Composite Rating combines IBD’s five stock-performance ratings, including EPS and Relative Strength ratings.Applied Materials (AMAT) is another of Parnassus Endeavor's tech holdings. The semiconductor equipment maker is up 8% so far this year.Demand for displays is driving growth for the firm.First-quarter 2016 revenue was $2.3 billion. That was a 4% decline from a year earlier, but better than analysts industrywide had expected. EPS growth was down 4%, but also beat analyst estimates.Applied Materials has an 84 Comp Rating.C.H. Robinson Worldwide (CHRW) is one of the fund's industrials. Shares are up 19% so far this year.The stock has posted seven quarters of double-digit EPS growth after a six-quarter EPS decline streak.Boasting a 90 Comp Rating, Robinson is a third-party logistics firm that provides freight transportation services and logistics solutions.BMO Capital Markets reportedly downgraded Robinson earlier this month stock to ""market perform"" from ""outperform,"" but increased its price target to $74 from $72.

589,CHRW,"Investors looking for stocks in the Transportation - Services sector might want to consider either Schneider National (SNDR  -  Free Report) or C.H. Robinson Worldwide (CHRW  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Schneider National has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while C.H. Robinson Worldwide has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. This means that SNDR's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.SNDR currently has a forward P/E ratio of 20.27, while CHRW has a forward P/E of 20.66. We also note that SNDR has a PEG ratio of 1.56. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. CHRW currently has a PEG ratio of 2.30.Another notable valuation metric for SNDR is its P/B ratio of 2.71. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, CHRW has a P/B of 8.53.Based on these metrics and many more, SNDR holds a Value grade of B, while CHRW has a Value grade of C.SNDR sticks out from CHRW in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that SNDR is the better option right now.

590,CHRW,"Shares of SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report) have gained 4.4% since it reported better-than-expected earnings per share and revenues for the first quarter of 2018.Markedly, this regional carrier’s first-quarter earnings per share came in at $1.03, well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 84 cents.

Results were aided by higher revenues and a lower tax rate.Quarterly revenues increased significantly year over year to $783.4 million, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $754.5 million. The top line benefited from the company’s improved fleet mix.SkyWest, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  SkyWest, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | SkyWest, Inc.

591,CHRW,"C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (CHRW  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 earnings numbers on May 1, after the closing bell.In the fourth quarter of 2017, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 16.5% with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. Moreover, the bottom line climbed 15.1% year over year on higher revenues. While the top line rose 16% year over year on increased pricing and volume growth across most the transportation sectors.The company also boasts an impressive earnings history, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters with an average beat of 3.6%.Let’s see, how things shape up for this earnings season.Why a Likely Positive Surprise? Our proven model shows that C.H. Robinson is likely to beat on earnings in the impending results on the back of a perfect combination of the following two key ingredients:Zacks ESP: C.H. Robinson has an Earnings ESP of +0.17%. A positive Zacks ESP indicates a likely earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: C.H. Robinson carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which further increases the predictive power of ESP. Notably, stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have significantly higher chances of beating estimates.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Quote What is Driving This Better-Than-Expected Earnings?The transportation sector (comprising Truckload, Intermodal, Less-than-Truckload, Ocean, Air, Customs and Other logistics services) is likely to perform well in the first quarter on the back of increased pricing as well as volume growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for transportation revenues stands at $573 million, higher than $538 million a year ago.We are also impressed by the company’s growth-by-acquisition strategy. For example, the company’s acquisition of Milgram & Company, completed last August, has strengthened its product portfolio. This is likely to boost results in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Additionally, the new tax law, having reduced the corporate tax rate significantly, is a further positive. The huge tax savings are likely to drive the company’s bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter.However, high operating expenses might hurt the company’s first-quarter results like the previous report. This in turn could lead to a deterioration of the operating ratio (defined as operating expenses as a percentage of revenues).Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the broader Transportation sector may also consider LATAM Airlines Group S.A. (LTM  -  Free Report), Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (EXPD  -  Free Report) and Copa Holdings, S.A. (CPA  -  Free Report) as these stocks too possess the right combination of elements to deliver an earnings beat this reporting cycle.LATAM Airlines has an Earnings ESP of +19.23% and a Zacks Rank of 3.

592,CHRW,"Shares of Spirit Airlines, Inc. (SAVE  -  Free Report) declined 5.9% on Apr 26 to close the trading session at $35.40. In fact, the stock was down despite this low-cost carrier posting better-than-expected earnings per share yesterday. Spirit’s first-quarter earnings per share came in at 44 cents (excluding $1.10 from non-recurring items), a penny ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Why This Contrasting Scenario Despite an earnings beat in the first quarter, investors were visibly displeased due to a year-over-year decline in the metric. High fuel costs were primarily responsible for the bottom-line contraction. Average economic fuel cost per gallon surged 21.5% to $2.15 in the reported quarter.The upsurge in fuel costs was chiefly responsible for a 39.8% increase in total operating expenses. This apart, expenses on salaries, wages and other benefits surged 22%. Unit costs (excluding fuel and special items) decreased 5%. However, the decline was more than the anticipated figure of 3% due to the new contract with its pilots.This Miramar, FL-based carrier’s struggles on the top-line front also disappointed investors. The carrier recorded revenues of $704.1 million, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $705 million. The top line, however, grew substantially year over year owing to healthy passenger revenues.Notably, the most disturbing aspect of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) carrier’s first-quarter top-line performance was the 2.4% decline in total revenue per available seat miles (a key measure of unit revenue). This key metric was hurt by the 1.7% decrease in operating yields and a 4.1% increase in average stage length.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) decline of 60 basis points to 81% was another negative aspect of the earnings report. The metric was down as traffic growth (21.4%) was outpaced by capacity expansion (22.3%) during the reported quarter.Spirit Airlines, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Spirit Airlines, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Spirit Airlines, Inc. QuoteDisappointing OutlookApart from the below-par earnings report, Spirit Airlines’ second-quarter 2018 guidance also disappointed investors and contributed to the stock price decline. The company envisions capacity (available seat miles) to expand 29% year over year in the quarter. TRASM is expected to decline in the range of 6.5-7.5%.Fuel costs are anticipated to increase further to $2.23 per gallon in the second quarter. Adjusted unit costs ex-fuel is estimated to be down 7.5-8.5%. For 2018, the carrier expects capacity to rise 22.5%. Adjusted CASM ex-fuel is predicted to be down 3-4% in the year.Upcoming ReleasesInvestors interested in the broader Zacks Transportation industry are keenly awaiting first-quarter earnings reports from key players like C.H.

593,CHRW,"The Q1 earnings season is unwinding fast with 154 S&P 500 companies (representing 37.9% of the total market capitalization of the coveted index) having reported results as of Apr 25.  In fact, the picture that has evolved thus far is an extremely rosy one.Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for these companies have increased 25.4% year over year. Also, revenues for the same improved 10.3% on a year-over-year basis. Furthermore, 80.5% of these companies have outpaced earnings estimates and 72.1% surpassed top-line expectations.What is even more encouraging is that this bull run is likely to continue for the rest of the Q1 reporting cycle. According to the above report, this earnings season seems to be well on track to register the highest level of year-over-year earnings growth in the last seven years. It also predicted that overall earnings for all the S&P 500 are expected to be up 20% on 8% growth in revenues. This bullish projection can be attributed to a corporate tax overhaul and relatively healthy job data.Given the prevalent healthy scenario, it is quite natural that most sectors should deliver an impressive performance. In fact, per the above report, 15 of the 16 Zacks sectors are projected to end Q1 with earnings growth year over year. Moreover, most of those 15 sectors are projected to end Q1 with double-digit earnings growth.One of these high-flying sectors is Transportation. Majority of the sector participants (57.1%) have already reported financial numbers. The performances of the S&P 500 transportation companies so far, indicate a 23.7% increase in total earnings year over year, with 75% outperforming on the bottom-line front. The members of this highly diversified sector are projected to end Q1 with earnings growth of 19.9%, much higher than the 3.5% in the final quarter of 2017.Factors Responsible for Transports Flying High It is a well-documented fact that stocks in the Transportation space had a rough time last year due to factors like hurricanes and public-relation related fiascos. Even though, headwinds like foul weather and high costs have hurt transports in Q1, sector participants managed to overcome the obstacles and perform well this earnings season.Notably, factors like the new tax law, improved unit revenue scenario, thriving domestic economy and strong performance of the intermodal division have helped this key sector to perform well in Q1 reporting cycle.Transports’ Bull Run Likely to ContinueWith the Transportation sector very much in favor, it is likely that quite a few companies in this space that have not yet disclosed their quarterly numbers will report better-than-expected results in Q1. Given this backdrop, it seems to be a prudent idea to add such stocks to one’s portfolio now.How to Make the Right Choice?With multiple companies present in the Transportation space, the task of selecting the right stocks is by no means an easy one. The process is akin to searching for a needle in a haystack unless one is aware of an appropriate method to make the right choice.One way to narrow down the list of choices is by looking at stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP.

597,CHRW,"Shares of C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (CHRW  -  Free Report) have surged 32% in a year’s time, outperforming the industry’s 8.7% increase.Reasons Behind the Price RiseC.H. Robinson has an impressive earnings surprise history, having outshined the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters. The average earnings beat is 2.2%.The company’s efforts to reward shareholders are also encouraging. In December 2017, C.H. Robinson’s board of directors approved a 2.2% hike in its quarterly cash dividend to 46 cents per share (or $1.84 annually). During the first quarter of 2018, it returned $134.7 million to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.Moreover, C.H. Robinson recently boosted its buyback program. The company’s board has added another 15 million shares to the existing share repurchase authorization of 1.2 million shares, approved in 2013.Increased freight demand and lower tax rates are encouraging too. The improvement in operating cash flow is an added a positive. We are impressed by the company's grow-by-acquisition policy as well. To this end, the company acquired Milgram & Company for around $62 million CAD (approximately $50 million USD), which in turn, expanded C.H. Robinson’s global presence. This latest acquisition is in line with the company’s continued efforts to expand globally through mergers.Zacks Rank & Key PicksC.H. Robinson carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

598,CHRW,"American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to unveil first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, before the opening bell.In the fourth quarter of 2017, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.3% backed by higher revenues. Furthermore, this airline behemoth has an impressive earnings history, having outshined the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 3.8%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this Fort Worth, TX-based company prior to the announcement.Price Performance in Q1 In the January-March period, the stock has performed disappointingly mainly due to rising fuel costs. The stock has shed 0.2% of its value against the industry’s gain of 1%.Direction of Estimate RevisionsLet’s take a look at the estimate revisions to get a clear picture of analysts’ opinion on the stock before the earnings release.American Airlines has witnessed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings being revised 29.8% upward to 74 cents over the last 30 days.  Moreover, the estimate reflects a year-over-year improvement of 21.3%. However, when considering a shorter time period of seven days, the consensus mark for first-quarter earnings remains stable.Furthermore, analysts polled by Zacks expect first-quarter revenues to come in at $10.41 billion, reflecting an increase of roughly 8.2% on a year-over-year basis.Given this backdrop, let’s delve deeper to unearth the factors that are likely to influence the company’s first-quarter results:As noted above, oil prices have been on an uptrend lately and were up approximately 8% in the January-March period. We note that high oil prices do not bode well for companies in the airline space as fuel costs account for a significant chunk of their expenditures.Given the inversely proportional relation between oil prices and airline stocks, this increase in crude prices is expected to hurt American Airlines’ bottom-line in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Average fuel price per gallon (consolidated jet fuel, including taxes) is estimated in the range of $2.08-$2.13 for the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.10 lies within the guided range. Fuel price was $1.91 per gallon at American Airlines in the final quarter of 2017.Fuel prices apart, expenses on the labor front are also expected to limit first-quarter bottom-line growth. Non-fuel unit costs are anticipated to increase 3% year over year in the first quarter of 2018.However, American Airlines is expected perform well on the unit revenue front in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. The carrier expects total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM: a key measure of unit revenues) to increase between 3% and 4% year over year in the first quarter backed by strong demands for air travel and improving yields. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter TRASM (consolidated) is pegged at 15.76 cents, higher than 15.74 cents, unveiled by the company, in the fourth quarter of 2017. Moreover, pre-tax margin (excluding special items) is anticipated between 4% and 5%.American Airlines Group Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  American Airlines Group Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | American Airlines Group Inc. QuoteWhat Does Our Model Say?Our proven model does not show conclusively that American Airlines will beat earnings in first-quarter 2018. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. However, that is not the case as highlighted below.Zacks ESP: American Airlines has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 74 cents per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: American Airlines carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.

(SAVE  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.46% and a Zacks Rank of 3. The company will release first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26.Copa Holdings, S.A.

599,CHRW,"Return on equity is one of the most coveted metrics by investors. The metric enables investors to differentiate between a profit-churner and a profit-burner. It is a profitability ratio that measures the earnings that a company generates from its equity.To shortlist these gems, one can look at the DuPont technique to analyze basic ROE at an advanced level. Here is how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components:ROE = Net Income/EquityNet Income / Equity = (Net Income / Sales) * (Sales / Assets) * (Assets / Equity)ROE = Profit Margin * Asset Turnover Ratio * Equity MultiplierWhy Use DuPont?Although one can’t play down the importance of normal ROE calculation, the fact remains that it doesn’t always provide a complete picture. The DuPont analysis, on the other hand, allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE. It can help investors to segregate companies having higher margins from those having high turnover. For example, high-end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods, which rely on higher turnover.In fact, it also sheds light on the company’s leverage status, which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains. A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt. Thus, the strength of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt load.So, an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio. This is where DuPont analysis wins over and spots the better stock.Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company’s financials.However, looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task. Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis.Screening Parameters• Profit Margin more than or equal to 3: As the name suggests, it is a measure of how profitably the business is running. Generally, it is the key contributor to ROE.• Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2: It allows an investor to assess management’s efficiency in using assets to drive sales.• Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3: It’s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets.• Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environment.• Current Price more than $5: This screens out the low priced stocks.

606,CHRW,"C.H. Robinson Worldwide Inc. (CHRW  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 30 after the market closes.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.7% with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. However, the bottom line decreased 5.6% year over year due to higher costs and a lackluster performance of the truckload and intermodal divisions. Total revenues rose 12.8% owing to volume growth across all transportation services of the company.Let’s see, how things shape up for this earnings season.Factors at PlayThe company is struggling with rising costs. High costs are expected to hurt the company's bottom line in the fourth-quarter as was the case in the third quarter of 2017.Further, sluggish growth at the truckload and intermodal divisions may hamper results in the yet-to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for intermodal (part of the transportation sector) revenues stands at $7.46 million, below $7.52 million a year ago.Additionally, the company’s high-debt levels may affect results in the quarter.However, the company’s efforts to reward shareholders through dividends and share buy backs are impressive. In December 2017, the board of directors of the company approved a 2.2% hike in its quarterly cash dividend to 46 cents per share (or $1.84 annually).Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that C.H. Robinson is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: C.H. Robinson has an Earnings ESP of -1.01% as the Most Accurate estimate stands at 84 cents per share while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 85 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: C.H. Robinson carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company needs a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. Hence, this combination leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.C.H.

607,CHRW,"Benchmarks closed in negative territory on Thursday following concerns over a likelihood of a government shutdown. Sectors like real estate and utilities, which are considered as alternatives to bonds, declined after yield on 10-year Treasury notes reached its highest level since 2014. Additionally, increase in U.S. gasoline inventories and sharp rise in domestic crude production weighed on oil prices, which in turn led the energy sector downward.How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) decreased 0.4%, or 96.32 points to close at 26,115.65. The S&P 500 fell 0.2% to close at 2,798.03. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,296.05, losing 2.23 points. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 2.6% to close at 12.22.

On Nasdaq, a 1.74-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.Shutdown Specter Weighs on BenchmarksAfter closing at new all-time highs on Wednesday all the three key U.S. indexes fell on Thursday following concerns of partial government shutdown.  On Thursday, the House voted 230 to 197 in favor of passing a short-term spending bill, in order to avoid government shutdown. However, the bill is expected to face a setback in the Senate, which in turn raised concerns of a possible government shutdown. Following this development, nine of the 11 key S&P 500 sectors fell during the day.Higher rate environment and optimism of a steady economic growth weighed on bond prices. Lower bond prices supported the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, which increased from 2.579% to 2.611% on Thursday, reaching its best level since September 2014. Higher treasury yields weighed on steady dividend paying sectors like real estate and utilities.The Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE) declined 1%, becoming the worst performing sector of the S&P 500. Some of its key holdings, including Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report) and American Tower Corporation (AMT  -  Free Report) fell 1.9% and 1.1%, respectively. Additionally, the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) decreased 0.6%, with its two major components Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) and NextEra Energy, Inc.

Also, U.S. crude production increased 258,000 barrels per day to 9.75 million barrels, after falling in the preceding week. Increase in gasoline inventories and stronger domestic crude production led both WTI and Brent crude to decrease 0.03% and 0.1% to $63.95 per barrel and $69.31 a barrel, respectively.Fall in oil prices led the Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) to decline 0.8%, which was second biggest loser among the S&P 500 sectors.

608,CHRW,"Shares of C.H. Robinson Worldwide (CHRW  -  Free Report) gained 21.6%, outperforming the industry’s rally of 9% in 2017.What’s Behind the Uptick?The company’s efforts to reward shareholders through dividends and share buy backs are impressive.  In November 2017, the board of directors approved a 2.2% hike in its quarterly cash dividend to 46 cents per share (or $1.84 annually). Also, C.H. Robinson has an impressive dividend payment history.Investors always prefer an income-generating stock. Hence, a high dividend-yielding one is obviously much coveted. It goes without saying that investors are always on the lookout for companies with a track record of consistent and incremental dividend payments to put their money on.Furthermore, C.H. Robinson’s efforts to expand globally through mergers are encouraging. The acquisition of Milgram & Company, completed in August 2017, has boosted the company's global presence and will be accretive in the current year. In 2016, it acquired APC Logistics as well. This deal has boosted C.H. Robinson’s presence in the Australia- New Zealand region.New Tax Regime is a PositiveOn Dec 22, President Trump signed the much-anticipated tax bill into law (Tax Cut and Jobs Act). The $1.5 trillion tax overhaul package reduces corporate taxes from 35% to 21%. The significant reduction in corporate tax rate is likely to aid C.H. Robinson, for which the effective tax rate was 34.2% in the first nine months of 2017.Moreover, companies like C.H. Robinson spend significantly for capital expenditures. In the new regime, these companies will be able to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income immediately, which was not allowed earlier. As a result, their annual tax bills would be lowered significantly owing to higher deductions. This, in turn, will leave more cash in the hands of these companies to fund their capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases, among others.In fact, the new tax regime is not only a positive for C.H. Robinson but other transportation players like Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) as well. Evidently, Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) and American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report) announced bonuses worth $1,000 per employee, following the tax overhaul.Earnings Estimates on an Upswing at C.H. Robinson Upward estimate revisions reflect optimism in a stock’s prospects. C.H. Robinson scores impressively on this front as well. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year 2017 and 2018 earnings being revised 1.8% and 4.8% upward, respectively, over the last 90 days.Taking into account the above-mentioned tailwinds, we believe that the current price represents an attractive entry point for investors.

612,CHRW,"Shares of GOL Linhas Aereas Inteligentes S.A. (GOL  -  Free Report)) have surged more than 100% in a year, outperforming the industry ’s gain of 11.2%. The carrier recently increased guidance for 2017 owing to the impressive third-quarter earnings numbers and the robust traffic figures till September. The airline’s improved operating and financial performance plus focus on capacity discipline were among other factors responsible for its revised outlook.The company now expects earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margin — a measure for its earnings ability — around 9% (previous guidance had projected the metric between 7% and 9%). The guidance for EBITDA margin stands at approximately 14% (previous guidance had projected the metric between 12% and 14%). The carrier expects capacity (available seat kilometers) to be nearly 0.5% (previous guidance had projected the metric to either remain flat or decline at the most 2% on a year-over-year basis).Another important metric, load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers), is now projected to be around 79% (previous forecast had the metric in the range of 77-79%). Going forward, we expect the company’s focus on capacity discipline to result in increasing yields.The carrier’s outperformance in the third quarter is very encouraging. Earnings per share of $1.49 outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 47 cents, aided by higher revenues. Net sales came in at $858.8 million (R$2.7 billion), surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $783.3 million. The top line expanded 13.2% on the back of a strong demand for air travel. Passenger revenues accounting for the bulk of the top line increased 14.1% year over year.The carrier’s October traffic figures also raise optimism in the stock. Load factor in the month rose to 80.6% from 76% in October 2016. The metric improved as traffic growth exceeded capacity expansion.The steps taken by the carrier to overcome its struggles also hold promise. The carrier has been undergoing a thorough restructuring process and is also making constant efforts to reduce debt levels. This should bode well for its strong revival in the near term.In light of these positives, we believe investors should retain GOL Linhas stock for now.Zacks Rank & Key PicksGOL Linhas carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

However, economists have clearly stated that they do not expect the Fed to make any changes to existing monetary policies.A White House official stated on Monday that President Trump would announce his decision regarding who he has chosen as the next Fed Chief on Thursday.

615,CHRW,"C.H. Robinson Worldwide Inc. (CHRW  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 31, after the market closes.In the second quarter of 2017, this transportation company’s earnings per share of 78 cents fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 90 cents. Also, the bottom line decreased 22% year over year due to higher costs and lacklustre performance of the truckload division.Total revenue improved 12.4% year over year to $3,710 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,590 million.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this earnings season.Factors to ConsiderWe expect C.H. Robinson’s third-quarter results to be hurt by increased costs. Moreover, the company is looking to drive growth through acquisitions. Though positive on the strategy, we note that costs associated with the acquisitions weigh on the bottom line.In the soon-to-be reported quarter, C.H. Robinson acquired Milgram & Company, in a bid to expand its global network. Costs associated with the integration process are likely to hurt the bottom line.The transportation unit (comprising truckload, intermodal, less-than-truckload, ocean, air, customs and other logistics services) of the company is likely to disappoint primarily due to weaknesses in the truckload and intermodal sub-groups.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues from the truckload sub-group is pegged at $286 million, much lower than the $309 million reported in the third quarter of 2016. The same from the intermodal sub-group is pegged at $7.5 million, lower than the $7.8 million reported a year ago. The presence of alternative lower cost trucks is likely to hurt intermodal opportunities.The sourcing unit is, however, expected perform impressively in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues from this division is pegged at $31.31 million, higher than the $29.82 million reported a year ago. We are impressed by the company’s efforts to reward shareholders through dividends and share buy backs. An update on the issue is expected on the third-quarter conference call.What Does Our Model Say?Our proven model too does not show that C.H. Robinson will beat earnings in third-quarter 2017. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) — for this to happen. However, that is not the case as highlighted below.Zacks Rank: C.H. Robinson carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Zacks ESP: C.H. Robinson has an Earnings ESP of -0.29%, which acts as a spoiler. The Zacks Rank combined with a negative Earnings ESP leaves the surprise prediction inconclusive. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Conversely, we caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the broader Transportation sector may consider Expeditors International of Washington, Inc.  (EXPD  -  Free Report), Triton International Limited (TRTN  -  Free Report) and LATAM Airlines Group (LTM  -  Free Report) as our model shows these possess the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the quarter.Expeditors has an Earnings ESP of +1.68% and a Zacks Rank #3.

616,CHRW,"Return on equity (ROE) is one of the most-favored metrics of investors. It is a profitability ratio that measures earnings generated by a company from its equity. Investors can follow the ROE trend in companies and compare this to historical or industry benchmarks to pick a winning stock.However, stepping beyond the basic ROE and analyzing it at an advanced level could lead to even better returns. Here is where the DuPont analysis comes into play.It is an analytical method, which examines three major elements, namely operating management, management of assets and capital structure to find out the financial condition of a company. Below we show how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components:ROE = Net Income/EquityNet Income / Equity = (Net Income / Sales) * (Sales / Assets) * (Assets / Equity)ROE = Profit Margin * Asset Turnover Ratio * Equity MultiplierWhy Use DuPont?Although one cannot brush off the importance of normal ROE calculation, the fact remains that it doesn’t always portray a complete picture. The DuPont analysis, on the other hand, allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE. It can help investors to segregate companies with higher margins from those having a high turnover. For example, high-end fashion brands generally survive on high margins compared with retail goods, which rely on a higher turnover.And one of the ROE components – equity multiplier (explained below) – can help you judge how burdened a company is with debts. A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt. Thus, the strength of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt load.So, an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio. This is where DuPont analysis wins over and spots the better stock.Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at a company’s financials. However, looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task. Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis.Screening Parameters• Profit Margin more than or equal to 3: As the name suggests, it is a measure of how profitably the business is running. Generally, it is the key contributor to ROE.• Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2: It allows an investor to assess management’s efficiency in using assets to drive sales.• Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3: It’s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets.• Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environment.• Current Price more than $5: This screens out the low-priced stocks.

Earnings (on an adjusted basis) improved 29.6% from the year-ago figure, while revenues increased 8.5% year over year.Let’s see how things shape up this earnings season.Factors at PlayThe back-to-back hurricanes (Harvey and Irma) have been a major dampener to railroad operations and Canadian Pacific was no exception. Rise in fuel costs from natural disasters have the potential to hurt the bottom line in the third quarter.With the automotive sector accounting for a significant revenue volume, softness in the same might limit the bottom-line growth in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Additionally, decreased revenues in other key segments like Sulfur and Fertilizer and Forest Products might further hurt results in the quarter.Also, Canadian Pacific is a highly leveraged company. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings being revised 2.9% downward over the last 60 days. This, in turn, reflects the negative sentiment surrounding the stock.However, the company’s cost-controlling efforts are expected to aid results in the quarter. Plus, its attempts to reward investors through share buybacks and raised dividend payments are impressive.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Canadian Pacific CSX is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

618,CHRW,"CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 earnings results on Oct 17, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 8.5%. The company’s impressive earnings history shows that it has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters with an average beat of 8.4%.Let’s see, how things shape up this earnings season.Factors at PlayBack-to-back hurricanes (Harvey and Irma) havedisrupted railroad operations and CSX is not spared the catastrophe either. Also, freight costs have skyrocketed following the natural disasters. With fuel costs on the rise, CSX’s bottom line is likely to be hurt in the third quarter.Sluggishness of the automotive unit is also a cause for worry in CSX’s case. With the automotive sector accounting for a significant chunk of revenues, softness in automotive volumes is but likely to limit the company’s bottom-line growth in this soon-to-be-reported quarter.Recently encountered service disruptions by the company also do not bode well for its future and might hamper results in the quarter.Further adding to its woes, CSX surfaces as a highly leveraged company. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings being revised 11.9% downward over the last 90 days and this in turn reflects the stock’s surrounding negative sentiment.Due to these headwinds, shares of the company have underperformed its industry in the last three months. The stock has declined 2.7% against the industry’s 0.6% gain.  However, improvement in coal volumes holds promise for CSX in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.

619,CHRW,"J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc. (JBHT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 13.Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 4.35%. The transportation company’s earnings of 88 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 92 cents. Total operating revenue increased 6.9% year over year to $1,726 million but marginally fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,733.1 million. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this earnings season.Factors at PlayJ.B. Hunt has been struggling with declining demands for quite some time now. Like the previous quarter, high costs may hurt the company’s third-quarter earnings too. Lower customer rates may further affect results in the earnings.Being a highly leveraged company, J.B. Hunt’s high-debt levels raise concerns. This is evident from the fact that its long-term debt-to-equity ratio (expressed as a percentage) is currently 67, comparing unfavorably with its industry’s figure of 33.8.Driven by downtrends, shares of J.B. Hunt have underperformed its industry in the last six months. The stock has gained 17.8% compared with the industry’s rally of 23.4% during the period.However, the company’s expansion efforts are appreciative. In July, the company had acquired Special Logistics Dedicated with potential to enhance e-commerce delivery capabilities. Its efforts to reward shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases also raise optimism.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that J.B. Hunt is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP of J.B. Hunt is -1.85% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged marginally lower at 96 cents per share than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, poised at 97 cents.

621,CHRW,"The Nasdaq notched up a record high on Thursday following a surge in biotech stocks. Meanwhile, benchmarks ended in the positive territory for the fifth consecutive month. A clutch of positive economic reports also boosted investor sentiment. Moreover, speaking on CNBC, U.S. Secretary of the State, Steven Mnuchin said the Trump administration has presented a detailed tax plan to the Congress which they expect to sign into law by the year end.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 21,952.35, gaining 0.3%.

The tech heavy index last registered a record close on Jul 26. The Nasdaq gained 63.05 during this session, increasing over 1% last month.  The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB) surged 2.8% increasing 4.5% over the month.Analysts commented that the rally in biotech stocks for the second consecutive day has boosted gains for the markets. This comes at a time when upward momentum exists despite sluggish volumes.. Consequently, Nasdaq has increased 19% year to date.Strong Economic Reports Propel Gains for the MarketStrong economic data ensured gains for the broad based markets on Thursday. Initial jobless claims increased by 1000 to 236,000 from the previous week. However, the figure fell marginally short of the consensus estimate of  237,000. The four-week moving average of new claims stood at 236,750, a decrease of 1,250 from the previous week’s revised average. This reading indicates that the economy has stabilized. Further, it is the second lowest level recorded since the middle of 2009.,Consumer spending improved by 0.3% for July as a result of higher incomes and low inflation rates.

Mnuchin also said that the plan has been presented to the Congress and White House expects to push through the policy by the year end.

Benchmarks ended in the green for the fifth straight month, with the Nasdaq gaining during nine of the past ten months. The blue-chip index briefly touched the psychological 22,000 milestone during the month. This was possible due to strong earnings from companies like Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report), JP Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report), 3M (MMM  -  Free Report), Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report). Boeing has added about 300 points to the blue chip index since February and helped it cross the psychological milestone.Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions between North Korea and U.S. heightened when the former threatened to attack the Guam naval and air base. President Trump responded to such statements by stating that any attacks by North Korea would be met with ’fire and fury’. Further, North Korea also tested a missile over Japan which again raised tensions between Pyongyang and Washington.Political instability also reduced market gains. Trump disbanded two advisory panels following a backlash from top CEOs in the country following his comments on the Charlottesville incident. Further, Trump also threatened to shut down the government if he did not receive funding for his proposed physical wall along the US-Mexico border. The much awaited Jackson Hole Symposium also failed to throw light on the future of monetary policies in the U.S. The fallout of Hurricane Harvey disrupted the oil industry in Houston, which houses 16% of the total refining capacity of U.S.Stocks That Made HeadlinesT-Mobile US Gears Up for 5G With 600-MHz LTE SitesNational provider of mobile communications services, T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS  -  Free Report) has been a pioneer in innovative network expansion methodologies.

The deal is worth approximately $62 million CAD (approximately $50 million USD). The buyout,expected to boost C.H. Robinson’s bottom line in 2018, will likely be financed via cash and funds from C.H. Robinson’s existing revolving credit facility. The buyout, however, is not projected to impact C.H. Robinson’s current-year earnings.Milgram BackgroundFounded in 1951, Milgram is a privately held company, headquartered in Montreal, Quebec. With six offices in Canada and one in the United States, the company comprises around 330 employees, serving nearly 3,500 customers.As an international freight forwarder, Milgram offers consulting, trade advisory, warehousing and distribution services. During the fiscal year ending May 31, 2017, the company had gross revenues totaling approximately $155.3 million CAD (approximately $124 million USD).Benefits of AcquisitionC.H.

623,CHRW,"Shares of C.H. Robinson Worldwide (CHRW  -  Free Report) have struggled this year, underperforming the industry it belongs to. The stock has been down 7.3% against its industry rally of 10% on a year-to-date basis. Why the Decline?Last month, the company reported lower-than-expected earnings per share in the second quarter 2017. Moreover, the bottom line decreased 22% year over year due to higher costs and lackluster performance of the truckload division.Total operating expenses increased 8.7% year over year to $391.97 million, resulting in an operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue) of 68.3% compared with 60.7% in the year-ago quarter. High costs are likely to hurt the bottom line in the near-term as well.In fact, the truckload segment performed miserably in the second quarter with segmental net revenues declining 14.3% year over year. Also revenues at the intermodal segment decreased 7.9% year over year as the presence of alternative lower cost trucks hurt Intermodal opportunities. We remain concerned about the company’s high debt levels. The company exited the second quarter of 2017 with only $273.2 million of cash and $750 million of long-term debt compared with $500 million recorded at the end of 2016. Also, C.H. Robinson is liable to be hurt by adverse foreign exchange movements as it operates globally.Certainly Not a Broker FavoriteDownward estimate revisions reflect pessimism in a stock’s prospects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings has moved down 11% to 81 cents per share in the last two months due to multiple downward revisions. For full-year 2017, the same descended 9% in the identical period to $3.25 per share.Given the wealth of information at the disposal of brokers, it is in the best interests of investors to be guided by broker advice and the direction of their estimate revisions. In fact, the direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock.Additionally, the stock has an unattractive VGM Score of C. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.In ConclusionTaking into account the above-mentioned headwinds and the unfavorable readings, we advise investors to get rid of the stock at the moment. Currently, the company’s Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) also suggests the same.Stocks to ConsiderMeanwhile investors interested in the broader Transportation space can consider some better-ranked stocks from the same space like SkyWest Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report), Ryanair Holdings plc ((RYAAY  -  Free Report)) and Canadian National Railway Company (CNI  -  Free Report). All three stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).
