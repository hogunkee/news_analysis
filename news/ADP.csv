11,ADP,"The stock market uptrend might be under pressure, but you wouldn't know it by looking at several top growth stocks in Tuesday's Stock Spotlight screen.Names like HealthEquity (HQY), Oasis Petroleum (OAS), Inogen (INGN) and China-based ZTO Express (ZTO) are testing support successfully after recent base breakouts.On a weekly chart, heavy-volume support at the 10-week moving average is always good to see after a breakout. It's often a sign that institutional investors are adding to a current successful position, or buying the stock for the first time.After a breakout from a base in early May, health savings account provider HealthEquity paid a visit to its 10-week line last week. It wasn't a convincing case of support, though, as shares fell nearly 7% for the week. Still, the stock closed in the top half of its weekly range, ending just above the 10-week line. Shares are up 2.5% so far this week.Houston-based oil and gas producer Oasis Petroleum is also showing decent action around its 10-week line. A bounce off the support level during the week ended June 22 was compelling, but volume was light. Shares slumped nearly 6% last week but held above the support level. As of Tuesday's close, Oasis was still holding above the 10-week line, but interested buyers should wait for a bounce off the line with conviction before pulling the trigger.Inogen, a maker of portable oxygen concentrators for patients with chronic respiratory conditions, is also holding support at the 10-week line after a breakout from a base in April. But an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of D- gives pause. The rating is hurt, in part, by a heavy-volume drop for Inogen during the week ended May 26.

U.S.-China fireworks begin Friday. A pair of sectors at high risk from a Trump trade war have been big losers. That includes Dow Jones industrials such as Boeing (BA) and Caterpillar (CAT), as well as automakers. Chipmakers slumping, with Intel (INTC), Nvidia (NVDA) and Micron Technology (MU) stocks all failed breakouts. Apple (AAPL) stock also coming under pressure, with its heavy exposure to China.Dow futures rose 0.7% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.6%. Nasdaq 100 futures were 0.6% higher.The Federal Reserve will release minutes from its June meeting at 2 p.m. ET. At that meeting, policymakers raised rates and signaled two more Fed rate hikes are likely this year, one more than previously expected. Investors will be looking to see how hawkish Fed members really are.Also Thursday: the ADP employment report will estimate June private-sector hiring, the Labor Department will release weekly jobless claims and ISM will issue its June nonmanufacturing index. Those all lead up to Labor's June employment report on Friday.But the big news Friday: President Trump is due to impose tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods, mostly tech and telecom products. China says it will immediately retaliate, dollar for dollar.In Tuesday's half-day session before the 4th of July holiday, the major stock market averages opened higher but reversed lower. Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%, but closed above its 50-day moving average. The S&P 500 index slid 0.5%, once again sinking below its 50-day line. The Dow Jones industrial average retreated 0.55% after rising intraday above its 200-day line.Micron stock triggered Tuesday's sell-off. A Chinese court barred Micron Technology from selling chips in the country, siding with Taiwan chipmaker United Microelectronics (UMC) in a patent fight. Rightly or wrong, investors took that Micron ruling as part of the U.S.-China trade war. China has been holding up approval of the Qualcomm (QCOM)-NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) deal until the U.S. lifts harsh sanctions on China telecom gear giant ZTE.In any case, Micron stock fell 5.5% Tuesday. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index retreated 1.8%, moving back below its 200-day line. Micron was indicated lower again Thursday.Chip stocks have been conspicuous laggards even as the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite hit new highs in June. Even Intel stock, Nvidia stock and Micron stock, which were outperforming the chip sector, have fallen well below buy points and their 50-day moving averages.U.S.-China trade war tariffs won't target semiconductors much at first. But the U.S. is wary of China of buying cutting-edge tech as Beijing seeks dominance via Made in China 2025. Beijing could continue to make life difficult for U.S. chipmakers working in China via regulatory hurdles. Longer term, the trend is toward a U.S.-China cold trade war in technology that would roil complex supply chains and cut off markets.China is a huge and growing market for Boeing jets. China could favor Airbus (EADSY) over Boeing in a trade war. Boeing was the top Dow Jones stock in 2017. Boeing stock recently triggered a sell signal and is trading below its buy point.Another Dow Jones component, Caterpillar stock, has fallen below its 50-day and 200-day lines.General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) reported solid U.S. sales Tuesday. But GM stock, Ford stock and their global peers are struggling as Trump threatens a global auto import tariff. That would trigger retaliation and raise supply chain costs as even U.S.-made cars and trucks tend to have high non-U.S. content.Apple, another Dow Jones stock, is also vulnerable to a prolonged U.S.-China trade war. China is a big market for the Apple iPhone and various services. Most Apple iPhones are made in China. A trade war could hit iPhone suppliers, China could hold up exports and threaten any number of actions to hinder Apple.Apple stock blasted out of a buy zone in a sharp rally from the end of April to early May. Strong earnings helped, fueled by fast-growing high-margin services as iPhone sales were so-so A huge buyback and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) buying more Apple stock also were big Apple stock drivers.But in recent weeks, Apple stock has been fading. It's now just modestly above a buy point. Shares are fighting for support at 50-day, closing just below that level Tuesday.So far stocks have largely retreated on trade war fears, even as hopes remain that the actual damage will be minimal. But on Friday, President Trump is open hostilities with tariffs on an initial $34 billion of Chinese goods. China has vowed to retaliate. Tariffs are slated to hit a further $16 billion in Chinese products soon.Trump has threatened tariffs on another $200 billion in Chinese goods, and then a further $200 billion.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:The Big Picture: Stocks Face This TestTrump China Tariff Decision Will Be Yuuuge For StocksThese 4 Top Stocks Have One Thing In Common  IBD Stock Of The Day Tests Buy Point After 19% Run

That was in line with the expected 2.5%, still the Goldilocks reading markets enjoyed throughout 2017.Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures moved higher after the jobs report, with the major indexes hitting record highs early Friday. The 10-year Treasury yield slipped after the jobs and wage data that bolstered the case for the Federal Reserve to go slow in hiking its key interest rate.The continuation of tepid average wage gains comes amid a recent surge in federal withheld employment and income taxes. Over the last couple of months, Americans' paychecks have been growing at nearly the best rate in a decade.The stronger tax receipts may reflect a sugar high padded by early Christmas bonuses — AT&T (T) and Comcast (CMCSA) were among the companies pledging $1,000 bonuses for hundreds of thousands of employees as tax legislation crossed the finish line.Meanwhile, a host of big banks including Wells Fargo (WFC), PNC Financial Services (PNC) and Fifth Third Bank (FITB) have announced a $15 minimum wage since tax cuts passed. Wells Fargo is hiking its base wage from $13.50 an hour, but those won't show up until later this year.To help boost recruitment in a tight job market, Target (TGT) hiked its minimum wage to $11 an hour from $10 in October, with plans to get to $15 an hour by the end of 2020. Target announced 100,000 seasonal hires, up from 70,000, while Amazon.com (AMZN) planned to add 120,000 seasonal jobs, same as a year ago.IBD'S TAKE: The surest way to keep from missing out if this bull market still has legs and to avoid piling up losses should a bear market take hold is to read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market trend, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.For the second straight year, Wal-Mart (WMT) said it would give employees more hours rather than hire seasonal workers, so longer workweeks on top of solid payroll gains could be padding paychecks. Wal-Mart last raised its base wage to $10 an hour in February 2016.Labor Department data showed that the retail sector shed 20,000 jobs in December. Nonstore retailers such as Amazon added just 200 jobs.The ADP employment report out Thursday indicated that 250,000 private-sector jobs were added in December. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, which helps produce the ADP report, credited a strong Christmas selling season.

45,ADP,"As President Trump and the GOP celebrate their $1.5-trillion-tax-cut victory, Americans' paychecks are growing like they haven't for a decade.X The big question is whether this is a sugar high padded by early Christmas bonuses — AT&T (T) and Comcast (CMCSA) were among the companies pledging $1,000 bonuses for hundreds of thousands of employees as tax legislation crossed the finish line — or the start of a sustainable pickup for wage growth and the economy, and Friday's jobs data may start to provide some early hints.Wall Street expects another solid payroll reading — thought not as robust as Thursday's ADP report showing a 250,000 rise in private-sector payrolls — with 190,000 nonfarm jobs added in December and the unemployment rate holding at a 17-year-low of 4.1%. Still, forecasters expect Labor Department data to show that the tepid 2.5% annual gain in average hourly wages continued last month.Yet federal employment and income taxes withheld from worker paychecks are telling a merrier story. Over the past 10 weeks, federal withheld taxes have surged 6.8% from the same period a year ago, an IBD analysis of Daily Treasury Statements finds. That's far faster than the 5% growth in tax receipts implied by 2.5% average wage gains and the roughly 2% growth trend in aggregate hours worked in the economy.A multitude of factors is likely contributing to the faster rise in aggregate pay. Faster wage growth, spurred by the tightening labor market, could be among them. Target (TGT) hiked its minimum wage to $11 an hour from $10 in October. A host of big banks including Wells Fargo (WFC), PNC Financial Services (PNC) and Fifth Third Bank (FITB) announced a $15 minimum wage after tax cuts passed, but those didn't take effect in time for December's jump in tax receipts. Wells Fargo hiked its base wage from $13.50 an hour.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, which helps produce the ADP employment report, attributed its strength to a strong Christmas selling season. ""Robust Christmas sales prompted retailers and delivery services to add to their payrolls.""Target's wage hike came as it was seeking to recruit 100,000 workers for the holidays. Meanwhile, for the second straight year, Wal-Mart (WMT) said it would give employees more hours rather than hire seasonal workers, so longer workweeks on top of solid payroll gains could be padding paychecks. Wal-Mart last raised its base wage to $10 an hour in February 2016.A bigger Christmas bonus season is likely part of the story. After a year of huge stock gains and in anticipation of tax cuts in 2018, it wouldn't be surprising if bonuses were running ahead of the prior year's pace. The year-end bonus season runs through March 31, the deadline for deducting them from the prior year's pretax profits. And tax receipts spiked at the end of bonus season last March, briefly sending the growth in tax receipts to levels not seen since 2007.Now tax receipts are again breaking above the trend that has prevailed for a decade. Yet, given the individual and corporate tax cuts, the logical time for companies to pay bonuses will be early in 2018. That will allow corporations to deduct them against 2017 profits, when they'll face a higher tax rate, yet allow individuals to recognize the income in 2018, when they'll face a lower tax rate.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Wal-Mart Near Possible Buy PointCongress OKs Trump Tax Cuts; These Companies Are Celebrating The MostFederal Reserve Gives Trump Tax Cuts A Green LightHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

52,ADP,"The number of people filing for unemployment benefits last week came in ""unexpectedly"" low. Instead of 240,000 claims, there were 236,000, which marked the third week in a row this number has dropped.That's not a big deal in the grand scheme of things. It's just one measure, after all, and the differences aren't huge.Except it adds to a pile of ""unexpectedly"" good economic reports that have been coming out these days.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveADP reported that payrolls ""unexpectedly"" climbed 190,000 in November, while analysts had predicted 185,000.Consumer confidence ""unexpectedly"" hit a 17-year high in November.Labor costs ""unexpectedly"" fell in the third quarter while productivity surged. Economists thought costs would edge up by 0.3%.Retail sales in October ""unexpectedly"" rose. Economists had expected them to be flat.These are pulled just from headlines of the past few weeks. But the trend started almost as soon as President Trump took office.Normally, it takes months for a new administration's economic policies to take effect. But there was a sharp surge in business and consumer optimism, and the stock market has been on an upward trajectory, since the day Trump got elected. The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index has been in positive territory for 15 months straight. What's more, Trump was able to take immediate executive action on regulations, which sent a signal to businesses, markets and consumers alike.Now it appears that overall economic growth for the entire year could be, you guessed it, ""unexpectedly"" high.On Friday, the government will release the unemployment figures for November. But at 4.1%, the unemployment rate is already ""unexpectedly"" low. The consensus was that unemployment would average 4.6% for the year, but it's been under 4.6% since March.X At the start of the year, economists were in widespread agreement that inflation-adjusted GDP would grow 2% to 2.3%. The National Association of Business Economists survey put it at 2.2%. The Congressional Budget Office predicted growth would be 2.3%, as did Trump's own economists.But annualized growth was 3.1% in the second quarter and 3.3% in the third. The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow measure, which includes economic data available for the fourth quarter up to this point, currently stands at 3.2%. If that holds for the quarter, then growth for the year would be above 2.3%. (It would also mark the first time the economy has put together three straight quarters of 3% or higher growth since 2005.)All of this marks a sharp turnaround from the past eight years when, under President Obama's economic stewardship, GDP growth never once came close to meeting the consensus forecasts.At the start of 2016, for example, the White House forecast 2.6% growth for the year and the CBO 2.7%. The actual number: 1.5%.Month after month during Obama's eight years in office, economic indicators kept coming in worse than expected.And after each disappointment, Obama would blame ""headwinds"" and promise that strong growth was just around the corner.So, let's review.Economists were continually overestimating growth under big-spending, high-taxing, regulatory-happy Obama, and underestimating growth under Trump's pro-business, tax-cutting, deregulatory policies.One might be tempted to conclude that these economists are either ideologically biased or pretty lousy at their jobs.At the very least, it gives one reason to be suspicious when these same economists warn that Trump's promise of 3% growth is ""unrealistic,"" or that the economy is close to ""overheating,"" or that tax cuts will only make things worse.RELATED:It's Official: Tax Cuts Will Grow The Economy — So Why Be Fixated On The Deficit?Trump Notches Another Win On Trade As China Slashes TariffsThe Coming Tax-Cut BoomMore Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

72,ADP,"Tax Reform: It's been clear from our economy's near-decade of underperformance that the U.S. is badly in need of a fiscal shot in the arm in the form of tax reform and tax cuts. After his speech to factory workers in Springfield, Mo., on Wednesday, President Trump has made it clear he expects Congress to do something big.XCalling on Congress not to miss a ""once-in-a-generation opportunity,"" Trump pushed for a massive tax overhaul that, he promised, would cut loopholes and simplify the tax code from its current labyrinthine complexity into one that is ""simple, fair and easy to understand.""""It's time to give American workers the pay raise that they've been looking for, for many, many years,"" he said.He stressed that corporate tax cuts are absolutely necessary to make the U.S. more competitive when it comes to being a place where things are made. The U.S. corporate tax rate of 35% is way higher than the OECD average of about 24%. Not only does that impede investment here in the U.S., but it encourages companies to take profits and hold the cash overseas to reduce their tax bills. As a result, U.S. firms by government estimates now hold roughly $2.6 trillion in funds overseas. Even getting a part of that massive cash pile to return to the U.S. in the form of investment could have a significant impact on jobs and wages, estimates show.""Ideally, and I say this to our Secretary of the Treasury, we would like to bring our business tax rate down to 15%,"" Trump said.As we've noted here before, National Economic Council chief Gary Cohn and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have been meeting feverishly with leaders in Congress to hammer out a plan. That may be the reason why Trump, in his speech, didn't provide a great deal of detail. But it's important that the American people and Congress now know that Trump is engaged and that this is a priority for him.But the promise of a flatter, fairer tax code that delivers relief to both middle-class Americans and to corporations has already seemed to buck up the lackluster economy that Trump inherited. Under President Obama, as has been noted, the economy's growth averaged just 2% or so. That's not enough to create jobs for the millions of people who have been sidelined since the Great Recession of 2007-2008.While the economy's not out of the woods yet, in recent months it has perked up, largely in anticipation of tax reform and repeal of ObamaCare. Getting rid of the ObamaCare albatross might not be politically doable this year; but tax reform definitely is.Consumers, financial markets and companies know this. That may be why GDP for the second quarter was revised up on Wednesday to an annual rate of 3%, the best performance in over two years, while payroll giant ADP estimated that 237,000 new private jobs were created during August. To top it off, the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow figure, which estimates current GDP growth weekly, well before government figures emerge, sees 3.4% GDP growth in the third quarter.The economy is primed and ready to grow. All it needs is a spark, and tax reform would provide just that.Yet, even before Trump spoke, the usual suspects were at it again, savaging the notion that U.S. corporations needed any tax cuts at all. Both the New York Times and the Washington Post, arguably still our newspapers of record, questioned whether tax cuts create jobs.Well, the record is so clear on that. Every major tax reform that included tax cuts has been followed by a period of strong growth for jobs and the economy. There's no reason to believe this time will be any different. A 2015 Tax Foundation study estimated that cutting the corporate tax rate to 15% would boost GDP by 3.7% over 10 years.More importantly, it would have a major impact on jobs, the study said. ""The increase in investment from a corporate tax rate cut would lead to higher wages, more jobs, and a larger economy,"" wrote economist Andrew Lundeen.As for the idea that tax cuts ""cost the government,"" the government doesn't pay taxes. You do. But guess what? A boost in economic growth from 2% to 3% would raise tax revenues by as much as $3 trillion over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office, while also reducing debt as a percentage of GDP.So, contrary to what the economic gloomniks say, tax reform is both fiscally responsible and a job creator.But there will almost certainly be a big battle over this, with Democrats once again arguing that anything that simplifies and lowers taxes is really a ""giveaway to the rich.""Well, tax reform can be popular, if it's truthfully sold to the American people. When our IBD/TIPP Poll asked voters about tax reforms last May, some 55% said they supported cutting the business rate to 15%, while 66% supported tax cuts for families. Another 75% supported slashing taxes on repatriated profits from overseas, to get companies to reinvest that money in the U.S.""Put the partisan posturing behind us and come together as Americans, to create the 21st century tax code that our people deserve,"" Trump said. ""What could possibly be more bipartisan than helping people keep more of what they earn?""Average Americans know this is a big chance to get the economy moving again. Trump is now showing he's on board and making this a priority. If Congress is smart, as Trump suggested, it won't let this chance go by.RELATED:Never Mind The Gimmicks, We Need Real Tax Reform The Big Three Tax Cut Lies That Democrats Keep Telling When It Comes To Tax Reform, Keep It Simple, Stupid For Market Lists To Help You Invest Your Savings

Now the billionaire hedge funder is turning his blue-eyed gaze toward payroll firm Automatic Data Processing (ADP).XAckman's Pershing Square Capital is seeking control of five of ADP's 10 board seats, said ADP in a Friday statement.ADP said Pershing first reached out on Tuesday, and Ackman — who beneficially owns 8% of the payroll processor — asked the company to extend its Aug. 10 board nomination deadline by 30 to 45 days to nominate five directors, including himself, to ADP's board. Ackman also told ADP that CEO Carlos Rodriguez ""should be replaced.""But ADP is pushing back, touting its total shareholder return of 202% since Rodriguez took the helm and contrasting it to Pershing's return of 29%.""ADP is open to constructive input from our shareholders, and our Board respects the right of shareholders to nominate directors,"" said the company. ""However, ADP has a clearly defined Board nomination process, and the 2017 deadline for director nominations has been public for nearly a year. The Board has unanimously determined that it is not in the best interests of ADP or its other shareholders to accede to Pershing Square's last-minute request for an extension.""The current board has ""an effective balance of leadership continuity and fresh perspectives"" that will help ADP to further its goals, said the statement.ADP shares rose about 2% initially but closed down 0.3% to 111.39 in the stock market today. Peers Paycom Software (PAYC), Paychex (PAYX) and Paylocity (PCTY) did react much.Ackman's quests are well known. He took his bet on drugmaker Valeant all the way to the bottom, more or less, holding on to Pershing Square's stake until March of this year, despite a 2015 price-spiking scandal that drove off other hedge funds. Pershing Square was reportedly offered 11.10 to 11.40 each for shares that, at their late 2015 high, traded at 263.81.He also has a billion-dollar bet against multilevel marketing firm Herbalife, alleging that the nutrition supplement seller is a pyramid scheme. The Federal Trade Commission leveled a complaint against Herbalife last July that resulted in the company agreeing to fully restructure its U.S. business and pay consumers $200 million over charges that Herbalife deceived people into believing they could get rich quick by becoming distributors of its products.The ensuing FTC regulations have weighed on Herbalife, but shares are up over 35% so far this calendar year.A few weeks ago, Ackman joined Twitter.

Light sweet crude is down 16% this year, but Oneok is only down about 9%.West Texas intermediate crude oil was recently trading around $46.24 a barrel, up 2.5%.Earlier in the week, Raymond James analysts said the current weakness in oil is not based on market realities but on a misleading focus. Raymond James says U.S. inventory data since early March, when factoring in refined products, points to a bullish picture for oil.Other oil analysts disagree and have cut their outlook for crude oil prices. But Thursday, the Energy Information Administration reported a 6.3 million barrel drop in crude inventories for the week, catching analysts by surprise. This echoed a report late Wednesday from the American Petroleum Institute that also showed an unexpectedly sharp decline in oil inventories.Blue chips were flat to down.

83,ADP,"Competing drugs from AstraZeneca (AZN), Pfizer (PFE) and Clovis Oncology (CLVS) could ""muddy the waters"" for a bid on Tesaro (TSRO), an analyst said Thursday, a day after reports emerged that Tesaro could be on the sales block.X Late Wednesday, reports emerged that Tesaro could be seeking bids just two months after its ovarian cancer drug Zejula won Food and Drug Administration approval. But interest has been tepid, according to insiders cited by the Wall Street Journal.Janney analyst Debjit Chattopadhyay says AstraZeneca, Clovis and Pfizer are also working on similar drugs in a class called PARP inhibitors. Poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors appear to improve progression-free survival in patients with ovarian cancer.""Based on the multiple competitive data events and regulatory decisions, which could significantly alter the competitive landscape, we find the timing to be defensive and are not surprised by lukewarm interest,"" he said.In the near future, all three have data that could ""muddy the waters further,"" he said. If Clovis' Rubraca turns out to be as efficient as Tesaro's Zejula in ovarian cancer, Clovis could be better positioned in the market for patients who've already undergone one round of therapy.IBD'S TAKE: Tesaro stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 50, meaning it performs in the middle of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. It falls behind Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN), which has a CR of 97 out of a best-possible 99. Find the best-rated stocks at IBD Stock Checkup.Furthermore, AstraZeneca and Pfizer have data readouts later this year that ""all have implications for Tesaro,"" Chattopadhyay said. Outside PARPs as monotherapies, there's some research going into combining PARPs with immuno-oncology drugs.""Hence, an M&A at a significant premium to current valuation could translate into buyer's remorse down the road,"" he said.Chattopadhyay kept his neutral rating on Tesaro stock. In late-morning trading on the stock market today, Tesaro stock ended the regular trading day down incrementally to 149.22. AstraZeneca stock lifted 1.2% to 34.81. Clovis stock jumped nearly 7% to end the day at 55.21.

The Street expects 7% growth this year and then 16% in 2018.Among small caps, the iShares Russell 2000 (IWM) ETF rose 0.7% as it tried to retake its 50-day line. The small cap exchange-traded fund has been forming shallow bases since December. The fund has been a laggard, up about 2% so far this year.

The report showed slowing output and new orders, and quicker staff reductions in May, pressuring the sector into contraction for the first time in nearly a year. Markit releases its U.S. manufacturing index at 9:45 a.m. ET.In the U.S., the monthly Job Cuts Report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas showed layoffs up 41% in May, to 51,692.

87,ADP,"Futures for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite rose Thursday morning ahead of key U.S. economic data and amid a report showing Chinese manufacturing contracting. Four recent tech breakouts — Apple (AAPL) iPhone supplier Analog Devices (ADI), Micron Technology (MU), Marvell Technology (MRVL) and Paylocity (PCTY) — remain in buy range.X During Wednesday's session, the major averages reversed lower as oil prices fell and bank stocks tumbled. But while financials remained weak, the S&P 500 and other key index closed with slim losses, capping a solid tech-led month of May.Dow industrials futures rose fractionally vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures were up 0.1% while Nasdaq 100 futures climbed climbed 0.3%.Futures briefly pared most of their gains following the private-sector Caixin survey that showed Chinese manufacturing activity contracting for the first time in nearly a year. That follows slow-but-steady growth from official government data, out earlier in the week, that focuses more on state-owned enterprises.China's Shanghai composite slid 0.5% Thursday. Japan's Nikkei advanced 1.1%, ending a recent slide.In the U.S., investors will get the ISM manufacturing index, the ADP employment report and domestic auto sales for May, ahead of Friday's key jobs report.IBD'S TAKE: Chinese regulators, worried about soaring credit growth, are starting to crack down, having an impact on the world's No. 2 economy in short order. That's the focus of our latest cover story: ""Here's Why China's Latest Growth Scare Should Worry You.""Analog shares rose 2.4% to 84.80 on Tuesday, just moving beyond an 84.34 buy point. On Wednesday, the Apple iPhone supplier shares shot up as high as 90.49, but closed at 85.76, just a 1.1% gain and near session lows. That's not great action, and investors should be cautious. However, shares are well within the 5% chase zone from the entry point.What sparked Wednesday's big move? Analog Devices reported strong earnings and bullish guidance before the market open, though revenue was essentially in line.Analog Devices has been touted as a likely big winner from the upcoming Apple iPhone 8, due out later this year.As for Apple itself, shares dipped 0.6% on Wednesday, continuing to trade tightly over the last few weeks, close to record highs. Apple does not have a potential buy point current after a long run.Analog Devices has a best-possible 99 Composite Rating, which means it outperforms 99% of all stocks based on a variety of IBD proprietary fundamental and technical data. Big-time winners tend to have Composite Ratings of 95 or more near the start of their runs.Paylocity, the lone non-chipmaker highlighted here, is a cloud-based human resources software firm.Paylocity cleared a 45.71 buy point from a cup-with-handle pattern on May 25, and shares have remained above the entry since then. Shares fell intraday Wednesday but closed up 0.2% to 46.85.Other cloud-based HR software peers include Paycom (PAYC) and Workday (WDAY). Paycom has been hovering around a three-weeks-tight follow-on buy point, while Workday is modestly extended from a breakout. Workday, which competes against Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP), is expected to report a 220% EPS gain late Thursday.Paylocity has a 97 Composite Rating.The memory chipmaker cleared a 29.97 flat base buy point on Tuesday, then edged up 0.2% to 30.77 on Wednesday, still well within buy range. Industry demand and pricing is strong, boosting profits of other memory chip players such as Samsung Electronics and Western Digital (WDC).Micron's CR Rating is an 89, reflecting a poor run of earnings until recently. Memory chip makers' fortunes tend to be highly cyclical, so stocks often start to move on indications of improving industry fundamentals before big earnings come in. Micron is reporting strong results now.Marvell cleared a 16.82 buy point on May 25, then reported strong earnings after the closing bell that session. The next day, shares popped to just out of buying range, but shares have come back modestly this week to 17.24 on Wednesday.Marvell has a 92 Composite Rating.RELATED:The Big Picture: Techs Hot, But 2 Broad Sectors Are StrugglingHere's Why Bank Stocks Broke Key SupportThis Top Software Firm Has Flipped From Losses: 220% EPS Gain Seen ThursdayChip Stocks And Semiconductor Industry News3 Tech Leaders Near Highs As Earnings Loom: Investing Action Plan

88,ADP,"Companies added workers to U.S. payrolls at a steady pace in April with increases across industries, data from the ADP Research Institute showed Wednesday.Private payrolls climbed by 177,000 (forecast was 175,000) after a 255,000 gain in March that was revised from initial reading of 263,000. Goods-producing industries boosted head counts by 12,000. Service providers increased payrolls by 165,000.The private group's data on company hiring adds some color to Federal Reserve officials' discussions on the labor market Wednesday as they close out their two-day meeting in Washington. A strengthening labor market is pushing central bankers to proceed with further interest-rate increases this year as they also work to pare the Fed's $4.5 trillion balance sheet. The ADP figures have shown a spotty relationship with the government's monthly payrolls tallies, particularly in March when the group's reading was almost triple the Labor Department's gain in private employment.""Despite a dip in job creation, the growth is more than strong enough to accommodate the growing population as the labor market nears full employment,"" Ahu Yildirmaz, co-head of the ADP Research Institute. ""Looking across company sizes, midsize businesses showed persistent growth for the past six months.""Hiring in manufacturing rose by 11,000 following a 31,000 increase Business services added 72,000 jobs in April, the most in three years. Companies employing 500 or more workers added 38,000 to staff; payrolls rose by 78,000 at medium-sized businesses, or those with 50 to 499 employees; small companies boosted staffs by 61,000. Construction employment decreased 2,000, the only industry to show a decline, after strong job gains in the prior three months.

89,ADP,"Clovis Oncology (CLVS) stock toppled to a four-month low Thursday after the firm reported wider-than-expected losses, but analysts remained bullish on its ovarian cancer drug Rubraca, which topped views by $2 million.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Clovis finished the session down 3.6% to 51.36 after earlier falling as much as 5.6%, touching a low last seen in January. Still, Clovis stock is up 20% for the year following Rubraca's launch in December.The first quarter was Rubraca's first on the market. Rubraca sales crushed Wall Street's model, bringing in $7 million vs. the $5 million view. Rubraca is Clovis' first commercial product, and is being tested for treatment of prostate, breast and gastroesophageal cancers.Overall sales of $7.04 million beat the consensus view for $5.1 million, Janney analyst Debjit Chattopadhyay wrote in a note to clients. But adjusted losses of $1.33 per share missed his view for a 95-cent loss.Chattopadhyay raised his expectations for Rubraca sales in 2017 and 2018. He models $70.1 million for Rubraca in 2017, up from $57 million. For 2018, he boosted his outlook to $148 million from $142 million in revenue.Estimates for 2019 will depend on Clovis' ongoing trial, dubbed Ariel-3, and other front-line stories in the PARP inhibitor world. Poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) are enzymes used to repair damaged DNA. These drugs aim to inhibit those enzymes to treat ovarian cancer.IBD'S TAKE: Tesaro stock was the seventh-best performer in 2016 and led the biotech group among stocks that started the year above 10 and have a minimum daily trading volume of 10,000 shares. Can Tesaro keep up in 2017? Head to IBD Industry Themes for more.AstraZeneca's (AZN) Lynparza was the first PARP inhibitor approved. Clovis' Rubraca followed in December and Tesaro's (TSRO) Zejula was approved in March. PARP inhibitors could potentially be used to treat breast cancer based on genetic mutations common to both breast and ovarian cancers.Chattopadhyay is looking to compare the results of the Ariel-3 trial in patients with tumors that have the BRCA genetic mutation with Tesaro's trial, called Nova, of Zejula in patients with ovarian cancer. AstraZeneca's Solo-2 trial looked at Lynparza in BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer.""Our lack of conviction in the story hinges on the comparability of Ariel-3 vs. Nova,"" he wrote. ""Ariel-3 enrollment reflects a 'real-world population' and the data in the (BRCA mutation segments) are likely to be similar to Solo-2.""But the outcome for patients with different or no genetic mutations is unknown. Chattopadhyay kept his neutral rating on Clovis stock. Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young, on the other hand, is outperform rated with a 74 price target on Clovis stock.She is more bullish than Chattopadhyay, and raised her 2017 estimates for Rubraca sales to $78.5 million from $71.4 million. She assumes an 80% chance of success in the Ariel-3 trial.""If the data are positive, we expect investors may give further credit to first-line therapy and other indications like prostate,"" she said.RELATED:Tesaro Dives On 'Sticker Shock' For $177,000 DrugWhy Clovis' Advantage Might Squash Tesaro In Ovarian CancerTesaro Creeps Up On Rivals With Cancer Drug OK, But Merger Unlikely

91,ADP,"Major stock indexes stayed in the red in afternoon trading Wednesday as tech stocks lagged and Wall Street mulled a benign policy statement from the Fed.The Federal Open Market Committee was far from hawkish in giving an overall positive assessment of the U.S. economy, saying that the first-quarter GDP slowdown reported last week was temporary, while also noting that business investment has picked up the pace. Odds have been increasing lately for another rate hike at the June 13-14 meeting.The Nasdaq composite was down 0.5% but not because of Apple (AAPL), which recovered nicely from a 2% intraday drop. The tech index was weighed down, at least in part, by weakness in Akamai Technologies (AKAM), which plunged 16% on earnings.The S&P 500 eased 0.2%, while the Dow Jones industrial average was slightly up at 3 p.m. ET. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking very close to Tuesday's levels.Outperformers in the Dow included Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) with gains of around 1%. Benchmark crude oil was recently trading around $47.99 a barrel, up 0.7%.In the stock market today, Apple was in recovery mode after an early-morning drop. Shares eased 0.2%. Investors weighed an earnings beat alongside a sales miss as well as news of a raised dividend.Inside the IBD 50, Paycom Software (PAYC) jumped 3% after reporting another quarter of strong earnings and sales growth. Paycom, a provider of cloud-based human capital management software, is well extended after a base breakout in February.Other heavy-volume earnings gainers included Weight Watchers (WTW). Shares jumped 8.5% to 22.99 after the company reported a better than expected adjusted loss of 2 cents a share. Sales rose 7% to $329.1 million. The Oprah Winfrey-backed company ended the first quarter with 3.6 million subscribers, up 16% from a year earlier. Weight Watchers is following through nicely after a breakout from a cup-shaped base last week with a 19.96 buy point. Last week, the company announced that Mindy Grossman, CEO of the Home Shopping Network, would take over the CEO post in July, replacing Jim Chambers who resigned from the company last year.In economic news, the private sector added 177,000 jobs in April, slightly better than expected, according to the latest data from ADP. The news comes ahead of Friday's jobs report where nonfarm payrolls are seen rising 185,000 after job growth of just 98,000 in March.After the close, watch for earnings from Facebook (FB) and Tesla (TSLA). Facebook is extended after recently finding support at the 10-week moving average.

92,ADP,"X U.S. stocks looked to be set to take a well-deserved breather, posting minor losses early Tuesday following two weeks of strong gains. Yet key indexes still closed ahead as money flowed sharply into a select group of underperforming industries.The Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average all staged gains of around 0.1% to 0.2%. But small caps failed to take advantage of the late-hour rebound. The small-cap S&P 600 sank 0.4%, but it was down as much as 0.7% during intraday lows. The Russell 2000 slumped almost 0.6%.Volume rose sharply on both main exchanges. Tuesday's action on the Nasdaq appeared to be stalling, but it doesn't affect the overall distribution day count for that major index. Read more on this technicality in today's Big Picture column.At 1399, the Russell 2000 is clearly lagging the S&P 500, which finished Tuesday at 2391. The former is up 3% year to date, the latter up 6.8%.At least eight industry groups, many of them dwelling at or near the bottom of IBD's 197 group and subgroup rankings, belied the flat action of the major market benchmarks with gains of 2% or more.They included the hospitals (up 3.8%), cement and concrete (up 3.2%), department stores (up 2.7%), consumer loans (up 2.2%), coal (up 2.1%), and long-term medical care (up 2.1%). Meanwhile, two more struggling groups — discount and variety retail and clothing manufacturing — saw gains of  1.6%.Is it bargain-hunting? That may help explain part of it. But quarterly results are likely another major factor.Take Coach (COH), part of the apparel makers group. The stock shot more than 11% higher to 43.03. Shares leapt past a 41.80 buy point within a long saucer-with-handle pattern. That pattern is part of a long bottoming base. The buy point is derived from adding 10 cents to the March 30 intraday high of the four-week handle, or 41.79.Early Tuesday, the maker of luxury handbags, accessories and fashion clothing reported a 5% rise in fiscal third-quarter earnings to 46 cents a share, edging the consensus view by 2 cents. Revenue slipped 4% to $995 million. Coach has been focused on store closures and developing new products to promote the exclusive character of its products. Sales in the Stuart Weitzman designer-shoe business edged up 1% and gross margin improved to 62.1%, up 390 basis points. Coach had been reportedly pursuing a potential acquisition of rival Kate Spade (KATE), but is now said to be aiming at adding the Jimmy Choo collection of luxury-category women's shoes to its brand portfolio.As seen in a weekly chart, Coach shares have been in a deep freeze ever since topping at 79.70 in March 2012. Yet since the stock has carved out a nearly 10-month saucer base that features a stingy decline of 22% from the 43.71 peak, a good sign.Also, notice how since January of this year, Coach has logged seven up weeks in above-average weekly turnover and only one down week in heavy trade.Coach's Apparel-Clothing Manufacturing industry group is ranked a lowly 146th out of 197 industry groups for six-month relative price performance. That's slightly up from 164th six weeks ago. Yet the 28-member group shows just two companies with an RS Rating of 80 or higher, and both trade below 10 a share.When a stock has emerged out of a bottoming base pattern, it's not a surprise to see a low Relative Price Strength Rating. Prior to Tuesday's big gain, Coach showed a thin RS Rating of just 30, well off its nine-week high of 60 on a scale of 1 to 99.Among the other beaten-down groups that rebounded nicely Tuesday, Community Health Systems (CYH) of the Medical-Hospital industry group surged nearly 20% to 10.32, closing above the critical 10 level for the first time since late October. The Franklin, Tenn., firm reported a 70% drop in Q1 earnings to 7 cents a share. Revenue fell 10%. However, it beat profit views by 14%, and Q2 profit is seen rebounding 56% to 14 cents a share.Due to Tuesday's big gains, Community Health saw its RS Rating catapult from 70 to 92. Watch to see if that rating continues to rise or stay high in the near term. A 92 means Community Health now bests 92% of all stocks in IBD's database over the past six months.In the cement, concrete and aggregates industry group, Martin Marietta (MLM) gapped up and powered nearly 8% higher to 239.85 in volume that jumped 152% above average. The stock is now just 1% below a recent 52-week peak of 243.98. The stock has been basing for 14 weeks and has formed a saucerlike base with a 244.08 new entry.Martin Marietta's Q1 earnings fell 3% to 67 cents a share, but that followed an 886% leap in adjusted profit in the year-ago quarter. It crushed Wall Street's consensus view of 40 cents. Revenue rose 7% to $844 million.Martin Marietta was formerly part of Leaderboard, but its Jan. 25 breakout past a 236.51 entry failed to bear fruit. Leaderboard currently shows nine long growth-stock plays and features annotations on daily and weekly charts to identify proper buy points and signals of heavy institutional buying or selling.In economic news, April U.S. car sales disappointed the Street at an annualized rate of 16.9 million units, well below the Econoday forecast of 17.2 million. Some automakers got drilled. General Motors (GM) slid 3% to 33.20, diving well below its long-term 200-day moving average. Volume shot 60% above its 50-day average. With a 40 RS Rating on a scale of 1 to 99, GM is outrunning only 40% of all publicly traded companies over the past 12 months.The car sales data followed a lower-than-expected reading on the U.S. manufacturing landscape. On Monday, the ISM survey for April came in at 54.8, below the consensus view of 56.5 but still indicating expanding activity in the nation's factories.On Wednesday, keep an eye out for the ADP private-sector jobs report for April (Econoday sees a 170,000 lift in payrolls) and the nonmanufacturing ISM services survey (seen at 55.8).The Federal Reserve's latest meeting on interest rates started today and is expected to finish Wednesday amid little fanfare. According to CME Group, the activity among fed funds rate futures traders shows that there is a 95% probability that the key rate on overnight bank loans will remain in the 0.75%-1% target range.RELATED:Stock Market Today: Will These 10 Top Growth Names Win Big In 2017?The Case For A New Bull Market In GoldHow To Find Great Breakouts: Check The Stocks Near A Buy Zone Weekly FeatureHow To Spot Group And Sector Rotation: Use IBD's 197 Industry Groups TableIBD Big Picture: Fed Minutes Spook Stocks; Which IBD 50 Names Should You Sell?

93,ADP,"Companies  added workers to U.S. payrolls in March at the fastest pace since December 2014 on solid gains in construction and manufacturing and at small businesses, data from the ADP Research Institute in Roseland, New Jersey, showed Wednesday.Private payrolls climbed by 263,000 (forecast was 185,000) after a 245,000 gain in February that was revised lower from initial reading of 298,000. Goods-producing industries, which include manufacturers and builders, increased headcounts by 82,000 after a 100,000 gain, the strongest two months in data going back to 2002. Service providers boosted payrolls by 181,000 after a 145,000 increaseBusinesses continue to retain as well as take on more workers to meet demand, helping to sustain the progress that has put the labor market at or near the Federal Reserve's maximum-employment objective. The ADP figures, as they did last month, may spur economists to boost estimates for private jobs in Friday's release of the Labor Department's monthly payrolls report. Before the ADP data, the Bureau of Labor Statistics report was projected to show a gain of 170,000 non-government, non-farm jobs following a 227,000 advance.""Job growth is off to a strong start in 2017. The gains are broad based but most notable in the goods-producing side of the economy including construction, manufacturing and mining,"" Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics Inc. in West Chester, Pennsylvania, said in a statement. Moody's produces the figures with ADP.Hiring in construction rose by 49,000 following a 59,000 increase, the biggest two-month gain since 2006 Factories added 30,000 workers after a 33,000 gain in February, the strongest two month-advance since 2010 Companies employing 500 or more workers increased staffing by 45,000 jobs; payrolls rose by 100,000 at medium-sized businesses, or those with 50 to 499 employees; while small companies' payrolls jumped by 118,000, the most since June Education jobs fell by 32,000 and information positions declined by 10,000, the only two categories to show declines

94,ADP,"U.S. stock indexes posted moderate gains Wednesday afternoon, and the Nasdaq touched a new 52-week high but backed off slightly from the peak.The Nasdaq was up 0.6%, holding near its new high. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average spurted 0.7% and 0.8% respectively. Volume was running emphatically higher on both major exchanges.The bullish action raised legitimate questions on whether or not the pressure was off the uptrend. To answer that question, wait to see how and where the Nasdaq closes.The strength of the market involved a mix of groups Wednesday afternoon. The day's leaders, and strong performers within the group, included transportation equipment (Greenbrier (GBX), up 12%), oil and gas royalty trusts (BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust (BPT) up 5% and with a dividend yield of 11%), restaurants (Panera Bread (PNRA) on merger news), hospitals (HCA Holdings (HCA), up 1.5%) and construction mining equipment (Caterpillar (CAT), up 1.8%).Most of the winners had a story to tell.Railcar provider Greenbrier reported quarterly results, beating analysts' consensus views on revenue and earnings. RailwayAge magazine reported that Greenbrier won a new railcar lease agreement worth $1 billion. The company also raised its quarterly dividend from 21 cents to 22 cents a share.The oil royalty trust stocks have advanced with the recent price increase of crude oil. Light sweet crude notched a low of $47.01 a barrel March 22 and then rose about 9% to more than $51 a barrel. The oil royalty group popped almost 10% in the same period.Panera Bread is now sitting on startling gains since breaking out Feb. 8 after a stronger-than-expected earnings report. The gap-up buy point at the open that day was 220.59. With Wednesday's news that private equity firm JAB Holdings would buy the midcap restaurant chain, Panera's stock zoomed 13% higher and is now 41% above the gap-up entry.IBD'S TAKE: If the right conditions are met, the gap-up gain is one of the least risky stocks an investor can buy.HCA and the hospital stock group fell 8% and 10% respectively in the run-up to the RyanCare no vote. The bill was pulled without a vote March 24. Since then, the hospital stocks have trimmed about half the pullback. The Republicans are trying to unite the party behind a new attempt to repeal ObamaCare. The likelihood of success remains unclear.Caterpillar rolled 2% higher Tuesday and 1.8% Wednesday afternoon. The construction and mining equipment group is a laggard, but Caterpillar is only 3% off its high as it works on a shallow pattern.In economic news, the ADP employment report for March obliterated the Street's consensus number. The payroll increase reached 263,000, or 55% more than expected. The number was also about a third higher than the highest estimate in the range.On the downside, the PMI Services Index rolled in at 52.8 vs. expectations for 53.8. The ISM Non-Manufacturing Index also missed — 55.2 vs. views for 57. The Institute for Supply Management surveys 375 firms, while the PMI surveys more than 400 companies.RELATED:Think The Chips Are Done? Check Out These ChartsJobs Data Gives Boosts To Small Caps, ETFs

95,ADP,"Some of America's most venerable tech companies aim to renew growth by breaking up.The jury is still out on whether that will work for Conduent (CNDT), which has a long road ahead, analysts say. Separated from Xerox (XRX) in January, Conduent helps other companies get their financial house in order in the field known as business process outsourcing.Some analysts say Conduent aims to build a more competitive business. Others contend it could be a more attractive takeover target down the road. Its results have been lackluster of late, though the company's outlook indicates a growth path ahead.Complicating matters is activist investor Carl Icahn, who has a piece of Conduent. The big question is what will happen if its turnaround starts clicking.""We think Conduent is an unlikely (merger) target,"" Keith Bachman, a BMO Capital Markets analyst, said in a recent report. ""We don't think any of the established BPO leaders, such as Accenture (ACN), IBM (IBM) or Genpact (G), have any interest in acquiring Conduent, given its focus on the low end of the market.""But others say a sell-off could come piecemeal.""(Chief Executive Ashok) Vemuri may choose to divest/sell portions of the business that are either 'noncore' or less profitable,"" said Frank Atkins, a SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst, in a recent note to clients. ""While this would have impact on top-line trajectory on a reported basis, it is a quick way to drive margin as well as restore balance-sheet powder for strategic investment. In our view, this could be in low-margin, more commoditized work, or in certain geographies which may not be of adequate scale.""In investor meetings, Vemuri has outlined plans to increase its sales force, invest in digital technologies such as data analytics, and focus on North America and Europe as core markets.What the company also wants to do is exit low-margin contracts and pursue new deals with better pricing. It aims to migrate toward higher-value-added work rather than being a soup-to-nuts services provider.""The core philosophy now is to drive a more repeatable, scalable and predictable business,"" Vemuri said on Conduent's fourth-quarter earnings call in February.  ""We are not in the business of trying to capture a headline by doing a big deal that we do not even understand how to start working on.""Regardless of what awaits the company, the split/merger strategy isn't unfamiliar. Silicon Valley stalwart Hewlett-Packard in 2015 split into two publicly traded companies: Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) to focus on services and products for businesses, and HP Inc. (HPQ) to focus on PCs and printers.HPE in early April took a step further, spinning off its enterprise services businesses. But that entity merged with IT consulting firm Computer Sciences to create DXC Technology (DXC), now a rival of Conduent.Whether Conduent pursues a strategic direction similar to HP's remains to be seen. Xerox stock gapped up on Jan. 3, the day the spinoff was completed, and is up about 8% this year. Xerox is set to launch a slew of new products, aiming to spur revenue growth in the back half of 2017, analysts say.The move to split from Xerox was endorsed by Icahn, who built up a stake in the copy machine maker.Icahn now holds a nearly 10% stake in Conduent and picked three members of its board of directors. So he figures in whatever strategic options Conduent is looking at, analysts say.IBD'S TAKE: Conduent hasn't been a publicly traded company for long, but it's already is forming a cup-with-handle base that could lead to higher stock gains. Read here for more information on stocks forming cup bases.As its own entity, Florham Park, N.J.-based Conduent handles such services for businesses as state Medicaid payments, tollbooth collections, and other transactions.Along with Accenture, IBM and Genpact, a number of other business process providers compete with Conduent. They include Convergys (CVG), ExlService (EXLS) and WNS Holdings (WNS), as well as large multinational tech service providers including Automatic Data Processing (ADP), Cap Gemini (CGEMY), and the new DXC Technology.The worldwide BPO market is growing about 5% annually, says Citigroup. In 2018, it's expected to reach $197 billion, from $188 billion in 2017.As it grows, CEO Vemuri aims to provide multiple services to customers rather than spread out too thinly.""The thing we have to work on is to take various service capabilities, find the common thread between them, and sell (services) as a bundled solution,"" he said on Conduent's earnings call.Prior to joining Conduent last year, Vemuri was chief executive of iGate, an information services firm. France-based Cap Gemini acquired iGate for roughly $4 billion in 2015. Vemuri earlier worked at Infosys (INFY), an India-based consulting and tech services firm.Current results may not bode well for a takeover, though. Conduent's 2016 revenue fell 4% to $6.4 billion. Adjusted revenue in the December quarter fell 6.5% to $1.6 billion, below estimates.Conduent posted a fourth-quarter loss of $4.69 a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of 3 cents. Excluding a goodwill impairment charge and restructuring-related costs, Conduent said it earned an unadjusted profit of 29 cents per share vs. analysts' estimate of 23 cents. Analysts estimate that Conduent profit will rebound to 95 cents in 2018 from 75 cents this year. But it notched $1.06 in unadjusted profit last year.With a market valuation of some $3.2 billion, Conduent does not plan to repurchase shares or issue a dividend in the near term. Conduent has told analysts that if cost-cutting generates more free cash flow it could start making small acquisitions in 2018 to expand into new areas.Conduent has moved quickly to reduce its worldwide workforce to 91,000 as of Feb. 15, down from 96,000 at the end of 2016.While shares in Conduent are up about 7% since its spinoff from Xerox, Citigroup says one drag on Conduent stock has been that the company was not added to either the S&P 500 or midcap S&P 400 index post-spinoff, limiting its exposure to index investors.RELATED:Analysts Shoot Down Oracle-Accenture Deal; 'Why Buy The Cow?'

96,ADP,"XThe stock market pushed higher as the Nasdaq recorded a record high in early trading Wednesday after ADP reported a surprise jump in its private payroll estimate.After the strong early push, gains were beginning to slowly ebb across the major indexes. The Dow led with a 0.7% gain, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq followed up with 0.5% advances. Volume jumped across the board vs. the same time Tuesday.Action among the Dow industrial stocks was predominantly positive in the stock market today. Only one stock traded in negative territory, Cisco Systems (CSCO), which edged 0.2% lower. On the upside, McDonald's (MCD) paced the advancers with a 1.6% gain as the stock broke out of a cup-with-handle base with a 130.10 entry.Amazon's (AMZN) seven-day win streak continued in earnest on Wednesday as the stock jumped 1.3%. On Tuesday, the e-commerce giant claimed the 900 mark in heavy volume. Late Tuesday, Amazon intercepted the rights to stream ""Thursday Night Football"" games this season, taking them from Twitter (TWTR). Twitter shares fell 0.2% in early trading. Twitter shares remain 42% off the 52-week high and 80% off an all-time high recorded in the month after it went public in November 2013.Another FANG stock received bullish news as well: Netflix (NFLX) moved up 0.1% after international survey results compiled by Piper Jaffray indicated positive trends in seven international markets. The results led Piper Jaffray to reiterate its overweight rating on the streaming video company with a price target of 166.Panera Bread (PNRA) spiked near 14% after agreeing to a buyout by Luxembourg-based JAB for $7.5 billion. JAB is the owner of Caribou Coffee, Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, Keurig Green Mountain and Peet's Coffee & Tea.Among recent IPOs, Snap (SNAP) traded down 4% after receiving a neutral rating from BTIG, which said the social media company was fairly valued. The stock is forming an IPO base. Mulesoft (MULE) is also forming an IPO base, but this debutante is slightly closer to its entry at 26.02. Shares rose 2.7%.Among stocks breaking out, Essent Group (ESNT) broke out of a base with a 36.91 early Wednesday. The private mortgage insurer has sterling fundamentals and volume is tracking over 200% above average. Shares advanced 4.3%.Action within the IBD 50 was mostly positive in midday trading. On the upside, NetEase (NTES) rebounded 2.8% after Tuesday's break of the 50-day when growth concerns regarding the company's game business sent shares down 4%. Shares are hovering right back above the 50-day Wednesday.On the downside, medical company BioTelemetry (BEAT) slid 3.9%, while Inphi (IPHI) dropped 0.8%. Shares of BioTelemetry remain extended from a 24.20 flat-base entry, while Inphi looks to be adding a handle to its cup base.RELATED:ADP Says Companies In U.S. Added 263,000 Employees In MarchSnap Initiated At Neutral; Can It Out-Innovate Facebook?Amazon Scores Touchdown, Wins NFL Streaming Rights

97,ADP,"The U.S. economy added 98,000 jobs in March, as the jobless rate fell to 4.5%, the lowest since April 2007, the Labor Department reported on Friday.While Wall Street economists expected a 180,000-job gain, the tepid rise looks mostly like an effect of a record warm February followed by a Northeast snowstorm in mid-March. The bigger deal is the drop in the jobless rate, which Wall Street had expected to hold steady at 4.7%.The combination of a robust report on private hiring in March from payroll processor ADP, which estimated a 263,000 gain, and an extremely robust report on Friday from the household survey, suggests that the job market continues to be on a very firm footing.The payroll number comes from a survey of establishments, which — unlike the ADP report — can be thrown off by bad weather during the survey week. The unemployment rate comes from the household survey, which showed that the ranks of the employed rose by 472,000 last month after a 340,000 increase in February.Average hourly wages rose 0.2% to $26.14, matching the 0.2% increase expected. Hourly wages rose by 2.7% from a year ago, but that number looks like it could rise significantly by June. That's because March and April of 2016 saw the biggest wage gains last year, helped along by a big wage hike at Wal-Mart (WMT), so the comparison will be much easier by June.The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite turned modestly lower on the stock market today immediately after its release but rallied to close mostly flat as markets looked past the disappointing headline number to the labor market's underlying strength. The 10-year Treasury yield, which was lower before the report on a safety bid after the overnight U.S. bombing of a Syrian airfield, also recovered.Before Wednesday, the March jobs report didn't seem to be a big one. That's because markets already are pricing in a Federal Reserve rate hike in June. But Wednesday's revelation that Fed policymakers expect to begin unwinding the $4.5 trillion central bank balance sheet before year-end raised the stakes. Although markets initially reacted to the report as though it would keep pressure off the Fed, the opposite may be true.Outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas said on Thursday that companies announced plans for hiring 289,000 workers in the first three months of 2017, the biggest first-quarter hiring plans on record and more than 10 times the total in early 2016. Some of that may have been because President Trump has encouraged such announcements, even if some of the plans don't appear exactly new. Amazon (AMZN) said it will add 100,000 jobs by mid-2018, while Dow component Wal-Mart is adding 10,000 jobs this year.Other recent hiring announcements have come from Charter Communications (CHTR) and Halliburton (HAL), which is a big change from last year's job cuts for the oilfield services firm.IBD'S TAKE: The stock market's uptrend is under pressure, meaning investors should be more cautious in buying stocks and quick to cut losses. Read The Big Picture each day to stay on top of the market's trend.Minutes from last month's Fed meeting revealed that most policymakers ""judged that a change to the committee's reinvestment policy would likely be appropriate later this year.""Instead of continuing to reinvest all of the principal from maturing bonds, which keeps the balance sheet steady, the Fed would gradually let its portfolio run off, assuming the economy continues as expected.As explained by University of Oregon economist Tim Duy, the Fed seems to be signaling that it will tighten monetary policy at a pace roughly equivalent to a quarter-point rate hike every three months. That would mean another hike in September, before the Fed ""switches gears to balance-sheet reduction"" in December.Yet markets aren't currently pricing in another rate hike after June until December. Unless economic conditions soften, expect market pricing to speed up the timetable for rate hikes, as long as the labor market remains in good shape.Keep in mind that ""good"" is in the eye of the beholder. In early March, Fed Chair Janet Yellen noted that job growth of around 180,000 per month is ""notably above the level estimated to be consistent with the longer-run trend in labor-force growth — between 75,000 and 125,000 per month.""Even after January and February payroll gains were revised down by a combined 38,000, the average job gain over the past three months is 178,000, which is plenty fast, as far as the Fed is concerned.RELATED:How The Fed Surprised Markets Again, This Time Hitting StocksFebruary Jobs Growth Strong, But Not Too Strong To Unnerve Investors, Fed

98,ADP,"A blowout private-payroll report from ADP and rebounding oil prices initially helped put the major U.S. stock indexes on pace for weekly gains. A strong start from the tech sector, led by Tesla (TSLA), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL) and its suppliers also helped send the Nasdaq to fresh record highs.But that all changed with the minutes from the Federal Reserve's March meeting, as policymakers signaled a surprise tilt toward more monetary tightening. Signs of disarray in Washington, D.C., on the effort to overhaul taxes also weighed on markets. Official U.S. jobs data showing conflicting signals Friday failed to bolster the market, nor did a strong IPO from tech company Okta. The Dow Jones industrial average closed about flat  for the week, while the S&P 500 was down 0.3% and the Nasdaq was off 0.6%.The Labor Department's March payroll report showed a gain of just 98,000 jobs, barely over half of what analysts expected, and January's and February's gains were revised lower. But the unemployment rate fell to a 10-year low of 4.5% as a separate survey found a robust jump in employment. Much of the weakness in payrolls was blamed on unseasonable weather. Underlying trends could be stronger. ADP's private-sector hiring report earlier in the week put March's jobs gain at 263,000. The overall direction of jobs, wages and inflation is seen putting pressure on the Fed to tighten monetary policy.RELATED:Minutes of the Federal Reserve's March 14-15 meeting released Wednesday afternoon revealed that policymakers are ready to start shrinking the central bank's $4.5 trillion balance sheet later this year.The move, which amounts to a tightening of monetary policy, would begin to reverse the accommodation from the Fed's unconventional asset-buying programs launched in late 2008 to combat the financial crisis.The revelation helped turn a solid stock market advance into a small loss. Some analysts suggested that the Fed's policy signal could mean an unexpected rate hike in September, following a widely expected one in June. That would allow the Fed to start reducing the size of its balance sheet in December by no longer reinvesting all of the principal returned when its bond holdings mature.Separately, Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Richmond regional Fed bank, abruptly resigned after admitting that he violated the Fed's confidentiality rules in 2012 by speaking with a financial analyst about policy deliberations.RELATED:Okta (OKTA) raised $187 million late Thursday, pricing 11 million shares at 17, the high end of its estimated range.

It's the fourth major restaurant acquisition this year following Restaurant Brands' (QSR) purchase of Popeyes, Golden Gate Capital's buyout of Bob Evans Farms and Darden Restaurants (DRI) buying Cheddars.

Analysts say some advertisers that have suspended ads on YouTube are seeking concessions from Google, aside from resolving the ad placement issue. YouTube, meanwhile, launched a $35 monthly TV streaming service in five U.S. markets — New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago and Philadelphia.Meanwhile, Amazon's video business rolled ahead. It won rights to stream 10 National Football League games this fall — taking the ball from Twitter (TWTR), which held the same rights last year. Amazon is paying a big price for the privilege.

Nonfarm payrolls, due Friday, are seen rising 178,000, with the unemployment rate holding steady at 4.7%.Meanwhile, the minutes from the March 15 Fed meeting were released at 2 p.m. ET. There were no big surprises as most voting members continued to support a gradual pace of rate hikes, but that could change if the economy unexpectedly heats up. Committee members were also divided on the outlook for inflation. The 10-year Treasury yield was flat at 2.36%.In the stock market today, shares of Panera Bread (PNRA) soared 14% to 312.57 on news that it's being bought by JAB, whose brands include Keurig, Krispy Kreme and Peet's Coffee & Tea.

101,ADP,"The revival of the GOP push to repeal and replace ObamaCare didn't last long.Negotiations reportedly hit a wall late Tuesday, as concessions to House conservatives repelled more moderate Republicans, leaving no clear way forward.After signals that the House might vote on a revised bill before the end of the week, Republicans are now saying that talks about reviving TrumpCare have been tabled indefinitely.The initial demise of House Speaker Paul Ryan's American Health Care Act two weeks ago was a negative for markets, raising concern that the rest of President Trump's fiscal agenda might be sidelined. Yet Wall Street appears to have decided that there's nothing to be gained by diving back into the treacherous politics of ObamaCare repeal.Stocks opened higher on Wednesday after ADP reported that private employers added a bigger-than-expected 263,000 jobs last month, and confirmation that TrumpCare has no pulse did nothing to dampen the mood. The Nasdaq composite rose to a record high in afternoon trading on the stock market today. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.8%, paced by McDonald's (MCD) and another good day for Caterpillar (CAT).Even as TrumpCare was being put back on ice, there were more signals from the White House that it wants to speed up the timetable for bringing forward an infrastructure bill. Dozens of Republican members of Congress were reportedly briefed on the Trump administration's emerging infrastructure proposal.IBD'S TAKE: The stock market uptrend has been under pressure lately, a signal to investors to be more cautious about buying stocks and quick to cut losses.

102,ADP,"XMinutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's March 15 meeting turned a positive session on its ear Wednesday afternoon, stripping the market of its early advance and leaving the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 all seeing red.The Dow Jones industrial average tapped out with a 0.2% loss, down from a 1% gain early in the session. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq also erased gains, ending off 0.3% and 0.6%, respectively.Small caps did worse, with the Russell 2000 ending 1.2% lower. Volume rose, according to early figures.Bonds slid and stocks began trimming gains after Fed minutes released at 2 p.m. ET showed the committee prepared to raise interest rates more quickly if the economy showed rapid gains in strength. The notes also showed the Fed set to begin paring back its $4.5 trillion balance sheet, beginning with cutbacks to market-supporting reinvestments in bonds and mortgage-backed securities. Those moves would be tied to interest rates, suggesting that rate increases could occur more rapidly if inflation gained momentum.JPMorgan (JPM) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) slipped more than 1.2% apiece, hauling down the Dow industrials.  DuPont (DD) ran atop the index with a 0.8% gain.The Dow Jones transportation average gave up its early gains to end a fraction lower for the day as five of the gauge's 20 stocks posted gains of better than 1%. American Airlines Group (AAL) and container-freight big dog Matson (MATX) climbed 1% and 2%, respectively. Avis Budget Group (CAR) dropped nearly 3%.Transports received an early shot of confidence from Greenbrier (GBX), which pared its gains and ended 10% higher for the day.  The Lake Oswego, Ore.-based maker of railcars reported a strong beat of fiscal second-quarter analyst expectations, as well as an agreement to expand the company's relationship with Japan-based bank Mitsubishi UFJ (MTU) to the tune of more than $1 billion. The gain put Greenbrier shares well up the right side of a cup base with a 49.60 buy point.Oil prices backed off early highs, with West Texas intermediate futures ending up 0.3% but with the oil still above $51 a barrel. Energy issues took home five of the 10 worst losses among S&P 500 stocks. New-issue DXC Technology (DXC) topped the index, rising better than 3%.Beyond the Fed minutes and the EIA's weekly oil report, the day's economic news was mixed. A much higher-than expected March hiring number from the ADP National Employment Report gave investors an early boost of confidence. That boost and the rollout of primarily positive company news bowled over the later negative service-sector purchasing managers index.March PMIs from both Markit and the Institute For Supply Management failed to meet economist expectations.RELATED:Nasdaq Scores New High; Is The Uptrend Back?

Small caps lagged but the Russell 2000 gave up just 0.1%.

Shares are well past an 843.94 handle buy point and more than 5% above an 860.96 entry of a four-weeks-tight pattern.

Volume was slightly higher than usual. Pacific Crest raised its rating on the chip designer to overweight from sector weight and set a 75 price target. Cirrus is one of the chip stocks it expects to benefit from a strong iPhone 8 cycle. But graphics chip designer Nvidia (NVDA) slumped 7%, gapping down below its 50-day moving average in rapid trade. Shares are working on a two-month consolidation. Pacific Crest lowered its rating on the IBD 50 stock to underweight from sector weight, citing concerns about market saturation for data-center chips.In economic news, the IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index fell to 51.7 in April from 55.3 in March, nearly back to its early November level before President Trump's surprise win.Economic data slated for Wednesday include the ADP employment report and the ISM services index, both for March, as well as weekly mortgage applications and the Energy Information Administration's petroleum status report.The minutes from the Fed's March 14-15 monetary policy meeting will be released at 2 p.m. ET.RELATED:Think Semiconductor Stocks Are Done?

107,ADP,"Private employers added a net 298,000 jobs in February, according to the ADP Employment Report, the best gain since April 2014 and much better than expectations for 183,000. January's private payroll gain was revised up by 15,000 to 261,000.Manufacturing jobs, a key focus for President Trump, jumped by nearly 32,000 last month, the most in five years.The strong back-to-back gains suggest that hiring activity has ramped up. Business and consumer surveys have shown optimism has risen sharply since Election Day, as the Dow Jones industrial average and other stocks have boomed on hopes for tax cuts, deregulation and other pro-growth measures.The data bode well for the Friday's employment report from the Labor Department, though ADP has a mixed record of foreshadowing the official reading. Economists expect a nonfarm payroll gain of 195,000 after January's 227,000. Private jobs should climb 190,000.In a separate report, nonfarm productivity rose at an unrevised 1.3% annual rate in the fourth quarter, the Labor Department said.

The tech-laden index rose 0.4%, but fell nearly 0.2% for the week. The S&P 500's six-week win streak also ended. It gained 0.3% Friday; down 0.4% for the week. The Dow Jones industrial average picked up 0.2%, but lost 0.5% for the week. Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE coming in about 10% lower than Thursday. Nasdaq volume ended close to Thursday's level.Advancing stocks outnumbered decliners on both exchanges by nearly 2-to-1.Chip names like Lam Research (LRCX), Applied Materials (AMAT) and Broadcom (AVGO) outperformed in the Nasdaq 100, with gains of around 2% each.February employment numbers came in better than expected, just like the ADP report earlier in the week. February nonfarm payrolls rose to 235,000, nicely above the consensus estimate of 200,000. The unemployment ticked lower, as expected, to 4.7%.At the New York Mercantile Exchange, April WTI crude oil lost another 1.6% to $48.49 a barrel. For the week, it lost 9%, partly due to a government report earlier in the week that showed an 8.2-million-barrel weekly rise in domestic crude supplies to a record level of 528.4 million barrels.In the stock market today, the airline group held up relatively well despite a big dive by Southwest Airlines (LUV) after the company lowered its unit revenue guidance. Shares recovered nicely off lows but still fell 0.8%. American Airlines (AAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL) also gave weak forecasts earlier in the week.Southwest is testing support at the 10-week moving average for the second time after a breakout from a cup-shaped base with a 48.10 buy point.In IPO news, IT services provider Presidio (PSDO) had an unspectacular debut after pricing last night at 14, at the low end of  a proposed range of 14-16.

VanEck Gold Miners (GDX) has dived 15% in the past month through March 7 and has shed 5.9% through the first week of March.The bullish report on private employment from ADP buttresses views of strength in the U.S. economy and its ability to absorb higher interest rates.The ADP data is closely tracked by traders as a window into the official jobs data that is due out Friday, Allen Sykora of Kitco News wrote early Wednesday.He noted that expectations are for the nonfarm payrolls number to rise and added: ""The jobs data are seen as the final piece of the puzzle for a potential U.S. interest-rate hike when the Federal Open Market Committee meets next week. The federal funds futures have factored in a high probability of a rate hike after recent comments from Fed speakers that were hawkishly construed, barring some surprise weak economic data, such as the jobs report.""Higher interest rates put downward pressure on gold while boosting the dollar in which it is priced. The yellow metal serves as a haven asset but bears no yield. It struggles to compete against rival yield-bearing haven assets when rates rise.Spot gold fell 0.47% to $1,209.86 per ounce, after touching its lowest since Feb. 3 at $1,210.92, a report from CNBC said.The SPDR Gold Shares ETF sits 12% below its July high of 131.15.The fallout from the ADP report rippled to other corners of the ETF market.

111,ADP,"Bank stocks like Dow components JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) opened higher Wednesday on the strength of ADP's monthly jobs report, which blew past expectations.The economy added 298,000 private-sector jobs in February, the best gain in nearly three years far past estimates for 183,000. The torrid acceleration shown in the ADP report comes ahead of the official government job figures for February, which are set for release Friday.The 10-year Treasury yield, which helps determine rates on mortgages and is a measure of inflation expectations, had risen to 2.56%, continuing a recent revival back to near postelection highs. Higher yields and a wider yield spread should be good for banks profits.Bond yields have been rallying on growing expectations for a Federal Reserve rate hike at the end of the March 14-15 meeting. Fed officials have signaled that a move is likely, with markets pricing in a 91% chance that it'll happen. Investors now see about a 50-50 chance of a second hike by June's Meeting.JPMorgan Chase rose as high as 92.85 soon after the opening bell, but closed down 0.2% to 91.21 in the stock market today. Goldman Sachs reversed to close down 0.3%.Bank of America (BAC) settled up 0.2% while Citigroup (C) advanced 1%, with both also well off the day's best levels.Wells Fargo (WFC) reversed to finish down 0.15%. Morgan Stanley (MS) rose 0.15%.IBD'S TAKE: Many businesses don't exactly benefit when interest rates rise. Bank stocks are different in that they actually do. JPMorgan and Goldman leaped to record highs last week after two more dovish Fed officials, John Williams and William Dudley, indicated that a rate hike could be on the horizon and that economy was gaining steam.Then, last Friday, Fed chair Janet Yellen said a rate hike this month ""would likely be appropriate,"" assuming the economy didn't suddenly falter. She also indicated the Fed would likely institute three rate hikes this year.RELATED:JPMorgan Cautious On Benefits From Tax Cuts, Fewer RegulationsJPMorgan, Charles Schwab, Goldman Jump On Trump's Regulatory Rollback

112,ADP,"Economic optimism is on the rise among small businesses and consumers alike, judging from recent surveys. The monthly Index of Small Business Optimism finds the highest optimism rate since December of 2004.Over half of the small businesses surveyed said they are hiring or trying to hire, and many said they expect sales to increase and to expand their business. Consumers share that optimism, with consumer confidence in the economy at a 15-year high.Why are people looking up these days?One big factor must be the Trump administration's enthusiasm for sweeping away regulatory burdens. When businesses spend an inordinate amount time doing paperwork for regulators or face government crackdowns for even the smallest missteps and infractions, those businesses are less able to afford or plan expansions, job creation and wage increases.Red tape has been one of the top concerns of employers, according to multiple surveys, from ADP and the international law firm Littler Mendelson to the National Association of Manufacturers and Wells Fargo.But despite the postelection optimism, hard work remains ahead when it comes to actually scaling back job- and business-killing regulations. And one of the biggest offenders in that regard is the new ""joint employer"" liability standard imposed by the Obama administration's National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).The board's August 2015 decision in a case against waste management company Browning-Ferris overturned 30 years of precedent — government rules that companies had relied upon for decades — that determined when two companies are considered joint employers of an employee. Those standards are important because they determine if a company, such as a franchise business or manufacturer, is liable for labor violations committed by a company they do business with but do not directly control, such as a franchisee or contractor.This is a big deal. Prior to the ruling in the Browning-Ferris case, a common-sense policy was in place. Joint employment was established when one company exerted direct and immediate control over another firm's workers.For the last 30 years, a company had to directly control key employment terms, like hiring and firing or pay and work assignments, to assume joint employer liability. Now, a company may be forced to assume liability if they exercise indirect or unexercised potential control. It's a fuzzy standard, so no one knows for sure what their liability will be.The most immediate fix to the problem lies with the courts. On March 9, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit will hear oral argument in the Browning-Ferris case. Hopefully the court will restore the long-standing precedent because the new joint employer standard is inconsistent with the intent of Congress.The National Labor Relations Act made it necessary to exercise direct and immediate control to establish an employment relationship, not merely indirect control.  Holding a company liable for employees it actually employs and exerts day-to-day control over makes sense. Holding a company liable for the employees it doesn't control makes no sense.It is important to recognize that most contractors, franchisees and staffing agencies — the entities that will bear the brunt of the harm of the change — are independent small businesses that partner with other businesses. Those independent businesses make all the day-to-day decisions related to pay, hiring and work conditions of their employees, so a joint employer relationship should not exist.The Obama fiduciary rule threatens to stifle these beneficial business relationships. One of the business models that is in the new joint employer standard's cross hairs is the franchise industry, which consistently outpaces the rest of the economy.Franchise businesses support roughly 8.9 million direct jobs and $890 billion of economic output for the U.S. economy. The Obama standard can ruin these successful business models by incentivizing large companies to steer clear of contracting with small businesses entirely. Without congressional or court intervention, the NLRB's action will block a path toward entrepreneurship, reduce job creation, expand employer liability, increase employment insurance costs, lead to a surge in lawsuits, and disrupt thriving business models. That could put a real damper on economic optimism and opportunity.

117,ADP,"Companies last month added the most workers to payrolls since June on pickups in services and manufacturing jobs, with private payrolls climbing by 246,000, data from the ADP Research Institute in Roseland, N.J., showed Wednesday.The payroll increase was well ahead of a forecast for 168,000, and it came after a revised 151,000 gain in December. Goods-producing industries, which include manufacturers and builders, increased headcounts by 46,000, the most in two years. An increase of 4,000 service providers boosted payrolls in that sector by 201,000 following a 147,000 gain.With demand rising throughout the economy, companies are likely to continue adding workers at a steady pace, especially following a jump in business optimism on the heels of President Donald Trump's election victory. Hiring occurred across all business sizes and most industries, figures that could provide insight on the labor market ahead of Friday's release of the government's monthly payrolls report, which is projected to show a 170,000 increase in private jobs.""(The year) got off to a strong start in the job market,"" Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pa., said in a written statement. Moody's produces the figures with ADP.""Job growth is solid across most industries and company sizes,"" Zandi went on to say. ""Even the energy sector is adding to payrolls again.""Hiring in construction totaled 25,000, the most in four months. Factories added 15,000 workers, the most since December 2014. And companies employing 500 or more workers increased staffing by 83,000 jobs.Payrolls rose by 102,000 at medium-sized businesses, or those with 50 to 499 employees, while small companies' payrolls gained 62,000 workers, the most since July.
"
118,ADP,"Michael Clarfeld has helped steer $5.6 billion ClearBridge Dividend Strategy Fund (SOPAX) to solid performance by pursing high-quality stocks that provide price appreciation with improving dividends.The fund he co-manages has returned an average annual 8.89% in the three years ended Jan. 31, topping 80% of the diversified income-oriented stock mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. The fund's 12-month trailing dividend yield is 1.12%.His bull's-eye is dividend growth, not high dividends. He and co-managers Harry Cohen and Peter Vanderlee favor stocks that are financially healthy enough to pay dividends that rise. They avoid those with yields that are inflated either by companies desperately trying to attract investors or by falling share prices.The bonus is that the financial strength that provides a launchpad for dividend growth inoculates stocks against the risks of a rising interest rate environment, he says.""Stretching for yield is risky,"" he warns. ""Dividend growth is the place to be. That growth can offset the negatives of rising rates.""Dividends can be shock-absorbers, smoothing investors' rides during market turmoil. Yet their stock holdings still offer the potential of price gains, the thinking goes.Just look at some of his fund's holdings. Among the fund's four holdings with the highest Composite Ratings from IBD, Texas Instruments (TXN) is up 43% in the past 12 months ended Jan. 31; it has an annual dividend growth rate of 15.3% in the past three years, according to dividend.com. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) is up 42%; its dividend growth rate is 10.6%. Automatic Data Processing (ADP) is up 22%; its dividend growth rate is 6.8%. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) is up 41%; its dividend growth rate is 31.2%.IBD'S TAKE: UnitedHealth is No. 1 in IBD's Medical-Medical Care industry group. To see how the company's growth metrics — like its strong 87 IBD Composite Rating and four straight years of earnings per share (EPS) growth — stack up against its rivals, visit IBD Stock Checkup.That volatility antidote of dividend-paying stocks might come in handy sooner rather than later. The market has traded sideways since mid-December as investors wait to see how the newly installed president's policies play out and whether a Republican-controlled Congress makes good on the business friendly actions investors expect from it.Stocks offering dividend growth also might fare better than bonds if the Federal Reserve makes good on its signals that it intends to raise rates multiple times this year.From his office in Manhattan, 39-year-old Clarfeld talked with IBD about whether it's wise to own a dividend-paying portfolio in a rising rate environment and his fund's overall investment approach.IBD: Do you ever give in to temptation and buy high-yield stocks?Clarfeld: If you buy only stocks with high current dividends, you miss out on some good stocks. We own American Tower (AMT), for instance, which is a wonderful business. (Its share price is up 34% since the end of 2012. Its dividend yield is 2.2%.) But it only began to pay dividends in 2012. So you have to be open-minded.We used to own Heinz (now part of KraftHeinz (KHC)). Several years ago it was much easier to find great companies with solid growth and high dividends like Heinz. But then it got taken over. We couldn't find a replacement that was as good a company with a good growth rate and a high current yield, so we ended up tilting more toward dividend growth and a little less toward high current yield as the impacts of quant easing became more pronounced over the last many years.IBD: Dividend growers are among the most stable companies. Why not buy shares in them directly and avoid a fund's expenses?Clarfeld: There are a couple of reasons. One is diversification. It would not be particularly efficient for an individual to buy 4o to 50 stocks. The broker commissions would add up.And the average person who has a job and a family does not have time to follow 50 different companies, industries, competitors and figure out which to buy, the correct time to buy, and so on.IBD: You began a stake in JPMorgan Chase (JPM) not long ago, but well before its recent Trump bump. What's your thesis?Clarfeld: We bought it early in the year when it was yielding north of 3%. (Yield now is 2.3%.) Pre-election, there was so much investor fatigue toward large banks, prices were very beaten down. And the prospect of interest rates going up, it seemed like it would never happen. And it seemed like regulatory pressures would persist forever. We just thought the valuation was too pessimistic. And JPMorgan has lots of franchises that are valuable.IBD: Texas Instruments' (TXN) earnings per share growth has accelerated for four straight quarters. What's driving it?Clarfeld: We like their emphasis on analog chips. If you think about Texas vs. Intel (INTC), which we also own, Intel makes the brains of computers. They are high performance, high dollar value. Texas focuses on the other end of the spectrum. Their chips sell for 10 to 20 cents. They are basic but high quality. And they're attractive because they are the largest player in that space.Anyone designing a new alarm clock or refrigerator or car and needs basic chips knows that Texas Instruments has them. And once those chips are designed into something, it rarely changes. So they provide a recurring revenue stream like an annuity.High performance chips require huge R&D spending. Texas Instruments' chips are much less capital intensive. So they can direct 100% of their free cash flow to shareholders.IBD: Automatic Data Processing (ADP) got a nice Trump bump. But you've owed this for years, right?Clarfeld: It's been a core holding for 10-plus years. It's a business we think can compound earnings for years. And payroll processing provides recurring revenues. Once you get a company's payroll, the business is sticky. This company benefits from job growth in the economy. It is taking share. And it provides ancillary services. They help companies deal with Affordable Care Act compliance, although a potential repeal or replacement is now a risk for them. Still, the ACA is not a core driver of this business.And recently it's benefited like a lot of financials from rising interest rates. They earn a float on payrolls they handle. Rising rates mean that float will increase.IBD: You reopened your stake in Alphabet (GOOG) after closing it. What brought you back?Clarfeld: We're a dividend portfolio. We don't go looking for nondividend-payers, but we don't want to be overly dogmatic. We wanted this exposure and there is no other way to get it.Over the past 10 years, we've owned three nondividend-payers: Apple (AAPL), Berkshire Hathaway (BERKB) and Alphabet. There is no search company like Google. There is no company like Berkshire Hathaway, which won't initiate a dividend while Warren Buffett is alive. After he's gone, who knows? And we think Alphabet will likely initiate a dividend in the future. We're not forecasting that, but we think they will.IBD: You trimmed your Waste Management (WM) stake. Why is that?Clarfeld: Actually, it's an example of a business we like. The business is stable and predictable. It's cyclical with the economy. There's been enough consolidation to make the industry rational. In fact, they've been able to drive prices higher despite a relatively weak economy. We have trimmed some just on valuation.IBD: What distinguishes Walt Disney (DIS) from other media names?Clarfeld: Their ability to create properties and then monetize them. They make movies, then turn it into a theme park attraction and then sell merchandise from it to kids. They show an ability to do that in a way few other companies can.And they own ESPN, which is dominant in sports. The biggest piece of ESPN is monthly subscription income, not advertising, and their paid subscribers are growing. So their revenue is stable and predictable. They have multiyear contracts with (cable) systems, with built-in (price) escalators.IBD: Is Home Depot (HD) a play on an expected pickup in economic growth?Clarfeld: What we like about it is not what's going to happen to the economy in 2017. We don't own a lot of retailers because they're hard to understand. And they have a fashion element, which can become unpopular suddenly. Home Depot is not like that. They're not trying to call a fashion fad. And they don't need to spiff up their stores, which are warehouses. It took a huge step down in the financial crisis. We bought it back then. Our cost basis is below 30. (Now it's trading around the high 130s.) It's a play on people spending on their homes.IBD: UnitedHealth Group (UNH) has trended higher since the election. Is this a play on the expectation of reduced health care regulation?Clarfeld: They have diversified their operations. The stock has done well because people expect reform or changes under the new administration that will be market based. Company management is very commercially oriented.RELATED:Where Vanguard's CEO McNabb Sees Fund Giant Headed In 2017Where Mutual Fund Bigwigs Expect To See Stocks Gains In 2017After 2016 Ends On Strong Note For Mutual Funds, What's Ahead For 2017

119,ADP,"It was a strong start for the stock market Wednesday as the Wall Street cheered a strong quarter from Apple (AAPL). Early gains faded, but the Nasdaq composite and Dow Jones industrial average held modest gains in afternoon trading.The Nasdaq was up 0.4% after popping 0.8% early, the Dow added 0.2% and the S&P 500 was mostly flat. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking higher than Wednesday's levels in the stock market today, more so on the Nasdaq due to heavy volume in Apple.Breadth was negative with Nasdaq decliners having a slight edge over advancers. On the NYSE, losers topped winners by about 3 to 2.The stock market might've given back early gains, but Apple didn't as shares jumped nearly 7%. Earnings and sales topped expectations and halted three straight quarters of declining growth. Wall Street seemed enthusiastic about the fact that the company sold 1.3 million more iPhones than expected. Several Apple suppliers moved higher on the news, including Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Qorvo (QRVO). Both report after the close today. Cirrus jumped 4%. Qorvo edged higher as it tries to clear a long consolidation with a 64.90 buy point.Heavy volume gainers included pipeline firm Oneok Partners (OKS). Shares surged 19% on news that Oneok (OKE) will buy the rest of the company for $9.3 billion. As a result of the deal, Oneok's quarterly dividend will increase 21% to 74.5 cents, giving it an annualized yield of around 5.6%.On the downside, U.S. Steel (X) reversed lower despite a big earnings beat. Shares slumped 4.5%.Steel producers have been under pressure lately, but one bright spot in the group is Posco (PKX). Shares rose more than 3% to 59.90 in heavy volume. Shares have been volatile, though, as the stock gets closer to possibly clearing a 60.23 cup-without-handle buy point.Facebook (FB) added 1% ahead of its earnings report after the close. It's still in buy range from a 129.37 cup-with-handle buy point. In economic news, ADP reported that private payrolls increased by 246,000 in January, well above the consensus estimate of 168,000.

120,ADP,"Treasuries pared losses and were slightly lower in late trading Wednesday after the Federal Open Market Committee's statement proved more dovish than some traders anticipated, helping push two-year yields down from the highest levels of 2017.Yields were higher by less than a basis point across the curve at 3:18 p.m. in New York, after rising as much as five to seven basis points in morning trading on stronger-than-expected U.S. employment and manufacturing data. Two- to five-year yields led the retreat after the FOMC statement left intact expectations for two rate increases this year, while acknowledging improvement in consumer and business sentiment over the past six weeks.""There were some remote concerns that the Fed might set the table for a March hike,"" said William O'Donnell, U.S. rates desk strategist at Citigroup in New York. When that didn't happen, ""the front end rallied back toward unchanged on the day.""The two-year yield rose as much as 5.6 basis points to 1.26%, its highest since Dec. 28, after the January ADP Employment Change topped the most optimistic estimates and the ISM Manufacturing PMI rose to a two-year high.The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note added four basis points to 2.49%. It fell four basis points on Tuesday. The U.S. yield curve steepened Wednesday in the minutes after the Federal Reserve left its benchmark lending rate unchanged. The difference between two-year yields and those on 30-year bonds widened to about 186 basis points, from about 182 basis points before the announcement, as shorter-maturity Treasuries pared losses.

121,ADP,"Stocks rallied early Wednesday, fueled by Apple (AAPL) postearnings and positive jobs data, but the major averages saw their early gains fade. Walt Disney (DIS) also boosted the Dow Jones industrial average.The Nasdaq rose 0.2% in today's stock market action, the Dow climbed 0.1% and the S&P 500 fell fractionally. Volume swelled across the board vs. the same time Tuesday.Steel, bank and telecom-related plays were among the biggest gainers; software, department stores and gold miners lagged.Apple gapped up and soared nearly 6% in massive volume to its highest level since November 2015. Shares are now extended well past a 118.12 cup-with-handle buy point cleared on Jan. 6. The company reported fiscal Q1 results late Tuesday that beat forecasts on both the top and bottom lines, thanks to better-than-expected iPhone sales. It sold 78.3 million iPhones, up 5% from last year and above views for 77 million. RBC Capital Markets raised its price target to 140 from 125, with an overweight rating.Among other Dow stock, Disney rose fractionally while Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan (JPM) were each up more than 1%. Disney marked a new 52-week high and is just barely in range from a 106.36 buy point of a cup with handle. Morgan Stanley on Monday raised its rating to overweight from equal weight and its price target to 124 from 101.Facebook (FB) climbed 0.5% in brisk trade ahead of its Q4 results due after the close. Shares remain in buy range from a 129.37 handle entry. Analysts expect the social network's earnings to jump 66% to $1.31 a share on 46% higher revenue of $8.51 billion.United Parcel Service (UPS) slid 3% in heavy turnover, extending Tuesday's 7% drop. The stock is still technically in flat-base range with an 11% correction from the left high to low, but the high-volume gap-down below its 50-day and 200-day lines is bearish action. The package delivery giant's Q4 results missed estimates Tuesday and its full-year guidance disappointed.Private-sector employers added 246,000 jobs in January, ADP reported, well above economist forecasts for 168,000 and December's 153,000.

122,ADP,"The Federal Reserve held its key interest rate steady on Wednesday, as expected, as it waits for clearer evidence that rising economic confidence will fuel an upturn in growth.The Fed, which was unanimous in its decision, noted that ""business fixed investment has remained soft"" although ""measures of consumer and business sentiment have improved of late.""""The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate,"" the Fed said in a statement.Treasury yields trimmed their gains and stocks wobbled up and down after the Fed signaled no rush to hike, meaning it's unlikely the next hike will come at the mid-March meeting. Apple (AAPL) pushed the Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq composite slightly higher. Apple itself rose more than 7% following its strong holiday quarter earnings late Tuesday. The S&P 500, fractionally lower before the Fed announcement, closed slightly higher.Investors had been on guard for more hawkish signals after strong economic reports on Wednesday morning. The Institute for Supply Management Index rose 1.3 points last month to 56, the fastest pace since November 2014 and well above the 50 neutral level. Meanwhile, payroll firm ADP estimated that U.S. companies added 246,000 jobs in January, much stronger than the 168,000 that Wall Street expected.Those reports outweighed news that General Motors (GM), Ford (F) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) saw sales fall in January after a big December. GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler shares fell slightly on the stock market today.Signs of faster growth and prospects for higher interest rates, good for banks' net interest margins, helped lift bank stocks in Wednesday trading. Bank of America (BAC) rose 1.1%, while U.S. Bancorp (USB) advanced 0.7% to an all-time high.IBD'S TAKE: President Trump's agenda faces a large degree of uncertainty. If the WTO found the border tax backed by House Republicans — and increasingly by the White House — to be illegal, the GOP would face three difficult choices that could throw the ruling party into crisis.Fed policymakers caught markets off-guard in December when a number of them built President Trump's planned fiscal stimulus into their hawkish forecast for three rate hikes in 2017. Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said that it's not clear the economy needs stimulus to reach full employment.But after a tumultuous first week and a half of his presidency, Fed policymakers are likely done trying to predict what Trump will do and how his policies will affect the economy. Now the Fed, like investors, is in wait-and-see mode to watch what can get through Congress, when it will affect the real economy, and whether Trump's immigration and trade policies curb or offset the force of his pro-growth moves.For now, markets still expect just two rate hikes in 2017, coming in June and December. After the Fed's announcement, markets were pricing in just 17.7% odds that the next hike will come on March 15.RELATED:U.S. Manufacturing Gears Up As 'America First' Trump Takes Office Ford, GM, Fiat Chrysler U.S. Sales Decline In January

That bullish news helped send GM shares to a 22-month high recently.Ford shares dipped 0.3% toclose at 12.32 on the stock market today. GM stock fell 1.3% to finish at 36.14, trying to find support at its 50-day moving average.President Trump has criticized GM, Ford and other automakers for Mexico factories and exports, urging them to set up more facilities in the U.S. But with U.S. demand plateauing at record levels, Ford says no more domestic plants are needed.One U.S. automaker that is rapidly expanding is Tesla (TSLA), which announced Wednesday it is changing its name to Tesla Inc. from Tesla Motors. Tesla has plans to ramp up from delivering 76,320 vehicles last year to making 500,000 in 2018.

127,ADP,"Broad adoption of Clovis Oncology's (CLVS) PARP inhibitor, Rubraca, could depend on trials of rival drugs from AstraZeneca (AZN) and Tesaro (TSRO), Janney analyst Debjit Chattopadhyay said Monday.In the stock market today, Clovis stock fell 1.1% to 61.83. Shares, though, have run up nearly 40% this year vs. a 5.3% climb for the SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI) exchange-traded fund. IBD's Biomed/Biotech industry group is up less than 1% in 2017.Chattopadhyay credited Takeda Pharmaceuticals' plan to acquire Ariad Pharmaceuticals (ARIA) for $5.2 billion and Merrimack Pharmaceuticals' (MACK) $575 million divestiture of an oncology asset to Ipsen for driving up the valuation of oncology biotechs and for Clovis' stock run-up.IBD'S TAKE: Tesaro and four IPOs led the biotech sphere in terms of gains in 2016. See how those five stocks and the broader industry group performed on IBD's Industry Themes.Clovis shares have traded well above their 50-day moving average since early November. Chattopadhyay classified the rise as ""too far, too fast."" Clovis could wait some time before getting a takeover bid with its premium wrapped in an at-risk asset, he said.""Despite the premium being placed on commercial-stage oncology assets and the potential synergies of PARPi with checkpoint inhibitors, a near-term Clovis buyout may not materialize until key competitive readouts settle the debate on the equivalency/superiority of the various PARPi,"" he said.Poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) are enzymes used to repair damaged DNA. Companies including Clovis, AstraZeneca and Tesaro are testing whether inhibiting those enzymes could help treat ovarian and other cancers. AstraZeneca and Clovis both have approved drugs.Clovis' drug was approved in December for ovarian cancer patients whose tumors have a deleterious BRCA mutation and have not responded to chemo. A day later, Tesaro's New Drug Application for an ovarian cancer drug won priority review from the Food and Drug Administration.Readouts from AstraZeneca's SOLO-2 trial and Tesaro's PRIMA are likely to affect Rubraca's adoption and Clovis stock, Chattopadhyay wrote in a research report. An earlier phase three trial from Tesaro, called NOVA, showed PARP inhibitor niraparib significantly improved progression-free survival in ovarian cancer.""If SOLO-2 is not in the same ballpark as NOVA, questions on interchangeability of PARPs could impact Clovis shares heading into ARIEL-3 readout,"" he wrote. ARIEL-3 is a Clovis trial looking at Rubraca as a maintenance treatment in patients with ovarian fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer.Chattopadhyay suggested trials from AstraZeneca and Tesaro could change the role of PARP inhibitors to front-line treatments from second-line, thus reducing the pool of Rubraca patients. He kept his neutral rating on Clovis stock.""Based on the near-term uncertainties, we would wait for a better entry point,"" he said.RELATED:Tesaro Ovarian Cancer Drug Gets Priority Review After FDA OKs Clovis MedBiotech Stocks Might Catalyze, Or Plunge, On 4 Key Sectors In 2017Tesaro Stock Rebounds Despite FDA Hold-Up On Anti-Nausea Med

128,ADP,"Filings for U.S. unemployment benefits declined to their lowest level in eight weeks, but other data showed companies added fewer jobs than forecast in December.Showing volatility typical around the holiday period, jobless claims dropped by 28,000 to 235,000 in the week ended Dec. 31, a Labor Department report showed Thursday in Washington. The median projection of economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for 260,000.Meanwhile, data from the ADP Research Institute in Roseland, N.J., showed Thursday that private payrolls climbed by 153,000, below forecasts of 175,000. That came after a revised 215,000 gain in November. Goods-producing industries, which include manufacturers and builders, reduced head counts by 16,000, while service providers boosted payrolls by 169,000.""Job growth remains strong but is slowing,"" Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics Inc. in West Chester, Pa., said in a prepared statement. Moody's produces the figures with ADP. ""Smaller companies are struggling to maintain payrolls while large companies are expanding at a healthy pace.""ADP found that businesses continue to add workers to meet sales, helping to sustain the progress that has put the job market at or near the Federal Reserve's maximum-employment objective.The slower pace of hiring underscores the challenge for companies in finding skilled workers as the labor market tightens, one reason wage growth may accelerate.The data provide more clues on the employment situation ahead of the Friday release of the Labor Department's monthly payrolls report, which is expected to show the economy added positions in December to cap another solid year of gains.Hiring in construction fell by 2,000 while factories subtracted 9,000 workers. Companies employing 500 or more workers increased staffing by 63,000 jobs. Payrolls rose by 71,000 at medium-sized businesses, or those with 50 to 499 employees, while small companies expanded payrolls by 18,000.The Labor Department figures, meantime, usually show swings around the year-end holidays. Firms generally have avoided firings as the job market tightens and the supply of available workers shrinks.Filings have remained below 300,000 for 96 consecutive weeks, the longest streak since 1970 and a threshold economists say is indicative of a healthy labor market. An average 263,000 Americans filed for benefits each week in 2016, down from 278,000 in 2015.The number of people continuing to receive jobless benefits rose by 16,000 to 2.11 million in the week ended Dec. 24, the highest since early September. The unemployment rate among people eligible for benefits held at 1.5%. These data are reported with a one-week lag.Estimates in the Bloomberg survey for initial claims ranged from 250,000 to 275,000. The Labor Department revised the prior week's reading to 263,000 from an initially reported 265,000. Last week's figure was close to the four-decade low of 233,000 from the week ending Nov. 12.Six states including Virginia and Wisconsin had estimated claims last week, as did Puerto Rico. There was nothing unusual in the overall data, according to the Labor Department. The four-week average of claims, a less-volatile measure than the weekly figure, decreased to 256,750 from 262,500 in the prior week.

129,ADP,"Treasuries rallied across the curve, driving down benchmark yields by the most since the days after the June Brexit vote, as traders across financial markets backed away from crowded bets.The benchmark 10-year U.S. yield plunged nine basis points to 2.35% at 4:14 p.m. in New York, touching the lowest level since Dec. 8, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. It's set for the biggest decline since June 27. The 10-year break-even rate, a market measure of inflation expectations, fell from close to the highest level since 2014.Across financial markets, trends snapped Thursday as investors weighed the risk of a lackluster payrolls report Friday and the prospect that trades based on Donald Trump's impending presidency had gone too far. Data from the ADP Research Institute on Thursday indicated that companies added fewer jobs in December than forecast. The figures come a day before the Labor Department releases its monthly payrolls report.""A bunch of the widely predicted trades for this year are all being broken at the same time, with oil going lower, investment-grade corporates widening out, TIPS break-evens tightening, and then rates rallying as a result,"" said Mike Lorizio, a Boston-based senior trader at Manulife Asset Management, which oversees about $343 billion. ""Some key levels being broken just inspired further buying.""In other markets, the dollar tumbled, while the S&P 500 retreated for the first time in 2017. The move in Treasuries was exacerbated by extended short positioning in futures, traders said, and marked by heavy futures volumes.

130,ADP,"Bank stocks retreated, dragging down the Dow industrials, as Treasury yields fell Thursday on ADP's employment gauge.The 10-year Treasury yield, which helps determine the rate on mortgages and other debts, was down nine basis points to 2.35%, after hitting a recent peak above 2.6% in mid-December. The two-year yield, which influences credit-card debt and other key loans, rose five basis points to 1.17%. A flatter yield curve is not good news for bank profitability.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) shares closed 0.9% lower on the stock market today, while Bank of America (BAC) dropped 1.2% and Citigroup (C) 1.7%. Wells Fargo (WFC) retreated 1.55%. Goldman Sachs (GS) pulled back 0.7%, and fellow investment bank Morgan Stanley (MS) lost 0.9%.JPMorgan and Goldman are part of the Dow Jones industrial average and are a key reason why the blue-chip index is lagging Thursday.ADP said the private sector added 153,000 jobs in December, below expectations, according to MarketWatch, and lower than the 215,000 added in November. The government's December jobs report is set for release on Friday.Bank stock charts generally look healthy, with share prices leveling off in recent weeks following a long run-up after the election of Donald Trump. Wall Street has been betting that a combination of tax cuts, regulatory cutbacks, an infrastructure overhaul and higher inflation under Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress will benefit banks in the years to come.The economic growth and infrastructure investment have led to anticipation of higher inflation, which has pushed longer-term yields up as investors try to make up for the dollar's declining buying power over time. When the Fed raises rates, a prospect more likely under higher inflation, banks can more easily raise their own, helping to pad their finances.The Federal Reserve has already offered more bullish signals on rate hikes for this year. According to minutes from the Fed's December meeting, policymakers ""indicated that the upside risks to their forecasts for economic growth had increased as a result of prospects for more expansionary fiscal policies in coming years.""IBD'S TAKE: The Fed can raise its own benchmark interest rate in an attempt to curb inflation and economic overexpansion and make borrowing more expensive. With investors banking on Trump's fiscal policy jolting the economy, Fed policymakers may get more aggressive on raising rates. JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo report quarterly earnings next week.RELATED:More Than Bitcoin: Blockchain's Links Reach JPMorgan, IBM, Wal-MartAs The Dow Nears 20K, These 5 Stocks Have Led The WayU.S. Banking Giants Gain As Deutsche Bank, European Financials Teeter

Activision (ATVI), a group peer of Electronic Arts, reports Thursday after the close.On the downside, Paycom Software (PAYC) crashed 16%.

139,ADP,"General Motors (GM), Toyota Motor (TM), Ford Motor (F) and a number of car dealer and parts maker stocks are powering higher Wednesday, even as the auto industry is seen reaching a plateau near record highs.Other trends would seem to act as headwinds on the auto sector as well, such as higher oil prices weighing on truck and SUV sales and expectations for an interest rate hike denting the easy financing that buyers have enjoyed. September sales tallies from individual automakers also fell short.But Autodata's industrywide sales figure of a 17.76 million annual rate last month topped forecasts.

140,ADP,"Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) have broken out this week on growing Federal Reserve rate-hike speculation and relief over Deutsche Bank (DB).After AFP reported that Deutsche Bank could settle a mortgage-securities case for far less than the Justice Department asked for, potentially warding off a bigger shock to the global banking industry, Bank of America and Citigroup on Friday bounced off their 50-day lines. Meanwhile, Fed officials' comments and recent economic data have reinforced expectations for central bank tightening by the end of the year.Banks and bank stocks should do well if the Fed raises rates because it allow them to increase the spread between its lending rates and borrowing costs. Banks' net interest margins have been squeezed in recent years.JPMorgan Chase (JPM), meanwhile, also rebounded off its 50-day. JPMorgan broke out in early August from a handle in a consolidation and remains within range of the 66.58 buy point. JPMorgan rose 1.6% to 67.69 Wednesday.Citigroup climbed 1.9% to 48.65 in the stock market today, hitting its best levels since early January.

Wells Fargo is still reeling from the cross-selling scandal.IBD'S TAKE: The Banks-Money Center industry group, which includes the big banks, moves in tandem with the Federal Reserve's announcements on interest rates. To learn more about top industry groups and taking profits quickly rapid changes in the market, see this story about Swing Trading strategies. Meanwhile, some super-regional banks also have broken out. SunTrust Banks (STI) broke past a 44.71 buy point of a consolidation pattern begun in late May on Tuesday.

SunTrust had found resistance several times just above 44 in recent months.Meanwhile, Comerica (CMA) rose 2.8% to 49.21 Wednesday, extended from buy range but still performing solidly.Wednesday's bank stock gains come as ADP reported that companies added 154,000 jobs in September, short of estimates for 170,000 but still solid.

The Idaho-based chipmaker reported late Tuesday that revenue fell and its bottom line swung to a loss, as expected by analysts, in its fiscal fourth quarter.

The biggest loser in the S&P 500 was retailer Kohl's (KSS), down 19%.The retail sector has done little in the so-called Trump rally. Just before the election, retail was No. 26 of 33 sectors. Going into Thursday's session, retail was No. 25.In the Nasdaq 100, retailer Urban Outfitters (URBN) was the worst performer, down 5% in heavy volume.In economic news, payroll firm ADP reported that businesses added 153,000 jobs in December, which was 11% fewer than the Street expected.

146,ADP,"The employment report out on Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET is expected to show that the economy added 175,000 jobs in December, continuing the solid trend of recent months.But the real focus will be on wage growth and the jobless rate, which both delivered big surprises in last month's report.After the rise in average hourly earnings hit a seven-year high of 2.8% in October, wages backslid in November, slipping 0.1% and bringing the annual rate down to 2.5%. Friday's report could indicate whether that was just a statistical quirk.The consensus view is that December's report will show a 0.3% rise in average hourly earnings from November. Jefferies economists Ward McCarthy and Thomas Simons expect a 0.4% jump, lifting annual wage gains to a new cycle high of 2.9%.In November, the jobless rate surprisingly fell to a nine-year low of 4.6% from 4.9% amid a drop in workforce participation. The volatile household survey had been showing that more workers had been coming off the sidelines to participate in a stronger job market. Economists expect Friday's report to show the jobless rate rising to 4.7%, indicating that November's report somewhat overstated how tight the labor market is.Wage gains and the unemployment rate are both key indicators for the real question on everyone's mind: Can the job market accommodate President-elect Donald Trump's fiscal fuel without overheating? That won't be clear for some time and depends greatly on the size of the fiscal package that comes out of Congress, but Friday's report will offer some clues and could affect expectations for how fast the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in the coming year.IBD'S TAKE: The Federal Reserve, long worried about paltry growth, has shifted to the role of traffic cop. Now the key question is whether Donald Trump's fiscal fuel will raise the economy's speed limit, allowing for faster growth without pushing inflation much above the Fed's comfort zone.On Thursday, ADP reported that private employers added 153,000 jobs in December, somewhat less than expected. The ADP has an uneven record of predicting Labor's nonfarm payrolls. Meanwhile, initial jobless claims tumbled by 28,000 to 235,000 in the week ended Dec. 260,000.Incoming evidence from corporate earnings reports suggests that wage pressures are continuing to rise moderately.On a Dec. 6 earnings call, Dave & Buster's Entertainment (PLAY) said it expected wage inflation of about 5% in the fourth quarter, up from its September projection of 4% to 4.5% for the second half of 2016.Casey's General Stores (CASY) highlighted ""increased wage pressures"" on a Dec. 8 earnings call as the prime factor behind a 4.9% increase in same-store operating costs.Casey's management also said they would stick by a planned annual salary increase of $10 million to avoid overtime pay under the Obama administration's Labor Department rule that was to take effect on Dec. 1., even though the election and an eleventh-hour injunction mean it's unlikely to be implemented without major changes.While it would be hard for any company to retract commitments for pay hikes once announced, Chief Financial Officer Bill Walljasper said the decision is in keeping with Casey's goal ""to be the employer of choice in our market area, and so part of that for us is to have competitive wages at competitive benefits.""Wal-Mart (WMT) boosted minimum salaries for assistant store managers to $48,500 from $45,000, effective in September, to avoid being liable for overtime pay.""Labor is under some pressure,"" Darden Restaurants (DRI) CEO Gene Lee said on a Dec. 20 earnings call, when asked about the company's guidance for modestly higher labor inflation.""We're operating in a low unemployment situation and in that environment we're going to continue to see wage increases,"" Lee said, according to a Seeking Alpha transcript. But he added that such environments have been ""great for our business"" in the past, and he's optimistic that ""this wage inflation that we're seeing is going to turn into discretionary income and some of it's going to end up back in our restaurants.""RELATED:Jobless Rate Dives To 9-Year Low; Is Labor Market Too Tight?How Overtime Pay Ruling Affects Wal-Mart, Dollar Tree, Fast Food

148,ADP,"Treasuries whipsawed between gains and losses after minutes from the Federal Reserve's December meeting showed officials focused on a gradual pace of interest-rate hikes, while seeing risks stemming from fiscal policy spurring faster economic growth and a stronger dollar providing a headwind.The benchmark 10-year U.S. yield fell about one basis point to 2.43% at 4:12 p.m. in New York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. It fell as low as 2.43% and rose as high as about 2.47% after the release of the minutes of the Dec. 13-14 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, when officials raised rates for the first time in a year.The Fed minutes were ""less hawkish, but not dovish,"" said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets.About half of the FOMC participants incorporated an assumption of more expansionary fiscal policy in their forecasts; however, several others pointed out that a further rise in the dollar might continue to hold down inflation. At least two bearish elements drew focus: the risk of ""a sizable undershooting of the longer-run normal unemployment rate"" that could force the Fed to raise rates faster, and the possibility that a change to the fed funds rate path ""could also have implications for the reinvestment of proceeds"" from maturing debt on the Fed's balance sheet.Bonds declined in most eurozone markets, led by France into the European close.

173,ADP,"Small caps got drilled and helped drag the rest of the market lower on Monday. Amid a relatively quiet news day on the corporate front, the decline underscored a need for U.S. stocks to take a break after three weeks of postelection frenzied buying.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) showed relative strength, as its loss of just 0.2% to 111.57 allowed the No. 1 firm in the Nasdaq in terms of market cap and revenue to hold above a recent 110.33 buy point.Apple broke out of a cup with handle at 110.33 on Sept. 14, rallied nearly 8%, then retreated to give back all of that decent gain. However, the stock also held up above its 200-day moving average, a good sign for long-term holders.The Russell 2000 slumped 1.3% on Monday, finishing nearly at session lows, after rising 10.2% during the week of Donald Trump's surprising White House victory, then adding another 2.6% and 2.4% in the prior two weeks of trading.The S&P SmallCap 600 fell 1.2%. The S&P 500 dropped 0.5% while the Nasdaq composite and the NYSE composite both slid around 0.6%.Volume was sharply higher on Monday vs. Friday's half-day session, according to preliminary data. So technically speaking, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 both chalked up a distribution day.Apple continues to be coy with its 50-day moving average, which is near 113. Watch to see if any positive news related to holiday shopping reports will help lift the megacap tech play above this key technical line.On a positive note, Apple's Accumulation/Distribution Rating is currently a C+, according to IBD Stock Checkup. This points to a slight net accumulation over the past 13 weeks by institutional investors.Also, the Street has recently lifted its consensus profit view for fiscal 2017 (up 9% to $9.05 a share) and fiscal 2018 (up 11%). Apple's fiscal year ends in September.Elsewhere, small-cap IPOs were not immune from the heavy profit taking. Airgain (AIRG) slid more than 14% lower to 20 in triple average trade. The micro-cap play ($151 million market value, 4 million share float) is still up 17% past a proper IPO base buy point of 17.04.Airgain, which specializes in antenna technology to improve Wi-Fi connections, went public at 8 a share on Aug. 12.Also in the stock market today, gold mining and select utility stocks in the diversified, electric power and water supply areas bucked the decline, gaining 1% to 4% each. Foreign telecom, retail drugstore chain and newspaper stocks also thrived.Finisar (FNSR) also went against the grain, gapping up at the open and rising 3.7% to 33.97 in the heaviest volume in nearly four weeks. The maker of transmitters and transceivers for fiber optic telecommunications networks moved further past a 31.52 flat-base entry point and is now extended.. Investors generally should not buy a stock more than 5% past the proper entry.Finisar got positive comments from two Wall Street equity analysts who expect a strong second quarter in the period ended Oct. 31. Finisar is slated to report results after the market close on Dec. 8. Finisar's Telecom-Fiber Optic industry group has fallen from the top spot in IBD's 197 industry group rankings yet still is squarely within the top 40.Finisar has rallied as much as 81% from an earlier breakout in late July; that breakout began in quiet trade, but the stock held above its 50-day moving average. Volume eventually heated up in mid-August.The biggest declines of the day belonged to cement and concrete firms, oil explorers, department store chains and biotechs. All of these industry groups dropped well more than 2.5% for the day.On Tuesday, the market will be watching the revised report on U.S. third-quarter GDP growth. The ADP private sector jobs survey for November comes out early Wednesday.RELATED:Why Apple Formed The Bottoming Base, And Why It's Important For InvestorsWhen Did Apple Initially Break Out?Why These Two Analysts Are Upbeat On Finisar's Earnings

174,ADP,"Paycom Software (PAYC) is a rare bird these days — a fast-growing vendor of cloud-based applications that's also quite profitable.In this case, Oklahoma City-based Paycom has managed to make its mark providing payroll processing and human capital management software in an integrated offering to U.S. companies.Paycom stock has been a big winner this year, with shares up 30% so far in 2016. Its stock ended trading Thursday down fractionally to 48.75. It went public at 15 in April 2014.""The company has consistently outperformed expectations, is expected to grow well over 40% in 2016, and is nicely profitable — a rare combination in the cloud software space,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst David Hynes said in a recent note to clients. He rates Paycom stock as a buy with a price target of 55.Paycom focuses mostly on small and midsize companies with 50 to 2,000 workers for its software-as-a-service. That keeps it under the radar of larger firms such as payroll-processing leader ADP (ADP) and cloud-based human resources software provider Workday (WDAY).Still, ADP is considered to be among its main rivals, along with Paychex (PAYX), Paylocity (PCTY) and Ultimate Software (ULTI), RBC Capital Markets analyst Ross MacMillan said in a note to clients. He rates Paycom stock as sector perform with a price target of 54.While most providers of payroll and HR software tick off all the necessary boxes for functionality, Paycom excels in several ways, MacMillan said.For starters, its software is based off a core system of records maintained in a single database. Since the Paycom software is essentially a single application, it is easier for administrators to manage, MacMillan points out.""We believe our success is due to the growing recognition of the benefits that can be gained from Paycom's single database architecture,"" Paycom Chief Executive Chad Richison said on a conference call with analysts on Aug. 2.Paycom's software also is sold directly to customers through agents in regional sales offices.""Paycom has a very clear playbook for driving growth by adding customers and by increasing the average recurring revenue per customer,"" MacMillan's report says.Its customer growth strategy is based on expanding its sales organization through new regional offices across the U.S. Paycom has 42 sales offices now with line of sight to about 124 possible offices, MacMillan said.""We are still in the early stages of a multiyear mission to gain market share and grow into one of the largest providers of cloud-based payroll and human capital management software,"" Richison said.MacMillan believes Paycom can grow its sales by 25% or more for the next three years by adding new customers and increasing revenue per customer.HR management today is all about regulatory compliance and benefits, so Paycom and the industry benefit when the government imposes new employee rules on companies.For instance, Paycom has gotten a boost from selling software to help companies comply with the Affordable Care Act, aka ObamaCare.The company also recently released a tool kit to comply with changes to the Fair Labor Standards Act, allowing customers to make strategic decisions related to new overtime pay regulations.IBD'S TAKE: Paycom stock sports a best-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99 and is ranked No. 1 in IBD's Computer Software-Enterprise industry group. Paycom also is on the IBD 50 list of superior stocks.Another area for compliance involves meeting diversity requirements.Paycom says it helps companies effectively navigate a rapidly changing business environment. Its software is designed to manage employees from recruitment through retirement.The market for cloud and outsourced payroll processing and related human capital management services is worth about $25 billion to $30 billion a year in the U.S. and is growing in the high single digits, MacMillan said.""We think Paycom can address up to $14 billion of the payroll/HCM market,"" MacMillan said. ""Paycom's calendar 2016 revenue forecast of $326 million suggests the company has single digit share.Paycom likely gets about half its new customers by winning business away from ADP and, to a lesser extent, Paychex, he said. The rest it pulls from small regional players running payroll-centric licensing software and from in-house and on-premises services like Microsoft (MSFT) Dynamics GP and Sage.Paycom is scheduled to report third-quarter results after the market close on Nov. 1.In the second quarter, Paycom reported earnings per share of 21 cents excluding items, up 110% year over year, on sales of $73.9 million, up 51%. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting 13 cents EPS minus items on sales of $70.6 million.For the September quarter, analysts are looking for Paycom to earn 11 cents a share excluding items, up 38%, on sales of $76.7 million, up 39%.Paycom is starting to face difficult comparisons to big year-ago quarters, so its growth rate is likely to decelerate, MacMillan said.There's a lot to like about Paycom, MacMillan said. He just thinks the stock is fairly valued at current levels.Shares have been in a base of late, but neared a breakout point in Monday trades, climbing nearly 5% to close at 52.44.RELATED:How Big Will The 2016, 2017 Earnings Increases Be For Major Stock Leaders?

IBD spells out how to take those first steps toward a pay raise in another news report.In the follow-up phase of your negotiation, here's what to do if you don't get what you want. In fact, this is why it's called a negotiation. These steps can help you persuade your boss to change his tune from no or maybe to yes.Remember, the process starts by digging up data about how much people who do your job as well as you get paid; by making a list of your accomplishments in boosting income or cutting company costs; by scheduling a meeting with your boss and, if it's not the same person, with the manager who decides whether you get a raise. Put the amount of pay you want into a short, clear memo that describes what you want, how much comparable workers are paid and why you believe you deserve it.If your request is turned down, here's how to proceed:If the rejection is not because you don't deserve a raise but instead because it's the wrong time in your employer's budget cycle, ask when the right time would be to schedule another meeting to discuss the topic. If the company says it can't afford to pay more, ask how you will be able to know when company finances will allow raises.If the rejection is personal, ask your boss to spell out what you need to do to justify a pay raise. Are there specific tasks you should undertake? Are there skills you need to master? Are there productivity, income or cost-cutting goals to must achieve? Also, ask if you must achieve those things within a set time span.Finally, ask how soon after reaching those targets you can set a new meeting to revisit your pay raise.Tatum said, ""Tell your boss, 'Let me understand what's behind that offer. My information shows that people in my job get paid X number of dollars in this metro area on average.' Or, 'I have earned this much money or saved that much money for the company.' Or, 'You set XYZ goals, I accomplished them, here's what people are paid elsewhere, this is where I am, here's where I ought to be. Why not give me the full the amount I'm requesting, which reflects that income or savings or ability to meet goals you've set?'""If that does not prompt your boss to raise his offer, tell him you'd like to think about what he has said. Ask what time tomorrow you can have a follow-up meeting. You might be steaming inside, but keep calm. Don't laugh, don't make insults. Then, or at the follow-up meeting, present your points. Then say this is what I think my pay should be.
"
187,ADP,"Want a pay raise? Of course you do. The real question is: What's the best way to get it?Wages rose an average 4.6% for all full-time workers in the first quarter of 2016, according to a report by ADP, a payroll processing firm.That's a nice step up. U.S. paychecks grew a meager 2.25% a year on average over the two years ended in March, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.But waiting for a raise to fall into your lap is chancy. If you don't ask for one, you may not get one. Or you may get less than you'd like. ""If you don't ask, you are less likely to get the raise now, which could impact future raises and opportunities,"" said Lisa Skeete Tatum, co-founder and CEO of Landit.com, a platform whose goal is to increase the success of women in the workplace.Experts suggest several ways to take control and boost your odds of getting the raise you want. Here are eight steps for negotiating a pay raise that's satisfying:If you get the raise you want, mission accomplished.If you get turned down at first? There are tactics for dealing with that too.

205,ADP,"Private-sector employers continued to hire at a steady rate this month, adding 200,000 jobs after a slightly downward revised 209,300 in February, the ADP National Employment Report.Services firms accounted for 190,900 new hires, the vast bulk of new employment. Manufacturing added 2,600 jobs after losing 8,600 jobs in February. Boeing (BA) said Wednesday it would cut 4,550 jobs.Small firms led the way, adding 85,700 jobs, while large enterprises' net hiring slowed to 38,800. But year-over-year, large firms are adding jobs at the fastest pace since May 2012, while small business hiring is the weakest since mid-2014.Also, franchise employment rose by 22,000 in March and 4.1% vs. a year earlier, largely on restaurant franchise gains.  The National Labor Relations Board and several minimum wage hike efforts are singling out the franchise model used by McDonald's (MCD), Yum Brands (YUM) and many other fast-food chains.The Labor Department will release its March employment report on Friday. Economists expect to see a rise in nonfarm payrolls, including government jobs, of 210,000. They also expect a rise in hourly earnings and the average workweek, after weekly pay fell a stunning 0.5% last month.Image provided by Shutterstock.

206,ADP,"Paychex’s (PAYX) quarterly revenue came in slightly ahead of Wall Street estimates, while its earnings were in line with views. But shares for the provider of payroll assistance dropped more than 2% in the early going Wednesday.Paychex said that its third-quarter revenue rose 7% to $752.6 million as it provided more payroll services, added new customers and saw its revenue per check climb. Analysts had predicted revenue at $751.2 million.The company, which primarily serves small and medium-sized companies with minimum-premium health insurance and cloud-based accounting, said that its adjusted earnings were 50 cents a share.Paychex forecast its total service revenue for the fiscal year ending May 31 to grow 7% to 8%. The midpoint would be slightly below analyst consensus for roughly 7.6% revenue growth for the year.Human resources corporate services providers such as Paychex, Cintas (CTAS), Convergys (CVG), WageWorks (WAGE) and ExlService Holdings (EXLS) have expanded recently, in part by assisting companies at complying with ObamaCare regulations in the health insurance market.During the quarter, Paychex began integrating Advance Partners, a provider of financial, operational and strategic services that it purchased on Dec. 22 for an undisclosed sum. The acquisition added 1% to third-quarter revenue, Paychex said.""We are pleased with execution during our selling season, in particular in the midmarket space,"" Chief Executive Martin Mucci said in a written statement.Paychex stock has been in a first-stage consolidation for nearly three months with a 54.88 buy point.

207,ADP,"Hello Barbie says, ""Privacy breach"" to plaintiffs in a lawsuit that’s testing the boundaries of security in the Internet of Things age.Mattel (MAT), the maker of the interactive doll, is among those being sued on grounds that the doll picks up and records the voices of the children who play with the doll, voices that it uploads and stores without parental consent.The unusual case was filed in December in Los Angeles County Superior Court. Other defendants include San Francisco-based ToyTalk, which partnered with Mattel to produce the doll; and Los Angeles-based Samet Privacy, which does business as the kidSAFE Seal Program that lists, reviews and certifies interactive and online products as compliant with the federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA.“The problem is parents and children don’t really know that ToyTalk is going to use their child’s conversation for data mining and other purposes not fully disclosed,” said Steve Teppler of the Abbott Law Group in Jacksonville, Fla. “They say they’ll protect the child of the purchasing parent’s identity, but what about friends’ children?”Abbott Law Group represents the plaintiffs in the case: Ashley Archer-Hayes of Vista, Calif., who bought the doll, and her minor child; and Charity Johnson of Chula Vista, Calif., and her minor child “on behalf of all others similarly situated,” states the suit. The children of Johnson and Archer-Hayes are friends, and they played with Hello Barbie at a Barbie-themed birthday party late last year, the suit says.The suit is one of many dealing with the untapped online frontier that is the Internet of Things, referring to products used in everyday life that are increasingly connected with the Internet and that store information online. These products range from cars to home security systems.On its website, kidSAFE describes Hello Barbie as “the first fashion doll that can have a two-way conversation with girls. The doll features speech recognition and progressive learning features that enable girls to engage with Barbie like never before. Hello Barbie features more than 8,000 lines of dialogue, inspires imagination and storytelling, plays more than 20 interactive games, and tells jokes.”Although Hello Barbie must be registered to activate, and the registration process includes information relating to privacy, plaintiffs argue that Hello Barbie will pick up voices of a child’s friends, and those voices will be uploaded and stored without parental knowledge, let alone consent.Interactive toys like Hello Barbie are expected to proliferate. How can parents stay informed about the privacy policies of each toy?“That’s the problem,” Teppler said. “What are your choices? You could make the doll only perform with the registered user, but that’s not the way the toy is designed. To comply with COPPA, you’d have to have a waiver for the user of the child’s voice. We don’t know what ToyTalk’s affiliates do with this information.”Teppler raised the possibility that information stored on ToyTalk computers could become discoverable in litigation, for example, if kids start talking about their parents’ activities.“It’s an interesting evidentiary issue,” said Teppler. “The terms of service say the purchasing parents can access the recordings for two years, but can they get them erased? You could deactivate your account, but they would still have the recordings.”Mattel would not make someone available for an interview, but spokesman Alex Clark said in an email, “While we do not comment on pending litigation, I can tell you Mattel is committed to ensuring every product we make meets or exceeds all applicable laws and regulations. In addition, we are confident in the robust data security technology used in our Hello Barbie product.”For its part, kidSAFE has rated Hello Barbie as “COPPA certified.”Ben Warlick, an attorney with Morris, Manning and Martin in Atlanta, says that plaintiffs have an uphill battle to recovery because Mattel and other defendants don’t control how a child uses the toy.“Plaintiffs pointed out suggestions for what Mattel could have done, including notifying parents that the toy should not be used outside the presence of other nonregistered children,” Warlick said. “But I do not think it’s a realistic argument to tell a child not to play with a toy around other kids; that’s hard to do.”Warlick, who co-chairs his firm’s Internet of Things practice group, says that the Hello Barbie case is likely just one of the first of many that will test the bounds of privacy protection in the Internet of Things age.“We started the new practice group because we’re finding that universal notions of privacy and security don’t necessarily translate to the Internet of Things,” he said.Warlick says that an argument can be made that interactive devices should have higher security and encryption features, “but many little battery-powered devices like weather or pet monitors may not have the processing power to run encryption or robust security measures.”Similar suits have been filed against ADP home security systems and Vizio smart TV sets.“It’s a real issue for product developers in this area,” Warlick said, “about what is the right level of security and encryption for these devices.”

208,ADP,"Treasuries fell, led by 30-year bonds, as traders looked to U.S. employment data for the next clue to the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate path.Longer-dated U.S. debt retraced gains a day after Fed Chair Janet Yellen sent yields tumbling when she said in a speech that caution in raising rates was “especially warranted.” A report from the ADP Research Institute showed the U.S. added more jobs than forecast in March ahead of Labor Department data due April 1. The difference between yields on two- and 30-year Treasuries, known as the yield curve, climbed to the highest since Feb. 18.The ADP report ""may have caused some traders to back away from bets that payrolls will disappoint on Friday,"" said Jim O’Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics Ltd in Valhalla, New York. ""It adds to the evidence that the trend in employment growth remains strong, despite the global economic and financial developments that Fed officials continue to worry about.""Investors are assessing the outlook for the $13.3 trillion Treasuries market after Yellen said global economic risks may slow the pace of policy tightening, even amid signs of U.S. economic strength. The Labor Department report will show the U.S. added 205,000 jobs this month, while the pace of wage gains held steady at a 2.2% annual rate, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists. A report this week showed core U.S. inflation remains below the central bank’s 2% target.The yield on the 30-year bond, which is more sensitive to longer-term expectations for inflation and economic growth, rose five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 2.65% as of 5 p.m. ET, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data.The 2.5% security due in February 2046 fell $10.94 per $1,000 face amount, to 96-27/32.The gap between yields on two- and 30-year Treasuries steepened for a second day, rising to 1.89 percentage points.“With the Fed now more reluctant to hike than previous perception suggested, the notion that inflation could bounce back and steepen up the curve makes sense,” said Ian Lyngen a government-bond strategist at CRT Capital Group LLC in Stamford, Connecticut.Companies added 200,000 workers in March, according to figures released Wednesday from Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey called for a 195,000 March advance.The U.S. sold $28 billion of seven-year securities Wednesday at a yield of 1.606%, the last of three note auctions this week totaling $88 billion.

209,ADP,"And as expected - stocks did very little yesterday...in yesterday's note - I suggested that we would remain in the 2055/2065 range with no reason at all to do much else....in fact yesterday's range was 2057/2063 - and there were no fireworks, no end of month or end of qtr surprises at all as investors were just happy to see the end of the qtr come (and go)! In the end the Dow end the qtr with a 1.5% gain and the S&P had a 0.8% gain.Now you could credit yesterday's lack of activity to both exhaustion and reluctance by anyone to do anything ahead of today's NFP report and the host of other macro data points that will bombard us today......... Remember today is April 1st - otherwise known as April Fool's Day around the world....now while its origin is unknown - it is a day defined by tricks, tomfoolery and hoaxes - all designed to make someone look like an April Fool..... So the question today is:Will today's NFP report just be an April Fool's joke? Mkt expectations are calling for an increase of 205k jobs created in March - now remember last month the call was for +195k and the gov't came out and told us that we really created 242k jobs! (Now THAT is a joke.....).....on Wednesday - the ADP reported a slightly higher number of jobs created + 200k (vs. the expected 195k), and they raised the prior month from 205k to 214k......this now suggests that we will get a stronger NFP report.... and to that I say - ""April Fools!!!""Other eco data due out today includes:

US futures are down 9 pts in early pre-mkt trading.....Now remember - it is a NEW qtr...the slate has been wiped clean and the odometer has been reset to zero.....The dollar continues to come under pressure, oil appears to be de-coupling from the broader mkt - the recent rally in oil driven more by the dollar action vs. any real change in fundamentals.....Gold - which has seen a dramatic 16% gain over the past 3 months is now coming under a bit of pressure as investors decipher the tea leaves over the future of US and global economics. If the data begins strengthen then logic tells us that Gold should weaken (think other more dynamic opportunities) but if the global economies continue to stall or weaken then watch Gold spike higher yet again (think the safe haven play)....Earnings are now clearly in the bulls eye as investors prepare themselves for the onslaught of coming earnings over the next 3 weeks.The WSJ runs with a headline article this morning detailing the state of the IPO (Initial Public Offering) mkt.""Lackluster IPO Market Flashes Warning - Pace for initial public offerings is slowest first qtr since 2009, and analysts warn that second period may not bring much relief""In this article the writer tries to connect the dots between the lack of new product and investor appetite for risk...... I am not sure that is the connection...investor appetite will be fed by interesting and dynamic product as well as realistic valuations for these untested products.....it is the purest form of mkt dynamics that rewards proper risk taking......Investment by PE firms, Venture Capital Firm and large asset management firms have push valuations to extremes and maybe investors are finally waking up the idea that these extreme valuations reward nobody but the investment banks and the insiders looking to unload these 'over valued' shares.Yesterday we learned that many of the big asset managers (Fidelity, Blackrock, TRowe Price etc....) - the same ones that have invested in private start ups (PRE-IPO) have pushed valuations to 'extreme' levels and are now taking - 'hair cuts' ( I think it was described as an AX) to valuation estimates for these privately held (difficult to value) companies. I would argue that it was THESE asset managers themselves that are responsible for the crazy valuations creating ' Unicorns' that they now are the focus of investor angst.[A Unicorn is usually a startup company that does NOT have any established performance metrics but have a supposed stock mkt valuation of more than $1 billion dollars]So now that all of these asset managers are having a 'V-8' moment and becoming more realistic - we are beginning to see a change in psychology.....Should these companies really have such ridiculous valuations? Apparently not! And these very markdowns have sucked the life out of the momentum - making it harder for investment banks to 'sell this story' at the ridiculous valuations that they have tried to convince us all of....So now you get untested, overvalued private companies that think they are going to cash out at 'X' and are now told that ""maybe that is not the case""......they may have to settle for something more realistic like 'Y'....and they don't want that - so they don't come to the mkt....It's like the guy that says my house is worth $1 mil while everything around him is trading at $400k......HELLO??? Does this remind anyone of the late 90's DOT.COM bubble?????Global mkts begin the new qtr all in the RED - (no one should be surprised at all).

Next door in China - we did see China Manf PMI rise (surprise) to a 9 month high of 50.2 vs. the est of 49.4. All of this just noise as all eyes are focused on the US - after all the drama of the past couple of weeks. Japan - 3.5%, Hong Kong -1.34%, China +0.12% and ASX -1.64%.In Europe - PMI""s were than the flash estimates, but the weakness in Japan ended up stealing the show....Volumes remain subdued as European investors count the minutes until the US jobs report.

226,ADP,"So yesterday Janet came out swinging - admitting that the world is on the edge or a recession saying:""Given the risks to the outlook, I consider it appropriate for the committee to proceed cautiously in adjusting policy.....the key is that the global economic and financial backdrop looms more threateningly now than before.........and even though officials expect the US economy to weather any further rough patches, the dangers can't be ignored""Let me be clear - she did NOT give any details on timing whatsoever and now the feeling is that if we get any rate rise at all - it will just ONE and it may not be in June....So we can forget all the chatter about 'multiple increases'.... and should the economy take a turn for the worse - she assured the invitees that the FED could still take steps to resuscitate the economy - think 'forward guidance' (which is just another word for Jawboning - which is what she did yesterday as she 'guided' expectations), the other trick up her sleeve would be the launch of an ECB style bazooka..... but either way - she put the idea of any increase to bed and she essentially told the 5 non-compliant FED mouthpieces to 'assume the position' and prepare to get spanked for insinuating last week that rates are due to rise in April -.......And the mkt roared! Investors and traders immediately hit the BUY button on their computers sending the S&P up 17 pts or 0.8% and the Dow up 97 pts or 0.6%.....Remember - last week - CNBC.com ran with a headline article about how ""Fed Chair Yellen has a mini revolt on her hands"" as 5 FED presidents took to the airwaves to suggest that the FED was falling behind the curve and that the mkt (and investors) should expect rates to rise in April. Now it appears that Janet was not happy about that development - And whether or not there is a bit of dissension in the ranks - as the French proverb goes: ""Il faut laver son linge sale en famille"" ......or ""Never wash your dirty laundry in public"".... and that is what they were doing.......washing their 'dirty laundry' for all to see in the name of 'transparency'. And what does that transparency show - it shows a complete mess within the ranks as no one really knows what to do....so staying the course appears to be the best answer for now.....Oh boy.....this story gets more interesting as the hours tick by.....I am beginning to re-think this whole transparency issue - Is it in fact the best thing for the mkts? Does it create more angst and instability for investors and traders? Would Paul Volker ever run the FED like this? (A: NO) Does the FED secretly want more instability to keep everyone guessing? As far as I am concerned - they can do what they want 'behind closed doors' but once they open those doors and the FED chair speaks then that should be it. Period the end. Whatever happened to loyalty? This business of then letting everyone in the FED run hog wild over any network that will have them is getting a bit exhausting. Because in the end - what does it really accomplish besides mass confusion and mkt instability? It is not helpful for investors nor businesses that are trying to plan for the future - it also does not help the individual as he/she plans for the future. The constant sense of angst concerning (global) monetary policy is unnecessary - and quite honestly has created a global monster...Just look around the world and tell me what you see....I think the worst part of all this is what are we really talking about? 25 bps?

THAT WAS DRAMATIC! (But that was a different time......Ronald Reagan was president and America was on the verge of an incredible resurgence...)Once again - let's point out how legislators have done zero to assist the FED by being creative and pro-active with fiscal policy....But that's another story - one that we see unfolding right in front of us via the Presidential election......People are disgusted and rightly so.....Does anyone in DC understand that?Overnight - stocks rallied - (duh), credit mkts rallied, commodities (think oil) rallied and the dollar continued to slide lower - extending its worst month in 5 yrs. The VIX also moved lower - sliding 9% taking it to its lowest level of the year.....what does this mean? It means that there is a fair amount of complacency in the mkt - no real sense of fear...of course not - Janet has once again tucked it tightly in bed - kissing it on the head, saying 'Mommy loves you... now go to sleep'..... and this is right in front of what is expected to be a weak earnings season.... so the plot thickens.Stocks in Asia and Europe shot higher on the news....with the exception of Japan that got hit with a huge drop in Industrial Production - sending the Nikkei down 1.5%. Hong Kong +2.15%, China + 2.77% and the ASX +0.1%.European mkts following in lock step with Asia and the US....FTSE +1.7%, CAC 40 + 1.9%, DAX + 1.7%, EUROSTOXX +1.6%, SPAIN +1.5% and ITALY + 1.45%US Futures are up another 11 pts in pre-mkt trading......taking the futures index up to 2060.....which will send the cash index up to 2067 if this holds.....I suspect that 2075 should be another level of resistance - but anything is possible now.... Eco data today includes Mort Apps which fell by 1%, and the ADP employment report which is due to show an increase of something approaching +195k jobs.....We will be entertained by one FED speaker today.....Chicago's own Charlie Evans.....(an admitted DOVE). He will be on CNBC Squawk box at 8:30 just after the ADP release, he will also be speaking at the Forecasters Club of NY at 1 pm.Remember that this is end of month and qtr...so a rally would do so many people so much good - especially ahead of April 15th....(Tax day)..... Either way -Take Good Care

229,ADP,"The stock market shook off a weak start to score big gains Tuesday, after dovish remarks by Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen.The Nasdaq composite surged 1.7%, while the S&P 500 rose 0.9%, and the Dow Jones industrial average added 0.6%. Small caps also fared well, with the Russell 2000 up 2.7%. Volume was sharply higher across the board vs. Monday, according to preliminary figures.Winners topped losers by a nearly 4-to-1 margin on the NYSE and by more than 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq. Gold miners, software makers and chip stocks were among the top gainers in the stock market today. Consumer electronics and oil stocks lagged. West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures fell more than 2% to $38.43 a barrel, extending their slide for a fifth straight session.After the close, Sonic (SONC) was trading 3% higher on a fiscal Q2 earnings and sales beat. The burger chain also boosted its full-year earnings and same-store sales outlook. Shares had edged slightly lower during the regular session and were just shy of a 33.04 cup-with-handle buy point.Dave & Buster's (PLAY) was down slightly in extended trading after reporting Q4 results that topped views. The stock rose 2% during the regular session and is building the right side of a base.Apple (AAPL) led the Dow with a 2.4% advance, its biggest one-day gain in nearly a month. The stock, up 16% from its Jan. 28 low, is still nearly 20% off its high. The FBI on Monday withdrew its order for Apple to hack into the iPhone used by Syed Farook, one of the two perpetrators of the December mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. Apple had been fighting the order since mid-February.Microsoft (MSFT) was the second-biggest gainer on the blue chip index, climbing 2.2% as the stock nears a 55.19 buy point of a double-bottom base. The software giant is reportedly among companies interested in bidding for troubled Internet firm Yahoo (YHOO), shares of which rose 3.1% Tuesday.The IBD 50 outperformed, with 46 advancers and four decliners. Telecom play Broadsoft (BSFT) led with a 6% jump, which broke out past a 39.20 buy point. TAL Education (XRS), Universal Display (OLED) and Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI) all rose more than 3%.On the economic front, consumer confidence came in better than expected for March, while the S&P/Case-Shiller 20-City Composite Index for January showed a 5.7% jump in home prices.Economic data due out Wednesday include the ADP employment report for March and the weekly mortgage applications and petroleum status reports.

230,ADP,"Thanks Janet. Stocks wiped out small early-morning losses Tuesday, soon after the most powerful banker in the world reiterated a ""go slow"" approach toward raising short-term interest rates. The major indexes then kept rumbling higher, right into the finish. Volume jumped sharply on both main exchanges. The gains in heavier volume reflected anxious buying (and quite likely some short covering)…
"
231,ADP,"Stocks chopped as neither the bulls nor the bears made a stand, volume was the lowest so far for 2016, and many global mkts had remained closed for what is known as the Easter Monday Holiday......leaving very little for traders or investors to chomp on......and so the S&P did nothing really other than bounce around moving both north and south of the unchanged line some 20 times - and at the final bell was up 1 pt to close at 2037.The lack of action is more reflective of the uncertainty over the near term direction the 1Q earnings season and the uncertainty over FED policy.....Recall that last week - we saw a revolt within the central bank......on the 16th - Janet assured the world that rates were fine right where they were for now (all the while leaving June as the next launch date).....concern over global macro issues and mkt turmoil had given rise to continued caution in terms of US monetary policy...the mkts loved it and rallied hard exploding thru what should have been more significant resistance at the 200 dma....but on the back of the renewed ECB commitment to stimulus and Janet's commitment to 'lower for longer' - investors/traders went on a buying binge - some to 'get more long' while others scrambled to cover 'short positions' (or those bearish bets) on the future direction of stocks.That took us up and thru resistance only to fail at the 2050 level when the revolt began....5 different members of the FED came out and challenged her publicly....defying the data, ignoring the protocol.....each one suggesting that not only should rates rise - they should do so in April....smack in the middle of what is expected to be a weak earnings season.... the mkts stumbled, unable to advance as confusion set in..... but they did not collapse either - or not yet anyway.....Were these bozo's just testing the water? Were they trying to gauge investor sentiment? Was this all a ploy to divert the conversation away from the broader geo-political issues - ISIS, Brussels, Oil, a weakening Europe, Obama's visit to Cuba and his Tango in Argentina and even the comedic stupidity of the Presidential election as two of the GOP contenders running for the highest office in the country succumb to middle school antics?OK...so today - all mkts are back online and the focus is returning to what should be the drivers of mkt action. Investors and traders returned to their desks after the long weekend and now are focusing on the end of the month action, coming macro data and what Janet will say today when she speaks at the Economic Club of NY at 12:20 pm (est)....Overnight - San Fran's Fed President Williams is the latest to opine on monetary policy this morning.... You see - he is in Singapore - and gave 'prepared remarks' to an audience at the National University there about US monetary policy - because that is important.........and in it he appeared to join in with his fellow bankers while never really committing to any hard and fast date - as he said -""Others' economic fate do now spell our own.....My view is essentially, let's just stay on track. Let's not get sidelined by the noise and distraction commentary can sometimes cause. We're not quite where I'd like us to be, but recent developments have been encouraging and add to my confidence that we're on course to reach our (inflation) goal. Overall the US economy keeps chugging ahead.""And so there is another vote for a rate increase - at some point - leaving him squarely 'on the fence' but suggesting that the next move should be UP and not DOWN- as he tried to assuage investor/trader angst.Now eco data this week includes a fair amount of information.....today we get lots of Case Shiller Home Price data......(nothing to get excited about), tomorrow brings us the ADP employment report and expectations are for +195k jobs.....Thursday includes ISM Milwaukee and the Chicago Purchasing Managers report.....on Friday - we get the monthly Non Farm Payroll report - and this time the gov't is promising us an increase of 210k jobs, (How many of those are minimum wage?), they expect unemployment to remain at 4.9% and are looking for average hourly wages to increase by 0.2%. Look for ISM Manf, Construction Spending, Labor Force Participation rates, ISM Prices Paid and ISM New orders. All of this macro data will set the stage for more trader speculation on the next FED move. What do FED Fund Futures say about an April increase?US futures are down 4 pts at 2024.....right now....there is no reason for the mkts to really rally hard at the moment.....but remember it is end of month and end of qtr..so the next couple of days could see increased volumes as portfolio managers 'clean up' ahead of the marking period. I continue to believe that we remain range bound within the 2020/2050 trading bands.The next move will come from the FED and if Janet surprises us and tells us that so much has changed in the last two weeks - and SHE puts April squarely on the table.... then watch for the mkt to test lower.....breaching the 2020 support to test the 1996 support level.I don't expect that she is going to divine the tea leaves for anybody today. It will be more of the same - where she plays the Dove and then releases the boys to contradict her to gauge investor and mkt sentiment. After that - then the mkts will settle in for month/qtr end and then prepare for the coming earnings season....which kicks off the week of April 4th.In Asia - stocks traded with a downside bias on some soft economic data. In Japan - the Unemployment Rate and Retail Sales both missed. Japan -0.18%, Hong Kong +0.1%, China -1.28%, ASX -1.57%,In Europe - stocks are edging higher ahead of Yellen’s speech. The Europeans are not convinced that rates are due to rise in April.....Michael Hewson - Chief Mkt analyst at CMC markets sums it up last week's chatter this way:""What was all the more puzzling was that last week's chatter was completely at odds with the recent dovish narrative of the most recent FOMC meeting""So - sit back and enjoy the show.....remember the mkt is now flat on the year and that is a WIN for many asset managers as we close out the qtr.....I suspect the mkt will hold tight thru Thursday....but then Friday is April 1st and the beginning of a new qtr.....Take Good Care

233,ADP,"Private employers added a net 213,800 jobs to their payrolls in February, up from 193,400 in January, ADP reported. The services sector accounted for virtually all of the gains, while manufacturing employment fell.Economists expected private payrolls to rise 185,000 last month.The services sector added 208,500 jobs, up 20% from January's downwardly revised 174,400 jobs added, ADP said. Broken down further, professional and business services added 59,000 jobs, up 55% from January. Trade/transportation/utilities added 20,000, down 30% from January.The 8,000 jobs added in the financial activities sector was the least since August. Bank of America (BAC) is reportedly planning investment banking cuts, according to various recent reports, after JPMorgan Chase (JPM) warned of a ""very tough"" quarter for investment banking.Manufacturing, battered by a strong dollar, weak global economic growth and an enervated energy sector, lost 8,900 jobs last month, the second-largest drop in five years. Halliburton (HAL) is among the companies who have announced fresh layoffs in recent days. Manufacturing employment rose 0.1% vs. a year earlier, the smallest gain since late 2010.But the overall goods sector increased jobs modestly, led by a gain in construction, which added 27,000 payrolls.Large businesses and small businesses added 76,000 jobs each, while medium-sized businesses added 62,000 jobs.ADP's report comes ahead of the Labor Department's employment report on Friday. Economists expect 190,000 non-farm payrolls were added in February. They see the unemployment rate holding at 4.9%.

234,ADP,"Let's just get this off the table NOW -And let the games begin .......We weren't 5 mins into the debate before FOX News lost complete control of the GOP debate, the issues and the candidates....As so many expected - the school yard fight between Rubio, Trump and Cruz continued to play out on the small screen...John Kasich - Ohio Governor - remained on the sidelines - taking the high road, choosing not to get drawn into the fray and showing the country that he is the most presidential of any of the GOP candidates....and who could blame him?In a continuation of Rubio's assessment about the size of Donald's HANDS - Trump made sure to let the world know that the size of his hands has nothing to do with the size of anything else and as expected today's NY POST runs with the headline:""Prickly Don Rips Below the Belt Jab - SIZE MATTERS""And now - US politics has fallen to a new low - and the GOP is frantic....while Hillary is all 'nestled in her bed with visions of sugar plums in her head!Stocks edged higher yesterday.....as they continue to build on the rally, a rally begun by the turnaround in oil/energy and financials....Healthcare and Tech continue to lag....The latest rally which begun 3 weeks ago has the S&P up 10% from the February 12th lows...and is now within just a couple of percentage points of going positive for the year, in what some will describe as yet another incredible Fed (and global central bank) pump!We have managed to break thru initial resistance at 1940 - and are now testing the weekly middle Bollinger Band line at 1996 - which is essentially the same level as the 100 dma at 1999. Now yesterday we closed at 1993 - right on the highs of the day, a bit over extended and hitting our heads on what is sure to be significant resistance. .....and today - the gov't will report on Non Farm Payrolls (NFP) - the expectation is for +190k jobs to have been created.....but many are now expecting an upside surprise after Wednesday's ADP surprise. Included in this report will be the Unemployment rate which is expected to remain at 4.9%, the labor participation rate which is expected to inch up to 62.8% and Avg hourly earnings - which are expected to show a 0.2% gain.While the mkt has managed to stage a very impressive countercyclical (bear mkt) rally, on what appears to be improving macro data - we do need to be concerned about what is happening to earnings estimates for the 1st qtr. Bloomberg tells us that forecasts have fallen 9.6% or DOUBLE the average rate. And why should this concern you? Well......if they prove to be correct then that will make 5 qtrs of negative growth......and 5 qtrs of negative growth typically produces a real bear mkt and not one of those swift 6 week affairs like we saw in Jan/Feb but one that is longer and more painful.Income amongst the S&P companies is now expected to decline by 8% this qtr while projections for profit gains have turned to declines for tech and consumer non-durables - bringing the number of industries with no growth to 7 out of 10. Street analysts are now projecting a 1.9% decline in profits for the 1st qtr and that is down from initial expectations of +3.7% growth rate in January....If these forecasts prove true then someone has a lot 'splainin' to do'....And talk about 'splainin - Across the pond in Europe - the talk turns to Eurozone Deflation.....and the last thing that they need is a building recession.....our friends at Credit Suisse made a bold call last week......"" if the euro zone were to relapse back into recession it is not clear it would endure.”Essentially - they are suggesting the days may be numbered for the European experiment..... The zone's 19 member states only managed to grow by 0.3% in the 4th qtr of 2015, despite all of the bond purchases initiated by the European Central Bank (ECB) and the benefit of weaker oil prices... and that is AFTER the Eurozone includes drug money and prostitution in their GDP figures...Now many of you are saying ""Come ON! Really! - Kenny, you must be mistaken...how could that be?"" Well - back in late 2014 - someone suggested that in order to bolster GDP - The EZ could benefit from including 'illegal activities' in their calculation......(incredible right?) and since then the calculation was changed to ""include Class A Drug Trade and the provision of prostitution services"" and these new components have added about 0.2% to EZ (Eurozone) GDP.( It is surprising that the Democrats have not adopted this same plan to help improve US GDP! - but it is still early in the game....)So now - as we know - the Europeans sit and wait until next week's ECB announcement - as they are expected to launch another round of QE while they force interest rates further into NEGATIVE territory. Now all this talk has helped precious metals....GOLD - trading at $1274/oz is now up 20% off of the December 2015 lows....having broken thru all 3 resistance levels as investors flocked to the safety of this precious metal when talk of NEGATIVE rates turned to reality....Next week will be important all around.... because if the ECB pushes negative interest rates even lower, gold will find even more support and will surely spike higher. If they disappoint and do less than expected then gold would consolidate these recent gains...based on the action - the smart money is betting that they won't be disappointed....Overnight - global mkts appear to be ending the week on a positive note...rallying broadly into the closing bells... There were no material economic reports released and the only news event overnight were comments made by BOJ Governor Kuroda - comments that downplayed the chances for any additional easing at the next Bank of Japan (BOJ) meeting next week. in Asia - Japan +0.32%, Hong Kong +1.1%, China +0.5% and ASX + 0.18%. In Europe mkts are also higher as they await our NFP report at 8:30 am. FTSE + 0.86%, CAC 40 + 0.89%, DAX + 0.91%, EUROSTOXX + 0.76%, SPAIN +0.37% and ITALY -0.47%.US futures are UP 3 pts as they pucker up and get ready to kiss S&P 2000. Psychologically this will be an important event...but if the NFP report is stronger than expected then the talk returns to a rate hike on the table this month (almost impossible) and we could see some profit taking....If the NFP number is surprisingly weak (Unlikely) then talk of lower for longer will be the headline and then look for a real test of resistance. I continue to believe we will remain in the 1940/2000 trading range until after the FED meeting....Take Good Care

236,ADP,"Stocks opened to thin losses Wednesday, but the Nasdaq flicked in and out of positive territory.The Dow industrials and S&P 500 eased about 0.1% each, with the Nasdaq moving between fractional gains and losses.Things might have been worse in the stock market today, but a strong February employment report from ADP helped shore up some confidence before the start of trade. Still, the market may be hanging back ahead of the Fed's March Beige Book report, due at 2 p.m. ET. It is the last before the Federal Open Market Committee's March 14-15 meeting, and it could have some impact on afternoon trade.Oil prices stuck to their early losses, with West Texas Intermediate down almost 2% and Brent crude trading 1% lower. The Energy Information Administration reports its weekly inventory data at 10:30 a.m. ET. The weekly inventories estimate from the American Petroleum Institute indicated Tuesday that inventories rose 9.9 million barrels last week, vs. consensus views for a 2.5 million barrel increase.Dow stocks opened generally lower. Apple (AAPL), Pfizer (PFE) and Merck (MRK) crept higher, all with gains of less than 0.3%. DuPont (DD) and Nike (NKE) led the downside, with losses of 0.9% and 2%, respectively.On the S&P 500, Monsanto (MON) tumbled 5% after management guided its Q2 and full-year earnings below consensus expectations. Dollar Tree (DLTR) shed 3% after its fourth-quarter earnings fell more than expected and a 117% revenue gain stopped short of analyst forecasts.Small caps were performing comparatively well as the S&P 600 generated some big moves.

238,ADP,"It was a SUPER TUESDAY in America.....March came in like a LION as global investors grabbed for anything that wasn't nailed down and......Some would have you believe it was a MAGA (Make America Great Again) rally.....I say - 'not so fast cowboy.....it ain't over until the fat lady sings......'Voters went to the polls to try and cull the Presidential field......Democrats pulling for Hill as she looks to be the anointed leader of that party (although Sanders has not conceded, but should) .....while the GOP is still struggling trying to find their next leader......The Donald would have you believe it is him as he continues to cause earthquakes every time he opens his mouth and now that it looks like he could really snatch it - the calls from the GOP establishment get louder and louder to STOP him.......as the party spins out of control.............. Kasich and Carson barely registered on the Richter scale while Teddy and Marco cause tremors across the nation .....tremors yes, but a real quake - not so much.......but they are not giving up so easy - vowing to take this fight to the convention in what would is known as a 'contested convention'.....the Democrats would LOVE this to happen.....as it just confirms that the GOP is a mess......[A contested convention (or brokered convention) is a situation where no one single candidate has secured the required number of delegates to be the clear front runner - so the process then goes to 'political horse trading' at the summer convention......At the convention - if there still is no clear candidate then all of the delegates are released from their prior pledges and the slate is wiped clean. And the 'brokering' or 'horse trading' begins anew....after a couple of winks, some promises and a handshake - the party chairman calls for a new vote of the delegates. It is then hoped that this will result in a clear winner as a majority of delegates rally around one candidate....The interesting thing here is that a brokered convention does not necessarily reflect the will of the people and could end up being more divisive rather than inclusive - and then we will be saying congratulations to President Rodham- Clinton (again)]And as far as the mkts go - it was a Super Tuesday for stocks as well....Stocks around the world rallied hard.... In the US - all of the indices broke up and thru resistance....and in a vote of confidence - OIL also made history as investors in that asset class took WTI (West Texas Intermediate) up and thru its resistance as well to end the day at $34.44/barrel.....The excitement started early.....Global mkts were on fire after NY FED's Dudley made very dovish comments overnight (Monday evening in NY, Tuesday morning in Asia) in China - concerning US interest rate policy and the PBoC (Peoples Bank of China) announced more stimulus - after a very disappointing manufacturing PMI report - Couple that with expectations of more ECB action as Europeans continue to struggle with what their future looks like......and we got a massive global rally.......Germany’s DAX shot up 2.3%, France’s CAC-40 added 1.2%, and the broader Eurostoxx Index added 1.7%.....Here at home - stocks came out of the gate strong and finished even stronger......The Dow closed up 2.1%, The S&P tacked on 2.4%, Nasdaq rallied 2%, the Russell 2000 +2% ......and so the story continues.....Central banks are at it again.....jawboning to pump up prices— They have spent a great deal of effort in changing the narrative for oil, for stocks, and for the economy - trying to drive up prices for stocks as we enter the final month of the 1st qtr.Now March came in 'like a lion - but will it go out like a lamb' as the saying goes?Overnight the excitement continues.....Japan rallies 4% as news that the Japanese gov't pension fund - (GPIF) - the largest fund in the world with some $1.2 trillion dollars may put some $47 bil to work in the Japanese mkt after the recent beating it took......Other mkts in the region jumped on board for the ride.....Hong Kong rallies 3%, China +4.1% and Australia + 2%. Now Moody's tried to throw cold water on the party by cutting the Chinese country's credit rating outlook to NEGATIVE from stable...but that was not successful at all.... Investors thumbed their nose at Moody's reminding them that they are always late to the party....and that their track record of protecting investors is suspect - think Great Financial Crisis of 2007-2016.....In Europe - mkts there are in rally mode - but not nearly as excited as the rest of the world at the moment...They seem to be in digesting mode after all of the excitement.....as they continue to speculate on the next move by Uncle Mario and the ECB...FTSE -0.34%, CAC 40 + 0.16%, DAX + 0.4%, EUROSTOXX +0.45%, SPAIN +0.8% and ITALY +0.83%This morning - US futures are taking a breather...currently down 4 pts....which is completely understandable...and I would not be surprised to see us back off and test support at the 50 dma....which is now 1940.....We don' t have too, but it would not be a surprise at all, before the next attempt to pierce S&P 2000. Oil is also backing off a bit and has now once again broken thru support - as it is down 0.68 cts...at $33.72/barrel....in what I think is a test to shake out the weakest links before a move higher once again.San Fran Fed's Williams is due to speak today at 10 am est.Eco data today includes ADP employemnt - exp of +190k.....Mortgage Apps came in at minus 4.8% and that makes sense after the pending home sales number on Monday......Fed's Beige Book due at 2 pm.Now with the official results still being counted - it does look like Hillary and Donald took the majority of the delegates last night so the momentum builds. The mkt will now start to pay more attention to the battle as analysts/strategists position themselves for what both a Rodham-Clinton Presidency and Trump Presidency would look like....Will Janet and the FED will fade to black as the investors ponder the political landscape? After yesterday - talk of the pace and timing of rate hikes once again grew louder....but March for all intents and purposes is off the table - June is the next opportunity for any rate hike and then December if at all...so maybe we get 50 bps in 2016, but for sure we will not get 100 bps and maybe that is part of the reason to celebrate......Take Good Care

"
241,ADP,"Productivity at U.S. businesses fell at an annualized rate of 3% in Q4, the Labor Department said, the biggest drop since Q1 2014, as hiring jumped despite stalling output.Economists had forecast a productivity decline of 1.8%, and the fourth quarter's number came in below the most bearish estimate of -2.6%.The third-quarter number was revised downward by 0.1 point to a 2.1% gain. Output rose just 0.1% gain, while hours worked increased 3.3%.United labor costs rose 4.5% during the Oct. 1-to-Dec. 31 period.U.S. productivity rose a meager 0.6% in 2015, the fifth straight year of sub-1% growth. That's been an unfortunate pattern since the Great Recession, as the productivity rate during the economic recovery has been anything but impressive. Weak productivity has contributed to a lack of wage growth and a non-robust economic performance.While the U.S. economy is still adding jobs, it primarily has come via the service sector, which typically has smaller productivity gains. ADP reported the U.S. added roughly 205,000 private-sector payrolls in January, and 192,000 of that total was in the services sector.U.S. manufacturers have been hurt by a strong dollar, weak global demand and a battered energy sector. Caterpillar (CAT) and Dow Chemical (DOW), with the latter currently in the midst of a merger with DuPont (DD), are among the companies who have been trimming staff.Manufacturing productivity fell at a 0.5% pace in Q4, but that followed a 5% gain in Q3.
"
242,ADP,"Job growth slowed much more than expected in January as the economy added just 151,000 jobs, but the report was seemingly strong in all the ways that might keep the Federal Reserve itching to raise interest rates again.Average hourly wages rose 0.5%, the second-biggest monthly gain going all the way back to 2008. Meanwhile, the jobless rate fell to 4.9%, the lowest since February 2008, and the labor force participation rate rose for a third straight month, to 62.7%.A tighter labor market begets higher wage growth and puts upward pressure on inflation. This is what Fed policymakers expect to happen, it's why they raised rates in December, and it's why investors are apparently beginning to fear they could do so again as soon as March -- despite the sharp decline in job gains.That may be one reason why stocks sold off sharply Friday, with the S&P 500 down 1.85% at the closing bell, while the dollar rose against other currencies. The Nasdaq tumbled 3.25%, as grim forecasts from LinkedIn (LNKD) and Tableau (DATA) triggered widespread concern about business spending on software generally.But a closer look at the details of the jobs report suggests more reason to be worried about the economy weakening than to fear another Fed hike. Not only were overall job gains lackluster and lower for a third straight month, but a large portion of those gains are more than a bit puzzling and probably not something to count on going forward.Manufacturers added a surprising 29,000 jobs -- tied for the best gain since early 2012. Yet that reading stands in stark contrast to the Institute for Supply Management manufacturing survey earlier in the week showing factories shedding jobs at the fastest pace since 2009. While not as dismal, ADP reported that factory payrolls were unchanged in January.Meanwhile, the trade deficit widened in December as exports fell for a third straight month, rising 6.9% vs. a year earlier, the Commerce Department said Friday. U.S. manufacturers are struggling as a higher dollar makes it even harder to compete in a sluggish global economy.Then there's the retail sector, which added 57,700 jobs, or 38% of the total gain. The best month of retail hiring in more than three years came even as Wal-Mart (WMT) said it would lay off 10,000 workers and close 154 U.S. stores (though the closings came after the payroll survey week) and as Macy's (M) closed 40 stores and announced 2,500 layoffs.Most of the retail job gains appear to be a statistical quirk related to seasonal adjustment.""Department stores, an industry having a difficult time by any measure, increased payrolls by 13,200 -- primarily because they didn't hire as many in the fall to lay off a lot in January,"" said Steve Blitz, chief economist at ITG Investment Research.Electronics and appliance retailers like Best Buy (BBY) added 8,600 jobs on a seasonally adjusted basis, the best gain in nine years. That doesn't seem to square with reality, as the sector faces brutal competition from Amazon (AMZN). Nor does it square with the picture Best Buy painted when it reported disappointing holiday sales amid weak demand and price cuts for the Apple (AAPL) iPhone 6S and iPad.Seasonally unadjusted data show that electronics retailers added 9,200 fewer workers in November and December compared to a year earlier, then trimmed payrolls by 6,000 fewer in January 2016 vs. January 2015.On the other hand, IHS Global Insight chief economist Nariman Behravesh notes that temp hiring swung from a 25,100 gain in December to a 25,200 drop in January. That's not likely to be repeated either.ITG Investment's Blitz concludes: ""Given all this noise and that it is way too soon for current market turmoil to impact real economic activity . . . (we'll have to) wait for February data to begin to get a sense of whether trending demand for labor is shifting.""There also is reason — actually 14 of them — to wonder if the 0.5% jump in hourly wages last month really represents a shift in the trend. That's because 14 states raised their minimum wages on January 1, directly affecting 2.8 million workers, according to the liberal Economic Policy Institute. California's $1 hike to $10 an hour was the most consequential.The think tank estimated that the minimum wage hike would lead employers to raise wages for another 1.9 million workers earning close to the new minimum to avoid paying more senior workers the same as less senior ones at the cost of morale.It remains to be seen if the higher minimum wages depress job growth to any extent. Low-wage hiring does appear to have slowed last year in the six cites which implemented big minimum wage hikes to $10 an hour or more last year.Even the strong household survey, which showed that the number of people with jobs surged by 615,000 last month (or 409,000 excluding a population adjustment), probably isn't giving a reliable signal. That's not to say the jobless rate is higher than 4.9%, but only that it can't be counted on to give a reliable estimate of employment gains in any given month. For example, in the third quarter of 2015, the payroll survey showed an increase of 192,000 jobs a month, while the household survey showed a gain of 73,000.A slower pace of hiring was expected after gains averaged 279,000 in the fourth quarter but economic growth slowed to just 0.7%. Economists had expected a gain of about 188,000 jobs in January.The workweek rose 0.1 hour to 34.6 hours, meaning that the increase in work was better than the headline 151,000 job gain. Still, the payroll report offered one more not-so-great sign for the strength of hiring going forward: Outside of manufacturing, 57.6% of industries added jobs last month, down from 65.3% the prior two months.Image provided by Shutterstock.

244,ADP,"Federal Reserve officials are increasingly uneasy about financial markets since they raised interest rates in December. Meanwhile, U.S. hiring remained solid to start 2016. The service sector continued to expand, but at its slowest pace in nearly two years.Financial conditions have tightened since the Federal Reserve hiked rates for the first time in nearly a decade in December, New York President Bill Dudley told MNI in an interview. That could affect the Fed's decision-making. Further weakening in the global economy and additional dollar appreciation could have ""significant consequences"" for the economy. The Fed signaled more concern about global markets and less optimism for the U.S. economy at the end of last week's policy meeting.Dudley's comments initially helped lift markets, but stocks soon retreated in morning trade, with the 10-year Treasury yield near a 1-year lowOne reason why the dollar might rise? Other central banks continuing to ease. Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda said the BoJ has room to ease further after surprising markets late last month by pushing interest rates to -0.1%. Kuroda said there is ""no limit"" to monetary easing, saying policymakers can ""devise new tools.""The Institute for Supply Management's nonmanufacturing index fell 2.3 points in January to 53.5. That's the lowest since February 2014, though still above the neutral 50 level. The export orders index signaled the sharpest decline since March 2009, during the last recession. Import orders slid to their weakest since July 2012. The jobs index signaled slower hiring.On Monday, ISM's manufacturing index signaled contraction for a fourth straight month, with the jobs gauge the lowest since May 2009.Markit's services index, similar to the ISM nonmanufacturing gauge, fell 1.1 points to 53.2, the weakest in 27 months.The U.S. economy added more jobs than expected last month, adding 205,400 to private-sector payrolls, the ADP National Employment Report said.Economists had forecast 190,000 jobs added in January, less dramatic than the upwardly revised 266,900 jobs added in December's report.The services sector was the big driver with 192,000 jobs added. The U.S. service sector has remained in growth mode despite grim numbers from U.S. manufacturers, who have been hurt by a strong dollar, weak economic growth overseas and a battered energy sector.Manufacturing jobs fell fractionally vs. December. They dipped 0.1% vs. a year earlier, the worst since September 2010.  Industrial companies such as General Electric (GE) and Caterpillar (CAT) have issued Q4 earnings reports attesting to trouble overseas. Caterpillar and Dow Chemical (DOW) have announced new plans to cut jobs in recent weeks.The Labor Department will release U.S. nonfarm payroll data on Friday.Mortgage applications fell 2.6% during the week of Jan. 29, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Refinancings inched out a 0.3% gain while the purchase index fell 7%. The average 30-year fixed loan for mortgages ($417,000 or less) fell five basis points to 3.97%, its first sub-4% level since October.Image provided by Shutterstock.
"
245,ADP,"The big question for the economy is whether the service sector can keep on trucking, even amid manufacturers' struggles and financial market jitters.The news on Wednesday provided some cause for concern as the Institute for Supply Management's nonmanufacturing index unexpectedly fell 2.3 points in January to a 23-month low of 53.5. Though still above 50, signaling expansion, it was the measure's third straight decline. That follows ISM's manufacturing index out Monday that showed factory activity contracting for a fourth straight month.A 53.5 reading for this closely watched indicator of the service sector's health is historically consistent with GDP growth of 1.8%, the institute said.Of particular concern, the employment index dropped to a 12-month low of 52.1 from 56.3. Yet ADP's monthly employment report out Wednesday showed that private service-sector firms added 192,000 jobs in January, just below the 199,000 average reported by the Labor Department for 2015.Still, that's a step down from the 230,000 private service sector job gains that ADP reported in December, as total private payrolls grew 266,900 vs. a 205,400 gain last month. Manufacturing jobs edged down slightly compared to both December and a year earlier.The Labor Department will release its January employment report on Friday.Meanwhile, another Federal Reserve official signaled unease about events since the central bank raised interest rates in December. Further weakening in the global economy and additional dollar appreciation could have “significant consequences” for the economy, New York Fed President William Dudley told MNI.Online employment postings advertised only 13,500 more jobs in January than in the prior month, the Conference Board said Wednesday. While calling it ""a disappointing start for 2016"" and highlighting a large drop in postings for sales-related positions, the research group noted that demand remains high, with nearly 5.5 million advertised vacancies.Wal-Mart (WMT) announced 10,000 job cuts in January, part of its plan to close 154 stores in the U.S. Macy's (M) said it would lay off 4,500 while closing as many as 40 stores.Sprint (S) detailed 2,500 job cuts last week, including 2,000 customer-care positions, many of them at call centers. Yahoo (YHOO) announced late Tuesday that it would cut 15% of staff.Staffing firm Robert Half International (RHI) said in an earnings call this week that it ramped up full-time staff in the second half of 2015 and ""wouldn't add significantly to headcount during this quarter.""The ISM services report's prices paid index fell from 51.0 down to 46.4, the lowest since July 2009. One of the survey respondents noted that ""falling prices are pushing margins down as many are forced to drop prices to meet the competition.""The ISM survey also highlighted the service sector's exposure to the weak global economy as the export orders gauge sank to a nearly seven-year low of 45.5 from 53.5 the prior month.

247,ADP,"Picture this: The Kennedy Center - Washington DC -Janet Yellen takes center stage preparing for her first concert of 2016. In the audience are a range of global central bankers - Uncle Mario (Draghi) - The ECB (European Central Bank), Haruhiko Kuroda - the BoJ (Bank of Japan), Zhou Xiaochuan - the PBoC (Peoples Bank of China), Stefan Ingves - Riksbanken (Sweden), Lars Rohde - NationalBanken (Denmark), Steven Poloz - Canadian Central Bank along with the bankers from emerging mkt countries as they all consider the additional drastic steps needed to turn their economies around. In the audience are also other members of the FED and a host of global investors. As she comes on stage - Madonna's 'Celebration' plays in the background...... global mkts are surging on news that the BoJ launched a new and more dramatic stimulus program last week after two lost decades. The music wanes and the crowd applauds - and a new song begins.....And the song? .........the Janis Joplin classic - ""Piece of my Heart..."". You know it - and if you don't know it - feel free to YouTube it..... (I have given you the introduction - but no one does it like Janis Joplin)""Oh, come on, come on, come on, come on...Didn't I make you feel like you were the only man - yeah!

253,ADP,"Oh, oh, break it! Break another little bit of my heart now, darling, yeah, yeah, yeah.
"
254,ADP,"Oh, oh, Have another little piece of my heart now, baby......"",Can you hear her now? She grabs the mike and belts it out......Singing to these men as they did just that....they stole just another little piece of her heart (by launching new/improved stimulus programs) and then they broke it all over the global mkts...- making it more difficult for the FED to move on rates - and why? Because the message being sent by those global banks is - ""Houston? We've had a problem!"" ...suggesting that economies around the world are contracting -and that is not what Janet or the FED wants to hear.....so you ask - why doesn't she just block her ears? - Well - she and Cousin Stanley (Fischer - Vice Chair) have been doing that for quite some time now .....and now it's coming back to bite her in the ..... (fill in the blank)(And for those of you NOT old enough to remember that famous quotation - Those were the words uttered by Commander Jim Lovell - On April 13th, 1970 during the famed Apollo 13 spaceflight when an oxygen tank exploded and ripped off the side of the spacecraft service module while these men were in orbit approximately 205,000 miles from Earth on their way to the Moon -- the world was held in suspense as these men hobbled together duct tape, paper clips and straws in an attempt to 'repair' the spacecraft and return safely to Earth.....fearing that if they were unsuccessful - they would be lost forever - hurtling thru space going who knew where........In the end though those men succeeded using the duct tape and paper clips allowing them to keep it together and land the spacecraft in the vast Pacific Ocean near Samoa.)Sound somewhat familiar? Are we just hurtling thru space - seemingly out of control? Is the FED trying to hold it together with paper clips and duct tape...?Ok - back to the mkts.....Stocks soared on Friday on the news that Japan didn't just CUT interest rates - they have now gone NEGATIVE after 2 lost decades (joining a host of other nations)....sending global stocks into overdrive..... The rally was a knee jerk reaction to Japan's surprise decision to introduce negative interest rates for the first time in their history.Negative rates are a funny thing, right? They do succeed in driving down the currencies of those nations, which helps to boost inflation and exports....but this comes at the expense of other countries, which then causes those other countries to respond in kind with easier monetary policies of their own. (Remember the vicious circle?)I mean - take China......5 months ago - the PBoC's decision to devalue the Yuan was driven in part by their need to lower its own interest rates to stimulate growth. The lower Yuan, then put pressure on all of China's trading partners, including Japan, to ease monetary policy. And the result - investors swiftly repriced risk assets......setting off global turmoil as the game played out. On Friday - we saw that Citigroup economists are now predicting that many of the world's central banks would cut their rates even further into negative territory in coming months, ""should macroeconomic conditions turn out even weaker than currently expected.""This move by the BoJ sent Yogi (the Bear) running for cover as algorithms tripped over each other sending the Dow and S&P up 3.6% and 2.4% respectively as they attempted to cover short bets before the gains disappeared. And once again, we see that the catalyst that caught everyone by surprise was another temporary fix....more on that below....Ok - for Joe Q Public - what does that mean? Well, it means that if banks have reserve balances at the central bank (BoJ) then they will HAVE TO PAY the central bank for the privilege of having cash - they will no longer be paid interest on their deposits and potentially neither will depositors at local and regional banks. (Do you see where this is going?)The logic behind this thinking? Force people to take their money out of the bank and spend it - Forcing inflation to rear its UGLY head.....but here is the rub...... when an economy is booming and people are working and earning and spending money, then inflation is a NATURAL byproduct of too much money chasing too little supply. The stimulus is the expanding economy, But when they try to FORCE inflation using a form of 'artificial stimulus' in a contracting economy it usually spells disaster. (Think the 4 QE programs initiated by the FED).Nevertheless, this is apparently how all of these Ivy League central bankers think – if it doesn't happen naturally - then force it......this has become known as the 'Viagra effect'......take 'an economy' that is in contraction mode, give it a little 'blue pill' and force a 'short lived but pleasurable reaction' while ignoring the longer term cause. This has been proven many times to be a failed strategy - all it will do is force money out of the bank (safe haven) as it searches for yield temporarily causing stocks to move higher. It doesn't cause consumers to spend money - in fact it causes concern which only forces consumers to SAVE money.....as they expect tougher times ahead.Many analysts/strategists and long term asset managers do not suspect that this latest move will be the catalyst for an extended rally- unless of course it is accompanied by structural fiscal reforms that will boost investment and confidence - moves that our elected officials refuse to consider......Now artificial stimulus programs may cause the mkt to rally a bit more from here but this will only cause some to suggest that 'if it lasts longer than 4 hrs - see a doctor......'. In the end, we all know that the effects of this 'artificial stimulus' DO wear off and we find that the 'economy' returns to its contractionary mode. Look! the Kool Aid doesn't cut it anymore...

255,ADP,"Global growth forecasts are being cut and financial mkts are reeling as slowdowns in an array of economies raise the warning flag..... and this creates an even more difficult situation for central bankers who are already pushing the limits of the exhausted monetary policy debate.
"
256,ADP,"Ok...back to the charts....if you draw a trend line on the S&P - from the lows of Aug/ Sept/Oct and drag it across - you will find that Friday's action took us up and thru what should have been resistance at 1920......- but the hysteria on Friday caused the algo's to run wild breaking up and thru ending the day at 1940. This suggests a further move upwards to the 1975/2000 range is in short order if we hold. If we do not hold then a retest of 1875 would not surprise me....and if the macro data continues to weaken then a retest of the January lows of 1820 is a good bet.On the earnings front - Earnings continue to come in as expected...with 70% of the reports beating the estimate.- never mind that these estimates have all been slashed prior....and many companies have supported their earnings with healthy share buybacks. We have another big week of earnings ahead of us still and I fully expect more of the same...Trading this week will also be driven by investor and algorithmic reaction to some key U.S. economic data, especially Friday's NFP (Non Farm payroll Report) of +190k. Ahead of that report we will see reports on ISM manufacturing with two very different estimates: Markit is calling for 52.7 while the ISM is calling for 48.5 (one is expansionary while the other reflects contraction), The services component suggests expansion at 55.2. Personal income +0.2% and spending +0.1%, as well as the ADP Employment report of +190k jobs.And don't forget the Iowa Caucuses today.....Hopefully by tonight the field will be a little thinner....as those Americans do the hard work of culling the field for the rest of us......Overnight in Asia - Mkts mixed - Japan +1.98%, Hong Kong -0.45%, China - 1.78% and ASX +0.76%. In China - macro data shows continued weakness in the manufacturing sector - with PMI notching 49.4 (contractionary). But the overall impression is that this report is beginning to show some level of stabilization in China while maintaining that risks still remain. Which means what exactly? Maybe the mkt will go up or maybe it will go down?Evan Lucas - Mkt Strategist at Spreadbetter IG had this to say:""The BoJ's move is a net positive for risk, net positive for international trade and increases fund flows in Asia. All are seen as a macro positive""In Europe - Mkts are moving lower as the world continues to digest the latest BoJ move. HSBC announces 8k layoffs (plans to slash 1 out of 5 jobs), is freezing global pay for 2016 and shrinking it investment bank by 1/3rd in response to sluggish global growth and strangling regulation as they continue to cut costs to drive profitability............FTSE -0.39%, CAC 40 -0.56% , DAX - 0.51%, EURSTOXX -0.72%, SPAIN flat, and ITALY-0.37%US futures are DOWN 7 pts this morning as investors/traders settle in for another week and digest Friday's rally. Oil is a bit lower this morning - on what feels like profit taking after its surge as well. Look for the S&P to test what is now support at 1920, if it holds then we can breathe a sigh of relief - if not - strap in again.

276,ADP," Torture — the action of inflicting severe pain on someone as punishment: or to force them say or do something: or for the sole pleasure of the person inflicting the pain.  — that is what they do in war…..Chinese Water Torture — a process whereby water is slowly dripped onto a restrained person’s forehead, finally driving that person insane.  That is what they do to the stock mkt……slowly drive the investor insane…..By now - we are all well aware of the disaster that had taken place in global mkts since the beginning of the new year - that is unless you have been living under a rock - but either way - we have seen some $2.4 tril wiped out the value of global mkts....some of the blame can be placed squarely on broad macro themes, a breakdown in Apple (AAPL) shares, renewed nervousness concerning Mid East and North Korean geo-political issues, the coming earnings season, health of the consumer, etc.........but for the most part the most recent cause of mkt nervousness  has been front and center - China...  Right or wrong - they have become the scapegoat.....Now - look - there is a lot of 'stuff' going on there.....slowing Chinese economy, currency devaluation,  plunging commodity prices....blah, blah, blah......but can we really pin total mkt action on this one 'developing, emerging mkt country'?  Hardly....but it is fun, isn't' it?   I mean you always look to deflect responsibility - or better yet - look to place blame....and for now - the Chinese economy seems to suit everyone just fine.....I mean we have to blame someone and we were tired of blaming the usual suspects...... Corp earnings, The FED,  Lack of inflation,   Housing slowdown,  Oil and other commodities,  - well you get the picture......Yesterday  - as the world waited all day for Thursday night/Friday morning trading to begin once again in Asia the US mkt continued to come under pressure.   But again — no one threw the kitchen sink out the window or jumped off any roof.  Was it ugly, yes, was it frustrating, yes.  The Dow at one point was off more than 450 pts while the S&P was off over 46 pts……Nasdaq got slammed as well taking that index down more than 3% in early trade.…  It was the classic 'herd mentality' taking hold.....fear builds and people lose their sense of the bigger picture.....and the mkt swings and usually overshoots the reality......After the absolute crushing that China took on Thursday - global mkts were naturally on edge.......Europe sold off and here in the US - the train kept coming......Mid morning yesterday — word spread that the Chinese gov’t was abandoning their circuit breakers - circuit breakers that were supposed to ease the chaos, but which in fact had only exaggerated it....and so — they did away with it…..which left European and American investors time to think about what that could mean.  Was it a good thing?  Would we witness the first major financial crisis of 2016?  Would the Chinese stock mkt implode on Friday?  And if so — what would be the knock on effect for Europe and the US…….Well let’s get one thing straight….You don’t really think that the Chinese would abandon the curbs without making sure that the mkt would go UP  do you?How ridiculous would that be?  How would they be able to prove to the world that they were actually in control if they allowed their mkt to go over the edge?   I mean — You can just hear it, no?  Remember - China is a COMMUNIST country that is trying to be a CAPITALIST country with all of the state controls......so the gov't  made it very clear to investors —‘No selling allowed — otherwise we kill you….. Death by Firing Squad…’ and as so many of us sat glued to our computers last night at 9 pm……we waited and waited…..Japan, Australia opened lower — setting the tone…..US futures remained cautious….ticking slightly higher….as the seconds turned to mins and the Chinese mkt opened…..BOOM!!!!   Just like that it rocketed higher by 3% -  then sold off to -2.2%  (causing the first round of ‘deaths’)  which then served as a warning to anyone else who even considered hitting the SELL button…… Netflix should make a docu-series - ""China ! - How the State Manipulates Global Mkts""  I mean think about it…... UP, Really?  Well, yes in the short term...look that mkt is OFF 17% since Christmas.....so maybe it was a bit oversold.....The papers detail it precisely -  ""The Shanghei Composite Index closed 2 percent higher, after falling as much as 2.2 percent earlier. Regulators removed the circuit breakers after plunges this week closed trading early on Monday and Thursday. The central bank set the currency’s reference rate little changed Friday after an eight-day stretch of weaker fixings that roiled global markets. State-controlled funds purchased Chinese stocks on Friday, focusing on financial shares and others with large weightings in benchmark indexes.    The scrapping of the circuit breaker system will help to stabilize the market, but a sense of panic will remain, particularly among retail investors, The ‘national team*’ will probably continue to buy stocks significantly to stabilize the market.""(*National Team = Gov't)Ok..so guess what?  Yup....global mkts breathe a sigh of relief and the 'snap back relief rally' began.....European mkts WERE higher in initial trade but have since all turned lower - German industrial Production sorely disappointed - missing estimates at -0.3% vs. the +0.5% exp.... US futures are up nicely +15 pts  but off the highs of the early morning trade when we were up 25 pts.... Expect more volatility today.....as the focus now turns to our 'big event' - the NFP (Non Farm Payrolls) report...at 8:30  exp are for +200k jobs but after Wednesday's strong ADP employment report - the pressure is on for a 'better than expected' number...and my sense is that we will get it - especially after the recent drubbing global mkts took - this will allow today's FED speakers to tell us how great it all is.......(smoke and mirrors...)The mkt is on track for its worst start to a year since recorded history!!!  (According to FactSet stats that go back to 1897).   If the first five days are any indication of what is to come.....the get ready - because here it comes... If there were any doubts about the crash in the Hi Yield bond market last year warning us about what was coming for the stock market this year, we can put that to bed....Technically, the Russell 2000 index is leading all indexes to the downside, breaking through last year’s lows of last September on its way to challenge the October 2014 lows at 1,040.  Typical of the Russell leads both in bull markets and bear markets and this latest move does not signal a building BULL mkt just yet.....in fact it looks ugly...... The Dow Trannies also took out their 2015 lows of 7682 and are down 16% from the November  highs and down 23% from their highs of February 2015.  Looks like a big fat brown BEAR to me......We are clearly short term oversold  - as the Dow gives back 1,100 points in five days and the S&P gives back 111 pts during the same time frame.  Expect a snap back rally but also expect that sophisticated asset managers will 'sell any rally' until there is a real shift or catalyst in thinking..... Remember - the mkt can stay IRRATIONAL longer than you can stay LIQUID.  Side Note — Friends — As so many of you know — The Headstrong Project (getheadstrong.org) is an organization that is very close to my heart.  It is a Veteran’s charitable organization that provides POST 911 combat veterans dealing with PTSD and thoughts of suicide with world class mental health care through its treatment program at Weill Cornell Medical Center.   (The Dept of Defense reports 22 suicides a day  and over 350k confirmed cases of veterans dealing with PTSD.) Take a moment to look at the latest qtrly newsletter to learn more about this amazing organization — of which I serve on the Board of Directors — and choose to support those men and women who chose to serve and protect you.  Thank you all for you past support and my hope is that you will continue to support The Headstrong Project team help heal ‘The Hidden Wounds of War’.

305,ADP,"Big U.S. companies committed a record amount of cash to stock buyback plans and cash mergers in 2015, shattering the prior record from 2007, according to TrimTabs Investment Research, which sees the data point as a potentially worrisome sign for both the economy and equities. Meanwhile, small businesses continue to add jobs, but the pace of those gains slacked off…

307,ADP,"The US geological Service reports a 5.1 magnitude earthquake 30.4 miles outside of Kiju, North Korea….Reports of the event start to circulate around the world — Questions arose — Suspicions confirmed — North Korea's state owned TV confirming that the country had successfully conducted a 'hydrogen nuclear bomb test' saying that the country will not give up any nuclear capability until the US drops its hostile foreign policy towards that country.  Surrounding countries go into overdrive immediately condemning this action…… South Korea President Park Geun-Hye - quickly criticizing Kim Jung-Un calling this test a ""grave provocation to this country's security' and ensuring that North Korea will 'pay the price for conducting a nuclear weapons test""  Japanese PM Shinzo Abe calls the test a 'grave threat to our nation and one we cannot accept""
"
308,ADP,"The White House - though aware said nothing but the US National Security Council did say:  
"
309,ADP,"""While we cannot confirm these claims at this time, we condemn any violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions and again call on North Korea to abide by its international obligations and commitments,  We have consistently made clear that we will not accept it as a nuclear state.

"
310,ADP,"Remind me again - Who is that guy that lives in the WH?  
"
311,ADP,"Mkts in Asia - which had just opened for trading and were weak to begin with -  turned lower still....……News of the test sent Japanese, South Korean, Australian and a host of other Asian nations  lower…..China - which once again is attempting to weaken its currency only added selling pressure to mkts around the world.   
"
312,ADP,"Emerging mkts falling to 6 yr lows as renewed concern over a weaker Yuan remind global investors of the beating that stocks took back in August when the Chinese devalued their currency.......for the most part though, Asian mkts took it in stride — they did NOT implode….and history suggests that the mkts will not become obsessed with it......But while a slowdown in China, weakening global macro data reports, coming downgrades to US corp profits, concern over FED policy, and the crisis in the mid-east continue to give investors/traders reason for caution - this new geo-political development raises the bar and adds fuel to the already burning fire….
"
313,ADP,"All of this news sent investors into typical 'safe haven assets'….the Japanese Yen surged higher vs. the dollar,  Yields on 10 yr treasuries down by 2.22 bps to 1.27% (prices up/yields down) — and Gold currently UP $7.60  considered by so many to be the 'safest haven asset' moved higher — piercing the down trending 50 dma — (see yesterday's comments) and now trading at $1086/oz….looking to move and test $1112/oz.  
"
314,ADP,"Defense stocks in Asia all moved higher, but did close off of their intraday highs — resource stocks in Australia ended the day lower on the back of the China currency moves— dragging that index down by 1.6% as broad based indiscriminate selling engulfed that mkt…..
"
315,ADP,"This morning European mkts are all a bit lower as the world begins to assess the damage caused by both of these latest international events.  (North Korea and China's currency weakening) .  Oil coming under renewed selling pressure as concerns about growing supply rise - closed under $36/barrel yesterday and today has fallen another 90 cts to $35.07/barrel -  taking us back to the lows of early 2009 during the height of the GFC (Great Financial Crisis) and this is really setting the tone for both Europe and the US.   
"
316,ADP,"European mkts are getting clobbered...as the morning becomes afternoon....and the selling intensifies....FTSE -1.5%, CAC 40 - 1.69%, DAX - 1.85%, EUROSTOXX - 1.6%, SPAIN -1.8% and ITALY - 1.8%......   US futures - took a nosedive lower on the Pyongyang news overnight and continue to succumb to weakness as the sun rises over the Atlantic......S&P futures are currently down 35 pts or 1.7% - as they sliced right thru S&P 2000 ""like a hot knife thru butta""  (as Barbara Streisand would say in her signature style Brooklyn, NY accent).  Once again the tone has been set - it is Risk Off (for today)....
"
317,ADP,"The choppy trading on Wall St over the last two months makes it very clear.......traders/investors are voting with their feet..... expressing  uncertainty about the future outlook:  corp profits, FED policy, presidential politics, strangling regulation, higher taxes, exploding social welfare programs and huge international geo-political risks ......
"
318,ADP,"After Monday's plunge  the  ""buy the dip""  crowd is not so sure that this time it makes sense to buy the dip......maybe - we should just sit back and see how this unfolds......Look - a lot of downside gaps were created on Monday's action - never mind the overall negative tone permeating the psyche  and as noted - the mkt has suffered a fair amount of technical damage........ and while the FED (like every other central bank) may be trying to stabilize the mkt to keep it from falling off of a cliff - at some point it makes no sense to 'stand in front of an oncoming train' .  The mkts will go to the level of equilibrium sooner or later - NO MATTER who tries to stand in its way. 
"
319,ADP,"We are now significantly below S&P 2000 - we tested 1976 in early pre-mkt a level where I have been saying the mkt needed to go to.....but there may be a bit more to go....in fact I still think a test lower (1950) is not out of the question.  ECO data today includes Mortgage Apps  DOWN by 11.6%  and the ADP Employment Change - expected to show +195k jobs.  In addition to the other eco data points due out - the FED is due to release their DEC mins at 2 pm....I do not suspect we will learn anything new at all....it's just the usual confessional  to make them all feel better.....  Expect mkts to break lower at the opening - but do not necessarily get sucked in just yet.....a break below 1950 will surely cause the mkts to test the August lows of 1870......

We will continue to protect and defend our allies in the region, including the Republic of Korea, and will respond appropriately to any and all North Korean provocations.""  Remind me again - Who is that guy that lives in the WH?  Mkts in Asia - which had just opened for trading and were weak to begin with -  turned lower still....……News of the test sent Japanese, South Korean, Australian and a host of other Asian nations  lower…..China - which once again is attempting to weaken its currency only added selling pressure to mkts around the world.   Emerging mkts falling to 6 yr lows as renewed concern over a weaker Yuan remind global investors of the beating that stocks took back in August when the Chinese devalued their currency.......for the most part though, Asian mkts took it in stride — they did NOT implode….and history suggests that the mkts will not become obsessed with it......But while a slowdown in China, weakening global macro data reports, coming downgrades to US corp profits, concern over FED policy, and the crisis in the mid-east continue to give investors/traders reason for caution - this new geo-political development raises the bar and adds fuel to the already burning fire….All of this news sent investors into typical 'safe haven assets'….the Japanese Yen surged higher vs. the dollar,  Yields on 10 yr treasuries down by 2.22 bps to 1.27% (prices up/yields down) — and Gold currently UP $7.60  considered by so many to be the 'safest haven asset' moved higher — piercing the down trending 50 dma — (see yesterday's comments) and now trading at $1086/oz….looking to move and test $1112/oz.  Defense stocks in Asia all moved higher, but did close off of their intraday highs — resource stocks in Australia ended the day lower on the back of the China currency moves— dragging that index down by 1.6% as broad based indiscriminate selling engulfed that mkt…..This morning European mkts are all a bit lower as the world begins to assess the damage caused by both of these latest international events.  (North Korea and China's currency weakening) .  Oil coming under renewed selling pressure as concerns about growing supply rise - closed under $36/barrel yesterday and today has fallen another 90 cts to $35.07/barrel -  taking us back to the lows of early 2009 during the height of the GFC (Great Financial Crisis) and this is really setting the tone for both Europe and the US.   European mkts are getting clobbered...as the morning becomes afternoon....and the selling intensifies....FTSE -1.5%, CAC 40 - 1.69%, DAX - 1.85%, EUROSTOXX - 1.6%, SPAIN -1.8% and ITALY - 1.8%......   US futures - took a nosedive lower on the Pyongyang news overnight and continue to succumb to weakness as the sun rises over the Atlantic......S&P futures are currently down 35 pts or 1.7% - as they sliced right thru S&P 2000 ""like a hot knife thru butta""  (as Barbara Streisand would say in her signature style Brooklyn, NY accent).  Once again the tone has been set - it is Risk Off (for today)....The choppy trading on Wall St over the last two months makes it very clear.......traders/investors are voting with their feet..... expressing  uncertainty about the future outlook:  corp profits, FED policy, presidential politics, strangling regulation, higher taxes, exploding social welfare programs and huge international geo-political risks ......After Monday's plunge  the  ""buy the dip""  crowd is not so sure that this time it makes sense to buy the dip......maybe - we should just sit back and see how this unfolds......Look - a lot of downside gaps were created on Monday's action - never mind the overall negative tone permeating the psyche  and as noted - the mkt has suffered a fair amount of technical damage........ and while the FED (like every other central bank) may be trying to stabilize the mkt to keep it from falling off of a cliff - at some point it makes no sense to 'stand in front of an oncoming train' .  The mkts will go to the level of equilibrium sooner or later - NO MATTER who tries to stand in its way. We are now significantly below S&P 2000 - we tested 1976 in early pre-mkt a level where I have been saying the mkt needed to go to.....but there may be a bit more to go....in fact I still think a test lower (1950) is not out of the question.  ECO data today includes Mortgage Apps  DOWN by 11.6%  and the ADP Employment Change - expected to show +195k jobs.  In addition to the other eco data points due out - the FED is due to release their DEC mins at 2 pm....I do not suspect we will learn anything new at all....it's just the usual confessional  to make them all feel better.....  Expect mkts to break lower at the opening - but do not necessarily get sucked in just yet.....a break below 1950 will surely cause the mkts to test the August lows of 1870......Take good care.

"
324,ADP,"Global stocks dropped like a 'lead balloon' on Monday —  never even looked back from the min the mkts opened……renewed worries over Chinese economic conditions — likely confirming a contraction and the way the mkts reacted it is expecting a 'global contraction'....and this  caused investors to 'exit' the Chinese mkt in droves — which then set the tone for Europe, the US, and a host of emerging mkt countries…..Toss in the new brewing crisis in the Mid East — between the Saudi's and the Iranians and you had the perfect brewing storm….[Now — the diplomatic crisis in the Mid East is going to be something to keep our eyes on……as the growing tension over the recent Saudi executions builds — dragging in other countries to 'take sides'…… the US finds itself in a precarious position…..We are in bed with both of those countries — the Saudi's as a long time ally in the region and now the Iranians — as we were the lead negotiator in the UN Security council resolution - a resolution to address their nuclear capacities as well as allow them back into the oil mkt..... an agreement which attempted to bring that country back onto the global stage after years of being banished….a deal that was met with so many concerns, by a range of nations, but alas - it fell on deaf ears……and since that deal has been negotiated - the Iranian's have already violated its terms..... thumbing their nose at Kerry and Obama..... The violation?   Test firing of ballistic missiles — which should have resulted in immediate punitive actions…….but did NOT…… So now the US state department - led by Kerry has  renewed calls for leaders in the Mid East to calm down…..saying— ""We call on all sides to avoid any actions that would further heighten tensions in the region….""]
"
325,ADP,"In the end — this crisis should not be the catalyst that will cause mkts to go over the edge, but it certainly did not help the mood yesterday….and may not help the mood in the days ahead…..Keep your eyes on oil — as the new tensions should help to keep that in check….but it is curious…if this event had happened 5 yrs ago….oil would have spiked hard — as the tensions would cause investors to question what the risks to a stable oil mkt would be…..but yesterday — we did not see that, in fact the small spike that oil did have, was all but given back by day's end….and why?  Because the world is awash in oil (The US has now become an exporter of oil)  and if the Saudi's really want to cause some pain for Iran — they will TURN UP production — bringing more supply to the mkts forcing Iran to CHOKE as oil prices plummet…..  Thoughts anyone?Technically — the mkt has been warning us for months now that a major topping process has been in the making…..- deteriorating mkt breadth, divergences between the major indexes and the inability to stay above all 3 technical support levels — the 50, 100 and 200 dma’s — toss in some other charting patterns — like those ‘spinning tops’ we saw in the last couple of weeks, add in weakening macro data and the latest FED moves and  we have the makings of some tougher times ahead….Now it is hard to predict what the mkt will do for the year based on one day's worth of action, but many analysts/strategists have been calling for another difficult year already…..Yesterday US macro data did not help the mood — December ISM came in at 48.2 — the second month that this important barometer has been below 50 (suggesting contraction) and construction spending fell by 0.4% vs. the exp of a rise of 0.7% - and in fact we learned that the gov’t has been ‘mis- calculating’ 10 yrs worth of construction spending saying that:   (note that this point went unnoticed in the media and you certainly don't have any FED representatives talking it up...)""In the November 2015 press release monthly and annual estimates for private residential total private total residential and total construction spending for January 2005 through October 2015 have been revised to correct a processing error in the tabulation of data on private residential improvement spending"".
"
326,ADP,"A processing error?  For 10 yrs?  I mean you can’t even make this up……but as a result — GDP estimates will be revised — and they won't be revised higher as they try to bury the new data …...wink!  wink!    Almost immediately the Atlanta FED downgraded their GDP NOW Forecast for the 4th qtr 2015 — taking that estimate from +1.3% to +0.7%....or a 46% reduction in the original estimate…..What will the revisions for the past 10 yrs  look like?  Again — in the long run — it  means very little, but on a day of nothing by negatives — how could that possibly be viewed as a positive?OK...so this morning US futures are now under pressure once again....this after being mostly higher during the night in a knee jerk reaction.........they were up  8 or 9 pts  during the night  but have since reversed course and are now down 13 pts....once again breaking down and thru S&P 2000.    It's a bit of a mess, and with global growth estimates being revised lower, investor risk appetite is much more cautious...and cautious means more price sensitive...as the story builds about the coming 'global recession'..... And like we discussed yesterday - the mkt has broken a range of technical supports and this will cause it to churn until it finds equilibrium....My sense is that that equilibrium is in the 1950/1975 range...or down at least another 1 - 2% from here.Eco data today is useless....vehicle sales.....but as the week goes on look for ADP Employment report - exp of +195k jobs, US Services PMI - exp of 54, ISM Non Manf Composite of 56, Factory Orders of -0.2%, Durable goods and Capital Goods Ordered and Shipped.....Friday brings us the all important NFP report - again expectations are for us to have created some 200k jobs in December.....while unemployment is expected to remain at 5%.
"
327,ADP,"Oil this morning is actually lower to unchanged, sending the signal that the world is not concerned about supply at all......WTI is holding its own right here at $36.72 - well above long term support at $34.20....so there is no fear of a meltdown just yet......Gold on the other hand is up $4.80 at $1080/oz   - as expected - think the safety trade - and is just about kissing the downtrending 50 dma at $1086 - if the crisis continues then look for gold to break up and thru and test its 100 dma at $1112/oz.Overnight — Asian mkts continued to gyrate in fits and starts.....lunging higher only to get slammed as the day wore on..... News out overnight that the end of the share sale ban imposed on the mkts 6 months ago would have little impact on mkt action......then what did the Chinese do?  They moved to support the mkt - pumping some 130 bil Yuan ($20 bil) into the mkt as 'state controlled funds bought stocks'  but nobody is supposed to know that according to sources that asked NOT TO BE IDENTIFIED and then regulators announced that the 'selling ban' due to expire on Friday - would now remain in place for an indefinite time period - saying -""The sales ban on major holders, introduced in July near the height of a $5 trillion rout, will stay in effect until the introduction of a new rule restricting sales, the people said. Listed companies were encouraged to issue statements saying they’re willing to halt such sales.""Now they want to introduce new rules restricting future sales while the listed companies issue statements essentially saying 'we won't sell stock'....oh boy.....    Now while the point was to ease the pressure, the moves only undermined the broader pledge to allow mkts to function on their own......Sending the message - 'We're screwed!'.   All mkt centers ended lower again.... Japan -0.42%,  Hong Kong  -0.65%,  China -1.86% ,   And ASX -1.63%In Europe this morning — the negative mood continues to drag developed mkts lower as the Asian contagion remains front and center and the Middle East conflict steals the spotlight........  On the eco front - German unemployment hit it on the head at 6.3%,    European Union HICP (Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices) - it is their version of our CPI - missed the expecation of +0.3% coming in at +0.2%.....Either way - the mkt is not responding to any of the eco data announced.......FTSE -0.16%,  CAC 40 -0.67%, DAX -0.71%, EUROSTOXX -0.58%, SPAIN - flat, while ITALY moves into the plus column...at +0.24%Take good careKpKenny Polcari is Vice President and director of NYSE Floor Operations on behalf of O’Neil Securities, Inc., a sister company of Investor's Business Daily.

333,ADP,"For the last few weeks, it seems that the plan was to push the mkt back to the old highs......and so far - it seems to be working.....as we are only 25 pts away from the 2015 highs on the S&P and only 50 pts away from the S&P breaching the long term uptrend line at 2159 (drawn back from December 2014).

334,ADP,"Q: Did the FED manufacture this rally?   A: -DUH!    And if the mkt senses that they do nothing in December - then we can prepare for an even more potentially dramatic move up.....
"
335,ADP,"I mean look - you have to accept the fact that this rally is NOT being driven by earnings - which so far are down 3.9%....and nor is it being driven by fundamentals.....so it does make it difficult to see how the mkt can move 'much' higher - but compared to some of the alternatives - what else are equity investors to do?

The new hires were fairly evenly divided between small, midsize and larger companies, the report said, but service-sector employers were far more active than manufacturers, accounting for 204,000 of the new jobs.The Labor Department revised its estimate of productivity among workers in the third quarter upward to a 2.2% increase vs. earlier estimates of a 1.6% gain. The revision was in line with consensus expectations and leaves the estimate still below Q2's 3.5% increase, but ahead of a 1.1% decline in Q1.Unit labor costs were more of a surprise, revised upward to a 1.8% increase — above the department's initial 1.4% estimate and counter to forecasts for a revision lower to a 0.9% gain.Oil prices continue to bob in their recent range, down 1% this morning, but with West Texas Intermediate still within its $41 to $43 per barrel box and Brent crude fluctuating between $43 and $45. The Energy Information Administration releases its weekly oil inventories data at 10:30 a.m.In stocks, Nike (NKE) again showed the Dow's largest decline, down 0.7%. Houston-based Columbia Pipeline (CPGX) dropped 8%, the worst hit among S&P 500 stocks, after announcing late Monday a 51 million share offering in order to fund its 2016 capital expenditures.Yahoo (YHOO) and Qualcomm (QCOM) pulled up the Nasdaq 100, rising more than 3% each in premarket trade.Yahoo jumped after news reports said its board will enter discussions today as to whether the company should sell its core Internet business or finalize the spinoff of its interest in Alibaba (BABA). The spinoff of China-based diversified Internet giant Alibaba, in which Yahoo holds a 15% stake, has been discussed for some time.The separation of the core Internet business is a move urged in a November letter from hedge fund Starboard Value, which called itself a ""significant shareholder"" of Yahoo. The Wall Street Journal named Japan's SoftBank as an interested potential buyer of Yahoo's Internet business. Yahoo shares have been retaking some ground since marking a low in early October, but the stock remains 36% below its year-ago high.Qualcomm surged on news of its deal to allow China-based mobile device maker Xiaomi to produce 3G and 4G cell phones using Qualcomm patents. Qualcomm shares tumbled 18% in November, sending the stock to new lows in its 19-month correction.The stable of IBD 50 and Your Weekly Review names was quiet for a second day, with no stocks in the groups rising or falling as much as 1% ahead of the start of regular trade. LGI Homes (LGIH) and Natus Medical (BABY) had scored some of the best gains on the two lists on Tuesday, both rising to new highs.

"
357,ADP,"Stocks closed mixed to lower on Friday — on what was the slowest trading day of the year…but did you really expect anything different?  With the US mkts only open for 3 ½ hrs and no real catalyst to push it higher - it would have been hard for it to do anything other than what it did.All the hype over Black Friday, Small Business Saturday, and Cyber Monday continue to cause a bit of concern as investors/traders began to wonder aloud — what it all means. Will the news on Saturday morning suggest that Black Friday was a dud?  Have all the ‘pre-Black Friday sales’ taken the luster off?  Are retailers sending the signal that they are nervous and if they are, then how will that translate to traders/investors on Monday morning? Well — in a bit of 'forewarning' consumer discretionary and retailers led the way lower on Friday.  Wal-Mart  (WMT), Amazon (AMZN), Tiffany's (TIF), GAP (GPS), JC Penny  (JCP), Macy's (M),Best Buy  (BBY) etc…..all putting in weak performances ahead of the big shopping weekend as traders placed their bets.On Saturday morning — the papers announced the news — No, not the fights to get into the stores, or the lines of people who camped out just to be first in line,  but rather :  'Black Friday — Not so Black', 'Black Friday Sales Slip from Year Prior', 'Black Friday Store Sales Fall as Americans Buy More Online' and 'Black Friday Was a Bust!' SunTrust Robinson Humphrey summed it up by saying:  ""We believe that Thanksgiving shopping was a bust""…. but is that really what happened?  Is it just that the shopping moved from physical to virtual?  Consumers no longer feeling the need to get up and go out.....but rather sit home in their 'skivvies', open up their computers and shop online...spending some $4.4 bil online over the weekend.......in fact this morning's WSJ lays it out clearly: ""Online Shopping Surges on Black Friday Weekend - online shopping, especially via mobile phones, surges, showing how buying habits have changed"" What a contrast to years past? I mean who remembers the look of terrorized sales clerks as throngs of crazed, almost hysterical,  shoppers pushed their way into the stores at midnight? So what’s the consensus? Seems to me that it was a lot of wasted time and talk about Black Friday..... and since all of these 'sales' were happening 'online' as well as in the store in the week's prior to Black Friday and will surely happen in the weeks following Black Friday — why then should anyone rush out and shop on Black Friday?  What is the advantage?  Apparently Zero! The question then becomes - What happens to the margins?  Yes - we are told that sales rose 14%  y/y but at what cost?   Will retailers crush margins in order to entice the consumer to part with their dollars?  And then what does that really mean for the investment thesis?  Is that Bullish?  What is important to remember though — is that the shopping season is not made up of any one day…..it is the culmination of shopping that takes place from early  October — right thru Christmas and then it is the shopping that takes place on Christmas day thru year end when retailers slash the prices of anything that remains to get it 'off the shelf'.  So before anyone goes and makes an investment decision based on Black Friday — remember — Black Friday was a day created by the industry to create hype and excitement — in the end — the results will be what they are…..I am just not sure it will be what the retailers want them to be - but we shall see.OK — back to the mkts…on Friday we saw China get slammed (again) — down some +5% as concern over the slide in industrial profits once again takes center stage causing some analysts to ring the alarm about a deteriorating Chinese economy.  Add in the newly announced probe into some of China's largest brokerages and you had the perfect backdrop for investors to hit the SELL button.   This morning we saw a repeat of that story.... Asian mkts continued to come under pressure overnight as this story builds....   At one point China was off another 3.5% in early trading only to recoup those losses and end the day marginally higher.  The volatility in the Chinese mkts illustrates the difficulty that Chinese officials face as they try to transform their economy and allow the mkts to price in real risk as the gov't attempts to withdraw support.    Japan -0.69%,  Hong Kong -0.33%,  China +0.26%  and ASX -0.69%.In Europe this morning we are seeing those mkts flat to slightly higher as investors there discount the negative moves out of Asia and begin the week anticipating more stimulus to be announced by the ECB on Thursday. The  Eurostoxx index - an index of 50 blue chip stocks that represent the 'super sector' leaders from 12  Eurozone countries -  is up 2% this month and it is up 17%  off  the September lows as optimism builds over the strength of the Eurozone economy as well as the potential for more Kool Aid offered up by the ECB.  ECB Pres Draghi is expected to announce even more stimulus by pushing the cost of parking money at the ECB even higher ( rates to go further into NEGATIVE territory) as he tries to force the banks to lend vs. hoard. FTSE -0.04%, CAC 40 +0.67%, DAX  +0.97%, Eurostoxx  +0.76%, Spain +0.98% and Italy +0.62%.  Now US futures have been all over the place, down nearly 9 pts in early pre-mkt trading and have now swung back to positive territory - currently up  3 pts at 2093 -  as traders/investors return from the long holiday weekend. Get ready for 'macro data overload' as US investors/traders get hit with a slew of data.In addition  we will hear from Fed Chair Yellen as she addresses the Economic Club of Washington on Wednesday and the Congressional Joint Economic Committee on Thursday -  Expect traders to listen intently to what she has to say. What does that mean for rates? By now — everyone should realize that it is NOT about the December 16/17th meeting any longer — it is now about what happens next year.Will she indicate that further rate hikes are in store in quick succession in the new year? Is she setting up to be more aggressive in the months ahead?   In addition - watch for the  'FED Bus Tour' featuring a range of FED officials as they pontificate over the state of the economy and monetary policy.Tomorrow we will get Chicago's Evans, and Fed Gov Brainard . Wednesday gives us Atlanta's Lockhart and San Fran's Williams. Thursday brings us Cleveland's Loretta Mester and Fed Vice Chair Fischer....and not to be outdone - Friday will play host to Philly's Harker, St. Louis's Bullard and Minneapolis's Kocherlatkota.Now this week brings a ton of macro data: Today brings us Chicago PMI - exp of 54, Dallas Fed Survey of -10  and Pending Home Sales  of 1%. Tomorrow we get Manf PMI of 52.6, Construction Spending of +0.6%, ISM Manf of 50.5. Wednesday - ADP Employment of +190k....But the KICKER is on Friday when we get the final NFP report before the next FED meeting — expectations are for +200k jobs to be created — which would be down significantly from last month — but strong enough for her to say:  ""And we’re OFF!""(We would have to see a number sub 100k for there to be any concern that she will go into another holding pattern - not happening....)Stay tuned - it is sure to be a week of volatility and excitement.

364,ADP,"Shareholders of ServiceNow (NOW) are awaiting Wednesday's Q3 earnings to see whether the business-software maker can live up to expectations and more than double its EPS, and if so, whether that indicates a solid quarter for business-software firms overall.ServiceNow is expected to report EPS ex items of 8 cents, up from 3 cents in Q3 2014, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue is forecast to rise 43% to $256.2 million.The company has had a tough time staying in the black, but this could mark the fifth straight quarter of profit.

365,ADP,"Manhattan Associates surprised Wall Street with better-than-expected third-quarter earnings and revenue, and predicted a strong finish to the year with a raised full-year earnings forecast.The business software maker said that its adjusted net income for the period ending Sept. 30 grew 31% from a year earlier to 42 cents a share, while revenue climbed 13% to $142.3 million. The firm came in ahead of a 36-cent EPS forecast from analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, also topping their expectation of $141.1 million in revenue.Manhattan Associates (MANH) now sees full-year adjusted EPS of $1.47 to $1.49, up from its prior prediction of $1.40 to $1.42. It left the full-year revenue forecast at $553 million to $558 million. Analysts have been predicting adjusted EPS of $1.41 on $556.8 million in revenue.In a press release, CEO Eddie Capel said that the outlook for the rest of this year is ""quite positive.""""Demand for our omnichannel, store and distribution management solutions continues to be strong, and we continue to lead with product innovation to enhance our market leadership position,"" he said in a prepared statement.Executives said on a call with analysts Tuesday that they see fourth-quarter revenue declining, as expected, in line with seasonal changes. The company expects revenue growth between 9% and 10% for 2016, while analysts have been expecting 10%.Business Software BuzzesManhattan stock ended the regular trading session down 3% to 66.19 but recovered almost all of the territory in post-close action following its earnings report.Manhattan is a relatively small player in the business-software arena, also known as enterprise, making supply-chain and inventory-management programs. Gaining ground in the market are other, much larger players such as Salesforce.com (CRM), Automatic Data Processing (ADP) and Workday (WDAY), all of which have prospered lately.Another notable player, SAP (SAP), reported earnings Tuesday morning in line with pre-announced results from last week, helping the company's stock to its 12th gain in the last 13 trading sessions, up 17% in that time. Others in the sector used the Aug. 24 flash crash as a springboard for recovery, with Salesforce, ADP and Workday all adding 13% to 19% in that time.Manhattan's stock performance over the long term, as well as in the market's recent rough patches, has garnered investor attention. Manhattan shares have trended up since the flash crash by over 16% to not far off a July high of 69.81.The company has notched double-digit earnings growth for every reporting period since the second quarter of 2011, helping it achieve a Composite Rating of 98 out of a possible 99 from IBD. It also has a high EPS Rating and Relative Price Strength Rating.Analyst Yun Kim from Lake Street Capital Markets initiated coverage on Manhattan in a research note Monday with a buy rating, and said that the firm has ""quietly developed a reputation among investors as one of the best-executing software companies.""""With the industry's most comprehensive omnichannel solutions that are integrated to the company's strength in supply-chain operations, the company is well positioned to continue to maintain its leadership position in this fast-growing and expanding market opportunity, which we believe is still in the early stage of market adoption,"" Kim wrote.

366,ADP,"Private employers added 182,000 jobs in October, payroll processor ADP said. That marked a drop from September's downwardly revised 190,000 and was about what analysts had forecast.October gains were led by a rebound in hiring by small businesses, adding 90,000 jobs. ""Large companies continue to be negatively impacted by trends such as low oil prices and the strong dollar driving weaker exports,"" ADP said in a statement. ""On the other hand, small businesses can benefit from these trends.""The goods-producing sector had its best month of 2015, although manufacturing shed 2,000 jobs in October. Construction stayed strong, with 35,000 jobs added, about the same as in September.ADP's report is often used to forecast the Labor Department's official jobs data, due out two days later, although ADP's numbers are sometimes imperfect. Economists expect Labor to announce a gain of 190,000 jobs Friday.

368,ADP,"Stocks should have celebrated that 'great news'.....yet - they showed a lack of direction for much of Friday as traders/investors digested the 'blow the roof off the house' monthly jobs report. The major averages spent the day bouncing back and forth across the unchanged line before closing mixed.
"
369,ADP,"U.S. employers supposedly added jobs in October at a pace unimagined while boosting wages at the fastest rate since 2009, giving the FED the all clear signal  that the economy is back and is strong enough to withstand an interest-rate increase next month.
"
370,ADP,"Nonfarm payrolls rose a seasonally adjusted 271,000 last month - beating the expectation by more than 100k jobs - causing the unemployment rate to fall  to 5%, a level Fed officials expected it to reach before the end of the yr.  [ Note that September was revised down to 135,000 and remember that last month August had been revised dramatically down as well.]  I would expect that October's numbers will also be 'revised' next month — or maybe in January, after the Fed has used these 'dramatically improved' numbers to justify  a rate hike in December.  I mean these numbers are just too good to be believed.  
"
371,ADP,"Economists and strategists are now convinced that  the likelihood of the first rate increase is now on the table - remember - 'Fed officials have said for months they would start lifting their benchmark rate, which has been near zero since late 2008, after they saw more improvement in the labor market and felt ""reasonably confident"" annual inflation would rise toward their 2% target'...Stephen Stanley - Chief Economist at Amhearst Pierpoint Securities had this to say:  ""This is the kind of employment report that even the most diehard doves on the Fed cannot ignore,""  I would say - ""That is if you believe it"".  
"

"
653,ADP,"Have employers cut work hours to avoid ObamaCare penalties? There's no clearer test than the one put forth by the White House Council of Economic Advisers.The Affordable Care Act employer mandate applies to workers who clock at least 30 hours per week. So if companies were seeking to minimize liability, we'd likely see a drop in the number of workers with hours just above that threshold relative to the number with hours just below it.The White House test, as amended in early 2014: ""Compute the ratio of persons working 31-34 hours per week to persons working 25-29 hours per week.""30-Hour Dividing LineThe results, seen in the accompanying chart, are striking. After leveling off for a couple of years as the economy recovered from recession, the ratio began a sharp and sudden dive in 2013. In June of this year, there were 191,000 fewer workers with usual work schedules of 31 to 34 hours in their main jobs than at the end of 2012, a drop of 8%. Meanwhile, an additional 406,000 people usually worked 25 to 29 hours, up 12%. These figures average 12 months of data because the U.S. Census' Current Population Survey (CPS) data are volatile from month to month.The divergent shifts on either side of the 30-hour divide coincide almost perfectly with the initial measurement period for ObamaCare employer penalties that began in 2013. Potential liability is determined a year before the penalties are actually imposed, so employers began responding in a pretty big way in early 2013.While the data show that the shift away from a 31- to 34-hour workweek became obvious in the final quarter of 2013, the data are consistent with employers adjusting work hours months earlier. That's not only because it takes some time for employers to implement such changes but also because census interviewers ask people to give their most frequent schedule over the past four or five months.The timing also matches the surge in anecdotal reports of employers cutting work hours, which IBD collected in a database that grew to 450 employers.The timing also matches up well with the relapse in the average workweek in low-wage industries. That's evident in the other chart based on Bureau of Labor Statistics data from the monthly establishment survey.As noted above, the White House economists tweaked their test of ObamaCare's impact. Initially, they had counted the 5 million or so people reported by the census to be working exactly 30 hours a week as full-time under ObamaCare. Once IBD brought it to their attention that the census rounds up, counting 30 minutes or more as a full hour, the White House acknowledged that including those workers ""may be misleading.""New Studies Claim No ObamaCare Jobs ImpactThat rounding problem is all the reason needed to dismiss one of three new studies casting doubt on ObamaCare's impact on work hours. The authors of an Urban Institute study treat all 5 million 30-hour workers as full time, rendering their analysis unreliable.Indeed, there were numerous reports of employers cutting workers to 29.5 or even 29.75 hours. Economists have noted that workers with their hours closest to 30 are most likely to have their schedules trimmed. Not only is it less disruptive to worker morale to lose a half hour of work, as opposed to 3 or 4 hours, but the penalty is greatest per hour of work for those working exactly 30 hours.For companies that provide coverage to most workers over 30 hours, that penalty equals $3,120 per uncovered full-timer in 2015. Remember that the penalty is paid after taxes. Converted to the equivalent in tax-deductible wages, the fine is equal to about $5,120 in wages for a company facing the average combined federal and state tax rate of 39.1%.Now it's fair to say that as employment has picked up and the jobless rate has come down, companies have likely become somewhat less concerned about ObamaCare penalties and more concerned about finding and hanging onto good workers. But as the penalty grows from year to year (along with the growth of the average national health insurance premium), so too may its bite, particularly as the economic cycle begins to turn.The Secret Of TimingTiming, in other words, matters a lot, and timing may be the biggest problem with the other two studies. One study from Aparna Mathur and Michael Strain of the American Enterprise Institute and Sita Slavov of George Mason University compares work hours before ObamaCare's passage (from January 2008 to February 2010) to work hours after (from March 2010 to July 2014).Thus, the ""after"" includes nearly three full years before the earliest measurement period for ObamaCare penalties was set to begin, during which time the Supreme Court was set to decide whether the individual mandate was kosher and President Obama had to face re-election.Asked whether it would have made more sense to focus on the period starting in 2013, Strain responded: ""I don't agree that it would have made more sense, but I do agree that this would be an interesting question to study.""Strain and his colleagues did find a shift from above 30 hours to below, but the shift wasn't more pronounced in lower-wage service industries likely to feel the brunt of the mandate, so the authors concluded that the mandate didn't have an effect.One shortcoming of the methodology is that it looked at employment by industry, not occupation. Yet school districts, local governments and colleges account for the bulk of IBD's database of hour-cutters. The fact that bus drivers, cafeteria workers and paraprofessionals lost hours in a high-paying industry actually helps generate the study's conclusion that ObamaCare hasn't had an impact.Other data also appear to contradict their finding that service-sector workers aren't bearing the brunt of short shifts and lack of full-time jobs. Researchers from the Atlanta Federal Reserve noted earlier this year that the share of workers stuck in part-time jobs was nearly back to normal in production industries but the recovery had barely dented the share of people working part time for economic reasons in general service industries.Timing is also a main flaw of a third study from human resources service provider ADP, which compared work hours in the third quarter of 2013 to the fourth quarter of 2014. The study missed out on the substantial shift that was already well advanced when the Obama administration, at the start of July 2013, pushed back the mandate penalty until 2015. The White House subsequently delayed the penalty for companies with fewer than 100 full-time equivalent workers until 2016.Lastly, it's not clear how well the ADP study adjusts for seasonal factors, since retail and hospitality-sector workers tend to work longer hours in the fourth quarter. It's hard to conclude much from studying a quarter's worth of data, especially the fourth quarter.

(I mean be honest here).

I think the mindset is changing a bit.....I think families want a different experience - and with a stronger dollar - taking your family to Europe is more of a option............So I think the vacation dollars are just being spent more wisely. Again - maybe not so good for Disney - but it is good for families.

Yesterday - it managed to trade back above short-term supports at 2094 to close higher at 2099. This morning - Futures are flat as the market awaits tomorrows NFP report.

How happy is Lindsay Graham? He actually lobbied for his position to be on the JV team......So - if nothing else - it is sure to be a bit entertaining and will provide so much fodder for the late night talk shows and of course the perennial favorite - SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE.No matter what happens tonight - the field has to start to consolidate if the GOP has any chance at all of delivering a message to American voters. Currently - with 17 candidates running - the GOP appears fractured and fragmented and the message is getting lost in the antics provided cost free (because he doesn't need any money - as he has told us over and over) by none other than The Donald. The big question - how many minutes into the debate before The Donald's head explodes?Look - don't expect too much tonight - with only 2 hours and 10 candidates - there will not be a lot of substance to the debate - How could any one of them possibly really state their case for why they should be the POTUS (Pres. of the United States)? And just how will 3 moderators - Chris Wallace, Brett Baier and Megyn Kelly really be able to control the crowd without it looking like a sitcom? So sit back, get the popcorn and enjoy the show. Nothing that happens tonight will have any effect on the broader market or investor/trader mentality.__________________________________________________________________Stocks spiked sharply higher yesterday morning but then lost some ground as investors/traders digested another mixed batch of economic news (ADP) and earnings (Walt Disney (DIS) - the standout disappointment).

'13.

The 287,762 cuts in '15 are up 17% from '14.

Purchases were down 4% and refinancings sank 5% as the average interest rate rose 5 bps. A jobs index from Gallup rose in June to the highest since '12.

But his counterproposal differed enough that creditors — and markets — remained skeptical. All eyes are on the ECB, which must decide whether to keep extending emergency liquidity to Greek banks, which are closed all week, following a skipped payment to the IMF Tues. The June eurozone factory PMI was unchanged at 52.5 in June, 0.3 point above May, Markit said. France's PMI was upped to 50.7 in the final read from 50.5, while Germany's reading was unchanged at 51.9, nearly a point above May.Japan spending, confidence roar backThe Q2 Tankan survey found big companies plan to up capex by 9.3% in fiscal '16, the strongest pace in a decade.

884,ADP,"In a ""new normal"" slow-growth economy, smaller firms are more exposed to local or sector slumps. Large businesses are far more likely to have national exports and overseas operations.
"

893,ADP,"Employment at large firms rose by an average of about 7,000 a month following the three downturns before the Great Recession, while small-firm job growth averaged 82,000, according to recent Goldman Sachs research using Census Bureau data.
"
894,ADP,"But in 2010-12, after the Great Recession, big businesses added an average of 42,000 per month, while employment at small firms shrank by 700. Goldman also noted that wage growth at large firms outpaced that at small firms by 6 percentage points from 1996 through 2009. But in the past five years, that gap has swelled by an additional 14 percentage points.

"

980,ADP,"The US Trade Deficit - So you ask - what is that? And why is that measure now being credited with putting pressure on the mkt?
"
981,ADP,"The Trade Deficit is 'an economic measure of a negative balance of trade in which a country's imports exceeds its exports. The Trade Deficit represents an outflow of domestic currency to foreign markets' - Investopedia
"
982,ADP,"And why is this a problem? The theory goes that as the deficit widens - that means that more US dollars are being held by foreign nations - who at some point 'may' decide to sell them - which would put pressure on the value of the US dollar.....hmmmm pressure on the dollar would drive the dollar lower - something that the FED worked very hard to achieve over the past 7 yrs - causing a 200%+ run in the mkt......... so why now is a 'weaker dollar' causing tremors in the mkt?
"
983,ADP,"Now - Since August 2014 - we have seen the dollar rise 23% and have had to listen to all the analysts tell us how 'negative' the stronger dollar was going to be for the US economy.....Yet - the mkt continued to advance and companies did NOT get broadly slammed as we were told they would............Look - a strong dollar is indicative of a strong economy - thus when the dollar is strong - the 'perception' is that the economy is strong......so herein lies the conundrum.....Is our dollar strong because the economy IS strong or because other major currencies are weak due to those ""QE"" programs abroad? And IF that is the reason for our strong dollar - then maybe it's not all a bed of roses......and in fact maybe the economy is not so robust - causing a near term re-pricing of risk.
"
984,ADP,"Well - at least in the 1Q of 2015 - we have learned that the economy is not so strong...in fact with yesterday's trade deficit read - we can now expect 1Q GDP to be revised lower - taking it clearly into negative territory when we get this month's revision. And so - the reality of the 'state of the union' hits home as strategists play with the numbers in their excel spreadsheets to come up with new valuations - causing the algo's to light up as risk is re-priced.
"
985,ADP,"The mkt began weak but then turned uglier as the day wore on as the analysis of the underlying economics kept getting uglier. The move lower more than offset the gains seen over the past 2 days and once we started breaking support levels - the algo's then ramped it up and selling begets selling.....
"

The major indexes all ended the day firmly in negative territory breaking below the short term 50 dma support line........ The Dow slid 142 points - breaking support, Nasdaq plunged 78 points - breaking support, The Russell small call falling 1.45% breaking below its midterm support line (100 dma)......and the S&P tumbled 25 points ending the day right on its short term support line.....

This caught many analysts/strategists by surprise....and when they are surprised you can imagine what happens to the algo's....... Yesterday, as the S&P 500 was nearing yet another new all-time record - sellers came out in droves, buyers pulled back and the waves of selling washed over the mkt....

We have seen what the strong dollar did in the 1Q, so its anyone's guess about what the FED wants......My sense is that they want a weaker dollar to help revive growth going forward......

And why is that measure now being credited with putting pressure on the mkt?The Trade Deficit is 'an economic measure of a negative balance of trade in which a country's imports exceeds its exports. The Trade Deficit represents an outflow of domestic currency to foreign markets' - InvestopediaAnd why is this a problem? The theory goes that as the deficit widens - that means that more US dollars are being held by foreign nations - who at some point 'may' decide to sell them - which would put pressure on the value of the US dollar.....hmmmm pressure on the dollar would drive the dollar lower - something that the FED worked very hard to achieve over the past 7 yrs - causing a 200%+ run in the mkt......... so why now is a 'weaker dollar' causing tremors in the mkt?Now - Since August 2014 - we have seen the dollar rise 23% and have had to listen to all the analysts tell us how 'negative' the stronger dollar was going to be for the US economy.....Yet - the mkt continued to advance and companies did NOT get broadly slammed as we were told they would............Look - a strong dollar is indicative of a strong economy - thus when the dollar is strong - the 'perception' is that the economy is strong......so herein lies the conundrum.....Is our dollar strong because the economy IS strong or because other major currencies are weak due to those ""QE"" programs abroad? And IF that is the reason for our strong dollar - then maybe it's not all a bed of roses......and in fact maybe the economy is not so robust - causing a near term re-pricing of risk.Well - at least in the 1Q of 2015 - we have learned that the economy is not so strong...in fact with yesterday's trade deficit read - we can now expect 1Q GDP to be revised lower - taking it clearly into negative territory when we get this month's revision. And so - the reality of the 'state of the union' hits home as strategists play with the numbers in their excel spreadsheets to come up with new valuations - causing the algo's to light up as risk is re-priced.The mkt began weak but then turned uglier as the day wore on as the analysis of the underlying economics kept getting uglier. The move lower more than offset the gains seen over the past 2 days and once we started breaking support levels - the algo's then ramped it up and selling begets selling.....Rising volatility and continued concerns over Greece, China, the FED, The ECB, Oil, Bonds - both US and European, the dollar, earnings and collapsing revenues all contributed to the building negative mood yesterday... The major indexes all ended the day firmly in negative territory breaking below the short term 50 dma support line........

"
999,ADP,"Enter the outsourcers. As more companies decide to put all the data and technology that goes into human resources management on the Internet or ""cloud,"" opportunities are rising for nimble providers of cloud-based solutions.
"
1000,ADP,"One of the fastest growing of these so-called human-capital management, or HCM, cloud providers is Paycom Software (PAYC). It helps businesses automate and manage what it calls the ""complete employment life cycle from recruitment to retirement.""
"
1001,ADP,"Founded in 1998 by CEO Chad Richison, Paycom has diversified from its roots in payroll processing into a broader range of HCM applications.
"
1002,ADP,"Since the company went public in April 2014 at an offering price of 15, its stock has more than doubled. Revenue last year soared 40% to $151 million.
"
1003,ADP,"Working New Angles
"
1004,ADP,"A majority of Paycom's revenue still comes from payroll processing. But now payroll is a starting point: the firm upsells customers higher-margin HCM products that handle such things as talent acquisition and time and labor management.
"
1005,ADP,"In December, Paycom launched a new ""dashboard"" to its existing compliance solution on the Affordable Care Act to navigate the new employer mandate that went into effect in January. Earlier this year Paycom rolled out a new ""learning management"" system.
"
1006,ADP,"Paycom targets midsize companies with employees of 50 to 2,000. But some customers are larger, including three added in the fourth quarter. One longer-standing client employs more than 8,000.
"
1007,ADP,"Paycom's services are delivered as a single software-as-a-service application, making use of a single, multi-tenant database. It's a relatively low-cost solution but one that still allows for decent returns, analysts say.
"
1008,ADP,"""A lot of SaaS companies of this size are losing money. This company is making money, though not much,"" said Jim Macdonald, an analyst with First Analysis Securities.
"
1009,ADP,"Small as that profit is, it is growing. In Q4, the company earned $3.1 million, or 6 cents per share, vs. a slight loss a year earlier.
"
1010,ADP,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Q1 earnings of 8 cents a share, up from 3 cents a year earlier. They see a 47% gain in full-year earnings to 28 cents on a per-share basis, up from 19 cents in 2014.
"
1011,ADP,"In contrast, Paylocity (PCTY), which is viewed as Paycom's closest like-kind rival, has mostly logged quarterly losses, though revenue is growing at a fast clip.
"
1012,ADP,"Revenue in Paycom's fourth quarter jumped 45% year-over-year to $44 million, the highest percentage gain in a long string of strong double-digit increases. Analysts expect revenue to climb another 31% this year to $197.1 million, according to Thomson Reuters.
"
1013,ADP,"Sales People And Software

1014,ADP,"Much of Paycom's success has to do with its integrated software, says Richard Davis, an analyst with Canaccord Genuity.

"
1017,ADP,"Racing For Customers
"
1018,ADP,"Paycom opened five new sales offices in Q1, for 35 in total, all in the U.S. Paycom hires a lot of recent college graduates, with some work experience under their belts, and then trains them, Macdonald says.
"
1019,ADP,"Pricing is based on the number of customers' employees and the number of apps utilized. Davis figures that Paycom would get $20 per month per employee if all its apps were utilized, up from a starting point of around $10 or less per month. However, that could take some time.
"
1020,ADP,"""Right now it's a race to see who can get the customers,"" he said. ""It's like an open field and everyone is trying to get as many customers as they can. Once you land them they are sticky because it's a pain to switch.""
"
1021,ADP,"Companies typically switch payroll/HCM vendors every five to 10 years, he says.
"
1022,ADP,"At the end of 2014, Paycom served more than 12,000 clients and stored data for around 1.6 million of their employees.
"
1023,ADP,"Its high customer retention rate — steady lately at 91% — is ""more reflective of an enterprise customer base and demonstrates the strategic value of Paycom's solutions,"" Jefferies analyst John DiFucci said in a research note.

1024,ADP,"Another successful cloud-focused firm is Ultimate Software (ULTI), which saw revenue rise 23% in 2014 to $505.9 million.
"
1025,ADP,"Not to be left behind, much bigger incumbents with legacy technology are expanding into cloud solutions. Automatic Data Processing (ADP), for example, is ""heavily investing in and quickly transitioning clients to new platforms,"" noted JPMorgan analyst Mark Murphy in a research note.
"
1026,ADP,"Paychex (PAYX), which targets small-to-midsize firms, has added an SaaS platform called SurePayroll, he added.
"
1027,ADP,"Citing industry estimates in government filings, Paycom sizes the U.S. market for HCM applications in 2015 at roughly $7 billion, excluding payroll services. For payroll services alone it's an estimated $16.8 billion. But more ""narrowly defined"" to address the midmarket cloud space Paycom targets, Davis says the firm's addressable market is much smaller, perhaps $3 billion or more — ""still plenty big.""
"
1028,ADP,"""In a given year by our math $200 or $300 million in contracts are up in the air to be won"" by Paycom, Davis said.
"
1029,ADP,"In payroll outsourcing, Paycom is displacing incumbents such as ADP, privately held Ceridian, Paychex and Intuit (INTU), Murphy notes. And in broader HCM solutions it's homing in on the likes of the fast-growing Workday (WDAY) as well as Cornerstone OnDemand (CSOD).
"
1030,ADP,"Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP) are rivals in both payroll and the broader HCM space.

1042,ADP,"Stocks slumped again Wednesday, but closed off lows, as economic data weighed. The Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.4% each. Preliminary data showed NYSE and Nasdaq volume coming in higher than Tuesday's total.Manufacturing data was mixed and ADP employment data missed expectations ahead of Friday's jobs report. The stock market will be closed Friday in observance of Good Friday but March job data will still be released.In the stock market today, oil and gas stocks outperformed amid a surge in oil prices, while airlines lagged.American (AAL), Delta (DAL) and United Continental (UAL) fell hard after Deutsche Bank lowered all three to hold from buy, citing a strong U.S. dollar and capacity increases by non-U.S. carriers.Elsewhere, Apple (AAPL) held up well. Shares eased 0.1% after influential Apple analyst Gene Muenster said he expects the tech bellwether to sell 1 million Apple Watches during its opening weekend.

1043,ADP,"Manufacturing's recent rough patch lingered into early spring, a set of reports released Wednesday revealed.The Institute for Supply Management's March index slid 1.4 points to 51.5, the lowest in nearly two years. The export orders gauge sank another point to 47.5, its third straight month below the 50 mark that signals contraction. The new orders index fell 0.7 point to 51.8. And the jobs reading lost 1.4 points, touching 50.The jobs weakness was echoed by the ADP employment survey, which showed March private payrolls rose by 189,000, the weakest since January 2014. Manufacturers shed some 7,000 jobs, the first cuts since the Polar Vortex at the start of last year. Factors ranging from declining energy sector activity to winter weather took a toll in March, survey respondents told ISM, even as some were upbeat. ""March business is improving over Jan-Feb, thawing out of this crazy winter,"" one said. Several referenced ongoing supply chain interruptions from the West Coast ports work slowdown, which ended in mid-February.""There are so many balls in the air right now,"" said Jennifer Lee, senior economist for BMO Capital Markets.Lee largely blames a stronger dollar for the recent economic sluggishness. The buck is expected to keep rising as the Fed gets set to raise rates while other central banks ease aggressively. Still, she believes energy sector retrenchment has widespread ""spillover"" effects. Orders for durable goods sank 1.4% in February, the Commerce Department said last week. Orders excluding transportation fell for a fifth straight month. Companies including Caterpillar (CAT) and ConocoPhillips (COP) have said they will cut capital spending as oil prices hover at half their 2014 levels.The recent weakness in manufacturing and energy has been accompanied by other economic data that's frustrated analysts. Consumers remain cautious. Despite solid gains in income and wages in February, the savings rate popped to a two-year high.On the upside, U.S. auto sales picked up in March, automakers said Wednesday, fueled by SUVs,pickups and luxury vehicles.But the ISM and ADP reports worried investors Wednesday.The S&P 500 fell 0.4%, well off session lows. The 10-year Treasury yield retreated.ADP's data are not always a good guide of Labor Department data, Action Economics' Chief Economist Michael Englund wrote in a note, but job gains still ""face downside risk"" from everything from lower business sentiment to a slower pace of auto production. Analysts expect a rise of 247,000 jobs in Labor's March employment report on Friday.Wednesday's jobs figures were ""disappointing,"" Lee said, ""but the jobless rate is still at a 6 1/2 year low. Wages will start to pick up. At the end of the day as long as you have a job that's the supporting factor behind consumer spending and consumer spending is what drives the U.S. economy.""

It's a dominant player in the industry, along with its main competitor, Automatic Data Processing (ADP).When it comes to earnings and dividend stability, it's hard to do much better than Paychex. In January, the company declared a quarterly dividend of 38 cents a share, payable on Feb. 17 to shareholders of record Feb. 2. An annualized dividend of $1.52 gives it a yield of around 3.2%.In December, Paychex reported fiscal second-quarter profit of 47 cents a share, up 9% from a year ago. Sales growth accelerated from the prior quarter, rising 10% to $676.3 million. Payroll service sales rose 4% to $411.2 million. Human resources services sales jumped 21% to $254.7 million.In the second quarter, the company unveiled Paychex Flex, which integrates a software-as-a-service platform with the company's newly expanded service offerings.Meanwhile, a new product related to health care reform is doing well. It offers clients assistance in understanding the Affordable Care Act and its impact on business.At the end of the second quarter, Paychex's cash and total corporate investments totaled $927.5 million. The company is debt-free.Despite steady price performance in recent months, Paychex has its share of detractors. Short interest has stayed relatively high in the stock for several months, perhaps because of fears that the job market isn't as strong as recent data indicate. In mid-January, short interest totaled 14.7 million shares, according to Nasdaq.com.Paychex is a good example of how a stock can trend higher despite high short interest.

1238,ADP,"Maybe the race wasn't to the swift during biblical times, but in the 21st century you'll get left behind in a hurry if you're slow out of the gate with new technologies.Rivals of Ultimate Software Group (ULTI) are finding that out.Ultimate makes workforce management software designed to help clients better manage employee-related services such as payroll, benefits, recruiting, performance management and time management.The core product is UltiPro, software that manages the employment life cycle from recruitment to retirement. Ultimate delivers it via the Internet cloud.That last part — the cloud — is what separates Ultimate from others in its industry, analysts say. Ultimate was an early mover in designing an integrated, cloud-based human resources/payroll system, giving it a leg up on rivals who have taken longer to leverage the cloud.""As the move to the cloud has accelerated, Ultimate has been one of the biggest beneficiaries,"" said Samad Samana, analyst at FBR Capital Markets. ""They are taking a lot of customers away from ADP (ADP), Ceridian and Paychex (PAYX).""Clout Of The CloudCloud-based systems have several advantages over hardware-based systems, Samana told IBD.""There is a lower overall cost of ownership because you don't have to purchase hardware,"" he said. ""There's less staff cost in terms of management. And there are more frequent updates to the software, which helps you keep up with the pace of innovation.""Ultimate's ability to trot out new products and innovations has been one of the keys to its consistent financial growth through the years. The company posts double-digit sales and earnings gains with regularity and is expected to keep doing so well into the future.""The market for Ultimate's solutions is large and growing rapidly. The company has strong, highly regarded products, increasing scale, and a business model that better balances revenue growth and profitability than many SaaS (software as a service) peers,"" MKM Partners analyst Kevin Buttigieg noted in a report last month initiating coverage on Ultimate with a ""buy"" rating.Ultimate boasts 2,700 customers with employees in 150 countries. Its client list features a diverse range of firms, including software maker Adobe Systems (ADBE), restaurant operators Bloomin' Brands (BLMN) and Texas Roadhouse (TXRH), auto parts retailer Pep Boys (PBY) and Major League Baseball.Ultimate mainly focuses on two types of customers: enterprise companies, defined as those with more than 1,500 employees, and mid-market companies, or those with around 500 to 1,500 employees.Ultimate's enterprise sales team, which consists of 75 sales reps, has ""an unusually low turnover"" rate with an average tenure of 10 years, Barrington Research analyst Jeff Houston noted following Ultimate's third-quarter earnings report on Oct. 28.He cites several reasons for the low turnover, including ""not penalizing successful salespeople by narrowing their territories as well as world-class benefits.""Winning BusinessDuring a conference call with analysts, Ultimate CEO Scott Scherr noted a number of enterprise wins during the company's third quarter, though he didn't divulge the names of the customers. These included a ""high-profile"" restaurant chain with 18,000 employees, a security company with 6,500 employees and an education services company with 3,600 employees.While most of Ultimate's business comes from large and mid-sized clients, the company has lately increased its efforts to land more smaller companies of 500 or fewer employees, analyst Houston says.""Management was clear that it has been selling to companies with fewer than 500 employees for a long time, and that it is just adding more salespeople to target the low end of the market,"" he noted.FBR's Samana reckons it will be some time before the move to land more smaller clients begins to have much impact on Ultimate's financial results.""The move downstream is a newer initiative for them, so it's something where we will see a bigger contribution a couple of years from now,"" he said. ""It's not as big a driver in the near term.""What About Job Gains?Although analyst Houston says Ultimate stands to benefit as the economy adds jobs, CEO Scherr mentioned on the third-quarter conference call that with new customers being Ultimate Software's biggest growth driver, changes in employment ""are not that material"" to the overall growth goal.During the third quarter the company logged revenue of $127.4 million, up 24% from the prior year and just ahead of consensus analyst views. Earnings gained 25% to 50 cents a share, topping estimates by a penny.Recurring revenue, or revenue that is likely to continue in the future, increased 26% during the quarter.""The increase was primarily attributable to revenue growth from our cloud offering,"" Scherr said in a statement.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Ultimate to post full-year 2014 earnings of $2.02 a share, up 26% from a year earlier. EPS is seen rising another 22% to $2.46 in 2015.The company's stock price touched a nearly eight-month high of 156.20 on Tuesday. Shares are up 20% since Oct. 10.Ultimate is part of IBD's Computer Software-Enterprise group, which ranks No. 7 out of 197 industries tracked. The company has an IBD Composite Rating of 97, which ranks fifth in the group. Three stocks in the group have Composite Ratings of 99: Manhattan Associates (MANH), Paycom Software (PAYC) and Synchronoss Technologies (SNCR).

1334,ADP,"Ken Nickerson has a tough decision to make.
"
1335,ADP,"His employer, the University of Nebraska, is offering attractive retirement packages to eligible faculty. The 71-year-old biology professor passed on a similar offer in 2010 and wonders if he'll be lucky enough to receive another in two to five years, when he hopes to retire.
"
1336,ADP,"Nickerson understands why the university is asking older folks to step aside.
"
1337,ADP,"""There's a level of energy a 35-40-year-old will bring to writing grant proposals and manuscripts and just thinking about the world that someone who's 70 will not,"" he said.
"
1338,ADP,"Another key factor is that more experienced professors likely draw higher salaries than younger ones would. While the university doesn't have a specific budget target, a 2010 buyout saved $8.1 million as older faculty stepped down.
"
1339,ADP,"Something similar may be playing out across the country as thousands of older folks retire every day. The baby boom generation — those born from 1946 to 1964 — comprises 79 million Americans, according to Pew Research figures, and is dwarfed only by the millennials, 83 million strong and just starting their careers at the low rung of the pay ladder — if jobs are available.
"
1340,ADP,"The unusually large generational transition was intensified due to the 2008-09 recession and sluggish recovery. Many boomers delayed retirements as they lost jobs or had hours cut at the end of their careers. Many also saw the value of their retirement portfolios tank during the financial crisis.
"
1341,ADP,"There's some evidence that the generational shift is picking up, but its long delay may have had an impact even broader than previously realized, by depressing wage gains even as the job recovery shifted into high gear.
"
1342,ADP,"If that's true, it may have big implications for monetary policy.
"
1343,ADP,"Federal Reserve officials are worried about wage growth, which has plodded along at about 2% annually ever since the recession, barely above consumer inflation.
"
1344,ADP,"The Employment Cost Index, one of the most comprehensive measures of wages and benefits, rose 0.7% for a second straight quarter in Q3, the Labor Department said Friday. But those two strong quarters followed a 0.3% rise in Q1, which was among the lowest readings in three decades.
"
1345,ADP,"Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen and other monetary policymakers say that tepid wage gains have held back faster growth in areas like housing. More important, the Fed believes wages are the best barometer for gauging the labor market's health. As long as they stagnate, the Fed is reluctant to raise interest rates, believing there's still labor market slack, or an over-supply of workers, giving employers little reason to sweeten salaries.
"
1346,ADP,"Some analysts think official data may not capture the whole picture. The persistence of wage stagnation even as the jobless rate sinks below 6% and monthly job creation tops 200,000 suggests other trends may be at work.
"
1347,ADP,"Using data from payroll processor ADP, Moody's Analytics calculated in a recent report that 400,000 more job leavers and 500,000 more new entrants existed in Q3 than in the third quarter of 2013.

"
1354,ADP,"Retirement may be skewing another key Fed metric — the labor force participation rate, which skidded to a 36-year low of 62.7% in September. Philadelphia Fed research suggests a full 8/10 point of that rate's decline since 2012 is due to retirements, and not a sign of increased labor slack.
"
1355,ADP,"""This implies that the decline in the unemployment rate since 2012 is not due to more discouraged workers dropping out of the labor force,"" concluded the author, Shigeru Fujita.
"
1356,ADP,"Some analysts don't believe the retirement thesis. Gad Levanon, chief economist for the Conference Board, points out that the share of people over 55 who are working continues to grow, according to September Labor Department statistics. He also thinks the labor market is getting so tight that employers will soon have to pony up to keep experienced older workers from retiring.
"
1357,ADP,"Challenger agrees that the economy is nearing full employment, and expects shortages and ""a war for talent"" to pressure wages upward. He figures more flexible attitudes toward work post-retirement may help address some of that shortage.

1513,ADP,"That underlying strength was nowhere to be found in the Q1 GDP data, which was weaker than expected. Residential investment fell hard for a second straight quarter, and business fixed investment declined at a 5.5% rate.

U.S. businesses increased jobs by 139,000 last month, compared with a January gain of 127,000 that was revised down, according to the ADP Research Institute. The Labor Department is due to release February's nonfarm payrolls data on Friday.The Fed ""made the point that some of the weakness in the employment situation is due to the harsh winter weather,"" said Ray Remy, head of fixed income in New York at Daiwa Capital Markets America.The 10-year note yield was little changed at 2.70% as of 4:25 p.m. ET, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices.

"
1648,ADP,"Richard Herman Driehaus developed an investment approach using the ""buy high and sell higher"" principle. This investment strategy is ideal for that with the ability to take a high level of risks. These investors can use the Driehaus strategy by investing primarily in momentum stocks. The success of the strategy eventually helped Driehaus secure a place in Barron’s All-Century Team.Portfolios such as that of The American Association of Individual Investors (“AAII”) proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns. AAII’s portfolio, which was developed following the strategy, returned 13.5% and 18.1% in the five and 10- year time frames, respectively, compared with -1.1% and 4.2% returns for the S&P 500. Thus, investors with a high risk appetite may opt for this strategy.A Look at Driehaus’ StrategyAfter a detailed study of the Driehaus’ strategy, AAII concluded that it mainly focuses on strong earnings growth rates and impressive prospects to pick potential outperformers. While this strategy was made to provide better returns over the longer haul, companies with a strong history of beating estimates were also given importance.“I would much rather invest in a stock that’s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that’s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around,” Driehaus had said in an interview.Screening ParametersThe percentage 50-day moving average is one of the key criteria in this strategy. A positive percentage 50-day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50-day moving average level, indicating an uptrend. It is calculated by dividing the numerator (month-end price minus 50-day moving average of month-end price) by the 50-day moving average of the month-end price. Another momentum indicator – positive relative strength – has also been included in this strategy. In order to make the strategy more profitable, we have only considered those stocks that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) as well as a momentum score of ‘A’ or ‘B’. Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of ‘A’ or ‘B’ when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.• Zacks Rank equal to #1(Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through.

"
1650,ADP,"Welcome back from your Independence Day holiday — we sincerely hope you’ve kept all your digits intact for another year. This morning, we jump right back into new jobs data: specifically the ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) private sector payroll report and Initial Jobless Claims.Situated prior to Friday’s government jobs survey, the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ (BLS) non-farm payroll report and Unemployment Rate, today’s ADP numbers keep the narrative of a robust U.S. labor market, even as the headline number came in short of expectations. A total of 177K private-sector jobs for the month of June was below the 185K consensus estimate, and the second-lowest tally year to date. That said, the upward revision to May’s numbers — +11K to 189K overall — more than made up the difference.The ration between Services and Goods also remained consistent, at roughly 80/20: 29K new goods-producing jobs last month contrast with the 148K non-goods (services). We will see further services-related data after the opening bell today, both with Markit PMI and ISM reads expected to continue demonstrating overall strength.Medium-sized companies (between 50 and 499 employees) brought in the lion’s share of new jobs for June with 80K; large firms grew by 69K and small companies created 29K new positions. By sector, we revert to the multi-year recovery mean a bit: Education/Health Services and Leisure/Hospitality reported the most new jobs at 46K and 33K, respectively, while Construction’s 13K and Manufacturing’s 12K were further down the list.The estimate for tomorrow’s non-farm payrolls headline is roughly 195K, which is still more or less double the rate of labor force growth in the U.S. Meaning as long as we’re bringing in more than 100K jobs per month, we continue to enjoy an historically strong domestic employment situation. And we haven’t seen that few jobs created since last summer’s massive hurricane season; that said, the last time we reached 200K was back in February. One of the conditions of long-term employment recovery is that it tightens noticeably the higher it goes.That’s certainly the position we continue to see ourselves in now. A headline Unemployment Rate of 3.8% from May is expected to stay roughly in-line, which is again historically low. Important metrics to look at tomorrow will be the U-6 (aka “real unemployment,” which is sub-8% — also extremely low) and Average Wage Growth. We’ve seen wages gradually gain traction in this tightened labor market, with a typical rise of late around 0.3% month over month. Should this begin to ratchet up higher sooner, it would be a key indicator of inflation for the U.S. economy.Also this Thursday, Initial Jobless Claims data has been released. This too has come in a tad worse than anticipated: 231K from the upwardly revised 228K the previous week. We had been experiencing almost unheard of jobless claims rates sinking toward 200K per week, but it’s possible those rates are not fully sustainable, and we may be buoyed back to the 225-250K range consistent with the jobs recovery going back several years. Continuing claims ticked up to 1.739 million last week from just under 1.71 million the previous week — still impressively robust from an historic perspective.

1651,ADP,"A prudent investment decision involves buying stocks that have solid prospects and selling those that carry risks. At times, it is rational to hold certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions.Here we discuss about Genpact (G  -  Free Report), a stock that has rallied 19.6% over the past year. The company has expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 10%. The company’s strong prospects in the artificial intelligence (AI) space and benefits from strategic acquisitions are impressive.Let’s delve deeper in to Genpact’s key growth drivers.Acquisition a Key Growth StrategyGenpact is very active on the acquisition front. We believe that the buyouts of TandemSeven, BrightClaim and Rage Frameworks in 2017 are helping the company to expand product portfolio and gain new domain expertise.In fact, the addition of TandemSeven’s core design thinking process to Genpact’s AI platform is likely to help the latter become more customer-oriented company. Acquisition of BrightClaim and their associated company, National Vendor, should also strengthen Genpact’s insurance claims management expertise.Meanwhile, Rage Frameworks buyout expanded Genpact’s capability to provide AI offerings across industries, such as consumer packaged goods, industrial engineering, life-sciences and high-tech.Genpact’s other notable acquisitions include LeaseDimensions, Endeavour Software, Strategic Sourcing Excellence (SSE), PNMSoft Limited, Hitachi Management and Pharmalink Consulting. These buyouts have helped the company in expanding its presence in mobile technology, dynamic workflow solution, life sciences and banking operations. These, in turn, have driven customer base and top-line growth.Genpact Limited Revenue (TTM) Genpact Limited Revenue (TTM) | Genpact Limited QuoteArtificial Intelligence: Big OpportunityArtificial Intelligence presents significant growth opportunity for Genpact. Of late, the  company launched artificial intelligence (AI) platform — Genpact Cora — an automation to AI-based platform that combines its proprietary automation, analytics, and AI technologies into a single common platform.  This latest platform has a modular, interconnected network of technologies that enables clients to better tackle specific operational business challenges.Genpact Cora is also helping the company to provide related offerings to industries like consumer-packaged goods, industrial engineering, life sciences and high tech. Acquisitions of Rage Framework and design thinking based companies, like Tandem Seven have also expanded the company’s AI product portfolio.Per an IDC report, worldwide spending on cognitive systems and AI is estimated to touch $52.2 billion in 2021 at a CAGR of 46.2%. We believe that Genpact is well positioned to take advantage of the projected improvement in the AI space.Strong Clientele a BoonGenpact has a strong clientele across the world. The company serves almost one fifth of the Global Fortune 500, including Boeing, Citigroup, GlaxoSmithKline, Wells Fargo, Ironshore, Mondelez, PayPal and Abbott. We note that the Global Client base has improved rapidly over the last five years (2012-2017). Revenues from this group have increased at a healthy CAGR of 12% in this time frame to reach $2.47 billion in 2017.Moreover, Global Clients (as a percentage of total revenues) increased from approximately 75% in 2012 to approximately 90% in 2017. We believe that Genpact’s expertise in providing BPO services might continue to expand customer base in the long run.Bottom LineDespite riding on significant growth prospects, Genpact is not free from overhangs. High indebtedness resulting from frequent acquisitions and significant client concentration in terms of geographic location (North America) are threats. However, we believe that acquisitions, strong clientele and growth in AI space bode well for the company in long term.Genpacthas a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sectorinclude Automatic Data Processing (ADP  -  Free Report), Mastercard Inc.

Estimates for 2019 increased 2% to $4.50 per share.Positive Earnings Surprise History: Broadridge has an impressive earnings surprise history.

Moreover, earnings are expected to register 6.9% growth in 2019. The stock has long-term expected earnings per share growth rate of 10%.Growth FactorsStrong Business Model Broadridge has a strong business model wherein it earns significant recurring fee revenues, which include contributions from net new business, internal growth and acquisition-related synergies. Notably, revenues for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 came in at $4.143 billion, $2.897 billion and $2.694 billion, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of approximately 43%, 7.5% and 5.3%, respectively.Strategic BuyoutsBroadridge’s focus on enhancing its internal growth with strategic acquisitions is encouraging. On Mar 27, 2018, Broadridge completed the acquisition of ActivePath at an aggregate price of $25 million. The buyout should help Broadridge enhance consumer experience by transforming and improving its digital platform. In third-quarter fiscal 2018, the company declared that it has deployed almost $103 million for acquisitions year-to-date.In fiscal 2017, it acquired Summit Financial Disclosure, LLC., a full service financial document management solutions provider, and Message Automation Limited, a leading specialist provider of post-trade control solutions. The company’s 2016 acquisitions include DST Systems’ North American Customer Communications (NACC) business, 4sight Financial Software Limited and Inveshare.We remain encouraged by the company’s acquisition spree, which is helping Broadridge to expand its product portfolio and customer reach.Shareholder Friendly MovesWe are impressed with Broadridge’s consistent record of returning value to shareholders in the form of dividend and share repurchases. In fiscal 2017, Broadridge repurchased $342.8 million worth of its treasury stock and paid dividend amounting to $152.2 million. Continuing the same strategy, the company repurchased $3 million worth of its treasury stock and paid dividend of $80.4 million during first-half of fiscal 2018.In third-quarter fiscal 2018, the company returned $123 million to its shareholders in the form of dividends compared with $80.4 million in second-quarter fiscal 2018. These shareholder-friendly initiatives not only instill investors’ confidence but also positively impact earnings per share.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include TriNet Group, Inc. (TNET  -  Free Report), Automatic Data Processing (ADP  -  Free Report) and The Brink’s Company (BCO  -  Free Report). While Trinet sports a Zacks Rank #1, Automatic Data Processing and Brink’s Company carry a Zacks Rank #2.In the trailing four quarters, Trinet, Automatic Data Processing and Brink’s Company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 60.4%, 5.2% and 10.9%, respectively.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1653,ADP,"As we mull through the current trading week like a toothpick through molasses — with the Dow having traded down 4 straight sessions and 9 of 11, while both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are down in 2 of the last 3 regular trading days — we see some new key economic data. This is another feature of the current week: lots of econ grist for the mill, especially regarding jobs growth.Tomorrow, as we know, is the monthly government non-farm labor report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Yesterday we saw another solid jobs number for April from the private-sector ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) report, crossing the 200K-per-month new jobs trajectory yet again, which is extremely convincing of a peak labor market in the U.S. currently. Analysts currently expect 195K new jobs for last month overall, which would also keep this robust employment situation narrative in play.Furthering this narrative is today’s Initial Jobless Claims from last week, where we continually see new claims at low marks not realized since before Elvis wore a white jumpsuit. This morning’s 211K headline was up 2000 claims from the previous week, but well below the already-strong range of 225-250K claims we’d been seeing the past few years. These are extraordinary times for the domestic labor force. Continuing claims were up a bit: from 1.833 million to 1.833 million — still well below the psychologically pleasing 2 million continuing claims per week.Of course, tomorrow’s BLS number will fill a lot of these gaps we still have, from the Unemployment Rate (4.1% last time) to “real unemployment,” aka the U-6 (roughly 8%) to the all-important wage growth (2.7% year over year in last month’s read). And if market stagnation we’ve witnessed this week is about more than just fears of a trade war — check out Zacks Senior Strategist Kevin Cook’s excellent article from late yesterday here — then it might just be in tomorrow morning’s BLS report.We also see a new Productivity headline this morning, up 0.7% (lower than the 0.9% estimate, but higher than the previous read’s +0.3%). Unit Labor Costs reached 2.7% last month, down from the expected 3.0%. While productivity is extremely important to the overall health of economic growth, unit labor costs point toward metrics leading to future inflation, thus higher interest rates sooner. We don’t really have to worry about Fed rate policy, as the committee ended their latest conference yesterday without touching rates, but these numbers point down the road apiece.Finally, March trade balance came out with a headline of a deficit of $49 billion, slightly better than the -$50 billion expected and down from the prior read (upwardly revised) of -$57.7 billion. Obviously less trade debt is better, but this is another metric that awaits whether the other shoe will drop regarding trade war speculation. Until we see something concrete on this subject, expect economists to underweight this figure in the near term.

1654,ADP,"Wall Street suffered losses on Wednesday as all three major indexes closed in the red. Markets were up in the early hours of trading buoyed by the Fed’s decision to keep monetary policy unchanged. However, the broader-market lost momentum in the late hours on news of further escalation of the U.S.-China trade conflict. Strong earnings results of Apple Inc. also failed to uplift market sentiment as investors remain concerned about inflationary pressure in the U.S. economy.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) closed at 23,924.98, declining 0.7% or 174.07 points. The S&P 500 Index (INX) decreased 0.7% to close at 2,635.67. The Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 7,100.90, decreasing 0.4%. A total of 7.27 billion shares were traded on Wednesday, higher than the last 20-session average of 6.55 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1.06 -to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, advancers had an edge over decliners by 1.15 to -1 ratio. The CBOE VIX increased 3.1% and closed at 15.97.  How Did the Benchmarks Perform?The Dow decreased 0.7% with 24 of the 30-stocks in the index closing in the red while 6 traded in the green. Rising inflation and trade war fear pulled down the blue-chip index in the negative territory for the fourth consecutive days.The S&P 500 decreased 0.7% led by 2% decline of the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (XLP), 1.4% loss of the Healthcare Select Sector SPDR (XLV) and 1.1% decline of the Financials Select Sector SPDR (XLF). Notably, 9 out of 10 sectors of the benchmark index ended in negative territory.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite lost 0.4% as strong performance by Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) failed to cheer investors.Fed Maintains Current Monetary Policy At conclusion of its two-day policy meeting, the Federal Reserve kept the benchmark interest rate unchanged, in line with market expectations. The central bank did not given any hint whether it will raise interest rates very soon or will increase the number of rate hikes this year.However, the central bank did mention that the latest readings indicates both overall and core inflation have moved close to its 2% target rate and inflation is expected to remain at this level in the medium term.Market watchers believe that the Fed will most likely raise rate after its next meeting. Investors remain concerned that aggravation of inflation will force the central bank to adopt tighter monetary policy which may raise the cost of funds more than expected.Trade War Fear Escalates Markets witnessed panic selling in the late trading hours yesterday following news that President Trump is likely to issue an executive order restricting select Chinese telecommunications equipment makers from selling products in the United States.The trade conflict between United States and China has been shaking investor’s sentiment during last two months. The United States imposed $50 billion of tariffs on Chinese imports mainly on high-tech products which China retaliated by imposing $50 billion of tariffs on U.S. products primarily agricultural.The Trump administration is likely to release a list detailing further tariffs on China, to be worth $100 billion. Trump has also threatened to block Chinese technology investment in the United States.All these developments significantly hit investor’s sentiment. Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s will visit China this week to negotiate for trade related disputes. Market will closely watch this high level trade negotiation.Apple’s strong Performance Failed to Cheer-Up MarketsShares of Apple increased 4.4% after the company reported better-than-expected second quarter of fiscal 2018 earnings results. Net earnings of $2.73 per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $0.04 and increased almost 30% year over year. Net sales increased 15.6% year over year to $61.14 billion, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $60.99 billion.However, total iPhone unit sales of 52.2 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 52.9 million but increased 3% year over year. Meanwhile, the company’s long-term strategy appears to be to have a number of devices at different price points that are gradually moved to the next version, so the ASP continues to grow over time.

1656,ADP,"Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected third-quarter fiscal 2018 results.Adjusted earnings per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8 cents and increased 16% year over year. Revenues came in at $3.69 billion, outpacing the consensus mark by $26 million. The top-line figure improved 8% on a reported basis and 6% on a constant-currency basis.In the quarter, the company witnessed revenue growth across all its segments and significant improvements in key performance indicators like new business bookings and Employer Services retention.At the call, management sounded upbeat about the company’s business model and its strategy to drive sustainable long-term growth.We observe that shares of ADP have rallied 14.2% over the past year, significantly outperforming the S&P 500’s gain of 11%. Let’s delve deeper in to the numbers:Segments in DetailEmployer Services revenues of $2.80 billion increased 7% year over year on a reported basis and 4% on an organic constant-currency basis. The number of employees on ADP clients' payrolls in the United States rose 2.9% on a same-store-sales basis. Client revenues retention increased 170 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis.PEO Services revenues were up 10% year over year to $1.1 billion.

Acquisitions and impact from foreign currency translation are projected to add approximately two percentage points of growth to revenues instead one percentage point projected in the previous guidance.Adjusted EBIT margin is anticipated to be more or less flat compared to the prior anticipation of a decline of almost 50 bps.

1657,ADP,"We continue Jobs Week this morning with our monthly private-sector payroll reports from Automatic Data Processing (ADP  -  Free Report), and the results were typically excellent: a headline number of 204K new jobs were created by non-governmental firms in the month of April, higher than the estimated 190K. The Services sector led the way again with 160K new jobs, while Goods brought in a respectable 44K.Medium-sized companies (50-499 employees) made the most monthly hires in the private sector last month: 88K. Small businesses grew 62K while large firms brought up the rear with 54K. By industry, we were again led by Education/Healthcare with 39K, Leisure/Hospitality 36K and a strong showing by the long-dormant Construction industry, 27K. Even Manufacturing put up a strong 10K relative to this long-term employment growth path we’ve been on; before this, during the Obama years, Construction and Manufacturing, and the Goods-producing sector in general, routinely performed poorly.About the only ding on this morning’s new jobs figures was the down ward revision to March’s headline: -13K to 228K total new jobs. But even this is an overall positive — each month we bring more than 200K new jobs to the labor market, the lower our unemployment totals go, and, presumably, the higher wages will grow. This last aspect we’ve not seen as much evidence of, or at least wage growth has not meaningfully spiked in our current economy.Friday’s Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) non-farm payroll report (the government’s monthly read on jobs growth, which includes non-private employment) will be interesting to see in comparison to this morning’s numbers. These independent surveys often post discrepancies in their data in real time, but through revisions always follow a clearer trend line. Right now, the consensus is to see 195K new non-farm payroll jobs for April, with headline unemployment right around 4%.As we do start to see things like unemployment dip into the 3% range, and wage growth continuing or even accelerating (last read: +2.7% year over year), we turn our attention to the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which formulates interest rate policy. Currently within a range of 1.5-1.75% after a quarter-point hike during the FOMC’s March meeting, there is virtually no chance the committee raises again at the conclusion of its meeting today. But at the June meeting, a hike to 1.75-2.0 is right now a virtual certainty.What we will look at following today’s Fed meeting will be any changes to the language the committee uses, especially in regard to the amount of rate hikes the members are currently considering from now until the end of the year. When 2018 first began, the smart money was on 3 total rate hikes; we’ve already seen the first one, with presumably June and September on the way. But depending on how the economy is heating up, interest rates can go a long way toward absorbing rampant inflation.So far, the data we’ve seen that might lead the committee to consider a fourth rate hike this year isn’t really convincing. Yes, we’re in a robust labor market and a very long-term growth trajectory, but that’s not the same thing as requiring the Fed to step in and augment this growth in any unanticipated ways. Inflation may be creeping into the scenario, but this has been anticipated for a while — it’s nothing we’re not already prepared for.

"
1660,ADP,"Thursday, July 5, 2018Welcome back from your Independence Day holiday — we sincerely hope you’ve kept all your digits intact for another year. This morning, we jump right back into new jobs data: specifically the ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) private sector payroll report and Initial Jobless Claims.Situated prior to Friday’s government jobs survey, the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ (BLS) non-farm payroll report and Unemployment Rate, today’s ADP numbers keep the narrative of a robust U.S. labor market, even as the headline number came in short of expectations. A total of 177K private-sector jobs for the month of June was below the 185K consensus estimate, and the second-lowest tally year to date. That said, the upward revision to May’s numbers — +11K to 189K overall — more than made up the difference.The ration between Services and Goods also remained consistent, at roughly 80/20: 29K new goods-producing jobs last month contrast with the 148K non-goods (services). We will see further services-related data after the opening bell today, both with Markit PMI and ISM reads expected to continue demonstrating overall strength.Medium-sized companies (between 50 and 499 employees) brought in the lion’s share of new jobs for June with 80K; large firms grew by 69K and small companies created 29K new positions. By sector, we revert to the multi-year recovery mean a bit: Education/Health Services and Leisure/Hospitality reported the most new jobs at 46K and 33K, respectively, while Construction’s 13K and Manufacturing’s 12K were further down the list.The estimate for tomorrow’s non-farm payrolls headline is roughly 195K, which is still more or less double the rate of labor force growth in the U.S. Meaning as long as we’re bringing in more than 100K jobs per month, we continue to enjoy an historically strong domestic employment situation. And we haven’t seen that few jobs created since last summer’s massive hurricane season; that said, the last time we reached 200K was back in February. One of the conditions of long-term employment recovery is that it tightens noticeably the higher it goes.That’s certainly the position we continue to see ourselves in now. A headline Unemployment Rate of 3.8% from May is expected to stay roughly in-line, which is again historically low. Important metrics to look at tomorrow will be the U-6 (aka “real unemployment,” which is sub-8% — also extremely low) and Average Wage Growth. We’ve seen wages gradually gain traction in this tightened labor market, with a typical rise of late around 0.3% month over month. Should this begin to ratchet up higher sooner, it would be a key indicator of inflation for the U.S. economy.Also this Thursday, Initial Jobless Claims data has been released. This too has come in a tad worse than anticipated: 231K from the upwardly revised 228K the previous week. We had been experiencing almost unheard of jobless claims rates sinking toward 200K per week, but it’s possible those rates are not fully sustainable, and we may be buoyed back to the 225-250K range consistent with the jobs recovery going back several years. Continuing claims ticked up to 1.739 million last week from just under 1.71 million the previous week — still impressively robust from an historic perspective.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

1661,ADP,"One stock that might be an intriguing choice for investors right now is Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP  -  Free Report).

1663,ADP,"The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (IPG  -  Free Report) yesterday announced that it has inked a deal to purchase the Acxiom Marketing Solutions (AMS) business from Arkansas-based database marketing company — Acxiom Corporation (ACXM  -  Free Report). AMS is engaged in delivering data-related and analytical services.The deal has already received approval from the board of directors of both the companies. Subject to Acxiom shareholders’ approval and other customary regulatory approvals, the buyout is expected to close by the end of 2018.Deal Details and ExpectationsThe buyout will involve integration of AMS' expertise in data management with Interpublic’s media, creative, marketing services and analytics capabilities, global scale as well as consumer insights.The transaction is set at $2.3 billion in cash or $2.0 billion in net after considering an acquisition-related benefit from the tax step-up. The value of the deal is equivalent to 11.5 times of AMS’ expected 2018 EBITDA (inclusive of the tax step-up benefit).The acquisition is expected to be accretive to Interpublic’s adjusted earnings per share (EPS) in the year, after the deal closes. AMS will account for almost 8% of the combined entity`s revenues. Meanwhile, Acxiom expects to receive nearly $1.7 billion of net cash proceeds (assuming full payout of taxes and fees) from the sale. Acxiom plans to use the proceeds of the sale to invest in strategic growth opportunities, acquisitions, clearing off existing debt and rewarding shareholders through buybacks and cash tender initiation.On completion, Dennis Self and Rick Erwin will continue to serve as the co-presidents of AMS. The proposed deal does not include the takeover of LiveRamp business of Acxiom, which was acquired in 2014 for around $310 million.A glimpse at Interpublic’s price trend reveals that the stock has had an impressive run on the bourse on a year-to-date basis. The company’s shares have returned 14.2%, against the industry’s fall of 5.6%. IAN Segment Likely to Benefit Post deal closure, AMS will be aligned with IPG Mediabrands and operate as a stand-alone division.  Since IPG Mediabrands operates under Interpublic’s Integrated Agency Networks (IAN) segment, the deal is expected to boost the IAN segment. Revenues from the IAN segment contributed the largest chunk (around 84%) to Interpublic’s first-quarter 2018 net revenues. Revenues in this segment improved 6.5% year over year to $1.48 billion.Given strong demand for data-integrated and analytical services, we believe that Interpublic’s decision to acquire AMS is a prudent business move. Enhanced and innovative data-led offerings should strengthen the company’s market position and create more growth opportunities that will boost the top and the bottom line.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Interpublic is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

1665,ADP,"Shares of ICF International, Inc. (ICFI  -  Free Report) have gained 35.3% year to date, significantly outperforming the 5.3% rise of the industry it belongs to. Both government and commercial businesses remain in good shape, courtesy of improvement in business development pipeline and win rates.
"
1666,ADP,"Outsourcing is the business of transferring the control of certain operations, services or processes (which were previously done by the company’s internal staff and resources) to external resources or third-party contractors. A company may choose to outsource its operations for several reasons such as to reduce and control operating costs, increase focus on its core business competencies, thereby improving efficiency, strengthening its market share and getting access to better external resources. To avoid government rules and regulations, outsourcing is also adopted.Per a report by statista, the global outsourcing industry generated $88.9 billion in revenues in 2017. The outsourcing trends are expected to be more favorable going ahead in 2018 on a worldwide basis. The buoyancy in the outsourcing space is further confirmed by its Zacks Industry Rank in the top 37% (95 out of the 250 plus groups).Given this backdrop, it is not a bad idea to undertake a comparative analysis of two Outsourcing Services stocks — Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc. (BR  -  Free Report) and Paychex, Inc. (PAYX  -  Free Report). Both the stocks are part of the broader Business Services sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors). While Broadridge has a market capitalization of $13.57 billion, Paychex’s market cap is $24.56 billion.Zacks Rank & Style ScoreCurrently, both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.However, with a VGM Score of B, Broadridge enjoys an edge over Paychex in terms of investment attractiveness. Paychex has a VGM Score of D. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 offer the best investment opportunities for investors.Price PerformanceBroadridge clearly scores over Paychex in terms of price performance. Shares of Broadridge have gained 53% in a year’s time, outperforming the industry’s rally of 24.8%. Paychex, despite rallying 20.9% in the same time frame, underperformed both Broadridge and the industry it belongs to. Earnings ExpectationsEarnings growth along with stock price gains is often an indication of a company’s strong prospects.Paychex’s current-quarter earnings are projected to grow 11.3% compared with 9.9% for Broadridge.  For 2019, Paychex’s earnings are expected to register 10.9% growth compared with 6.9% for Broadridge.Thus, Paychex has an edge over Broadridge in terms of quarterly and yearly projected earnings growth.Earnings Surprise HistoryThe earnings surprise history of a stock helps investors have an idea of the stock’s performance in the previous quarters.Broadridge has performed better than Paychex, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the previous four quarters, delivering an average beat of 23.6%. Paychex delivered a positive surprise in two of the prior four quarters with an average beat of 1.2%.Net MarginNet profit margin helps investors evaluate a company’s business model in terms of pricing policy, cost structure and operating efficiency, and shows how good it is at converting revenues into profits. Hence, a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors.With a TTM net margin of 27.6%, Paychex not only compares favorably with the industry’s figure of 11.8% but also has a lead over Broadridge’s 9.4% TTM net margin. Broadridge does not compare favorably with the industry in terms of TTM net margin.ValuationThe Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E) metric is used to measure a company's value relative to its earnings. In general, a lower number or multiple is usually considered better than a higher one.The trailing 12-month price-to-earnings multiple for Broadridge and Paychex is 28.5 and 27.9, respectively, while that of the industry is 27.5. Although both the companies are overvalued relative to the industry, Paychex has an edge with a lower P/E ratio. Bottom LineOur comparative analysis shows that Broadridge scores over Paychex in terms of price performance and earnings surprise history. Paychex, however, has an edge in terms of expected earnings growth and net margin. Although both companies carry a Zacks Rank #2, Broadridge, with a better style score, has a higher probability of success in the near term. However, a faster share price rally in the past year has led to a relatively rich valuation for Broadridge compared to Paychex.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP  -  Free Report), The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation (DNB  -  Free Report) and FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. (FLT  -  Free Report). While Automatic Data Processing and Dun & Bradstreet sport a Zacks Rank #1, FLEETCOR carries a Zacks Rank #2.The long-term expected earnings per share (three to five years) growth rate for Automatic Data Processing, Dun & Bradstreet Corporation and FLEETCOR Technologies is 11.3%, 6% and 16.5%, respectively.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1667,ADP,"FactSet Research Systems Inc. (FDS  -  Free Report) looks strong on the back of higher growth in organic revenue, annual subscription value and increasing product portfolio. Growth across regions outside the United States is acting as another major tailwind for the company’s growth prospects.Notably, in third-quarter fiscal 2018, FactSet reported strong results with earnings and revenues surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Adjusted earnings per share of $2.18 beat the consensus mark by 4 cents and increased 17.8% year over year. Revenues of $339.9 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a slight margin and increased 8.9% year over year.Despite such impressive results, we observe that shares of FactSet have rallied 18.8% in the past year, underperforming the industry’s rise of 25.5%. Higher Annual Subscription ValueFactSet is witnessing growth in its Annual Subscription Value (ASV), driven by new client additions. The company added 80 new clients in third-quarter fiscal 2018, taking the total to 4,975. The company’s ASV increased 6.3% and reached $1.36 billion as of May 31, 2018. Organically, it increased $9 million during the quarter.Further, FactSet’s ASV reported robust growth on the basis of region. ASV generated $843.6 million revenues from the United States, up 4.4% from the prior-year quarter as well as organically. Internationally, ASV derived $512.6 million revenues, up 8.1% on a reported basis and 6.7% organically. While 13% growth was observed from the Asia-Pac region, Europe grew at a rate of 5%.The company's proprietary content revenues are expected to gain momentum in the quarters ahead, attributable to stronger demand driven by the company's competitive pricing strategy. We believe that its growing customer base, solid revenue growth, coupled with high client retention rate (90%) and a competitive pricing strategy, will positively impact results over the long term.Robust Organic GrowthFactSet continues to grow organically. In third-quarter fiscal 2018, organic revenues grew 5.7% to $332.5 million on the back of accelerated sales of content and technology solutions (CTS), analytics products and wealth management solutions. Region-wise,FactSet reported 5% organic growth from the United States and 6.9% internationally. The uptrend was due to higher sales from international price increase and analytics, data feed products along with a rise in workstation sales. FactSet’s ASV organic growth rate was 5.3% in the reported quarter.Expanding Global FootprintFactSet is strengthening its presence in the Asia Pacific region with the opening of a new office in Shanghai, China on May 31. With the opening, FactSet can now offer its data and analytic solutions to the growing number of investors and investment managers in China who seek better tools to aid them in their investment. FactSet has been working with the Chinese investment community since 1996.Additionally, the company’s ASV recorded 13% organic growth from the Asia-Pac region in third-quarter fiscal 2018. The region witnessed new client addition and higher sales to existing clients particularly in Singapore and Australia. Growth across both fixed income and equity products and Content & Technology Solutions (CTS) products boosted its analytical suite.We believe all these factors will perfectly complement the robust growth in the Asia-Pacific region. Despite contributing only 8% to total revenues, the Asia-Pacific region recorded marked improvement over the past two years. Revenues grew almost 40% from fiscal 2015 ($76.5 million) to fiscal 2017 ($106.7 million). The Asia Pacific segment operates offices in Australia, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Singapore and Shanghai.In third-quarter fiscal 2018, FactSet’s ASV recorded 5% organic growth from Europe. The company enjoyed major gains from the region in analytics, CTS and an increase in workstation sales. The UK and Nordic regions reported robust performance. Notably, FactSet generates around 25-27% of revenues from Europe. The European segment operates offices in Bulgaria, Dubai, England, France, Germany, Italy, Latvia, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.Strong Product Suite Across AnalyticsFactSet is highly optimistic about the integrated data-related products and services within its analytical suite, which it offers to the investment community. With the market adapting a quantitative approach to save time, reduce operating expenses and increase work efficiency, FactSet’s innovative analytical product suite should benefit.  To this end, FactSet’s recent launch of Open: FactSet Marketplace looks exciting. Open:FactSet Marketplace is a new online platform, which offers both core financial and alternative datasets to address the growing demand for integrated data. The company believes that this new platform will boost its CTS suite  next year.RisksDespite such tailwinds, FactSet continues to face stiff competition from other players providing financial market data, analytics and related services. These competitors may be able to expand their offerings and data content more effectively, price their products more aggressively or respond more rapidly to situations developing in the marketplace.Additionally, FactSet’s balance sheet is highly leveraged. As of May 31, 2018, long-term debt was $574.74 million compared with $574.70 million at the end of the prior quarter. The company exited third-quarter fiscal 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of $213.1 million compared with $233.6 million at the end of the prior quarter. Such a cash position implies that FactSet needs to generate adequate amount of operating cash flow to service its debt. Also, high debt may limit the company’s future expansion and worsen its risk profile.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderFactSet currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include Automatic Data Processing, Inc.

1668,ADP,"A prudent investment decision involves buying well-performing stocks at the right time while selling those that are at risk. A rise in share price and strong fundamentals signal a stock’s bullish run.Paychex, Inc. (PAYX  -  Free Report) has performed well in the past three months and has the potential to sustain the momentum in the near term.  Consequently, if you haven’t taken advantage of its share price appreciation yet, it’s time you add the stock to your portfolio.What Makes it an Attractive Pick? An Outperformer: A glimpse at the company’s price trend reveals that the outsourcing stock has had an impressive run on the bourse in the past three months. Shares of Paychex have returned 10.4%, which compares favorably with the Zacks S&P 500 Composite’s rise of 2.6%.  Solid Rank & VGM Score: Paychex currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a Value Growth Momentum Score (VGM Score) of B.

The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the previous four quarters, delivering an average positive earnings surprise of 1.2%.Strong Growth Prospects: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current quarter earnings is pegged at 71 cents, indicating year-over-year growth of 14.5%. Moreover, earnings are expected to register 8.6% and 8.1% growth, respectively, in 2019 and 2020. The stock has long-term expected earnings per share growth rate of 8.2%.Growth Factors: Increasing demand for outsourcing services offers ample opportunities to Paychex. The company’s efforts to capitalize on these opportunities by periodically introducing products and services for its clients and by moving into the mid-market arena have paid off. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2018,HRS segment revenues climbed 17% year over year to $401 million, mainly owing to a rise in human capital management (HCM) services clients. The HCM services include comprehensive HR outsourcing services, comprising HROI, time and attendance, retirement services and insurance services. In fiscal 2018, segment revenues rose 14% year over year to $1.5 billion. According to Paychex, in fiscal 2019, HRS revenues growth is anticipated in the range of 10–11%.Paychex’s efforts to capitalize on the rising opportunities in the professional employer organization (PEO) industry are appreciable. To this end, Paychex completed the acquisitions of HR Outsourcing Holdings, Inc., a national professional employer organization.Buyout of Lessor Group is expected to contribute significantly to FactSet’s payroll services. Notably, in the fiscal fourth quarter, Lessor contributed approximately 1% to total payroll service revenue growth.  Payroll service revenues increased 3% year over year to $452.4 million in fiscal fourth quarter and 2% to $1.8 billion in fiscal year 2018. As of May 31, 2018 (inclusive of the Lessor acquisition) Paychex had more than 650,000 payroll clients across more than 100 locations in the United States and Europe.Paychex’s strong cash position reflects management’s efficient execution in recent times. At the end of fiscal fourth quarter 2018, Paychex had cash, cash equivalents and corporate investments of $424.2 million compared with $421.2 million at the end of the prior quarter. The company has no long-term debt.  With no long-term debt to clear off, the significant amount of cash provides Paychex the flexibility to pursue any growth strategy in the form of strategic acquisitions and other related investments.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include Automatic Data Processing, Inc.

1672,ADP,"FactSet Research Systems Inc. (FDS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jun 26, before the market opens.Its top line is expected to benefit from higher organic revenues, acquisitions and dispositions. The new tax reform policy is likely to positively impact the bottom line.We observe that shares of FactSet have rallied 28.7% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s rise of 27.3%.                                              One-year Price Performance Top Line to Improve Year Over YearThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the fiscal third quarter stands at $339.71 million, indicating year-over-year growth of 8.8%. The top line is expected to grow on the back of higher organic revenues, buyouts and dispositions. Growth in FactSet’s annual subscription value (ASV), driven by new client additions, is likely to act as another growth catalyst.FactSet Research Systems Inc. Revenue (TTM)  FactSet Research Systems Inc. Revenue (TTM) | FactSet Research Systems Inc. QuoteIn second-quarter fiscal 2018, total revenues rose 13.9% from the year-ago quarter to $335.23 million. Organic revenues increased 5.7% year over year to $310.38 million. The company’s ASV increased 13.4% to $1.35 billion as of Feb 28, 2018. New client additions in the fiscal second quarter were 86, taking the total to 4,895.Earnings Likely to Grow on Tax Reform PolicyThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduced corporate tax rates significantly from 35% to 21%, will benefit FactSet’s earnings in the to-be-reported quarter. Notably, the consensus estimate for earnings per share (EPS) is pegged at $2.14, indicating year-over-year growth of 15.7%.In the fiscal second quarter, adjusted earnings rose 17.1% from the year-ago quarter to $2.12 per share.

1677,ADP,"We often lose sight of these things once we’re in the thick of earnings season, like we are now, but this happens to be Jobs Week. With the Automatic Data Processing (ADP  -  Free Report) private-sector report coming out for the month of April tomorrow, and the all-important Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) non-farm payroll report on Friday. But on CNBC’s Squawk Box this morning, Martin Mucci of Paychex, Inc. (PAYX  -  Free Report) reported small-business jobs and wage growth for last month, and the results are definitely interesting.Year over year, small business job growth is down 1%, and wage growth is at 2.7% — lower than the 2.9% we saw last summer. This would indicate that those massive corporate tax cuts we saw at the end of 2017 have yet to hit small businesses, or it might be an indication that we might not expect our overall jobs numbers to be notably affected by those tax cuts, after all.Arizona showed the best annual hourly earnings growth, and Denver was once again the top city for overall jobs growth. Phoenix topped in small business wages increasing, and Tennessee was the state that saw the largest gains in small business employment overall. Manufacturing was up in the month for small businesses, while Leisure/Hospitality came out on top in hourly earnings growth. Overall, for the month, wage growth for small businesses was up marginally.As far as Q1 earnings season goes, after the bell today we expect results from Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Snap (SNAP  -  Free Report), among many others. This morning we see plenty of results as well, but we’ve only got time to post a couple:Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) reported a 3-cent beat on its bottom line to 77 cents per share, whereas revenues of $12.9 billion missed the $13.1 billion anticipated. The company restated earlier guidance, which was in accordance with Zacks consensus numbers. For more on PFE’s earnings, click here.To keep within the same industry — as well as another Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated stock ahead of earnings results — Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) also topped earnings estimates, $1.05 per share versus 99 cents, but missed marginally on its top-line: $10.04 billion vs. $10.12 billion our analysts were looking for. It also reported in-line guidance with the current Zacks consensus estimates. For more on MRK’s earnings, click here.

1678,ADP,"Investors interested in stocks from the Outsourcing sector have probably already heard of TTEC Holdings (TTEC  -  Free Report) and Automatic Data Processing (ADP  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Both TTEC Holdings and Automatic Data Processing have a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that these stocks have improving earnings outlooks. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.TTEC currently has a forward P/E ratio of 18.60, while ADP has a forward P/E of 32.27. We also note that TTEC has a PEG ratio of 2.33. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. ADP currently has a PEG ratio of 2.85.Another notable valuation metric for TTEC is its P/B ratio of 4.87. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, ADP has a P/B of 15.38.Based on these metrics and many more, TTEC holds a Value grade of A, while ADP has a Value grade of D.Both TTEC and ADP are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that TTEC is the superior value option right now.

Notably, the company has witnessed a 14.1% rise in share price since it posted strong third-quarter fiscal 2018 results.Let’s find out what’s supporting the rally.Transformation Initiatives ADP boasts a strong business model, high recurring revenues, good margins, robust client retention and low capital expenditure.

The company continues to pursue acquisitions that strategically fit its overall business mix and are easy to integrate over the long term.Increasing Scale and Reach of DistributionADP’s wide scale and reach of distribution provides it with a competitive advantage. The company’s HCM sales are improving every year with clients in 113 countries worldwide. Also, ADP is increasing its inside sales organization to capitalize on digital sales.

Currently, the company is driving bookings growth through headcount, productivity and innovation.Strong Balance SheetADP’s strong balance sheet makes the stock attractive for investment in our view. The company had cash and cash equivalents of $2.3 billion as of Mar 31, 2018. ADP continues to use excess cash to aggressively buy back shares and pay out dividends. Continuing with its strategy of returning cash to shareholders, the company paid dividend of $995 million and repurchased stocks worth $1.26 billion during fiscal 2017.We believe that the strong balance sheet will not only help the company to continue shareholder friendly activities but also pursue strategic acquisitions and investments on product development in the long run. The dividend hike announced by the company in April 2018 highlights ADP's commitment to create value for shareholders and underscores the company’s strong financial position. It also indicates the company’s bright prospects.Increased and Extended Financial OutlookADP raised fiscal 2018 guidance for adjusted earnings and adjusted EBIT margin. Adjusted EBIT margin is anticipated to be more or less flat compared to a decline of almost 50 bps (basis points) projected earlier.

However, the company reiterated the outlook for revenue growth in the band of 7-8%.Additionally, ADP announced extension of its fiscal 2021 outlook on its Investor Day.

1680,ADP,"Outsourcing is the practice of handling over the control of certain operations, services or processes (which were previously done by the company’s internal staff and resources) to external resources or third-party contractors. A company may choose to outsource its operations for several reasons such as to reduce and control operating costs, increase focus on its core business competencies, thereby improving efficiency, strengthening its market share and getting access to better external resources. To avoid government rules and regulations, outsourcing is also adopted.Per a report by statista, the global outsourcing industry generated $88.9 billion in revenues in 2017. The outsourcing trends are expected to be more favorable going ahead in 2018 on a worldwide basis.Despite multiple tailwinds, outsourcing services have certain disadvantages. Companies need to constantly negotiate terms with their third-party contractors to enjoy easy services. At times, third-party vendors need to access the company’s internal data for proper functioning and this is where the security factor comes in. Given this backdrop, it is not a bad idea to undertake a comparative analysis of two Outsourcing Services stock — Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc. (BR  -  Free Report) and Automatic Data Processing Inc. (ADP  -  Free Report). Both the stocks are part of the broader Business Services sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors). While Broadridge has a market capitalization of $13.71 billion, Automatic Data Processing’s market cap is $61.36 billion.Zacks Rank & Style ScoreCurrently, both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.However, with an VGM Score of B, Broadridge enjoys an edge over ADP in terms investment attractiveness. ADP has a VGM Score of C. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 offer the best investment opportunities for investors. Thus, the company appears to be a compelling investment proposition at the moment.Price PerformanceBroadridge clearly scores over ADP, considering its price performance in a year’s time. Shares of Broadridge have gained 54.6%, outperforming the S&P 500’s and industry’s rally of 13.7% and 25.2%, respectively. ADP has gained 37.6%, underperforming both the S&P 500 Composite and the industry. Earnings ExpectationsEarnings growth along with stock price gains is often an indication of a company’s strong prospects.ADP’s current-quarter earnings are projected to grow 38.5% compared with 9.9% for Broadridge.  However, for full-year 2018, the situation is just the opposite with ADP’s expected earnings growth rate of 16.8% being lower than Broadridge’s growth rate of 34.5%.For 2019, ADP’s earnings are expected to register 12% growth compared with 6.9% for Broadridge. Moreover, the long-term expected earnings per share growth rate of 11.3% for ADP is higher than Broadridge’s growth rate of 10%.While Broadridge’s earnings are expected to grow higher than ADP in 2018, the situation is expected to reverse in 2019 and the long term.Earnings Estimate Revisions The direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock. Based on the earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and full-year 2018 and 2019, in the last 60 days, ADP appears to be more favorably placed.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current quarter earnings improved 9.8% for ADP against a decrease of 2.1% for Broadridge.For 2018, the consensus estimate improved 4.3% for ADP and 4.2% for Broadridge. Estimates for 2019 moved up 3.4% for ADP and 2% for Broadridge.Earnings Surprise HistoryThe earnings surprise history of a stock helps investors have an idea of the stock’s performance in the previous quarters.Broadridge and ADP have an impressive earning surprise history, with their earnings surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the previous four quarters.However, Broadridge enjoys an edge over ADP as it delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 23.6% as against 5.2% for the latter.Net MarginNet profit margin helps investors evaluate a company’s business model in terms of pricing policy, cost structure and operating efficiency, and shows how good it is at converting revenues into profits. Hence, a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors.With a TTM net margin of 13.6%, ADP not only compares favorably with the industry’s figure of 11.8% but also has a lead over Broadridge’s 9.4% TTM net margin. Broadridge does not compare favorably with the industry in terms of TTM net margin.ValuationThe Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E) metric is used to measure a company's value relative to its earnings. In general, a lower number or multiple is usually considered better than a higher one.The trailing 12-month price-to-earnings multiple for Broadridge and ADP is 28.8 and 34.2, respectively, while that of the industry is 28.3. Although both the companies are overvalued relative to the industry, Broadridge has an edge with a lower P/E ratio. The EV/EBITDA metric is used to compare two stocks within the same industry and offers a clearer picture of a company’s valuation because it includes debt. The ratio is often used in addition to the P/E ratio.We observe that while Broadridge and ADP have EV/EBITDA ratios of 16.3 and 21.0, respectively, the industry’s figure stands at 13.6. Although both the companies compare unfavorably with the industry, Broadridge is better positioned with a lower EV/EBITDA value. Though both the stocks look overvalued relative to the industry, Broadridge is undervalued compared to ADP.ROE and ROCReturn on Equity (ROE) is the measure of a company’s efficiency in utilizing shareholders’ funds. The trailing 12-month ROE for Broadridge and ADP is 45.3% and 45.7%, respectively, while that of the industry is 34.7%. Although both the companies clearly score above the industry, ADP is a better choice than Broadridge with a higher ROE. Return on Capital (ROC) for Broadridge and ADP is 21.3% and 30.4%, respectively, while the industry’s ROC stands at 22.9%. This implies that ADP generates a higher return on investment than its industry.Bottom LineOur comparative analysis shows that Broadridge is superior than ADP when considering price performance, valuation and earnings history. ADP scores over Broadridge in terms of net margin, long-term expected earnings growth, earnings estimate revisions, return on capital and equity.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include Mastercard Incorporated (MA  -  Free Report), FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. (FLT  -  Free Report) and WEX Inc. (WEX  -  Free Report). While Mastercard sports a Zacks Rank #1, FLEETCOR Technologies and WEX carry a Zacks Rank #2.The long-term expected earnings per share growth rate for Mastercard, FLEETCOR Technologies and WEX is 19%, 16.5% and 14.3%, respectively.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1681,ADP,"Tuesday, May 1, 2018We often lose sight of these things once we’re in the thick of earnings season, like we are now, but this happens to be Jobs Week. With the Automatic Data Processing (ADP  -  Free Report) private-sector report coming out for the month of April tomorrow, and the all-important Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) non-farm payroll report on Friday. But on CNBC’s Squawk Box this morning, Martin Mucci of Paychex, Inc. (PAYX  -  Free Report) reported small-business jobs and wage growth for last month, and the results are definitely interesting.Year over year, small business job growth is down 1%, and wage growth is at 2.7% — lower than the 2.9% we saw last summer. This would indicate that those massive corporate tax cuts we saw at the end of 2017 have yet to hit small businesses, or it might be an indication that we might not expect our overall jobs numbers to be notably affected by those tax cuts, after all.Arizona showed the best annual hourly earnings growth, and Denver was once again the top city for overall jobs growth. Phoenix topped in small business wages increasing, and Tennessee was the state that saw the largest gains in small business employment overall. Manufacturing was up in the month for small businesses, while Leisure/Hospitality came out on top in hourly earnings growth. Overall, for the month, wage growth for small businesses was up marginally.As far as Q1 earnings season goes, after the bell today we expect results from Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Snap (SNAP  -  Free Report), among many others. This morning we see plenty of results as well, but we’ve only got time to post a couple:Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) reported a 3-cent beat on its bottom line to 77 cents per share, whereas revenues of $12.9 billion missed the $13.1 billion anticipated. The company restated earlier guidance, which was in accordance with Zacks consensus numbers. For more on PFE’s earnings, click here.To keep within the same industry — as well as another Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated stock ahead of earnings results — Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) also topped earnings estimates, $1.05 per share versus 99 cents, but missed marginally on its top-line: $10.04 billion vs. $10.12 billion our analysts were looking for. It also reported in-line guidance with the current Zacks consensus estimates.

1682,ADP,"As during most Thursday mornings, Initial Jobless Claims from the previous week were again reported, sandwiched this week between yesterday’s excellent ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) private-sector payroll results of 235K new jobs and tomorrow’s all-encompassing non-farm payroll report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Today, Initial Claims reported reached 231K last week — 21,000 more claims than the previous week’s figure.Keep in mind, last week’s 210K claims was the lowest we’d seen since the Vietnam War was still in full force, and the U.S. economy scarcely resembled what it does today. Today’s 231K remains of the robust labor market narrative, in that it rests comfortably within the historically low 225-250K range we’ve seen for most of the past several years. Continuing Claims fell to 1.87 million on the week from 1.93 million the previous week, also parallel with positive employment news overall.Tomorrow’s BLS report is expected to have fetched roughly 200K new jobs in the month of February, a strikingly high number in such a tight jobs market. We may even see the first 3-handle on the Unemployment Rate in ages, depending on how many more chronically unemployed have finally begun to look for work. And wage growth figures will be closely analyzed, as they are a forward indicator of future inflation pressures on the economy.Yesterday afternoon, the Fed’s Beige Book was released, confirming much of what economists had long been expecting: employers are raising wages and expanding benefits for their workforces (at least in a “few” districts) as the labor market tightens. The descriptor for wage and price growth, however, remains “moderate” at this time. The report also saw a “marked increase” in the cost of steel in 4 districts as President Trump’s decision last week to slap tariffs of 25% on imported steel move closer to reality.European Central Bank (ECB) President Mario Draghi, in perhaps a muted response to U.S. steel tariffs, said he considers rising protectionism around the globe a risk to the Eurozone market. He may have also been referring to his home country’s general election, where the Italian parliament looks to be split in half by populists on both the Left and Right, which may lead Italy’s government to consider adopting protectionist measures going forward, as well. The ECB is also dropping its easing bias as the Eurozone economy improves, with inflation seen as rising toward an optimum 2%.Pre-market futures look to open in the green today: the Dow +29 points, Nasdaq +32 and S&P 500 +6. The 10-year Treasury bond looks to have plateaued, near term, in the high 2.8s — marking a steadiness to the bond market. Of course, a blowout Employment Report tomorrow morning may set all sorts of things into motion; we expect less relative volatility today ahead of tomorrow’s report.

1684,ADP,"Market futures are pointing lower ahead of today’s opening bell, and the release of new private-sector payroll data from Automatic Data Processing (ADP  -  Free Report) — which was again far above expectations — has done very little to quash this. Currently, the Dow looks to open more than 200 points lower, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq in the red, as well.ADP’s monthly payroll report says the private sector brought 235K new jobs to the U.S. in February, similar to the 234K initially reported in January — which has been revised upward to 244K. Considering that expectations for both months were in the 180-200K range, we continue to see outstanding jobs growth in the domestic labor force. It also marks 5 straight months with private-sector jobs tallying more than 200K.Services typically led the way with 198K new jobs, but Goods brought 37K as well. Construction made up 21K of those and Manufacturing another 14K — well above trends of the past few years.In fact, the Goods side of jobs growth often roughly equates the monthly positive surprises we’ve seen for the past half-year or more. Leisure and Hospitality led the way with 50K new private-sector jobs, Trade and Transportation reached 44K and Education and Healthcare brought 43K. Medium-sized businesses (between 50 and 499 employees) saw the biggest gains with 97K jobs.The ADP report is the precursor to Friday’s non-farm payroll report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which had also previously been guiding to around 180K monthly job growth. For February, however, we see the consensus up to 205K — over time (sometimes not initially), the ADP and BLS numbers do tend to demonstrate the same growth trends, even as the BLS also accounts for Government jobs, including on the state and local levels.What we may expect to see in Friday’s report is an Unemployment Rate that has fallen to 4.0% or perhaps even lower. Surely with such robust labor market growth — unprecedented in some respects, regarding the modern U.S. economy — we can expect to see evidence of the same turning up in the BLS figures. Importantly, this may also include meaningful wage growth — something market analysts as well as members of the Fed will be paying close attention to.Wage growth, both month over month and year over year, is a common forward indicator of rising economic inflation. And with a tight labor market getting even tighter, with wage growth having headed north around 30 basis points a month in recent times, this may lead the way toward more aggressive Fed policy in raising interest rates. Add onto this a massive influx of business capital by way of corporate tax cuts, and it’s easy to see why so many market participants have inflation on their minds currently.And this may also be the reason why such healthy private-sector labor market numbers have thus far failed to move the needle on market futures thus far ahead of Wednesday’s open.
"
1685,ADP,"Wednesday, April 4, 2018Concerns regarding U.S. trade with China, and the progressing development of what this scenario looks like, is sending market futures plummeting again ahead of the opening bell. Following President Trump’s latest announcement of tariffs hitting goods coming into the U.S. from China, the Red Dragon has retaliated with tariffs being slapped on more than 100 domestic goods being shipped to China.Currently, the Dow looks to open down 550 points, the Nasdaq -122 and the S&P 500, which hasn’t seen back-to-back gains in weeks, is -40 points. We see from this how trade with China does imply some contagion across industries — while the U.S. is targeting $50 billion in Chinese durables (think dishwashers, copiers, flat-screen TVs, etc.) with a 25% tariff and China is focused mostly on American commodities (soybeans, wheat, cotton, tobacco, etc.) — there is also the entire realm of semiconductors and other technology hardware more closely related to the Nasdaq’s domain.For U.S. autos, this specter is even more severe: there was already a 25% Chinese tariff on autos built in the U.S. — not just American car companies like Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report) either, but European plants in the U.S. South would also be affected — so this new measure would mean a full 50% tax levied on these autos being shipped to China. More than a quarter-million U.S. autos, worth nearly $10 billion, were sold in China last year. We see the results of this new measure in Tesla shares this morning, as well: TSLA is down another 5% this morning, -16.5% year over year.ADP Private Sector Payrolls Up Big AgainAll this aside, it doesn’t take much to find some very good news in today’s pre-market: 241K new private-sector jobs were created in March, according to payroll giant Automatic Data Processing (ADP  -  Free Report). February revisions cranked up 11K to 246K overall. Very strong Goods-producing jobs (65K) in mostly medium-sized companies (127K) pushed these levels up toward historic highs yet again. Construction brought 31K new jobs last month, Manufacturing saw 29K with Trade/Transportation topping the list at 40K.Predictions for Friday’s non-farm payroll totals from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) are for roughly 180K new jobs for March, although recently these estimates have been well short of the robust actuals we’ve seen; the ADP number in recent months has done a better near-term job of capturing the rapid employment growth in the U.S. The Unemployment Rate looks to stay the same at 4.1% or dip further.Of course, none of these numbers include any sort of headwinds from a trade war with China. Then again, these tariff numbers are still all just talk, and until agreements are reached on paper between the two economic giants, this is all they will remain. But the market is clearly pricing in the risk of a nasty fight between President Trump’s people and Xi Jinping’s.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

1686,ADP,"This week started with a big sell-off Monday, including a 3% drop in the Dow midday. From there we saw some value buying, but it’s clear volatility remains with us in the present-day markets. We would be hard pressed to blame anywhere but the U.S. indexes, as Europe took Monday off in observation of the Easter holiday. Overnight, Japan’s Nikkei index fell 0.5%, likely in response to yesterday’s red numbers here at home.Pre-market futures are up at this hour after closing below the 200-day moving average yesterday, erasing the Nasdaq’s gains for the whole of 2018 thus far. In fact, early trading looks to dig out of “correction territory” today, with the Dow +121, Nasdaq +71 and S&P 500 +20. Whether we can hold these numbers is contingent on a wide spectrum of news items we’ve yet to see. At this point, many analysts are expecting merely a “dead cat bounce,” meaning a period of buying back even thought the trading cycle remains bearish, at least near-term.This is also the week we get to look at new jobs numbers, with the ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) private-sector report coming out ahead of the bell tomorrow and the big Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) non-farm payroll numbers hitting the tape Friday morning. For February, we could not have possibly seen a more “Goldilocks” scenario: 300K+ new jobs with only moderate wage increases, meaning the labor market continues to tighten without a noteworthy spike in wages, which would be a big contributor to overall economic inflation.On CNBC’s Squawk Box this morning, Paychex (PAYX  -  Free Report) CEO Martin Mucci reported small businesses experienced a pullback in jobs for the month of March. Mucci pointed toward the tight labor market itself as the reason small businesses have had difficulty finding enough skilled workers to fill the jobs available, at least for firms with fewer than 50 employees. Phoenix remained the top city for wage growth, and Tennessee won the top state for small business growth overall. We shall see if this reported pullback makes it into the date we expect later this week.Tesla’s Other Shoe DropsAs expected, Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report) reported its production and deliveries for last month, posting 8180 new Teslas delivered in March. For the past week, 2020 new Teslas were produced — beneath the original guidance of 2500 per week, but better than many of the Tesla bears had been anticipating. Shares of the electric car leader are up nearly 3% in today’s pre-market, after tumbling in excess of 5% Monday.

The company is currently concentrating on strengthening its business while expanding client base globally. The company maintains a balanced growth model through a combination of well-focused internal development initiatives and strategic acquisitions. We expect the company to witness higher revenues in the future on the back of its focused growth initiatives.The stock has outperformed the industry in the last three months with an average loss of 0.2% compared with a decline of 5.5% for the latter.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderOmnicom carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1689,ADP,"Paychex Inc. (PAYX  -  Free Report) reported solid results for third-quarter fiscal 2018, wherein the top and the bottom lines came ahead of the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. Moreover, the company registered year-over year improvement on both counts.The company reported non-GAAP earnings per share of 63 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny and grew 15% year over year. The upside mainly stemmed from higher revenues, partially offset by increased expenses.Quarter DetailsPaychex reported total revenues (including interest on funds held for clients) of $866.5 million, up 9% year over year. Excluding interest on funds held for its clients, total services revenues (Payroll service and Human Resource Services) increased 8% year over year to $848.4 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $588 million.Payroll Service segment revenues went up 2% from the year-ago period to $455 million, primarily on the back of higher revenues per check.Human Resource Services segment revenues rose 17% year over year to $393.4 million, chiefly driven by strong growth in client base and worksite employees, elevated revenues from retirement, as well as online HR administration services.Interest on funds held for clients increased 37% on a year-over-year basis to $18.1 million, mainly benefiting from higher average interest rates earned.Paychex’s total expenses flared up 17% from the year-ago quarter to $574 million due to increased compensation, one-time bonus to non-management employees and a one-time expense related to termination of certain license agreements. Total expenses, as a percentage of total revenues, increased 470 basis points (bps) to 66.2%.The company’s operating income declined 5% year over year to $292.5 million. In addition, Paychex’s operating margin contracted 470 bps to 33.8%, chiefly due to higher total expenses as a percentage of revenues.Net income came in at $260.4 million, up from $202.5 million reported in the prior-year quarter.Paychex, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Paychex, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Paychex, Inc.

We also believe the company’s expansion initiatives, such as joint ventures and acquisitions, will likely support its long-term growth strategy.Product launches are likely to be the other growth drivers. Also, Paychex’s focus on small- and mid-sized businesses looking for HR solutions could provide growth opportunities.However, the company is facing issues in retaining its customer base for the last few quarters, which is a major concern. For the third quarter, the company did not mention anything about client growth for its payroll services.Furthermore, increasing competition from industry peers like Automatic Data Processing (ADP  -  Free Report), Insperity (NSP  -  Free Report), Intuit (INTU  -  Free Report), H&R Block, Broadridge Financial Solutions and DST System is another key concern.Currently, Paychex has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1690,ADP,"Paychex Inc. (PAYX  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Mar 26. The question lingering on investors’ minds is whether or not this provider of payroll and integrated human resource and employee benefits outsourcing solutions will be able to deliver a positive surprise.Notably, the company has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 1.77%.What the Zacks Model SaysOur proven model shows that Paychex is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because the stock fulfils the Zacks criteria of a positive Earnings ESP, and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Paychex has an Earnings ESP of +0.20% and a Zacks Rank of #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings is pegged at 61 cents, representing year-over-year growth of 10.9%. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $854.8 million, up 7.4% from the year-ago quarter.Paychex, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Paychex, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Paychex, Inc. QuoteLet’s now discuss the influencing factors in detail.Factors to ConsiderStrong domain expertise in human capital-management solutions for payroll, HR, retirement, and insurance services are expected to increase the company’s clientele and drive revenues.The company’s product launches and joint-venture initiatives are additional positives. Its investments toward building the sales team, which eventually assists in client addition and revenue generation, is a major tailwind.Notably, during the soon-to-be-reported quarter, the company’s solutions were adopted by the International Franchise Association (IFA) for providing payroll services for IFA membership.We also believe Paychex’s inorganic growth strategies are also proving conducive to its growth. With 14 acquisitions since its inception, the company has significantly improved its solutions suite and total addressable market (TAM). These have also acted as revenue boosters.However, a declining client retention rate is affecting the company’s financials. Additionally, heightening competition from industry peers like Automatic Data Processing (ADP  -  Free Report), Insperity, Intuit (INTU  -  Free Report), H&R Block, Broadridge Financial Solutions (BR  -  Free Report) and DST System is another key concern.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

1691,ADP,"Intuit Inc. (INTU  -  Free Report) recently unveiled QuickBooks Accountant Apps Program for better management of applications by accounting professionals on behalf of their clients.The applications selected for the program are the ones that have been hugely recommended by people related to the accounting domain. Further, these are in sync with QuickBooks Online and per the press release, “support single sign on via QuickBooks Online Accountant”.The company plans to roll out the new program this month and willing to make it available for users across the United States, UK, Canada and Australia pretty soon.Per, Rich Preece, head of the company’s Accountant Segment, Small Business and Self Employed Group, the addition of this program will be extremely beneficial to the professionals related to the accounting field. This will equip the professionals to provide effective recommendations for the selection and implementation of the applications required by their clients.The accounting professionals will have the option of using preferred pricing for the applications which have been selected for the program. Per the press release, “they can also receive one consolidated, itemized bill each month for all the apps they provision through the program.”According to the company, the applications that will be available initially are “Circulus, Expensify, Float, Method: CRM, Excel Transaction Importer, ServiceM8, SOS Inventory and Tsheets by QuickBooks.” Additional applications are expected to be incorporated going ahead.Intuit Gaining on QuickBook Online’s PopularityIn the last reported second-quarter fiscal 2018 results, this tax-preparation related software maker delivered revenues of $1165 million, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1156 million and portraying a 15% year-over-year gain.Intuit Inc. Revenue (TTM) Intuit Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Intuit Inc. QuoteThe company’s Small Business and Self-Employed Group witnessed 19% year-over-year growth. This was primarily driven by 51% subscriber growth rate for Quickbooks Online, which brought the count to 2.8 million at the end of the quarter. Hence, we believe Intuit is winning largely on the accelerated adoption of QuickBooks Online.Additionally, the shift in its business model from selling software to cloud-based subscription providing via QuickBooks is a major tailwind in the long term. Per a recent report by Gartner, the cloud based application services (Saas) is expected to generate around $99.7 billion of revenues by 2020 from $58.6 billion in 2017.With its SaaS-based QuickBooks and Online Tax applications, Intuit is well-positioned to make the most of the growth opportunity in the SaaS market.Zacks Rank and Other Stocks to ConsiderIntuit carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other top-ranked stocks worth considering the broader technology sector are Paycom Software, Inc.

1692,ADP,"Wednesday, March 7, 2018Market futures are pointing lower ahead of today’s opening bell, and the release of new private-sector payroll data from Automatic Data Processing (ADP  -  Free Report) — which was again far above expectations — has done very little to quash this. Currently, the Dow looks to open more than 200 points lower, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq in the red, as well.ADP’s monthly payroll report says the private sector brought 235K new jobs to the U.S. in February, similar to the 234K initially reported in January — which has been revised upward to 244K. Considering that expectations for both months were in the 180-200K range, we continue to see outstanding jobs growth in the domestic labor force. It also marks 5 straight months with private-sector jobs tallying more than 200K.Services typically led the way with 198K new jobs, but Goods brought 37K as well. Construction made up 21K of those and Manufacturing another 14K — well above trends of the past few years. In fact, the Goods side of jobs growth often roughly equates the monthly positive surprises we’ve seen for the past half-year or more. Leisure and Hospitality led the way with 50K new private-sector jobs, Trade and Transportation reached 44K and Education and Healthcare brought 43K. Medium-sized businesses (between 50 and 499 employees) saw the biggest gains with 97K jobs.The ADP report is the precursor to Friday’s non-farm payroll report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which had also previously been guiding to around 180K monthly job growth. For February, however, we see the consensus up to 205K — over time (sometimes not initially), the ADP and BLS numbers do tend to demonstrate the same growth trends, even as the BLS also accounts for Government jobs, including on the state and local levels.What we may expect to see in Friday’s report is an Unemployment Rate that has fallen to 4.0% or perhaps even lower. Surely with such robust labor market growth — unprecedented in some respects, regarding the modern U.S. economy — we can expect to see evidence of the same turning up in the BLS figures. Importantly, this may also include meaningful wage growth — something market analysts as well as members of the Fed will be paying close attention to.Wage growth, both month over month and year over year, is a common forward indicator of rising economic inflation. And with a tight labor market getting even tighter, with wage growth having headed north around 30 basis points a month in recent times, this may lead the way toward more aggressive Fed policy in raising interest rates. Add onto this a massive influx of business capital by way of corporate tax cuts, and it’s easy to see why so many market participants have inflation on their minds currently.And this may also be the reason why such healthy private-sector labor market numbers have thus far failed to move the needle on market futures thus far ahead of Wednesday’s open.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

The company reported non-GAAP income (excluding stock-based compensation, amortization and other one-time items) from continuing operations of 35 cents per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 34 cents.Quarter in DetailThis tax-preparation related software maker reported revenues of $1165 million, which was within the guided range of $1160-$1180 million but outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1156 million.On a year-over-year basis, revenues were up around 15% primarily owing to stellar performance of TurboTax and QuickBooks Online.Services and Other revenues were up nearly 18.4% to $849 million while product revenues increased 5.7% to $316 million.Segment-wise, Small Business and Self-Employed Group witnessed 19% year-over-year growth, primarily driven by 51% subscriber growth rate for Quickbooks Online, which brought the count to 2.8 million at the end of the just reported quarter. Online ecosystem revenues saw an increase of 39%. Self-Employed subscribers increased to around 490,000 from 425,000 in the previous quarter and 180,000 in the year-ago quarter.Geographically, U.S. based subscribers grew 47% to 2.2 million and international subscribers soared 69% on a year-over-year basis to 630,000.Management was particularly optimistic about positive responses to initiatives taken to increase subscriber base. The company is trying to address the funding needs of small businesses by providing them access to the required capital via their platform. Additionally, the incorporation of a virtual voice assistant in the platform is another tailwind.The company completed three acquisitions during the second quarter, of which the most prominent one is “TSheets” that added a time tracking application to the platform. The enrichment of the employee base via these additions is also a positive. The company’s brand awareness related programs are proving to be beneficial as well, as quoted by management. Notably, revenues from Consumer Group were up 12% year over year. Professional tax revenues within Strategic Partners Group were $95 million.The company’s recent enhancements to products generating revenues for the Consumer Group are proving to be worthy. The inclusion of artificial intelligence and machine learning has enriched the platform by improving consumer experience.The introduction of TurboTax Live has created growth opportunities for the company in the assisted market. The latest solution added to Turbo allows consumers to get an entire snapshot of their financial health. The application is available on Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) App Store. These additions have made the solutions portfolio further lucrative.Coming to operational metrics, Intuit reported non-GAAP gross profit (excluding stock-based compensation, amortization and other one-time items) of $935 million, up 14.7% year over year, backed by higher revenues. Gross margin for the quarter came in at 80.3%, almost flat year over year.The company posted non-GAAP operating income of $120 million compared with $106 million in the year-ago quarter. Operating margin contracted 13 basis points to 10.3% during the quarter.Intuit posted non-GAAP net income from continuing operations of approximately $91 million compared with second-quarter fiscal 2017 net income of $67 million.Intuit Inc.

Nevertheless, the company is on track to reach the fiscal 2018 target.Per the recent tax reforms, the company expects fiscal 2018 financials to be above the preliminary expectations and the guidance was updated accordingly.We believe the company will continue to benefit from regular enhancements of the solutions portfolio via innovations and inorganic growth, which will eventually boost the top line.However, stiff competition from payroll solution providers such as Paycom Software Inc.

Further, FTI Consulting continues to pursue opportunities in areas such as business transformation services, transaction advisory business, retail, construction, data and analytics, cyber business, information governance and international arbitration.This, in turn, leads to continued revenue growth. We believe FTI Consulting’s international expansion remains strong and is likely to continue in the future as well.Structural ChangesIn order to stay ahead in the rapidly evolving and competitive global markets, structural change has become a necessity as management teams look to fend off rivals, protect intellectual property rights and transform businesses via M&A, divestiture and other restructuring activities.

1699,ADP,"Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP  -  Free Report) yesterday announced a 9.5% hike in its quarterly cash dividend.The company’s board of directors raised its quarterly dividend payment from prior dividend of 63 cents per share to 69 cents. This translates to an annualized dividend of $2.76 per share, with a yield of 2.4%. The increased dividend will be paid on Jul 1, 2018 to shareholders of record as of Jun 8, 2018.The latest dividend hike came on the back of the tax benefits from the new tax (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, effective from December 2017), which lowered corporate tax rates significantly from 35% to 21%. Notably, the company reported a one-time net tax benefit of about $46 million from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in second-quarter fiscal 2018.A Long Track Record of Dividend Hike ADP’s board of directors is optimistic about offering another dividend hike in November 2018. Notably, the company has been maintaining a consistent record of annual dividend hikes. The company offered its 43rd consecutive increase in dividend on Nov 7, 2017. With a 10.5% increase, the quarterly dividend then was raised to 63 cents from 57 cents.We believe that the company’s strong financial background have enabled it to undertake shareholder-friendly measures like dividends and buybacks. In fiscal 2017, ADP generated $2,125.9 million cash from operating activities, reflecting an increase of 12% year over year. The company paid dividend of $995 million and repurchased stocks worth $1.26 billion during fiscal 2017.ADP’s Growth Potential Raises OptimismWe believe that such initiatives not only enhance shareholders’ return but also raise the market value of a stock. Through dividend payouts and share repurchases, companies boost investors’ confidence, persuading them to either buy or hold the script.Notably, ADP is confident on its growth potential, which increases the possibility of an additional increase in shareholder value. It looks strong on the back of strategic acquisitions and business moves. The company is focused on streamlining its business to strengthen core operations in the long run. To this end, it has divested a number of its divisions in the past few years. Further, we note that ADP holds a dominant position in the payroll processing and HCM market, primarily due to its robust product portfolio.Zacks Rank & Price PerformanceAutomatic Data Processing is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.A glimpse of the company’s price trend reveals that the stock has had an impressive run on the bourse on a year-over-year basis. Shares of ADP have returned 14.2%, which compared favorably with the S&P 500’s gain of 13.8%. Other Stocks to ConsiderA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector are Conduent (CNDT  -  Free Report), TriNet Group (TNET  -  Free Report) and The Brink’s Company (BCO  -  Free Report). While Conduent and TriNet Group sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), The Brink’s Company has a Zacks Rank #2.Earnings for Conduent, TriNet Group and The Brink’s Company are estimated to rise 43.8%, 40% and 5.3%, respectively, for the current quarter.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

1700,ADP,"If 2018 has thus far been the year of the stock market roller coaster, then Wednesday was its picture-perfect microcosm: a pre-market fallout of -550 on the Dow — and big drops in the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, as well — due to articulation on trade tariff tensions between the U.S. and China, only to reverse course and finish in the green by yesterday’s closing bell.Was a cease fire declared in the brewing trade war with China? Hardly. But market participants were able to collect themselves enough to recognize we’ve not yet seen any tariffs penned in ink, let alone set in stone. So unless and/or until we actually endure the pain of tightening tariffs spiking higher prices on imported goods while also generating major supply gluts on U.S. exports, they remain theoretical to this point.And though the markets work as a forward economic indicator, Zacks Senior Strategist Kevin Cook astutely points out that the big sell-off yesterday morning had crossed a technical threshold that swung back into buying opportunities. You can read his article here: Critical Market Juncture: AbsurdityA couple economic news items hit the tape ahead of Thursday’s opening bell: new Initial Jobless Claims from last week and the February read on the domestic trade balance. Jobless claims increased 24K to 242K from an upwardly revised 218K the previous week. This is a pretty big jump week-over-week, but consider that the previous two weeks’ reads broke low levels not seen since the years of “prog rock” (ask your hip uncle).A headline of 242K is also within our long-term range of 225-250K consistent with an historically robust labor market. Continuing claims sank further, to a smidge under 1.81 million; this read has not reached 2 million claims since the hurricane-riddled environment of late last summer.Jobless claims also come sandwiched this week been private-sector payrolls from ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) yesterday and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) non-farm payroll report tomorrow, before the opening bell. Analysts are looking for roughly 180K new jobs from March, though recent months’ projections have been notably low compared to the actuals. ADP’s report from Wednesday saw 245K new jobs last month just in the private sector alone.And the Trade Balance (deficit) from February is now the deepest hole we’ve been in since the middle of the crisis of the Great Recession: -$57.6 billion. We’ve not yet bottomed out from the lowest levels of economic collapse a decade ago, but considering the last time our jobs market was a strong as it is today we were running trade balances at or near absolute zero — and had always been there from the beginnings of this survey in 1950 — we can safely consider this a big number.Keep in mind this read is from February, meaning this was before threats of a trade war with China were anything more than an overlooked campaign promise from the Trump campaign. It will be interesting to see how this trade deficit is affected by threats of tariffs, etc., and even more if a trade war actually ensues.

1702,ADP,"Intuit Inc. (INTU  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 22. The company’s revenues are likely to benefit from higher adoption of the company’s enriched product suite. Acquisitions are expected to boost the top line as well. However, rising expenses are a major concern.Factors to ConsiderThe company has two main products – QuickBooks, which offers financial, and business management online services and desktop software to small businesses, and TurboTax, which offers income tax preparation products and services.There are over 29 million small and medium businesses in the United States alone. Intuit had over 2.55 million QuickBooks online subscribers in the country at the end of first-quarter fiscal 2018. We believe that Intuit has a lot of growth opportunity in this majorly untapped market.Notably, the soon-to-be reported quarter has been quite an eventful one for the company. Intuit announced the appointment of Diego Rodriguez as executive vice president and chief product and design officer.The company announced the launch of QuickBooks Capital, a product meant to solve lending related issues of small businesses. Additionally, the formation of a $15 million fund named “Lighter Capital Intuit Developer Fund” was announced by Lighter Capital for independent application developers of the Intuit QuickBooks platform.Intuit also unveiled QuickBooks Assistant, a chatbot for user assistance. In January 2018, the company launched Turbo, an application to determine the financial standing of customers. The application is available on Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) App Store.The company also signed an agreement to acquire TSheets in an attempt to incorporate time tracking systems. Moreover, in an attempt to increase its brand awareness, the company launched two advertisements on Feb 4, 2018 during Big Game, an American football match series.However, Intuit’s elevated costs and expenses remain a major headwind. Furthermore, stiff competition from payroll solution providers such as Paycom Software (PAYC  -  Free Report) and Automatic Data Processing (ADP  -  Free Report) is another concern.Intuit Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Intuit Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Intuit Inc.

1703,ADP,"Happy Groundhog Day! As we see on the first Friday of almost every month, new non-farm payrolls from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) have been released before the opening bell. This comes in conjunction with tonnage of new Q4 earnings reports both after yesterday’s market close and before today’s open. The headline was better than expected, but not a huge surprise: 200K new jobs created in January, with an Unemployment Rate remaining steady at 4.1%.While this 200K number is higher than the analyst consensus of roughly 180K (analyst for months have been expecting 180K new jobs), it is below the ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) payroll report released Wednesday morning, which showed 234K new jobs in just the private sector alone. Typically, however, while the ADP and BLS numbers do tend to align with future revisions, initially they are often far apart from one another.Pre-market trading, which had been deep in the red ahead of the BLS announcement, clawed back to around -180 points on the Dow, only to plummet back to around -225 points following the news.

1706,ADP,"Concerns regarding U.S. trade with China, and the progressing development of what this scenario looks like, is sending market futures plummeting again ahead of the opening bell. Following President Trump’s latest announcement of tariffs hitting goods coming into the U.S. from China, the Red Dragon has retaliated with tariffs being slapped on more than 100 domestic goods being shipped to China.Currently, the Dow looks to open down 550 points, the Nasdaq -122 and the S&P 500, which hasn’t seen back-to-back gains in weeks, is -40 points. We see from this how trade with China does imply some contagion across industries — while the U.S. is targeting $50 billion in Chinese durables (think dishwashers, copiers, flat-screen TVs, etc.) with a 25% tariff and China is focused mostly on American commodities (soybeans, wheat, cotton, tobacco, etc.) — there is also the entire realm of semiconductors and other technology hardware more closely related to the Nasdaq’s domain.For U.S. autos, this specter is even more severe: there was already a 25% Chinese tariff on autos built in the U.S. — not just American car companies like Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report) either, but European plants in the U.S. South would also be affected — so this new measure would mean a full 50% tax levied on these autos being shipped to China. More than a quarter-million U.S. autos, worth nearly $10 billion, were sold in China last year. We see the results of this new measure in Tesla shares this morning, as well: TSLA is down another 5% this morning, -16.5% year over year.ADP Private Sector Payrolls Up Big AgainAll this aside, it doesn’t take much to find some very good news in today’s pre-market: 241K new private-sector jobs were created in March, according to payroll giant Automatic Data Processing (ADP  -  Free Report). February revisions cranked up 11K to 246K overall. Very strong Goods-producing jobs (65K) in mostly medium-sized companies (127K) pushed these levels up toward historic highs yet again. Construction brought 31K new jobs last month, Manufacturing saw 29K with Trade/Transportation topping the list at 40K.Predictions for Friday’s non-farm payroll totals from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) are for roughly 180K new jobs for March, although recently these estimates have been well short of the robust actuals we’ve seen; the ADP number in recent months has done a better near-term job of capturing the rapid employment growth in the U.S. The Unemployment Rate looks to stay the same at 4.1% or dip further.Of course, none of these numbers include any sort of headwinds from a trade war with China. Then again, these tariff numbers are still all just talk, and until agreements are reached on paper between the two economic giants, this is all they will remain. But the market is clearly pricing in the risk of a nasty fight between President Trump’s people and Xi Jinping’s.
"
1707,ADP,"President Trump called for tariffs on U.S. steel and aluminum imports that could hurt corporations as well as consumers. Such tariffs also stirred fears of a trade dispute between the United States and China. This in turn propelled Wall Street’s fear gauge index above its historic average and dragged the broader markets down.Inflation scare leading to rate hikes had already triggered a sudden panic among investors. After all, rate hikes will raise borrowing costs, eventually denting corporate profits and affecting the U.S. economy. Amid such uncertainty, investing in dividend aristocrats seems prudent, as these provide higher total returns with lower volatility and are undoubtedly the holy grail of investing.Tariffs to Affect U.S. CorporationsWall Street began March on a sour note after Trump said that the United States will impose steel and aluminum tariffs. Trump said that the U.S. will impose a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum. Such a protectionist trade policy may be one of the widest-reaching trade action he has taken to date, but it has triggered a lot of concern among corporations and consumers.Tariffs will increase the cost of companies that rely heavily on aluminum and steel, like auto and plane makers. Needless to say, shares of Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report), General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) and The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) dipped around 3%. In fact, Corporate America has cautioned Trump that tariffs could backfire. After all, imports make up for about a third of the steel American business houses use every year.Higher prices on steel and aluminum, furthermore, will compel companies that rely on such products to pass on some of the costs to consumers. Increased consumer prices may in the long run hamper sales growth and affect the company, leading to job losses.Wall Street is Worried About a Trade WarTrump’s contentious tariff announcement has raised apprehensions about retaliation from China and other major U.S. trading partners. China cautioned America to abide by multilateral trade rules and not to harm the delicate global economy. We shouldn’t forget that China is the world’s dominant steel producer and Trump’s tariff moves could easily start a trade war between them.Li Xinchuang, vice secretary general of the China Iron and Steel Association, added that imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports is an “extremely stupid move.” This will make U.S. industries fall behind globally during a period when “China is in its prime.”Tariffs also raise threats of a trade war with America’s closest allies, Canada. And why not? Canada is the top exporter of both steel and aluminum to the United States. Canada is solely responsible for manufacturing 17% of all the U.S. steel imports and 43% of all aluminum imports. Canadian foreign minister Chrystia Freeland, in the meantime, has announced that “should restrictions be imposed on Canadian steel and aluminum products, Canada will take responsive measures to defend its trade interests and workers.”Rate Hike Fears LoomConcerns about trade came at a time when the broader market is already on a roller-coaster ride. The broader S&P 500 and the Dow tanked nearly 4% in February. Both the bourses had their worst month in two years. Meanwhile, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) soared 15% on Mar 1, indicating that turbulence has picked up as well.Investors remain worried that rise in inflation in the near term will prompt the Fed to hike short-term interest rates at a faster pace than expected. This in turn will increase borrowing costs for business and consumers, which will eventually lead to a slowdown in the economy. It’s important to also note that an easy monetary policy helped the equity market notch a nearly nine-year bull run.Inflation to RiseRecent hike in pay levels raised worries about higher commodity prices. Wage growth hit the fastest pace in January in more than eight-and-a-half years, according to the Labor Department. Average hourly wages increased 9 cents, or 0.3%, to $26.74. This helped the average year-on-year hourly earnings to rise to 2.9%, the highest since June 2009. Americans are now getting fatter paychecks mostly due to a tighter labor market, tax cut policy and a rise in the minimum wage threshold in several states.Consumers have also been ramping up their spending levels of late as they are largely benefiting from a rise in income. Traders predict that such upbeat consumer outlays will fuel inflation (read more: US Consumers Most Confident in 17 Years: Top 4 Picks).Minutes of the Jan 30-31 Federal Open Market Committee meeting has already shown that several officials expect inflation to move up this year and touch the Fed’s 2% target. Only a small number of them forecast inflation to fall short of 2%.Why Dividend Aristocrats? 5 Solid ChoicesGiven the aforesaid concerns, investing in dividend aristocrats seems judicious.

1712,ADP,"ADP, Q4, SOTU Boost Market Hugely
"
1713,ADP,"The U.S.-Canada trade dispute escalated after U.S. President Donald Trump called Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau “very dishonest and weak.” Trump had accused Canada of “charging massive tariffs” to U.S. businesses.The tiff involved France and Germany who criticized Trump’s decision to back out of the G7 communique. Trump, in the meanwhile, threatened to double auto tariffs, marring the G7 efforts to show a united front.   With Trump refusing to endorse the G7 communique, stock market gains are likely to be capped. In fact, more uncertainty is lurking as Trump is set to meet North Korean President Kim Jong Un in Singapore. Amid such ambiguity, investing in dividend aristocrats seems prudent, as they provide higher total returns with lower volatility.No Breakthrough at G7 SummitTrump’s stinging attack on Canada jeopardized the G7’s efforts to maintain free and fair trade relationships. He specifically accused Canada of imposing a 270% tariff on dairy. This has forced many U.S. dairy products from making their way to Canada from the United States. Trump, in return, has decided to slap more import tariffs on the sensitive auto industry.Trump tweeted “PM Justin Trudeau of Canada acted so meek and mild during our @G7 meetings only to give a news conference after I left saying that, ‘US Tariffs were kind of insulting’ and he ‘will not be pushed around.’ Very dishonest & weak. Our tariffs are in response to his of 270% on dairy!”Meanwhile, Trudeau’s office added that the dairy tariffs were primarily a reaction to Trump’s decision to levy charges on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, Mexico and the EU. Moreover, protective measures like Canada’s dairy tariff are very common throughout the world. Lest we forget, the United States has imposed tariffs to protect several of its industries, starting from the 350% tariff on tobacco to 160% on shelled peanuts.Trudeau said that Germany stood by the “jointly agreed communique” despite Trump’s decision to back out.

1719,ADP,"Well, President Trump was sure looking forward to this morning’s jobs numbers, and it turns out he was right to do so: 223K new jobs for the month of May from the non-farm payroll BLS report was well up from the previous month — the downwardly revised 159K for April — and much higher than the trailing 3-month average of 179K. The new Unemployment Rate dipped even further, to 3.8% — the lowest we’ve seen since the turn of the millennium.Average hourly earnings grew 0.3%, much better than the 0.1% gain we saw in April. Year over year, we see 2.7% growth in wage gains. This is still Goldilocks territory: not too hot, not too cold. The U-6, aka “real unemployment,” fell to 7.6% — the lowest in 17 years. The private sector brought in 218K new jobs last month — a better read than ADP’s (ADP  -  Free Report) reported 178K on Wednesday and the 162K from the previous month.About the only negatives in this morning’s report was in Temporary workers, down 7K last month, but that could signal strength in full-time employment, which is far more desirable. Labor Force Participation ticked down 10 basis points to 62.7% — indicating that, incredibly, there is still some slack in this historically robust labor market. The average work week remained consistent at 34.5 hours.The Retail industry led the way with 31K new hires in the month, with Healthcare, Construction and Professional/Business Services following closely behind. In all, we saw 171K new jobs in the Services sector. For another major positive, employment for African Americans, at 5.9%, is the lowest it has been since these numbers started being kept in 1972.Of course, any drama concerning trade difficulties with our neighbors on the Western Hemisphere wouldn’t show up in any of these numbers, and even if they are to come to fruition in the coming months — and there’s as yet no guarantee that they will — it’s difficult to gauge whether they will have an immediate effect on the labor market. If you’ve been keeping with U.S.-based stocks, you’ve likely done well. If you’ve been acting on the president’s tweets, you may be doing even better.

1720,ADP,"Benchmarks closed in the green on Wednesday after two straight days of declines. Boeing reached an all-time high after releasing upbeat fourth-quarter earnings results and a strong full-year projection, which in turn boosted key indexes. However, markets lost some of their gains after the Fed’s stated that inflation was likely to reach its desired level in the medium term and projected gradual increase in key rates. Although, key indexes finished marginally higher on the last trading day of January, all of them registered record gains for the month. While, the Dow and the S&P 500 registered their best monthly performance since March 2016, the tech-heavy Nasdaq posted its highest monthly increase since October 2015.How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) increased 0.3%, to close at 26,149.39. The S&P 500 rose 0.1% to close at 2,823.81. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,411.48, gaining 0.1%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) decreased 12% to close at 13.01. A total of around 8.05 billion shares were traded on Wednesday, higher than the last 20-session average of 7.18 billion shares. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.14 -to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.61-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.What Moved the Benchmarks?Shares of The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) rose 4.9% settling at its best levels ever, after the aircraft manufacturer posted fourth-quarter earnings per share and revenues that beat the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. (Read More)For the full year, Boeing’s operating profit jumped 76% year-over-year to $10.3 billion. Net earnings for the company climbed 67% from 2016 to $8.2 billion in 2017. Also, the company’s commercial airplanes' 2018 delivery expectations are reiterated at a record level of 810 to 815 airplanes, which was higher than 2017’s total deliveries of 763 aircrafts.Upbeat fourth quarter earnings results and strong 2018 earnings and airplanes delivery outlook contributed to Boeing’s incredible performance. On Wednesday, Boeing contributed 114 points to the blue-chip index, Dow and was one of the best performers among all the S&P 500 companies.Additionally, Electronic Arts Inc.’s (EA  -  Free Report) shares advanced 7% after the gaming company reported fiscal third-quarter non-GAAP earnings of $2.22 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.18.

Both the tech companies were biggest contributor to S&P 500’s gains during the day. (Read More)Fed’s Policy Statement in FocusOn Wednesday, the Federal Reserve opted to leave benchmark rates unchanged within the 1.25%-1.5% range. In its two-day Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) policy statement following the meeting ended Jan 31, the Fed indicated that economic activity has increased at a “solid rate” and will continue to grow at a “moderate pace.”Additionally, per the statement, labor market remains strong, while inflation will likely “move up” in 2018 and will reach the desired 2% rate in the “medium term.” The FOMC also said federal funds rate is likely to increase at a “gradual” pace in coming months.Rising rate hike prospects as early as Fed’s next policy meeting in March weighed on investor sentiment and limited some of Wednesday’s gains. Higher rate environment and optimism of steady economic growth and higher inflation weighed on bond prices.Lower bond prices supported the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, which was at 2.722% on Wednesday, hovering near its highest settlement in almost four years. Also, 2-year yield was at around 2.15%. High treasury yields also weighed on broader equity markets to a certain extent.According to ADP’s (ADP  -  Free Report) private sector payrolls report for January, 234,000 new jobs were created during the month, Further, December’s results were revised downward by 8000 jobs, but still tallied at 242,000.

The passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which permanently slashes corporate tax rates from 35% to 21%, last December contributed to January’s gains. Additionally, in its Beige Book, the Fed provided an encouraging outlook about the U.S. economy, which in turn also boosted investor sentimentMoreover during the month, the Senate gave its consent to pass a short-term spending Bill that ends the recent government shutdown. Additionally, upbeat fourth-quarter earnings season, which include a very strong revenue momentum, an above-average proportion of positive surprises and an unusually positive revisions trend for the current and coming quarters, also contributed to strong market performance.Stocks That Made HeadlinesQualcomm Beats Q1 Earnings and Revenue EstimatesQualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) reported strong financial results for first-quarter fiscal 2018, with the top and the bottom lines beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

Services led the way with 212K new jobs, with Manufacturing adding 12K and Construction +9K.Non-farm payroll figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) on Friday morning should be very interesting in light of today’s results.

1726,ADP,"Friday, June 1, 2018Well, President Trump was sure looking forward to this morning’s jobs numbers, and it turns out he was right to do so: 223K new jobs for the month of May from the non-farm payroll BLS report was well up from the previous month — the downwardly revised 159K for April — and much higher than the trailing 3-month average of 179K. The new Unemployment Rate dipped even further, to 3.8% — the lowest we’ve seen since the turn of the millennium.Average hourly earnings grew 0.3%, much better than the 0.1% gain we saw in April. Year over year, we see 2.7% growth in wage gains. This is still Goldilocks territory: not too hot, not too cold. The U-6, aka “real unemployment,” fell to 7.6% — the lowest in 17 years. The private sector brought in 218K new jobs last month — a better read than ADP’s (ADP  -  Free Report) reported 178K on Wednesday and the 162K from the previous month.About the only negatives in this morning’s report was in Temporary workers, down 7K last month, but that could signal strength in full-time employment, which is far more desirable. Labor Force Participation ticked down 10 basis points to 62.7% — indicating that, incredibly, there is still some slack in this historically robust labor market. The average work week remained consistent at 34.5 hours.The Retail industry led the way with 31K new hires in the month, with Healthcare, Construction and Professional/Business Services following closely behind. In all, we saw 171K new jobs in the Services sector. For another major positive, employment for African Americans, at 5.9%, is the lowest it has been since these numbers started being kept in 1972.Of course, any drama concerning trade difficulties with our neighbors on the Western Hemisphere wouldn’t show up in any of these numbers, and even if they are to come to fruition in the coming months — and there’s as yet no guarantee that they will — it’s difficult to gauge whether they will have an immediate effect on the labor market. If you’ve been keeping with U.S.-based stocks, you’ve likely done well. If you’ve been acting on the president’s tweets, you may be doing even better.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

1727,ADP,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 7% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is ADP due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Third-quarter Fiscal 2018 EarningsAutomatic Data Processing reported better-than-expected third-quarter fiscal 2018 results.Adjusted earnings per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8 cents and increased 16% year over year. Revenues came in at $3.69 billion, outpacing the consensus mark by $26 million. The top-line figure improved 8% on a reported basis and 6% on a constant-currency basis.Segment in DetailsEmployer Services revenues of $2.80 billion increased 7% year over year on a reported basis and 4% on an organic constant-currency basis. The number of employees on ADP clients' payrolls in the United States rose 2.9% on a same-store-sales basis. Client revenues retention increased 170 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis.PEO Services revenues were up 10% year over year to $1.1 billion. The upside was driven by 9% increase in average worksite employees. Average worksite employees paid by PEO Services were roughly 512,000.Interest on funds held for clients in the fiscal third quarter increased 21% to $135 million. The company’s average client funds balances climbed 6% year over year to $28.8 billion, while average interest yield of 1.9% was up 20 bps on a year-over-year basis.MarginsAdjusted EBIT margin contracted almost 20 bps to 24.4% primarily due to higher pass-through revenues and expenses related to acquisitions. The Employer Services segment’s margin fell roughly 20 bps on a year-over-year basis. On the flipside, the PEO Services segment's margin improved approximately 40 bps in the quarter.2018 GuidanceADP raised 2018 guidance for adjusted earnings, adjusted EBIT margin and worldwide new business bookings growth but reiterated the same for revenue growth in the band of 7-8%. Acquisitions and impact from foreign currency translation are projected to add approximately two percentage points of growth to revenues instead one percentage point projected in the previous guidance.Adjusted EBIT margin is anticipated to be more or less flat compared to the prior anticipation of a decline of almost 50 bps. ADP expects growth in worldwide new business bookings of 6-7% compared with the previous expectation of 5-7%.Also, adjusted earnings are envisioned to grow in the 16% to 17%, up from 12% to 13% guided earlier. ADP expects an adjusted effective tax rate of 26.2% compared with previous forecast of 26.9% for fiscal 2018.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been seven revisions higher for the current quarter.Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Price and Consensus  Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Price and Consensus | Automatic Data Processing, Inc. QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, ADP has an average Growth Score of C and a grade with the same score on the momentum front. The stock was also allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Based on our scores, the stock is equally suitable for value, growth, and momentum investors.OutlookEstimates have been trending upward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. It comes with little surprise ADP has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.

1728,ADP,"So the markets took a bath in red sauce yesterday, following weekend drama regarding the difficulties Italy faces with a hung parliament, leading to fears that the third largest economy in the European Union will voluntarily exit the EU — “Italexit,” to coin a phrase. The led to further game theory that said instability in the EU as a whole may eventually lead to a breakup of the Eurozone overall.But we are a long way from there; it’s far too early to be a true believer in the destruction of the EU. We see this in the pre-market rebound this morning, with much of the losses from Tuesday being buoyed back up in early trading today. And, as Zacks Exec VP Kevin Matras said earlier today: “Stocks Struggled Yesterday, but Italy’s Woes Overblown”Also this morning we see new economic data to help lead new market narratives now that Q1 earnings season is passed, and ahead of the Fed’s expected quarter-point rate hike in the next couple weeks. The two main headlines in this regard today — the second read on Q1 GDP and the ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) private-sector payroll survey — are both lighter than expected.Starting with the ADP numbers for May, which as usual hit the tape ahead of the big non-farm payrolls and unemployment read Friday, we saw a total of 178K new private-sector jobs for the month. This is beneath the expected 187K among a consensus of analysts, and April’s headline was revised way down by 41K new jobs to just 163K total. I say “just” 163K, though in reality this is still consistent with a healthy employment market in the private sector. But ratcheting this far down from a psychologically pleasing 204K last month is worth noting.The Services sector again led the way with 114K new jobs in May, but Goods-producing jobs performed very well compared to recent history with 64K jobs. The Construction industry outperformed all others for the month with 39K, and Manufacturing also pulled its weight with 14K new jobs. Trade/Transportation marked the biggest disappointment, with a loss of 23K new jobs for May.What’s interesting about this number is that Trade/Transportation has been among the biggest growth industries for new jobs over the past quarter or longer, and even led all industries back in March. Trucking, rail and logistics may all play a part in the pullback, and it may suggest higher inventories have put some slack in supply and demand. Trucking, in particular, is also one of those industries having trouble finding enough skilled labor to fill open positions — as such, it would give credence to economists’ views that a tight labor market will result in employment strains for certain industries.Q1 GDP was taken down 10 basis points this morning on the second read to 2.2%. Even though we see strong business investment (+9.2% in the quarter), personal consumption came in at a paltry 1%, falling from its initial read. If we may be so bold as to try and wring a narrative from this, take a look at the big corporate tax cut boon from early this year: businesses are feeling strong and putting their extra capital to work, whereas most individuals have not felt the wealth effect as of Q1 2018.Looking ahead to Q2 GDP, things improve markedly: an average estimate of 3.4% for our current quarter is very healthy, especially for an economy of the U.S.’s size, and also helps soften the blow of the 2.2% in seasonally slower Q1. For those looking for the first +3% full-year GDP in many years (the recent high was +2.9% in 2015), quarterly growth around three-and-a-half percent for the next three quarters should get us there, and then some. It will be interesting to see if a cap emerges due to the aforementioned skilled-worker strain.Considering how this may affect the Fed’s decision to raise interest rates next month, which is pretty well baked into everyone’s expectations right now. Another quarter-point raise will bring the federal funds rate to a range of 1.75-2.00%, marking the first time since before the Great Recession to see interest rates with a 2-handle.This would also be the second hike in calendar 2018, with possibly two more to go in the back-half of the year. However, odds of both a third and fourth rate hike have fallen recently, however, possibly with one eye on the situation in the Eurozone. But for now, the U.S. is doing its part leading the way in economic strength.

1731,ADP,"Headlines out of Italy this morning may come as a surprise to many U.S.-centric investors, but for those who have paid attention this may have looked doomed from the start: a coalition government between two anti-establishment parties — the progressive 5 Star and the far-right The League — appears to have hit a major bump in the road that threatens to send the wheels flying off. The mandate to form a new government has been refused, and fresh elections now look imminent.The March 4 elections resulted in a hung parliament, when Italians voted to shake things up by removing standard liberal and conservative parties in favor of 5 Star — a populist movement started by an Italian comedian — and The League, an anti-EU group led by right-wing firebrand Matteo Salvini. Among first orders of business for the economically challenged country was to secure a new loan from the EU and somehow pull together the disparate ideals of each “outre-party.” This appears to have resulted in an immediate failure to launch.So back to the drawing board for Italy, as designated Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has bowed out of further attempts to forge a compromise government. Italy’s current President Sergio Mattarella, a staunch pro-EU figure, is reportedly turning to the IMF to supply the country with a new compromise figurehead. But the push-pull in the country with regard to remaining within the Union is developing into real-time tension in the country and Europe in general.Market futures here at home may be indicating some concern regarding this issue. After last week’s modest uptick, with very little by way of economic indicators driving the bus, U.S. indexes are trading in the red ahead of Tuesday’s opening bell.And though we start the new week slowly, with a Monday holiday and only a smattering of econ data hitting the tape today, we see things really picking up as the week progresses: a second read on Q1 GDP (2.3% was the first headline number), private-sector payroll figures from ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) and Friday’s non-farm payroll report and fresh unemployment rate. These results will feed into the June narrative about a fresh interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve.But the concerns about Italy are not so easily shrugged off, especially considering its affect on the EU in general. When Greece looked into the economic abyss a few years ago, it unmistakably shook markets here at home. And now, with perilous situations emerging elsewhere around the globe, from Turkey to Venezuela, it’s clearly not the time to turn a blind eye to the world’s problems, especially with regard to their potential to roil the markets.

1733,ADP,"After witnessing roughly 20% gains or more in 2017’s major indexes, the natural question for investors is: what’s next? Well, this week will take us a good distance into figuring this out in early 2018, ahead of Q4 earnings season and as market participants plot their advances.Due to the holiday-shortened week, we’re seeing a slightly skewed events calendar: the ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) private sector payroll numbers for December will be released Thursday instead of the usual Wednesday — just one day ahead of the nonfarm payroll figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Expectations for both are positive but not earth-shattering: 189K new private sector jobs are expected from last month, and that number falls to 180K for Friday’s BLS tally. Unemployment is expected to remain 4.1%. All of these figures remain strong for the current economy.That’s not to say Wednesday will be devoid of relevant economic data; we expect to see ISM Manufacturing results, Construction Spending figures, Auto Sales and Fed minutes during the day tomorrow. (ISM Services numbers aren’t due until Friday.) These numbers will be particularly interesting for the goods producing and industrial investment factors implied, as these were sectors in the economy that have only recently begun to improve from their long-dormant states.One metric in particular on Friday will be of interest, and that is Average Hourly Earnings. This is another piece of the economic puzzle that has failed to gain along with the rest of the domestic environment, but with an estimate of +0.3% on Friday, this would point to wage growth that would go a long way toward enhancing U.S. GDP. (Q4 GDP, by the way, is estimated at 2.6% — another strong number to join Q3’s final 3.2%; any surprises to the upside here would no doubt be welcome for market bulls going forward.)Small Business Jobs Growth for December from today’s Paychex survey were down a bit, though moderate wage growth (+3%) still registers as a positive. Included in the Paychex data is a poll on the tax reform law passed at the end of 2017: 80% of small businesses in the U.S. are expected to invest their windfall profits back into their companies, and 65% of those companies expect to increase wages. More good news for the American labor force and U.S. economy in general.

1734,ADP,"Avis Budget Group, Inc. (CAR  -  Free Report) has rallied a massive 91.9% over the past year, significantly outperforming the 7.6% increase of the industry it belongs to. The company’s focus on widening its global network and coverage, and enhancing technology to improve its offerings is commendable. In first-quarter 2018, Avis Budget incurred adjusted loss of 74 cents per share compared with a loss of 94 cents in the year-ago quarter incurred adjusted loss of 74 cents per share compared with a loss of 94 cents in the year-ago quarter. The reported figure was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.04. Total revenues came in at $1,968 million, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,954 million and increased 7% on a year-over-year basis.Also, the company’s earnings surprise history has been impressive. Avis Budget outpaced consensus estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 35.4%. For the second quarter, the same moved up 3.6% over the past 30 days.Enhancing Global FootprintIn an effort to enhance its global footprint, Avis Budget invests in markets where car rental demand is on the rise.  In 2017, Zipcar — the leading car-sharing network and subsidiary of the company — forayed into Iceland, Taiwan and Costa Rica. Notably, Zipcar has significant presence in over 500 cities and towns across Europe, Asia and North America. By expanding footprint in various countries, the company has widened its global network and coverage to almost all the major regions of the world.This apart, Avis Budget remains focused on fortifying its fleet with the addition of latest car models from leading manufactures to attract customers. We believe that these strategies, along with better customer support systems should boost the company’s top line.Technology EnhancementThe company continues enhancing its technology and improving offerings. It is consistently trying to simplify customers’ online interaction to make the reservation, pick-up and return process more easy and user-friendly. It entered into partnerships with various product and technology companies to enhance user experience with mobile and technology capabilities.

1735,ADP,"Equifax Inc. (EFX  -  Free Report) shares have declined 15.7% over the past year against 34.9% increase recorded by the industry. Last year’s cyber-attack at Equifax, which resulted in theft of highly-sensitive personal data of approximately 143 million consumers, has heavily tarnished the brand image, reputation and credibility of the company.Equifax’s first-quarter 2018 earnings faced the brunt of a data breach, with the company’s earnings of $1.43, recording a 0.7% decline year over year.

However, for the second quarter, the company’s consensus estimates edged down 1.9 % in the past 30 days.Aftermath of Cyber Attack The company is facing huge customer criticism while cybersecurity companies are raising doubts over its preparedness and line of actions to the massive data breach. We believe that breach-related troubles for Equifax are unlikely to end any time soon.In the first quarter of 2018, the company’s adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 250 basis points (bps) year over year, reflecting higher operating expenses associated with the breach fallout.

An Outperformer: A glimpse of the company’s price trend reveals that the stock has had an impressive run on the bourse over the past year.

1739,ADP,"More good economic news hits the tape ahead of the opening bell today, with ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) private sector payroll numbers coming out better than expectations. November new private-sector jobs came in at 190K, better than the 175K expected. True, this is down a bit from October’s unrevised 235K, but that number retained some of the labor force volatility from the previous month’s hurricane activity (September jobs were way down, October way up).The current analyst consensus for Friday’s BLS non-farm payroll report is for 195K new jobs from November. These numbers between ADP and BLS don’t always correlate in real time, but with future revisions they tend to tell the same story. And any number north of 100K — the amount of new labor participants added each month — shows further strengthening within the U.S. jobs market.Typically, Services brought in more than 3x the number of jobs in Goods producing: 155K versus 36K. Medium-sized companies (50-499 employees) grew the most with 99K new jobs, followed by small companies (<50) with 50K and large firms (500+) at 41K. Leading sectors were Education/Healthcare (+54K) and a surprisingly strong Manufacturing (+40K) and Trade/Transportation (+36K). In another surprise, Construction actually lost jobs in the month (-4K), even with all the housing demand and further recovery from the hurricanes.Q3 ProductivityThe final read on Q3 Productivity has also come out this morning, with 3% staying unrevised from the previous month. A solid number, even though expectations were for a slightly higher revision. Labor costs, however, were revised way down: from +0.5% in the last read to -0.2% in the final read. This is not good news for what economists have been saying for a long time about wage growth needing to get stronger; in Q3, wage growth actually went backwards.Enter the tax cut proposal, which promises to increase wages based on trickle-down economic theory. Yet with an unemployment rate trending down — 4.1% for the last BLS report, and eyeing sub-4% in the near future, if today’s ADP numbers have merit — adding $1.5 trillion in deficit-financed tax cuts could cause the U.S. market to overheat, sparking a big jump in inflation and causing interest rates to spike. Talk about kicking a sleeping giant!
"
1740,ADP,"This is an important week for economic data in the U.S., but not quite yet. This Friday morning, we shall see the latest non-farm payroll numbers and unemployment rate from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). We expect to see another strong month of jobs gains pretty much across the spectrum of domestic industries, with even Construction and Energy picking up some of their slack from earlier in the year. In the last read, the unemployment rate fell to 4.1% — the lowest read we’ve seen since the labor market was much, much smaller.Typically, the Wednesday prior to the Friday BLS figures brings the private sector payroll report from ADP (ADP  -  Free Report), as it does again this week. The over-under for the past several months (not counting temporary hurricane-related issues) has been around 180K new jobs in the private sector created each month.A number like this again tomorrow will be consistent without robust labor market; north of 200K or even 250K would suggest something else in play here: the promise of a big corporate tax cut forthcoming would allow companies to build out their workforces, and those who want to get a head start on competition may have already begun hiring.Also consider the seasonality effect in these broader jobs metrics — retail and delivery companies hire more workers around the holiday season: jobs for cashiers, security, merchandise loading and logistics all may get a bump. This would obviously be good, but not something to bank on into the early months of 2018.Thursday we will see the Initial Jobless Claims read, and these numbers have been a little more turbulent of late, shaking out of the “normal” 225-250K range we’ve seen week to week over the past few years. Continuing claims have also been seeping up to the 2 million level of late, which is a total they have not reached in more than 30 weeks.Today, we saw a fresh read on the October Trade Balance, which sank to a deficit of -$48.7 billion, notably below the previous month’s -$44.9 billion. This is the deepest hole we’ve seen since January of this year. Importantly, one of the main criticisms about the new (forthcoming?) tax plan is that it dumps another $1-1.7 trillion onto the nation’s credit card over the next ten years. So if a dip of nearly $4 billion month over month concerns you, how much must you feel the proposed tax legislation will affect you (and the country)?

A number like this again tomorrow will be consistent with out robust labor market; north of 200K or even 250K would suggest something else in play here: the promise of a big corporate tax cut forthcoming would allow companies to build out their workforces, and those who want to get a head start on competition may have already begun hiring.Also consider the seasonality effect in these broader jobs metrics — retail and delivery companies hire more workers around the holiday season: jobs for cashiers, security, merchandise loading and logistics all may get a bump. This would obviously be good, but not something to bank on into the early months of 2018.Thursday we will see the Initial Jobless Claims read, and these numbers have been a little more turbulent of late, shaking out of the “normal” 225-250K range we’ve seen week to week over the past few years. Continuing claims have also been seeping up to the 2 million level of late, which is a total they have not reached in more than 30 weeks.Today, we saw a fresh read on the October Trade Balance, which sank to a deficit of -$48.7 billion, notably below the previous month’s -$44.9 billion. This is the deepest hole we’ve seen since January of this year. Importantly, one of the main criticisms about the new (forthcoming?) tax plan is that it dumps another $1-1.7 trillion onto the nation’s credit card over the next ten years. So if a dip of nearly $4 billion month over month concerns you, how much must you feel the proposed tax legislation will affect you (and the country)?Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

Continued subscriber growth for QuickBooks Online and QuickBooks Self-Employed also acted as a catalyst.The company recorded an increase of 56% in QuickBooks Online subscribers for the year, bringing the total global count to 2.55 million.

Its revenue performance improved on a year-over-year basis owing to strong growth in QuickBooks Online and success in Consumer Tax and ProConnect.We are positive about Intuit’s growing SMB exposure and believe that its strategic acquisitions will boost the segment. Increased adoption of its cloud-based services and products is another positive.The company has also restructured business to focus on the QuickBooks services. It expects to continue investing in this portfolio, which might hurt near-term profitability.Stiff competition from payroll solution providers such as Paycom Software Inc. (PAYC  -  Free Report) and Automatic Data Processing (ADP  -  Free Report) is a concern, especially considering the seasonality of Intuit’s tax business and the ongoing economic uncertainty.Currently, Intuit carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1743,ADP,"Paylocity Holding Corporation (PCTY  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter fiscal 2018 non-GAAP earnings of 15 cents per share which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 11 cents per share. Non-GAAP earnings also increased from 7 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.Quarter DetailsThe company’s revenues came in at $81.5 million, reflecting an increase of 25% year over year, and also marginally beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $81 million. The year-over-over increase was driven by new client addition, existing client growth and additions to HCM product suite.The top line was also backed by a 26% surge in recurring revenues (97% of total revenues) and an 8.6% increase in implementation and other revenues.The company’s non-GAAP gross profit came in at $51.1 million, up 30.1% year over year. Non-GAAP gross margin expanded 230 basis points (bps) year over year to 62.7%, primarily due to higher revenue base.Non-GAAP operating expenses are pegged at $43.3 million, up 18.8% year over year. As a percentage of revenues non-GAAP operating expenses contracted 300 bps year over year to 53.1%. This in turn positively impacted the operating results.Paylocity reported non-GAAP operating income of $8.2 million as compared with $4 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin during the quarter came in at 10% as compared with 6.2% reported in the year-ago period.Consequently, non-GAAP net income during the quarter was $8.2 million compared with $3.9 million reported in the year-ago period.Paylocity exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $103.5 million compared with $86.5 million in the previous quarter.

Further, it’s both top and bottom line for the quarter increased year over year. The company also provided an encouraging guidance for the second quarter and fiscal 2018.We remain positive about Paylocity’s regular investments in SaaS technology. Notably, in the last few quarters, clients moving from traditional payroll service providers to the company’s SaaS-based services generated a significant portion of Paylocity’s revenues. Consequently, we believe that regular investments in technological upgrades, along with product innovations, will continue to boost the top line in the long run. Such initiatives are also likely to have positive impact on its forthcoming results.Furthermore, higher adoption of Paylocity’s ACA dashboard application, which specializes in tracking employee count, employee status and health care plan affordability, will act as a tailwind.However, competition in the payroll processing sector from new entrants as well as existing players such as Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP  -  Free Report) , Oracle Corporation (ORCL  -  Free Report) and SAP SE (SAP  -  Free Report) remain major headwinds.Currently, Paylocity carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.     Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1744,ADP,"Following the heaviest inflow of Q3 earnings reports of the entire quarter yesterday after the closing bell, we see new economic data reads and news from across the pond. There will also be a long-awaited unveiling of the GOP tax reform plan today. And this is all aside from a new group of Q3 earnings reports coming out before the opening bell this morning.Initial Jobless Claims fell again, to 229K last week from a slightly upwardly revised 234K the previous week. Continuing claims have sunk to multi-quarter lows beneath 1.9 million to 1.884 million specifically. This is more positive news, following yesterday’s ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) strong 235K new private-sector jobs results for October. Tomorrow’s Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) non-farm payroll report is expected to bring in north of 300K new jobs last month. All of these numbers speak to an unwaveringly strong U.S. labor market.Productivity and Labor Costs reads were also released early today. Preliminary productivity hit 3.0%, a bit higher than the 2.8% analysts had been expecting. The last time this metric registered this high was back in 2014. Labor costs were close to in-line with expectations at 0.5%, following a 0.3% read last time around. A surge in productivity with slight wage increases would seem to be music to the ears of economists and market participants alike; solid growth without unruly inflation creating headwinds is likely as Goldilocks as it gets.Which brings us to the tax reform proposal key to the Republican-run Congress today and its success in next year’s mid-term elections, and my question is one that is almost never asked by market analysts these days: with 3% growth, still-cheap borrowing costs and solid employment numbers, what do we need a tax cut for?These types of measures are typically used to pry an economy out of being stuck in the mud; if we’re already at or near our goals currently, wouldn’t a tax cut at this stage be simply borrowing against future gains, with the possible additional problems of blowing a hole the the national deficit, which would create longer-term economic issues?This aside for now, the Bank of England today has decided to ratchet up its interest rates 0.5%, amounting to its first rate hike in 10 years. This announcement comes as inflation in the U.K. remains at 3% while economic growth is slowing, not speeding up.The Bank also stayed pat with an asset buyback program worth U.S. $574 million. It’s far from a typical move for a central bank to raise rates while the country’s economy slows; starting new businesses, obtaining mortgages, etc. will now be more difficult. Perhaps the logic is that giving commercial and investment bank in England a leg up will spur the economy indirectly in the months ahead.Q3 Earnings RoundupWe will hear from Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) after the closing bell. Yesterday afternoon we saw a big beat from Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) augmented by remarks from CEO Mark Zuckerberg that security measures will add to costs at the social media leader at the expense of future profits. Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report), on the other hand, missed expectations on a Model 3 “bottleneck,” but future projections for auto deliveries in 2018 remained hopefully robust.Newell Brands (NWL  -  Free Report) shares have tumbled more than 20% this morning following its disappointing Q3 earnings results, where by the consumer plastics maker missed the 92 cent Zacks consensus and posted just 86 cents per share. This was still 10% growth year over year. Revenues in the quarter narrowly missed the 3.7 billion expected, and the company lowered earnings estimates for full-year 2017.Global quick-service restaurant major Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report) beat estimates by 2 cents per share to 68 cents in its most recent quarter, with $1.44 billion in revenues topping the $1.40 billion in the Zacks consensus estimate. Comps at KFC of +4% assisted the positive results in the quarter. Shares are trading up 2% in today’s pre-market.Hyatt Hotels (H  -  Free Report) surpassed expectations greatly on the bottom line, posting earnings of 26 cents per share compared with the 17 cents expected. Revenues of $1.12 billion topped the $1.09 billion we had been looking for. RevPAR rose 1.6% quarter over quarter, slightly offset by adjusted EBITDA down year over year.

1745,ADP,"A prudent investment decision involves buying well-performing stocks at the right time while selling those that are at risk. A rise in share price and strong fundamentals signal a stock’s bullish run.The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (IPG  -  Free Report) is a marketing and advertising services provider that has performed extremely well lately and has the potential to sustain the momentum in the near term. Consequently, if you haven’t taken advantage of the share price appreciation yet, it’s time you add the stock to your portfolio.What Makes Interpublic an Attractive Pick? An Outperformer: A glimpse of the company’s price trend reveals that the stock has had an impressive run on the bourse in the past six months. Shares of Interpublic have returned a massive 26.9%, which compares favorably with the industry’s gain of 7.1%. Solid Zacks Rank: Interpublic currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 offer the best investment opportunities for investors. Thus, the company appears to be a compelling investment proposition at the moment.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Northward Estimate Revisions: The direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Interpublic’s current-quarter earnings increased 13.5% to 42 cents per share. Estimates for 2018 increased 2.9% to $1.75 per share. For 2019, earnings have moved up 2.2% to $1.86 per share.Strong Growth Prospects: The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings indicates year-over-year growth of 24.1%. Moreover, earnings are expected to register 6.6% growth in 2019. The stock has long-term expected earnings per share growth rate of 6.7%.Growth FactorsStrong Business Model Interpublic’s digital capabilities, diversified business model and geographic reach offer a distinctive competitive advantage. The company is expected to achieve targeted levels in the coming quarters based on diversification across emerging regions and collaboration/integration across agencies through technological improvement. Moreover, the company continues to look for strategic investments/acquisitions to expand in high-growth regions and key world markets.Further, Interpublic looks strong on the back of higher organic revenue growth. In 2017, organic revenue growth of 1.8% was aided by growth across its major geographic regions, which was primarily a result of growth with existing clients. In the United States, organic growth was driven by its media and advertising disciplines. Internationally, organic increase can be attributed to strong growth within its media discipline, with remarkable contributions from Continental Europe and Other region, primarily Canada. In the first quarter, organic growth in the United States was 4.3% and 2.6% in international markets.Notably, in first-quarter 2018, organic growth resulted in a 3.6% increase in net revenues. It marked an improvement from 3.3% organic growth in fourth-quarter 2017. Further, the company expects organic growth to positively impact revenues by 2-3% in 2018.Encouraging Balance SheetInterpublic has a strong balance sheet driven by the management’s prudent moves. Interpublic generated cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $791 million in 2017. The company generated $881.8 million of cash from operating activities in 2017 compared with $512.8 million in 2016 and $688.5 million in 2015. The significant amount of cash provides it the flexibility to pursue any growth strategy. The company’s strong cash flow generating abilities make it a value buy for investors.Shareholder-Friendly MovesWe are impressed by Interpublic’s consistent efforts to return value to shareholders in the form of dividend and share repurchases. Interpublic paid dividends of $280.3 million, $238.4 million and $195.5 million,, respectively in 2017, 2016 and 2015. The company repurchased shares amounting to $300.1 million, $303.3 million and $285.2 million, in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.On Feb 14, 2018, the company’s board of directors announced a 17% dividend hike, raising the quarterly cash dividend to 21 cents per share. The company also approved another $300 million share repurchase plan, while using $55 million to repurchase 2.4 million shares in the first quarter of 2018. The company still has 400 million left on its outstanding repurchase authorization.Such moves indicate the company’s commitment to create value for shareholders and underline its confidence in its business. These shareholder-friendly initiatives not only instill investors’ confidence but also positively impact earnings per share.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation (DNB  -  Free Report), Automatic Data Processing (ADP  -  Free Report), and Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc. (BR  -  Free Report). All the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2.The long-term expected earnings per share growth rates for Dun & Bradstreet, Automatic Data Processing and Broadridge are 4.5%, 11% and 10%, respectively.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1746,ADP,"TransUnion’s (TRU  -  Free Report) subsidiary — TransUnion Healthcare — inked a deal to acquire Healthcare Payment Specialists (“HPS”). Based in Fort Worth, TX, Healthcare Payment Specialists assists healthcare service providers in boosting medical reimbursements. The deal is expected to be closed in the second quarter of 2018, subject to pending regulatory approvals.The deal, expected to boost TransUnion’s healthcare solutions services, will see the integration of TransUnion Healthcare’s Revenue Protection solutions with HPS’ innovative technology.TransUnion Healthcare’s Revenue Protection solutions help hospitals and other similar healthcare service providers prevent revenue leakage by engaging patients early in the financial process, ensuring the payment of earned revenues through identification and maximization ofreimbursement opportunities and optimization of collection strategies. This helps to streamline the processes and reduce costs. The company has successfully recovered more than $3 billion in cash for its entire client base, while working with more than 1500 hospitals and health systems.To maximize reimbursements, HPS focuses on payment areas with superior technology and deep domain expertise - which act as the key driving factors. Medicare Bad Debt (MBD) helps in identifying reimbursable bad debts. Medicare Disproportionate Share (DSH) helps serve low-income patients and raise their DSH reimbursement with multiple data sources.  HPS also offers complementary services in the areas of Transfer Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRG) and Indirect Medical Education/Shadow Billing.  We believe HPS’s product portfolio will perfectly complement TransUnion Healthcare in enhancing its Revenue Protection solutions. The merged entity is expected to provide greater returns to both providers and patients, with raised reimbursements. Further, it will aid in improving the patient’s financial experience..Growing Healthcare Services SuiteThe market for Medicare reimbursement optimization is showing strong growth, contributing 20% to total healthcare expenditures in the United States. Greater patient financial responsibility, focus on cost management and regulatory supervision are acting as key driving factors, enabling healthcare providers to rely on data and analytical tools to better manage their revenue growth.In view of the significant commercial opportunity offered by the market for healthcare operations, we believe that the proposed buyout of HPS is a prudent move by the company aimed at strengthening its healthcare operations. TransUnion’s U.S. Information Services (USIS) and Healthcare operating segments are aggregated into its USIS reportable segment. Under USIS, Decision Services (20% of USIS revenue) – a sub unit – recorded year-over-year revenue growth in 2017 and 2016 due to growth in the healthcare industry. For 2017, decision services revenues increased $36.3 million compared with 2016.To make the maximum out of this growing healthcare business, TransUnion continues to look for strategic investments/acquisitions. In 2016, the company completed two acquisitions, RTech Healthcare Revenue Technologies, Inc. and Auditz, LLC, which enhanced its domestic healthcare offerings in areas of revenue protection and identification and recovery of payments.Zacks Rank & Price PerformanceCurrently, TransUnion is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock.

1747,ADP,"Paylocity Holding (PCTY  -  Free Report) has an impressive earnings surprise history, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 220.1%.With expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 22% and a market cap of $3.03 billion, it seems to be a stock that investors need to retain in their portfolio if they are looking to reap long-term gains.Let’s take a look at the factors aiding the company’s performance.Paylocity, a provider of cloud-based payroll and human capital management (HCM) software solutions, is gaining from its regular investments in SaaS technology.Over the last few quarters, clients moving from traditional payroll service providers to the company’s SaaS-based services contributed significantly to its revenues. Hence, regular investments in technological upgrades, along with product innovation, will continue to boost the company’s top line.Notably, Paylocity stock has gained 30.2% in the last year, outperforming the industry’s rally of 27.7%.We believe that accelerated adoption of the company’s robust portfolio has aided the company’s financials. In third-quarter fiscal 2018, the company’s revenues came in at $113.4 million, reflecting an increase of 25.6% year over year and beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $111 million.Paylocity Holding Corporation Revenue (TTM) Paylocity Holding Corporation Revenue (TTM) | Paylocity Holding Corporation QuoteApart from the organic enrichment of the portfolio, management is extremely optimistic about the acquisition of BeneFLEX. This new buyout has added a host of benefit administration related solutions and is expected to drive its revenues further.However, competition in the payroll processing sector from existing players like Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP  -  Free Report), Paychex, Inc., (PAYX  -  Free Report) and Oracle Corporation (ORCL  -  Free Report) among others remains a major headwind. Increasing competition from new entrants also remains a threat.

1748,ADP,"Launched on 01/07/2014, the First Trust Rising Dividend Achievers ETF (RDVY  -  Free Report) is a smart beta exchange traded fund offering broad exposure to the Large Cap ETFs category of the U.S. equity market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?For a long time now, the ETF industry has been flooded with products based on market capitalization weighted indexes, which are designed to represent the broader market or a particular market segment.A good option for investors who believe in market efficiency, market cap weighted indexes offer a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns.On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.Based on specific fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such, these indexes attempt to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance.This area offers many different investment choices, such as simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies; however, not all of these strategies can deliver superior results.Fund Sponsor & IndexRDVY is managed by First Trust Advisors, and this fund has amassed over $488.72 M, which makes it one of the average sized ETFs in the Large Cap ETFs. This particular fund seeks to match the performance of the NASDAQ US Rising Dividend Achievers Index before fees and expenses.The Index is designed to provide access to a diversified portfolio of companies with a history of paying dividends.Cost & Other ExpensesWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor. And, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.50%, making it one of the more expensive products in the space.RDVY's 12-month trailing dividend yield is 1.33%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.Representing 29.50% of the portfolio, the fund has heaviest allocation to the Financials sector; Consumer Discretionary and Information Technology round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report) accounts for about 2.50% of total assets, followed by Best Buy Co., Inc. (BBY  -  Free Report) and Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP  -  Free Report).Its top 10 holdings account for approximately 22.2% of RDVY's total assets under management.Performance and RiskSo far this year, the ETF return is roughly 2.25%, and is up about 17.05% in the last one year (as of 05/18/2018). RDVY has traded between $26.49 and $31.88 in the past 52-week period.The ETF has a beta of 1.01 and standard deviation of 15.17% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium choice in the space.

1749,ADP,"A prudent investment decision involves buying stocks that have solid prospects and selling those that carry risks. At times, it is rational to hold certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions.Here we discuss about Navigant Consulting, Inc. (NCI  -  Free Report), a stock that has rallied 22.3% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s gain of 2.9%. We believe the stock has the potential to exceed expectations moving ahead. The reasons behind our optimism include the company’s strong segmental growth as well as benefits from acquisitions and hiring. The long-term expected earnings per share growth rate for the company is 13.5%.Let’s delve deep to unearth the reasons behind the company’s impressive price performance.Consistent Segmental GrowthNavigant’s investments in acquisition and hiring strengthened its Healthcare and Energy segment over time. Meanwhile, the demand for data analytics in healthcare across all markets has been increasing, given the access to new data as a result of the Affordable Care Act and new technologies.Also, acquisition of Cymetrix and RevenueMed has extended Navigant’s business process management service capabilities to hospitals and physician groups. These buyouts and related hiring complement the company’s traditional consulting services, besides providing it with more recurring revenue streams.Furthermore, the company has broadened its service offerings and expanded operations in important markets and geographies. Navigant has also grown its benchmarking, data and research services to offer a broad range of market research capabilities. In 2016, it acquired Ecofys Investments B.V., which proved conducive to the company. This buyout is helping Navigant to enhance its capacities in energy policy, energy systems and markets, urban energy, climate strategies and sustainability services.Navigant’s Disputes, Forensics and Legal Technology segment has strengthened over time backed by its continuous efforts to enhance services and expand global reach. Additionally, the Financial Services Advisory and Compliance segment has grown through senior hiring.Consistent Investment in TechnologyNavigant’s continuous investments in technology infrastructure and development programs should help in boosting its business organically. Technology investments are augmenting the company’s technology-based service offerings, thus enabling it to efficiently meet the changing demands of its clients.Development programs are aimed toward improving sales effectiveness and collaboration across the organization. Navigant’s other focus areas include employee development, talent management and mentoring programs.Bottom LineConsistent investments in technology, acquisitions and hiring are adding to Navigant’s ability to grow its business organically, thus making us confident about the stock’s performance. Zacks Rank and Key PicksNavigant has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Based in Sao Paulo, Brazil, Cappuccino is a digital marketing and technology agency. The financial terms of the deal have been kept under wraps.The deal, effective immediately, will see integration of Weber Shandwick's public relations and integrated marketing capabilities with Cappuccino's specialization in digital content, technology production and strategic planning.

Further, Cappuccino has already conducted digital campaigns for several top local and multinational organizations in Brazil, with clients like Ajinomoto, Arcor, Boeringher Ingelheim and Citi.With broader exposure to the Brazilian market, the buyout of Cappuccino should help Weber Shandwick strengthen its foothold across Latin America.

In 2016, a content creation and digital agency with offices in the United States and United Kingdom., a public relations and digital agency based in China and a U.K. based mobile focused digital agency were acquired.We believe the buyout of Cappuccino by its subsidiary is one of Interpublic’s several strategic business opportunities to boost its digital capabilities.Interpublic’s digital capabilities, diversified business model and geographic reach offer a distinctive competitive advantage.

1751,ADP,"A prudent investment decision involves buying stocks that have solid prospects and selling those that carry risks. At times, it is rational to hold certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions.Here we focus on Omnicom Group Inc. (OMC  -  Free Report), a stock with an expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 5.8%. Moreover, its earnings are expected to register 10.8% and 7.4% growth, respectively, in 2018 and 2019.The company has outperformed the S&P 500 in the past six months. Shares of Omnicom have gained 7.4% compared with the S&P 500’s rally of 4.9% in the said time frame. We believe the stock has the potential to exceed expectations moving ahead. The reasons behind our optimism include the company’s higher organic growth and benefits from strategic investments, acquisitions and expansion efforts.Robust Organic GrowthWe appreciate Omnicom’s continuous focus on its internal development initiatives. To increase efficiency, the company has been making internal investments in its agencies and back office operations. It has also raised its internal investments in data, analytics and precision marketing. Driven by such positives, we expect Omnicom to witness higher revenues on the back of organic growth.Notably, in first-quarter 2018, organic growth resulted in a 2.4% increase in total revenues. It marked an improvement from 1.6% organic growth in fourth-quarter 2017. Further, the company expects organic growth to positively impact revenues by 2-3% in 2018.Growing Digital and Analytical CapabilitiesOmnicom is expanding its suite in the areas of digital and analytical capabilities by investing in agencies and partnering with innovative technology companies in key markets.On Apr 16, 2018, Omnicom’s media services division, Omnicom Media Group announced a partnership with IRI. Per the deal, IRI will serve as a preferred consumer packaged goods (CPG) data provider for Omnicom Media Group’s data and analytics division, Annalect. In Germany, Omnicom media group acquired Brain Group, a digitally-focused agency for media planning, marketing and transformation consulting and content creation.Omnicom’s operations are diversified across technology platforms, thus lowering its dependence on any one product in these dynamic technological markets. The company’s efforts to stay technologically updated to meet varying customer and client demands in areas of digital media, data as well as analytics look impressive. All these initiatives augur well for the long-term growth and stability of the company.Encouraging Balance SheetManagement has executed well in the recent times. This has helped Omnicom build cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments balance of $3.79 billion in 2017. The company’s cash position has improved considerably in the past few years. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, the company had $3.02 billion, $2.62 billion and $2.39 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, respectively.The company generated $2.02 billion of cash from operating activities in 2017 compared with $1.95 billion in 2016. The significant amount of cash provides it the flexibility to pursue any growth strategy. The company’s strong cash flow generating abilities make it a value buy for investors.Shareholder-Friendly MovesWe are impressed with Omnicom’s consistent record of returning value to shareholders in the form of dividend and share repurchases. Omnicom paid dividends of $515.2 million, $505.4 million and $496.7 million to its shareholders, respectively in 2017, 2016 and 2015. The company repurchased shares amounting to $568.4 million, $602.2 million and $727.5 million, in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. During the period from 2008 through Mar 31, 2018, Omnicom distributed 106% of net income to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.Such moves indicate the company’s commitment to create value for shareholders and underline its confidence in its business. These shareholder-friendly initiatives not only instill investors’ confidence but also positively impact earnings per share.Bottom LineThe aforementioned factors positively impacted Omnicom’s performance in the last reported quarter. The company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 3.2%. We believe the upbeat performance will continue in the quarters ahead, thus giving investors enough reasons to remain optimistic on the stock. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current quarter earnings is pegged at $1.57, indicating year-over-year growth of 12.1%.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Omnicom has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1752,ADP,"The first-quarter reporting cycle has seen strong earnings and revenue growth, which is expected to reach its highest level in seven years.According to the latest Earnings Outlook, S&P 500 members from the Business Services sector have already reported financial numbers and recorded top- and bottom-line growth of 22.5% and 6.8%, respectively in the first quarter of 2018. The report also states that 80.8% surpassed revenue estimates and 88.5% outperformed on the earnings front.The sector benefited from a strong U.S. economy, reduced tax rates, robust manufacturing and non-manufacturing activities, easing of the U.S. dollar and momentum in oil prices. Notably, it has performed well in the past year compared with the benchmark. It has gained 25.3%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500’s rally of 19.9% in the said time frame.Given this backdrop, let’s do a comparative analysis of two Business - Information Services stocks - TransUnion (TRU  -  Free Report) and The Dun & Bradstreet (DNB  -  Free Report). Both companies reported better-than-expected first-quarter 2018 results with year-over-year earnings and revenue growth.As both carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), we are using certain other parameters to find out which company is better positioned following their earnings release. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Price PerformanceTransUnion clearly scores over Dun & Bradstreet in this regard. TransUnion has gained 65.7% in the past year, massively outperforming the industry’s rally of 28.8%. Dun & Bradstreet, on the other hand, has underperformed the industry with a gain of 17.9%.Earnings Estimate Revisions The direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock. Based on second quarter and full year earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days, TransUnion is better placed. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings increased 5.3% for TransUnion against a decrease of 0.7% for Dun & Bradstreet. For 2018, estimates for TransUnion and Dun & Bradstreet have increased 5.2% and 4.3%, respectively.Earnings ExpectationsEarnings growth along with stock price gains is often an indication of a company’s strong prospects. TransUnion’s second-quarter earnings are projected to grow 27.7% while that of Dun & Bradstreet are expected to increase 7.1%.  Looking at the full year 2018 picture, TransUnion’s earnings are projected to grow 29.4% while that of Dun & Bradstreet are expected to increase 15.1%.  Thus, TransUnion has an edge over Dun & Bradstreet in terms of quarterly and yearly projected earnings growth.Net Margin Net profit margin helps investors evaluate a company’s business model in terms of pricing policy, cost structure and operating efficiency, and shows how good it is at converting revenues into profits. Hence, a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors.Even though readings for both the companies compare unfavorably with the industry’s figure of 19.3%, TransUnion has a lead since its TTM net margin is higher at 17.6%, compared with Dun & Bradstreet’s 16%.ValuationThe Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E) metric is used to measure a company's value relative to its earnings. In general, a lower number or multiple is usually considered better than a higher one.The trailing 12-month price-to-earnings multiple for TransUnion and Dun & Bradstreet is 37 and 16.4, respectively, while that of the industry is 26.8. Dun & Bradstreet has an edge with a lower P/E ratio and is undervalued relative to the industry.The EV/EBITDA metric is used to compare two stocks within the same industry and offers a clearer picture of a company’s valuation because it includes debt. The ratio is often used in addition to the P/E ratio.We observe that while TransUnion and Dun & Bradstreet have EV/EBITDA ratios of 23.7 and 8.7 respectively, the industry’s figure stands at 17.4. Thus, Dun & Bradstreet is better positioned with a lower EV/EBITDA value and is undervalued relative to the industry.TransUnion is overvalued relative to the industry in terms of both the metrics.Bottom LineOur comparative analysis shows that TransUnion scores over Dun & Bradstreet in terms of net margin, expected earnings growth and earnings estimate revisions. Its share price performance over the past year has also been relatively better. Dun & Bradstreet has an edge solely in terms of valuation.So, even though TransUnion seems expensive compared to Dun & Bradstreet, it is likely to generate higher capital appreciation.Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include Automatic Data Processing (ADP  -  Free Report) and Broadridge Financial Solutions (BR  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2.The long-term expected earnings per share growth rates for Automatic Data Processing and Broadridge are 11% and 10%, respectively.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

1753,ADP,"Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP  -  Free Report) stock has rallied a massive 28.9% in the past year, outperforming the S&P 500’s gain of 13.7%. The company is well poised on the back of strategic acquisitions and strong cash generation ability. ADP’s focus on streamlining its business is a positive as this should strengthen its core operations in the long run. In third-quarter fiscal 2018, ADP posted impressive results with earnings and revenues surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increasing on a year-over-year basis.Adjusted earnings per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8 cents and increased 16% year over year. Revenues came in at $3.69 billion, outpacing the consensus mark by $26 million. The top line improved 8% on a reported basis and 6% on a constant-currency basis.In the reported quarter, the company witnessed revenue growth across all its segments and significant improvements in key performance indicators like new business bookings and Employer Services retention.Also, the company’s earnings surprise history has been impressive. It surpassed the consensus estimate in three of the previous four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 5.2%. For fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, the consensus estimate moved up 12.7% over the past 60 days.Strategic BuyoutsAcquisitions have played an important role in ADP’s growth. Through acquisitions like WorkMarket (in January 2018), Global Cash Card (in October 2017) and The Marcus Buckingham Company (in January 2017), the company has not only gained new customers but has also been able to expand its operations in international markets. We believe that the company will continue to pursue acquisitions that strategically fit its overall business mix and are easy to integrate over the long term.Business Improvement InitiativesADP has been continuously taking up initiatives to streamline its business. We believe this should help the company strengthen its core operations in the long run. In tune with this strategy, in the past few years, the company has divested a number of divisions including AdvancedMD, Procure-to-Pay business, Dealer Services, Occupational Health and Safety services and Taxware Enterprise Service.Strong Cash PositionThe company exited third-quarter fiscal 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of $2.3 billion. ADP’s strong cash position allows it to aggressively buy back shares and pay out dividends.As of Mar 31, 2018, ADP paid $278.4 million of dividend to its shareholders and repurchased $187.9 million of stock. Further, on Apr 11, 2018, ADP announced a dividend hike of 10%, raising its regular quarterly dividend to 69 cents per share.These shareholder-friendly initiatives not only instill investors’ confidence but also positively impact earnings per share.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, ADP has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Some other top-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include TriNet Group, Inc. (TNET  -  Free Report), Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc. (BR  -  Free Report) and The Brink’s Company (BCO  -  Free Report). While Trinet sports a Zacks Rank #1, Broadridge and Brink’s Company carry a Zacks Rank #2.

1754,ADP,"Xerox Corporation (XRX  -  Free Report) announced its decision to end the previously announced merger with Fuji Xerox due to a delay in the delivery of audited financials of Fuji Xerox by the stipulated date of Apr 15, 2018. The company also noted discrepancies in the audited and unaudited financial statements of Fuji Xerox.Fuji Xerox Co., Ltd. (“Fuji Xerox”) is a joint venture between Xerox and Fujifilm, wherein Fujifilm holds a 75% interest and Xerox holds the remaining 25% stake.Additionally, Xerox inked a new deal with its two investors – Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason – who together hold a 15% ownership stake in Xerox. The new settlement is expected to resolve the pending issue related to its 2018 annual shareholders’ meeting, along with the legal disputes against its directors in connection with the proposed combination with Fuji Xerox.Terms of the New DealFive new members namely Jonathan Christodoro, Keith Cozza, Nicholas Graziano, Scott Letier and John Visentin will be replacing Robert J. Keegan, Charles Prince, Ann N. Reese, William Curt Hunter and Stephen H. Rusckowski.Gregory Brown, Joseph Echevarria, Cheryl Krongard and Sara Martinez Tucker will continue to serve as members of Xerox’s board.Cozza — the former Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Icahn Enterprises L.P. — is likely to be the new chairman of Xerox. Visentin will be replacing Jeff Jacobson as the company’s new CEO.Additionally, Xerox and Icahn have agreed to withdraw their board candidates from the upcoming shareholder meeting.Course of EventsOn Jan 31, 2018, Xerox and FUJIFILM Holdings Corporation (“Fujifilm”) inked a definitive deal worth $6.1 billion to combine the Fuji Xerox joint venture with Xerox. Per the deal, Fujifilm would own 50.1% of the combined company.However, the company’s decision was challenged by its two largest shareholders - who not only claimed the Fujifilm deal to be undervalued but also demanded the resignation of the then CEO.In April 2018, the two investors won a court case and succeeded in temporarily blocking the Fujifilm deal. With the recent termination of the merger, it seems like they have finally won the battle. Not only did they settle for a new contract with Xerox but also succeeded in making necessary changes to its board of directors.Zacks Rank & Price PerformanceCurrently, Xerox is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

1755,ADP,"Automatic Data Processing Inc (ADP  -  Free Report) is set to release second-quarter 2018 results on Nov 31.Notably, ADP has a positive record of earnings surprises in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 4.5%. In the last quarter, ADP delivered a positive earnings surprise of 7.1%.ADP reported first-quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings of 91 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a nickel. The figure increased 5.8% from the year-ago quarter.Moreover, revenues of $3.08 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.06 billion and grew 5.6% on a year-over-year basis.Based on impressive first-quarter results, ADP raised fiscal 2018 guidance for revenues and earnings. The company anticipates fiscal 2018 revenue growth in the range of 6-8%, up from previous guidance of 5-6%. The Global Cash Card acquisition and the impacts from foreign currency translation are anticipated to add approximately one percentage point of growth to revenues.ADP expects adjusted earnings to grow in the range of 5-7%, up from 2-4%.Notably, the stock has returned 22.6% year over year, substantially outperforming the 15.1% rally of the industry.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 89 cents for the current quarter, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 2.3%. Further, Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $3.18 billion, up roughly 6.4% from the year-ago quarter.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors Likely to Impact Q2 ResultsThe first U.S. labor market data of 2018 has hit the tape, with the ADP private sector payroll read for December reaching 250K new jobs. This is well beyond the analysts were expectation of 195K. November’s tally was revised down, but only a tad: -5K to 185K. Notably, the employment environment remains consistently strong.Last quarter, PEO Services revenues increased 14% year over year to $903.6 million. Average worksite employees paid by PEO Services increased 10% to almost 484,000.For the PEO Services segment, management anticipates fiscal 2018 revenue growth of 11-13% and margin expansion of 25-50 bps. The Zacks consensus estimate for the PEO Services segment is $925 million.We note that ADP holds a dominant position in the payroll processing and human capital management (“HCM”) market, primarily owing to robust product portfolio. Moreover, with recent acquisition of WorkMarket, the company will be able to integrate human capital management tools with WorkMarket’s contingent workers platform, consequently enhancing its offerings.Nevertheless, we expect investments in new initiatives to continue to weigh on the company’s bottom-line results. Moreover, rising unemployment levels will negatively impact the company. Further, increasing competition is a major headwind.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

1756,ADP,"The much-anticipated monthly employment report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) was released today ahead of the opening bell, and the headline results, at first blush, look a little disappointing: 148K new non-farm payroll jobs were reportedly created in the month of December, beneath the analyst consensus of around 180K. The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.1%, a 17-year low.However, just because this jobs total did not hit consensus, it’s still tens of thousands of jobs to the positive — that is, the current U.S. labor market only needs around 80K-100K new jobs per month to keep growing. Further, we see a big upward revision in November’s BLS headline, from 228K initially reported to 252K this morning. That said, we see these gains offset by a downward revision in October: 244K to 211K. The important places to drill down into this data do reveal good news relative to the disappointing headline: Average Hourly Earnings, an important metric tracking long-dormant wage growth, rose 0.3% in December — up from the +0.1% in November and pushing the year-over-year tally to 2.5%. And with the recently passed tax cuts to corporations, at this level of near-full employment, we look toward wage growth increasing even further in the months to come. Healthcare, unsurprisingly, brought in 31K new jobs last month — it also led the ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) private sector jobs totals released yesterday. (ADP’s numbers were far higher than today’s BLS totals, however. These surveys tend to tack closer together over future revisions, and ADP is also known by some analysts to overstate December numbers, partially on holiday shopping season in the Retail space.) But importantly, Construction and Manufacturing — two sectors that have struggled to keep up with the rest of the economy over he past few years — gained 30K and 25K new jobs last month, respectively.Retail last month brought the biggest disappointment, losing 20K jobs in the month. Considering holiday shopping season, when retailers traditionally add temporary jobs in the stores for the influx of shoppers, this number seems like something of an anomaly. But take a look at Warehousing, +30K in December, and the view becomes a bit clearer: there is no bigger warehouser in America than Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), and no retailer sold more goods for the holidays.Also, unemployment for African Americans fell to 6.8% last month, reportedly the lowest in the history of he BLS report (1971). The U-6 (aka “real unemployment”) remained steady at 8.1%, also historically low. And the Labor Force Participation Rate equalled the previous month’s 62.7%.In short, there is plenty here to hang our economic hat on. Perhaps we’ll even see some positive revisions to the negative number in the Retail sector, who knows? In any case, not bad news for the market — especially considering unemployment holding steady at 4.1% is not expected to change anyone’s opinion at the Fed regarding interest rates at this point.
"
1757,ADP,"Friday, January 5, 2018The much-anticipated monthly employment report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) was released today ahead of the opening bell, and the headline results, at first blush, look a little disappointing: 148K new non-farm payroll jobs were reportedly created in the month of December, beneath the analyst consensus of around 180K. The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.1%, a 17-year low.However, just because this jobs total did not hit consensus, it’s still tens of thousands of jobs to the positive — that is, the current U.S. labor market only needs around 80K-100K new jobs per month to keep growing. Further, we see a big upward revision in November’s BLS headline, from 228K initially reported to 252K this morning. That said, we see these gains offset by a downward revision in October: 244K to 211K.The important places to drill down into this data do reveal good news relative to the disappointing headline: Average Hourly Earnings, an important metric tracking long-dormant wage growth, rose 0.3% in December — up from the +0.1% in November and pushing the year-over-year tally to 2.5%. And with the recently passed tax cuts to corporations, at this level of near-full employment, we look toward wage growth increasing even further in the months to come.Healthcare, unsurprisingly, brought in 31K new jobs last month — it also led the ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) private sector jobs totals released yesterday. (ADP’s numbers were far higher than today’s BLS totals, however. These surveys tend to tack closer together over future revisions, and ADP is also known by some analysts to overstate December numbers, partially on holiday shopping season in the Retail space.) But importantly, Construction and Manufacturing — two sectors that have struggled to keep up with the rest of the economy over he past few years — gained 30K and 25K new jobs last month, respectively.Retail last month brought the biggest disappointment, losing 20K jobs in the month. Considering holiday shopping season, when retailers traditionally add temporary jobs in the stores for the influx of shoppers, this number seems like something of an anomaly. But take a look at Warehousing, +30K in December, and the view becomes a bit clearer: there is no bigger warehouser in America than Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), and no retailer sold more goods for the holidays.Also, unemployment for African Americans fell to 6.8% last month, reportedly the lowest in the history of he BLS report (1971). The U-6 (aka “real unemployment”) remained steady at 8.1%, also historically low. And the Labor Force Participation Rate equalled the previous month’s 62.7%.In short, there is plenty here to hang our economic hat on. Perhaps we’ll even see some positive revisions to the negative number in the Retail sector, who knows? In any case, not bad news for the market — especially considering unemployment holding steady at 4.1% is not expected to change anyone’s opinion at the Fed regarding interest rates at this point.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

(ADP  -  Free Report). This was also quite better than November’s revised number of 185,000.Coming to earnings, the exact earnings impact of the tax legislation will become clear once it is signed into law, but preliminary estimates suggest a material earnings boost. S&P 500 earnings in 2018 are already expected to be up 11.7%, with the growth pace expected to roughly double as a result of the tax legislation. Solid job creations in the private sector and strong earnings outlook boosted sentiment.Additionally, out of the 11 key S&P 500 sectors, eight of them managed to close in the green. The Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) advanced 1%, becoming the biggest gainer among the S&P 500 sectors. Some of its key holdings including The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

1760,ADP,"Shares of Intuit Inc. (INTU  -  Free Report), a business and financial software company, have been performing well of late.If you haven’t taken advantage of the share price appreciation yet, its time you hold the stock in your portfolio as it looks promising and is poised to carry the momentum ahead. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has an estimated long-term earnings growth rate of 14.1%.Estimates NorthboundEstimates for Intuithave moved up in the last 30 days, reflecting the optimistic outlook of analysts. The earnings estimates for fiscal 2018 and 2019 have gone up in the last 30 days.For fiscal 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has gone up by 1 cent in the last 30 days and is pegged at $4.97. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2019 also moved north by 3 cents to $5.58.Positive Earnings Surprise HistoryIntuit outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, recording an encouraging positive average earnings surprise of 37.5%.Ahead of the IndustryIntuit stock has gained 32.1% year over year, outperforming 31.2% rally of the industry it belongs to.Upbeat Q1Intuit delivered stellar first-quarter fiscal 2018 results. The company reported non-GAAP income (excluding stock-based compensation, amortization and other one-time items) from continuing operations of 11 cents per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 5 cents.This tax-preparation related software maker reported revenues of $886 million, which came ahead of management’s guided range of $840-$860 million and also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $855 million. On a year-over-year basis, revenues were up 13.9% primarily owing to better-than-expected growth in QuickBooks Online and ecosystem along with new and improved products.Strong GuidanceFor the second quarter, the company anticipates revenues in a range of $1.160-$1.180 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $1.12 billion. The company anticipates reporting non-GAAP earnings in the band of 31-34 cents per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at 31 cents per share.For fiscal 2018, the company still expects revenues of $5.640-$5.740 billion, representing an increase of 9-11% year over year.

The company currently trades at a forward P/E multiple of 30.5x, significantly lower than the industry’s average of 56.2x.

Therefore, the lower the P/E of a stock, the better it is for a value investor.Growth DriversWe are positive about Intuit’s growing SMB exposure and believe that its strategic acquisitions will boost the segment. Increased adoption of its cloud-based services and products is another positive.The company has also restructured business to focus on the QuickBooks services. It expects to continue investing in this portfolio, which might hurt near-term profitability.However, stiff competition from payroll solution providers such as Paycom Software Inc. (PAYC  -  Free Report) and Automatic Data Processing (ADP  -  Free Report) is a concern, especially considering the seasonality of Intuit’s tax business and the ongoing economic uncertainty.A better-ranked stock in the broader technology include NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1761,ADP,"Yesterday before the opening bell, the first indictments and first conviction in the Russia collusion scandal in the 2016 U.S. presidential election helped pump the brakes on the extended bull-market rally. Trump’s former campaign manager and a long-time aide face 12 grand jury charges, while a low-level Trump campaign operative has already pled guilty to lying to the FBI. Stock market indexes closed lower Monday, following seven straight up weeks.Whether or not this becomes an albatross on the stock market depends greatly on one’s perspective: Zacks Exec VP Kevin Matras, in his latest Profit from the Pros column this morning, sees the Paul Manafort indictments as little more than a temporary distraction. Those who believe Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller is likely to end his investigation soon and has already exhausted his findings will likely feel the same way: nothing more than a blip, a market breather. Though there does seem to be a greater risk hovering that the Mueller investigation is not wrapping up but just beginning to unfold. If such is the case, market participants may be more trepidatious moving forward.Not today, though: futures for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 are all up in Halloween Tuesday’s pre-market. Far from being spooked, or fear of a “trick,” traders and investors are apparently looking for plenty of “treats.”With good reason, as well: while the Case-Shiller August home sales report is expected to bring 6% growth in U.S. home sales (this is a trailing indicator, but is considered to be the most sound housing data economists see regularly), the Paychex small-business report this morning demonstrates the most stable quarter in the history of the small business index. Though jobs growth has begun to slow, wage increases look to be keeping pace with economic growth. Minneapolis, Denver and Seattle were among the cities seeing the strongest small business growth.And jobs data is expected to be strong, both tomorrow with the private-sector ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) payroll report and Friday’s all-encompassing non-farm payroll report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Even with a hurricane-affected quarter, jobs growth is expected to remain robust, with unemployment remaining around a low-to-mid 4% range, indicative of a very strong domestic labor market.Q3 Earnings RoundupAfter the bell we expect to hear from U.S. Steel (X  -  Free Report) and Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report), but ahead of the opening bell we see plenty of strength in Q3 performance:Mastercard (MA  -  Free Report) outperformed earnings and revenue estimates, posting $1.34 per share on revenues of $3.4 billion topping the $1.23 per share and $3.3 billion expected. Quarterly sales rose 18% year over year, with higher switched transactions in the quarter and cross-border volumes up 15%. Shares are up 1.7% at this hour in the pre-market.BP (BP  -  Free Report) also trounced expectations, reporting 57 cents per share on $60.81 billion in quarterly sales, which easily beat the $8.04 billion in the Zacks consensus estimate. Oil production year over year was up 16.4%, and shares of BP rose 2.5% initially upon the quarterly news.Other earnings beats this morning include pharma giant Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) and consumer staples major Kellogg (K), which both beat earnings expectations. Pfizer was in-line on its top-line, while Kellogg outperformed our consensus. Both stocks are trading up in today’s pre-market.Under Armour , however, is a much different story: although earnings of 22 cents per share beat estimates by 4 cents, quarterly sales posted a miss. More importantly, revenue and sales guidance were both pointed lower on lower North American demand and other operational challenges. UA stock, which had already fallen more than 40% year to date, are another 14.5% lower ahead of the opening bell.

1763,ADP,"A week from today, Wall Street turns open the spigots on Q3 earnings season, with some of its biggest banks reporting quarterly results, followed by three weeks of a constant barrage of earnings data. For today, we will have to be satisfied with several points of reference on the economy, including jobless claims and forthcoming speeches from Fed officials. Oh, and one big earnings beat, which came out ahead of today’s opening bell.Constellation Brands Blasts OffGlobal adult beverage distributor Constellation Brands (STZ  -  Free Report) posted a big beat in today’s pre-market, putting up earnings of $2.47 per share that easily topped the$2.16 in the Zacks consensus. This also represents EPS up 40% from this quarter — fiscal Q2 2018, BTW — on $2.08 billion in revenues, which beat consensus and are up 3.1% year over year. Solid growth in its beer business was cited in the earnings report.Constellation Brands has also raised guidance for fiscal 2018 quite notably: the new EPS range of $8.25-8.40 is a big boost from the previous estimate of $7.90-8.10. The company expects beer sales to continue to grow 9-11% through the remainder of fiscal 2018.

1764,ADP,"Thursday, October 5, 2017A week from today, Wall Street turns open the spigots on Q3 earnings season, with some of its biggest banks reporting quarterly results, followed by three weeks of a constant barrage of earnings data. For today, we will have to be satisfied with several points of reference on the economy, including jobless claims and forthcoming speeches from Fed officials. Oh, and one big earnings beat, which came out ahead of today’s opening bell.Constellation Brands Blasts OffGlobal adult beverage distributor Constellation Brands (STZ  -  Free Report) posted a big beat in today’s pre-market, putting up earnings of $2.47 per share that easily topped the$2.16 in the Zacks consensus. This also represents EPS up 40% from this quarter — fiscal Q2 2018, BTW — on $2.08 billion in revenues, which beat consensus and are up 3.1% year over year. Solid growth in its beer business was cited in the earnings report.Constellation Brands has also raised guidance for fiscal 2018 quite notably: the new EPS range of $8.25-8.40 is a big boost from the previous estimate of $7.90-8.10. The company expects beer sales to continue to grow 9-11% through the remainder of fiscal 2018.

1765,ADP,"At times, it is prudent to hold on to certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions.Paychex Inc. (PAYX  -  Free Report) seems to be one such stock, which investors should hold on to if they are looking to reap long-term benefits. Though the stock is facing a few headwinds at the moment, these are transitory in nature. There is enough scope for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to rebound in the long run.Notably, the stock has returned 9.9% in the last three months, outperforming 7.3% growth recorded by the industry.Growth DriversThere were a plenty of reasons behind the company’s upsurge, which includes a better-than-expected first-quarter result and upbeat fiscal 2018 guidance.The company reported non-GAAP earnings per share of 62 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents and grew 11% year over year. The upside mainly stemmed from higher revenues and efficient cost management.Paychex reported total revenues (including interest on funds held for clients) of $816.8 million, up 4% year over year. Excluding interest on funds held for its clients, total services revenues (Payroll service and Human Resource Services) ascended 4% year over year to $803.1 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $816 million.Buoyed by splendid fiscal first-quarter results, the company raised revenue outlook. The company now anticipates total revenues to jump 6%, up from the previous estimate of 5%. This translates to revenues of $3.34 billion, which is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.31 billion.Human Resource Services revenues are now projected to grow in the range of 12-14%, up from 8-10% projected earlier.All other guidance provided during fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results remained unchanged. Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be up in the range of 7-8%, which comes to $2.35-$2.38. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $2.37.Going forward, Paychex’s investments in product development, technology and focus on building its sales force to support revenue growth boost optimism. We also believe the company’s expansion initiatives, such as joint ventures and acquisitions, are likely to support its long-term growth strategy.Product launches are likely to be the other growth drivers. Further, Paychex’s focus on small and mid-sized businesses looking for HR solutions could provide growth opportunities.Additionally, its continuous share buybacks bode well for investors. The company has an expected EPS growth rate of 7.8%. Notably, the stock has delivered positive earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 2.2%.Risks PersistHowever, unfavorable interest rates and competition from Automatic Data Processing (ADP  -  Free Report) and Insperity (NSP  -  Free Report) remain key concerns.Our TakeWe expect the aforementioned factors to help the company sustain strong momentum and stay afloat amid difficult times.

1766,ADP,"As is typical for the first Wednesday in each month, a National Employment Report from national paycheck cutter Automated Data Processing (ADP  -  Free Report) revealed a negative impact from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma in September hiring trends. A total of 135K new private-sector jobs is the lowest since the glaringly low 62K in October 2016, and well under the trailing-12-month average of 218K per.Small businesses, especially those with under 20 employees, were the hardest hit in September — think Mom & Pop gas stations, for instance — losing 7000 jobs last month, 11K for just those smallest companies. For the second month in a row, the U.S.’s largest firms have tallied the highest number of new jobs: 79K. Medium-sized companies (50-499 employees) brought in 63K last month.The Goods/Services mix was a little closer than usual: Goods-producing firms saw gains of 48K new private-sector employment, and Services grew by 88K. Typically, Services job growth is at an even greater than 2-to-1 ratio month by month. This would suggest small-company services employment has been most affected by the dual hurricane onslaught in Southeastern Texas and the Florida Gulf Coast in September.To tie this up with a nice, tidy bow, Moody’s Chief Economist Mark Zandi added credibility to the labor market having been hit by two of the biggest natural disasters in U.S. history. “Hurricanes Harvey and Irma hurt the job market in September,” Zandi is quoted as saying this morning. “Looking through the storms the job market remains sturdy and strong."" So that’s the good news — though the loss of humanity is devastating for many as a result of Harvey and Irma, we may chalk them up to a one-time event affecting September (and, by extension, Q3 overall) but nothing necessarily beyond this.We will focus our attention on the all-encompassing non-farm payroll report due out Friday morning, ahead of the opening bell. Prior to ADP’s 135K total this morning, analysts had been predicting roughly 156K new jobs gains for non-farm payrolls in the month of September, or about the same as was reported for the month of August. Again, these represent a dip below a trailing-12-month average, but most economists aren’t sweating this, as hurricane-related issues look to have been the culprit.Pepsi Beats on Earnings, Revenues MissQ3 earnings season continues its slow trickle this week, with snacks and refreshment giant PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) posting mixed results in its quarterly earnings report. Earnings of $1.48 per share beat the Sacks consensus by 6 cents, up 4.2% year over year. Quarterly sales, however, posted $16.24 billion, a 1.3% increase year over year but beneath the $16.42 billion expected.Guidance from Pepsi was also mixed: where EPS guidance was raised 10 cents to $5.23 per share, but full-year organic revenue growth is only expected to rise 2.3% — lower than the 3% previously predicted. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s stock is trading down more than 1% in today’s pre-market; PEP is up year to date, but down over the past month and trailing 6 months.

1767,ADP,"Thursday, January 4, 2018The first U.S. labor market data of 2018 has hit the tape before the opening bell this morning, with the ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) private sector payroll read for December reaching 250K new jobs. This is well beyond the 195K analysts were expecting. November’s tally was revised down, but only a tad: -5K to 185K. We remain consistent with a very strong employment environment.Unsurprisingly, Services easily outpaced Goods-producing jobs — 222K to 28K, respectively. Medium-sized businesses (50-499 employees) brought in the most jobs at 100K, followed by 96K from Small companies, with Large corporations picking up the rear with 56K. Likely we’re seeing a lot of seasonal employment in these numbers from December’s holiday shopping season, but even still: strength all around.Education/Healthcare grew by 50K new jobs, followed by Trade/Transportation at 45K and Leisure/Hospitality at 28K. Even the long-dormant Construction and Manufacturing brought in relatively healthy numbers with 16K and 9K, respectively.Looking at holiday shopping totals, we see stronger-than-expected results from both Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), up 1.1% in holiday sales comps, and J.C. Penney (JCP  -  Free Report), up 3.4%. For both companies, these sorts of positive comps are rare, and with new tax cuts for the big-box retailers, both are cranking up earnings estimates for next fiscal year.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA  -  Free Report) reported top- and bottom-line beats on its Q1 2018 estimates in today’s pre-market, as well. Earnings topped expectations by a penny to $1.28 per share, up 16.4% year over year. Revenues grew to $30.74 billion, hotter than the $30.33 billion anticipated and up 7.9% year over year. For more on WBA’s earnings, click here.Finally, fresh Initial Jobless Claims numbers hit the early-morning tape today, and these numbers were higher than expected: +250K new claims were up 3,000 from the previous week’s slightly upwardly revised total of 245K. This is at the top of our non-hurricane-related jobless claims range we’ve seen over the past dozen quarters or more. Continuing claims, however, fell lower again from 1.951 million two weeks ago to 1.914 million last week. We remain under the psychologically satisfying 2 million jobless claims figure.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

1768,ADP,"Robert Half International Inc. (RHI  -  Free Report) released updates about the impact of the recent tax reforms on its business operations. The company has declared reductions in the bottom-line projections for fourth-quarter 2017, thanks to anticipated non-cash charges against provision for income taxes. Robert half expects incurring the charges as a result of the provisions enlisted under the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA).Per the recent tax reforms, Robert Half expects one-time charges of approximately $34-38 million (amounting to nearly 27-31 cents per share) to its provision for income taxes. Consequently, earnings are now estimated in the range of 29-39 cents, which marks a substantial decline from the previous range of 60-66 cents.Further, the company has also released updates regarding the effective tax rate for 2018, in relation to the recent enactments under the TCJA.  Robert Half now expects effective tax rates in the range of 26-28%. Notably, management’s tax projection for 2018 is pegged below the forecast for fourth-quarter 2017. Incidentally, during the third-quarter conference call, management projected effective tax rate for fourth-quarter 2017 to be approximately 37%.Reduced tax rates for 2018 are likely to boost the company’s bottom line. Also, greater retention of profits will help the company allocate more funds toward corporate reformation and development efforts.Can TCJA Improve Hiring Market Conditions?It is not certain whether the ongoing tax reforms will lead to higher wages for workers in the United States. However, such moves are expected to create more jobs owing to positive impacts on the economic conditions. The benefits from lower tax rates may propel companies to allocate more capital for increasing headcount to support business growth. The above-mentioned factors can significantly bolster Robert Half’s business in the forthcoming periods.  While Robert Half’s U.S. revenues were soft in the third quarter, management noted that hiring market trends started improving in September and continued till October. Evidently, temporary and consulting staffing revenues grew 2.1% in September and 2% in the first two weeks of October. Also, permanent placement revenues advanced 7.2% in September and surged 21% in the first three weeks of October.  These factors along with an overall improved economic scenario in the United States, encourages management about business growth. Such positive trends have been boosting investor’s optimism in the stock. In the past six months shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have returned 16%, almost in line with the industry’s rally of 16.2%.Looking For More?

1769,ADP,"On Dec 12, we issued an updated research report on Paychex, Inc. (PAYX  -  Free Report). Strong domain expertise in human capital management solutions for payroll, HR, retirement, and insurance services has been a key growth factor for the company. This has increased the company’s clientele and driven revenues northward. Notably, the company’s top line is expected to witness a 5-year (2012-2017) CAGR of 7.2%.Paychex stock has gained 14.0% year to date, outperforming the 11.3% rally of the industry it belongs to.However we are apprehensive about a declining rate of client retention over the last few quarters, which might affect the company’s performance in the near term.Key Factors Influencing the StockPaychex’s investments in product development, technology and focus on building its sales force to support revenue growth are tailwinds. Further, product launches and joint venture initiatives are likely to drive long-term growth. Also, its continuous share buybacks bode well for investors.Notably, the company’s initiatives to enrich its product portfolio via acquisitions have also proved beneficial. With 14 acquisitions since its inception, Paychex has significantly improved its solutions suite and total addressable market (TAM). These have also acted as revenue boosters.Paychex, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Paychex, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Paychex, Inc. QuoteMoreover, the growth potential of the industry that Paychex caters to is high. Per the company, half of its total addressable market is still untapped.However, the company is facing problems in retaining its customer base for the last few quarters, which is a major concern. During the last quarter, the company’s payroll client base remained flat due to a challenging demand environment and modest decline in retention. The client base was adversely affected by political uncertainty, which in turn impacted outsourcing-decision making in the mid-market.Additionally, increasing competition from industry peers like Automatic Data Processing (ADP  -  Free Report) and Insperity (NSP  -  Free Report) is another key concern.Zacks Rank and Stock to ConsiderPaychex has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A top-ranked stock worth considering in the sector is Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Long-term expected EPS growth rate for Intel is projected to be 8.42%.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

1770,ADP,"The labor market added jobs at a strong clip in November and has moved past a couple of months of hurricane disorders. Record low unemployment rate also reflected the strength in the labor market. Increase in average work week, in the meantime, suggests the possibility of increased hiring in the near term.Staffing companies stand to gain from the strengthening labor market, while President Donald Trump’s tax cut proposal will lift the economy and boost wages. Thus, investing in such companies seems prudent.Strong Hiring ShowU.S. employers added 228,000 jobs in November, steering past expectations of 200,000. In fact, job additions in the U.S. economy topped the 200,000 mark for the second straight month, reflecting a bounce back after hurricanes in Texas and Florida affected hiring in September.Construction jobs, which fluctuate depending on weather conditions, increased by 24,000. Home building recovered significantly from storm-related disturbances. Manufacturing payrolls gained 31,000, while health care and professional and business services showed steady gains. Restaurants and bars, which have seen the highest payroll gains in the last two months due to storms, added 18,900 workers. Job additions were, in fact, broad-based with white-collar firms and educational organizations contributing the maximum at about 54,000.Private Sector Adds JobsPrivate employment, in the meantime, added 221,000 jobs last month after 247,000 in the prior month, according to the Labor Department.Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP  -  Free Report), however, reported that employment in the private sector rose by 190,000 in November, with the manufacturing sector adding the maximum number of jobs in at least 15 years. Service-sector also saw job additions, with education and health services, and professional and business services leading the advance. Nonetheless, both the agencies reported healthy private sector job additions.Jobless Rate Drops, Average Work Week RisesThe unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.1% in November and continues to remain at a 17-year low. The U6 unemployment rate was 8% last month, up from 7.9% in the prior month. But, the broadest measure of unemployment and underemployment remained near the lowest since 2006.Average workweek for American workers, in the meanwhile, edged up to 34.5 hours from 34.4. The average workweek for all workers rose to a five-month high, which indicated that companies are making existing employees work harder that may ultimately lead to hiring of more permanent staffers.Trump’s Tax-Cut Proposal to Boost WagesAverage hourly earnings rose by 5 cents to $26.55, while the annual gain increased to 2.5% from 2.4%. But, yearly growth continues to hover around 2.5% for well over a year. Nonetheless, Trump administration’s initiative to overhaul the tax code and increase infrastructure spending will spur growth and eventually boost wage growth.The Senate has already voted 51-49 to approve the Republican tax bill. The bill trims the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, marking the biggest one-time drop in big business tax rates.4 Staffing Picks for a Healthy Labor MarketThe latest job numbers bode well for staffing companies. Meanwhile, Trump had earlier met chief executives of the country’s biggest manufacturers and pledged to return jobs to millions in the United States. The buoyancy in the staffing space is also confirmed by its solid Zacks Industry Rank in the top 24%, indicating continued hiring and more job opportunities. In fact, the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.We have, thus, selected four staffing stocks that boast a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and are well positioned to grow in the near term.Heidrick & Struggles International, Inc. (HSII  -  Free Report) — a Zacks Rank #1 company — provides executive search, culture shaping and leadership consulting services. The company enables its clients to build leadership teams by facilitating the recruitment, management and deployment of senior executives. The company has an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 0.9%. The stock’s expected growth rate for the next year is 892%, way higher than the industry’s projected gain of 13.9%.Kelly Services, Inc. (KELYA  -  Free Report) provides workforce solutions to various industries worldwide and is headquartered in Troy, MI. Currently, the company has a Zacks Rank #1. It has an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 65.9%. The stock’s expected growth rate for the current year is 30.8%, higher than the industry’s projected gain of 8.2%. Kelly Services’ earnings are set to grow next year. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.DLH Holdings Corp.

The company’s earnings are poised to grow in 2018.Randstad Holding NV (RANJY  -  Free Report) is a staffing and recruitment company that provides solutions in the field of flexible work and human resources (HR) services.

The stock’s expected growth rate for the current year is 16.3%, higher than the industry’s projected gain of 8.2%. The company’s earnings are set to grow 11.1% in 2018.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over.

1771,ADP,"Wednesday, December 6, 2017More good economic news hits the tape ahead of the opening bell today, with ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) private sector payroll numbers coming out better than expectations. November new private-sector jobs came in at 190K, better than the 175K expected. True, this is down a bit from October’s unrevised 235K, but that number retained some of the labor force volatility from the previous month’s hurricane activity (September jobs were way down, October way up).The current analyst consensus for Friday’s BLS non-farm payroll report is for 195K new jobs from November. These numbers between ADP and BLS don’t always correlate in real time, but with future revisions the tend to tell the same story. And any number north of 100K — the amount of new labor participants added each month — shows further strengthening within the U.S. jobs market.Typically, Services brought in more than 3x the number of jobs in Goods producing: 155K versus 36K. Medium-sized companies (50-499 employees) grew the most with 99K new jobs, followed by small companies (<50) with 50K and large firms (500+) at 41K. Leading sectors were Education/Healthcare (+54K) and a surprisingly strong Manufacturing (+40K) and Trade/Transportation (+36K). In another surprise, Construction actually lost jobs in the month (-4K), even with all the housing demand and further recovery from the hurricanes.Q3 ProductivityThe final read on Q3 Productivity has also come out this morning, with 3% staying unrevised from the previous month. A solid number, even though expectations were for a slightly higher revision. Labor costs, however, were revised way down: from +0.5% in the last read to -0.2% in the final read. This is not good news for what economists have been saying for a long time about wage growth needing to get stronger; in Q3, wage growth actually went backwards.Enter the tax cut proposal, which promises to increase wages based on trickle-down economic theory. Yet with an unemployment rate trending down — 4.1% for the last BLS report, and eyeing sub-4% in the near future, if today’s ADP numbers have merit — adding $1.5 trillion in deficit-financed tax cuts could cause the U.S. market to overheat, sparking a big jump in inflation and causing interest rates to spike.

1772,ADP,"Wednesday, October 4, 2017As is typical for the first Wednesday in each month, a National Employment Report from national paycheck cutter Automated Data Processing (ADP  -  Free Report) revealed a negative impact from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma in September hiring trends. A total of 135K new private-sector jobs is the lowest since the glaringly low 62K in October 2016, and well under the trailing-12-month average of 218K per.Small businesses, especially those with under 20 employees, were the hardest hit in September — think Mom & Pop gas stations, for instance — losing 7000 jobs last month, 11K for just those smallest companies. For the second month in a row, the U.S.’s largest firms have tallied the highest number of new jobs: 79K. Medium-sized companies (50-499 employees) brought in 63K last month.The Goods/Services mix was a little closer than usual: Goods-producing firms saw gains of 48K new private-sector employment, and Services grew by 88K. Typically, Services job growth is at an even greater than 2-to-1 ratio month by month. This would suggest small-company services employment has been most affected by the dual hurricane onslaught in Southeastern Texas and the Florida Gulf Coast in September.To tie this up with a nice, tidy bow, Moody’s Chief Economist Mark Zandi added credibility to the labor market having been hit by two of the biggest natural disasters in U.S. history. “Hurricanes Harvey and Irma hurt the job market in September,” Zandi is quoted as saying this morning. “Looking through the storms the job market remains sturdy and strong."" So that’s the good news — though the loss of humanity is devastating for many as a result of Harvey and Irma, we may chalk them up to a one-time event affecting September (and, by extension, Q3 overall) but nothing necessarily beyond this.We will focus our attention on the all-encompassing non-farm payroll report due out Friday morning, ahead of the opening bell. Prior to ADP’s 135K total this morning, analysts had been predicting roughly 156K new jobs gains for non-farm payrolls in the month of September, or about the same as was reported for the month of August. Again, these represent a dip below a trailing-12-month average, but most economists aren’t sweating this, as hurricane-related issues look to have been the culprit.Pepsi Beats on Earnings, Revenues MissQ3 earnings season continues its slow trickle this week, with snacks and refreshment giant PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) posting mixed results in its quarterly earnings report. Earnings of $1.48 per share beat the Sacks consensus by 6 cents, up 4.2% year over year. Quarterly sales, however, posted $16.24 billion, a 1.3% increase year over year but beneath the $16.42 billion expected.Guidance from Pepsi was also mixed: where EPS guidance was raised 10 cents to $5.23 per share, but full-year organic revenue growth is only expected to rise 2.3% — lower than the 3% previously predicted. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s stock is trading down more than 1% in today’s pre-market; PEP is up year to date, but down over the past month and trailing 6 months.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

1773,ADP,"Automatic Data Processing Inc (ADP  -  Free Report) is set to release first-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings on Nov 2.Notably, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 5.65%. Last quarter, ADP delivered a negative earnings surprise of 2.99%.Adjusted earnings of 66 cents per share increased 4% on a year-over-year basis on revenues of $3.07 billion, which increased 5.7%.Notably, the stock has returned 13.8% year to date, substantially outperforming the 6.7% rally of the industry.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key Factors to Watch ForADP’s top-line growth is anticipated to be 5% in the quarter, which is in the lower end of its 5-6% growth forecast for fiscal 2018. We expect improving bookings to positively affect revenues along with strong growth in the Professional Employer Organization (PEO) Services segment.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $3.06 million. The consensus estimate for the PEO Services segment is $892 million. Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Automatic Data Processing, Inc. QuoteHowever, elevated spending on service and sales along with the charges related to Service Alignment Initiative will keep margins under pressure in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Moreover, higher tax rate will also dent profitability.Further, the ongoing proxy fight with Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square will remain an overhang on the stock.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that ADP is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: ADP’s Earnings ESP is -0.35%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: ADP carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which when combined with a -0.35% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Kemet Corporation (KEM  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +7.46% and sports a Zacks Rank #1.

1776,ADP,"Paychex Inc. (PAYX  -  Free Report) commenced fiscal 2018 on an impressive note, reporting solid results for the fiscal first quarter, wherein the top and bottom lines, both, came ahead of the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. Moreover, the company registered year-over year improvement on both the counts.The company reported non-GAAP earnings per share of 62 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents and grew 11% year over year. The upside mainly stemmed from higher revenues and efficient cost management.Shares of Paychex were trading up nearly 5% at the time of posting this blog. Notably, the stock has returned 10.3% in the last three months, outperforming 6.1% growth recorded by the industry.Quarter DetailsPaychex reported total revenues (including interest on funds held for clients) of $816.8 million, up 4% year over year. Excluding interest on funds held for its clients, total services revenues (Payroll service and Human Resource Services) ascended 4% year over year to $803.1 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $816 million.Payroll Service segment revenues went up 2% from the year-ago period to $457.8 million, primarily on the back of higher revenues per check and client base.Human Resource Services segment revenues rose 7% year over year to $345.3 million, chiefly driven by strong growth in client base and worksite employees, elevated revenues from retirement, as well as online HR administration services. The growth was partially offset by tough comparisons wherein the segment’s revenues benefited from the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.Interest on funds held for clients increased 14% on a year-over-year basis to $13.7 million, mainly benefiting from higher average interest rates earned.Paychex’s total expenses flared up 2% from the year-ago tally to $471.8 million due to increased investments in technology and PEO business. Acquisition related expenses also contributed to this increase. However, total expenses, as a percentage of total revenues, contracted 110 basis points (bps) to 57.8%.The company’s operating income grew 7% year over year to $345 million. In addition, Paychex’s operating margin expanded 110 bps to 42.2%, chiefly driven by lower total expenses as a percentage of revenues.Net income came in at $227.8 million, up from $217.4 million reported in the prior-year quarter.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowPaychex exited the fiscal first quarter with cash, cash equivalents and corporate investments of $368.2 million compared with $323.4 million recorded at the end of the previous quarter. The company has no long-term debt. It generated operating cash flow of $343.6 million during the reported quarter.During the quarter, Paychex paid $179.1 million as dividend and repurchased shares worth $94.1 million.GuidanceBuoyed by splendid fiscal first-quarter results, the company raised its revenues outlook. The company now anticipates total revenues to jump 6%, up from the previous estimate of 5%. This translates to revenues of $3.34 billion, which is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.31 billion.Human Resource Services revenues are now projected to grow in the range of 12-14%, up from 8-10% projected earlier.Apart from this, the company revised its guidance for operating margin and effective tax rate. Operating margin is anticipated to be between 39% and 40% compared with the previous guidance of approximately 40%. Effective income tax rate is now projected to be in the band of 35-35.5%, down from the previous estimate of 35.5-36%.All other guidance provided during fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results remained unchanged. Management expects Payroll Service revenues to climb year over year in the range of 1-2%, while Interest on funds held for clients and investment income is expected to grow in the mid-to-upper-teen range.Net income is still likely to advance 5% year over year on a GAAP basis and 7% on a non-GAAP basis. Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be up in the range of 7-8%, which comes to $2.35-$2.38. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $2.37.Our TakeIn the fiscal first quarter, Paychex’s earnings and revenues both surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. Moreover, the year-over-year improvement on both counts is encouraging. Furthermore, the company’s upbeat revenue guidance for the fiscal is impressive.Paychex’s investments in product development, technology and focus on building its sales force to support revenue growth boost our optimism. We also believe the company’s expansion initiatives, such as joint ventures and acquisitions, will likely support its long-term growth strategy.Product launches are likely to be the other growth drivers. Also, Paychex’s focus on small- and mid-sized businesses looking for HR solutions could provide growth opportunities.However, unfavorable interest rates and competition from Automatic Data Processing (ADP  -  Free Report) and Insperity (NSP  -  Free Report) remain key concerns.Currently, Paychex has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is Synaptics Inc. (SYNA  -  Free Report), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1777,ADP,"After a busy week of new economic data — as well as speeches from members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) — last week, this week we look toward September employment metrics. The first of these will come out ahead of the opening bell tomorrow with the ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) private-sector jobs totals for last month, followed by Friday’s all-encompassing non-farm payroll results from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Expectations are for roughly 150-160K new jobs for the month, with the unemployment rate holding steady at 4.4%.However, sometimes an earnings report from a particular company can illustrate the relative health of industries on a more macro-level, and this morning we see results from new home builder Lennar Corp. (LEN  -  Free Report). This company has now beaten earnings estimates for the seventh straight quarter, which is impressive. Other reads also point to a solid fiscal Q3 2017 (August), which include improved demand and higher price points along the way.Lennar is based in Miami, FL, which took an indirect hit from Hurricane Irma a month ago. However, we don’t see much negative impact in the company’s Q3 as a result; this will likely become more obvious in the company’s Q4 report (and possibly beyond). For a more extensive look at this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s earnings report, click here.Q3 earnings of $1.06 per share topped expectations by a nickel. Revenues in the quarter rose 15% year over year to $3.26 billion, ahead of the $3.22 billion in the Zacks consensus. A higher number than expected of new homes delivered was cited for the company’s outperformance.Lennar also saw an increase of 20 basis points on home sales gross margin, and financial services rose 12.3% year over year. Part of this came from very impressive multi-family home sales growth, up 26.7% from Q3 2016 to $103.4 million in the quarter. Further, expenses were ratcheted down a tad in Q3, with SG&A costs down 9.2% year over year.So what we see in microcosm here — and it will take reports from Lennar competitors such as D.R. Horton (DHI  -  Free Report) and Beazer Homes (BZH  -  Free Report) in weeks to come to flesh out these narratives — that the new home market is showing signs of growth. They look modest, but the numbers are all pointed in the right direction. And as new homes are bought by families currently in rental units and/or at home with Mom and Dad, this opens up availability for more consumers to enter those rental units. Those in starter homes may more easily upgrade to their “dream homes,” helping accelerate the cycle. This is especially important as the baby boomer generation decides to downsize to smaller homes and assisted living facilities.The pre-market is up again across the board, following a new set of all-time closing highs for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500.

1779,ADP,"Paylocity Holding Corporation (PCTY  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 adjusted loss of 6 cents per share which was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate loss of 10 cents per share.Non-GAAP earnings during the quarter came in at 9 cents per share compared with a loss of 1 cent reported in the year-ago quarter.Quarter DetailsThe company’s revenues came in at $76.1 million, reflecting an increase of 27% year over year, and also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $74 million. The year-over-over increase was driven by new client addition, existing client growth and additions to HCM product suite.The top line was also backed by a 27% surge in recurring revenues (96% of total revenue) and a 30.6% increase in implementation and other revenues.The company’s non-GAAP gross profit came in at $47.1 million, up 32.5% year over year. Non-GAAP gross margin expanded 240 basis points (bps) year over year to 61.9%, primarily due to higher revenue base.Paylocity reported non-GAAP operating income of $5.5 million as compared with a loss of 21k reported in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin during the quarter came in at 7.2%. Non-GAAP operating expenses are pegged at $41.9 million, up 14.5% year over year. As a percentage of revenues non-GAAP operating expenses contracted 600 bps year over year to 55.2%.Consequently, non-GAAP net income during the quarter was $5.1 million compared with a loss of $0.393 million reported in the year-ago period.Paylocity exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $86.5 million compared with $101.5 million in the previous quarter. Receivables were $1.7 million compared with $2.2 million in the previous quarter.Paylocity has no long-term debt. The company generated $62 million of cash flow from operational activities during the 12 months ended Jun 30, 2016.GuidanceThe company provided outlook for the first quarter and fiscal 2018. For first-quarter fiscal 2018, Paylocity expects revenues in the range of $80.3–$81.3 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $80.3 million. Adjusted EBITDA is projected in the band of $12–$13 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share are anticipated to be in the range of 10–12 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 2 cents.For fiscal 2018, Paylocity anticipates revenues in the range of $368–$370 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $369.5 million. Adjusted EBITDA is projected in the range of $71–$72 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share are now expected within 78–80 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 31 cents.Share PriceIn the last one year, shares of Paylocity yielded a negative return of 4.8%, underperforming the industry, which gained 6.8%.Our TakePaylocity’s both top line and bottom line for the fourth quarter increased year over year. The company also provided an encouraging guidance for the first quarter and fiscal 2018.We remain positive about Paylocity’s regular investments in SaaS technology. Notably, in the last few quarters, clients moving from traditional payroll service providers to the company’s SaaS-based services generated a significant portion of Paylocity’s revenues. Consequently, we believe that regular investments in technological upgrades, along with product innovations, will continue to boost the top line in the long run. Such initiatives are also likely to have positive impact on its forthcoming results.Furthermore, higher adoption of Paylocity’s ACA dashboard application, which specializes in tracking employee count, employee status and health care plan affordability, will act as a tailwind.However, competition in the payroll processing sector from new entrants as well as existing players such as Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP  -  Free Report), Oracle Corporation (ORCL  -  Free Report) and SAP SE (SAP  -  Free Report) remain major headwinds.Currently, Paylocity carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

Although it represents a slightly tempered growth projection compared with the double-digit growth rate of the previous quarter, the dollar amount of the total earnings is likely to be on par or even better than the all-time high achieved in fourth-quarter 2016. The relative improvement in the quarterly performance is largely due to a turnaround in the economy, better job market scenario and rising oil prices. Experts widely believe that earnings growth is likely to be in double digits in 2018 and beyond.For the April–June quarter as a whole, about five of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to witness an earnings decline, with Autos, Conglomerates and Utilities being the biggest drag.The Business Services sector appears reasonably healthy. For the sector, earnings are expected to improve 9.4% year over year while sales are touted to rise 4.4% due to higher disposable income and new business initiatives.Let’s take a sneak peek at five major Business Services stocks scheduled to report earnings tomorrow to see how things are shaping up for the upcoming results.Republic Services, Inc. (RSG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results after the closing bell. The company has significantly expanded its product offerings in the e-commerce platform to address the evolving needs of the customers. This low-cost sales channel is likely to witness higher earnings in the quarter. In addition, the company improved the capabilities and functionality of the customer portal and mobile app with the enrolment of over 1.8 million customers. These value-driven interactive features are likely to lead to incremental orders and higher revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. (Read more: What to Expect from Republic Services in Q2 Earnings?)In the second quarter, the company’s earnings are expected to rise 7.3% year over year on 5.2% higher revenues. For the quarter, the company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, and Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), making an earnings prediction uncertain. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) for a likely earnings beat.

Moreover, the divestiture of Consumer Health Spending Account and Consolidated Omnibus Reconciliation Act businesses will impact top-line growth.

1781,ADP,"The first U.S. labor market data of 2018 has hit the tape before the opening bell this morning, with the ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) private sector payroll read for December reaching 250K new jobs. This is well beyond the 195K analysts were expecting. November’s tally was revised down, but only a tad: -5K to 185K. We remain consistent with a very strong employment environment.Unsurprisingly, Services easily outpaced Goods-producing jobs — 222K to 28K, respectively. Medium-sized businesses (50-499 employees) brought in the most jobs at 100K, followed by 96K from Small companies, with Large corporations picking up the rear with 56K. Likely we’re seeing a lot of seasonal employment in these numbers from December’s holiday shopping season, but even still: strength all around.Education/Healthcare grew by 50K new jobs, followed by Trade/Transportation at 45K and Leisure/Hospitality at 28K. Even the long-dormant Construction and Manufacturing brought in relatively healthy numbers with 16K and 9K, respectively.Looking at holiday shopping totals, we see stronger-than-expected results from both Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), up 1.1% in holiday sales comps, and J.C. Penney (JCP  -  Free Report), up 3.4%. For both companies, these sorts of positive comps are rare, and with new tax cuts for the big-box retailers, both are cranking up earnings estimates for next fiscal year.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA  -  Free Report) reported top- and bottom-line beats on its Q1 2018 estimates in today’s pre-market, as well. Earnings topped expectations by a penny to $1.28 per share, up 16.4% year over year. Revenues grew to $30.74 billion, hotter than the $30.33 billion anticipated and up 7.9% year over year. For more on WBA’s earnings, click here.Finally, fresh Initial Jobless Claims numbers hit the early-morning tape today, and these numbers were higher than expected: +250K new claims were up 3,000 from the previous week’s slightly upwardly revised total of 245K. This is at the top of our non-hurricane-related jobless claims range we’ve seen over the past dozen quarters or more. Continuing claims, however, fell lower again from 1.951 million two weeks ago to 1.914 million last week. We remain under the psychologically satisfying 2 million jobless claims figure.

1782,ADP,"Tuesday, January 2, 2018After witnessing roughly 20% gains or more in 2017’s major indexes, the natural question for investors is: what’s next? Well, this week will take us a good distance into figuring this out in early 2018, ahead of Q4 earnings season and as market participants plot their advances.Due to the holiday-shortened week, we’re seeing a slightly skewed events calendar: the ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) private sector payroll numbers for December will be released Thursday instead of the usual Wednesday — just one day ahead of the nonfarm payroll figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Expectations for both are positive but not earth-shattering: 189K new private sector jobs are expected from last month, and that number falls to 180K for Friday’s BLS tally. Unemployment is expected to remain 4.1%. All of these figures remain strong for the current economy.That’s not to say Wednesday will be devoid of relevant economic data; we expect to see ISM Manufacturing results, Construction Spending figures, Auto Sales and Fed minutes during the day tomorrow. (ISM Services numbers aren’t due until Friday.) These numbers will be particularly interesting for the goods producing and industrial investment factors implied, as these were sectors in the economy that have only recently begun to improve from their long-dormant states.One metric in particular on Friday will be of interest, and that is Average Hourly Earnings. This is another piece of the economic puzzle that has failed to gain along with the rest of the domestic environment, but with an estimate of +0.3% on Friday, this would point to wage growth that would go a long way toward enhancing U.S. GDP. (Q4 GDP, by the way, is estimated at 2.6% — another strong number to join Q3’s final 3.2%; any surprises to the upside here would no doubt be welcome for market bulls going forward.)Small Business Jobs Growth for December from today’s Paychex survey were down a bit, though moderate wage growth (+3%) still registers as a positive. Included in the Paychex data is a poll on the tax reform law passed at the end of 2017: 80% of small businesses in the U.S. are expected to invest their windfall profits back into their companies, and 65% of those companies expect to increase wages.

1783,ADP,"Robert Half International Inc. (RHI  -  Free Report) has been struggling with underlying weakness in Protiviti segment and sluggish domestic hiring trends. These factors also weighed on the company in third-quarter 2017, wherein earnings and sales declined year-over-year for the fifth straight quarter. However, the company is encouraged with the improving trends in the U.S. market.Further, the company has managed to stay afloat, courtesy of strong international operations and constant investments in technology up-gradation initiatives. Evidently, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have surged 24% in the past three months, almost in line with the industry’s rally of 25.4%.Let’s now delve into the factors that have been impacting Robert Half’s performance lately.Soft Protiviti Segment & Escalated Costs Protiviti is the wholly-owned subsidiary of Robert Half, offering varied risk consulting and audit services. Of late, the segment has been depicting weakness due to declining margins and fewer high-margin clients. During the third quarter of 2017, Protiviti’s revenues declined about 4% to $209 million, primarily stemming from weak trends in the United States. Despite a stable U.S. economic environment and a stronger job market, the hiring cycle continues to be lengthy as employers take more time to make hiring decisions. This is negatively affecting the company’s profits. Further, gross margin in the segment contracted 130 basis points to 29.6% during the quarter, severely affecting the company’s profits. The company has also been incurring increased selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses owing to higher staffing costs. Further, management expects SG&A deleverage, on account of costs related to IT initiatives, increased head count and higher compensations, especially outside the United States.The Driving FactorsNevertheless, the company has been witnessing strength in international hiring, driven by increasing demand for its professional staffing services. This, in turn has encouraged Robert Half to steadily invest in technology improvements. Major software initiatives include upgrades to enterprise resource planning applications and the implementation of a global, cloud-based customer relationship management application.Further, the company continues to invest in digital technology initiatives designed to enhance the service offerings to clients and candidates. In this regard, Robert Half concluded the global rollout of its CRM software in 2017, while it also launched a website recently. Notably, international revenue growth, mainly from European regions, provided some cushion to Robert Half’s soft revenues in third-quarter 2017.While Robert Half’s U.S. revenues were soft in the third quarter, management noted that trends improved in September which continued till October. Further, management is optimistic about the overall improved economic scenario. The increased economic activity in the United States and an optimistic growth view for 2017 give out positive signals for Robert Half’s business.Looking For More?

1784,ADP,"Automatic Data Processing Inc. (ADP  -  Free Report) is set to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings on Jul 27. Notably, the company has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 7.15%.In the last quarter, ADP delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6.50%. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $1.31 per share increased 12% on a year-over-year basis. However, revenues of $3.41 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.43 billion but grew 5% on a year-over-year basis.Management now expects new business bookings to decline year over year in fiscal 2017. Earlier, the company anticipated new business bookings to remain flat on a year-over-year basis. The decline in management’s expectation primarily reflects growing competition from the likes of Paychex (PAYX  -  Free Report), Equifax and The Ultimate Software Group.We note that ADP has underperformed the S&P 500 on a year-to-date basis. While the index gained 10.7%, the stock has returned 1.8%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderApart from stiff competition, we expect ADP’s investments in new initiatives to weigh on near-term earnings. Moreover, the divestiture of Consumer Health Spending Account (CHSA) and Consolidated Omnibus Reconciliation Act (COBRA) businesses will impact top-line growth. Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Automatic Data Processing, Inc. QuoteNevertheless, we note that ADP holds a dominant position in the payroll processing and human capital management (HCM) market, primarily owing to its robust product portfolio. This is also evident from the recent recognitions which the company’s solutions have received.ADP’s GlobalView HCM was named to the Constellation ShortList for Global Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for the second consecutive quarter in April.In May, Frost & Sullivan honored ADP as the “2016 North American HR Management Solutions Company of the Year”.ADP’s Accountant Connect solution also received “2017 CPA Practice Advisor Tax and Accounting Technology Innovation Award” in Jun.We believe that the company’s product strength will continue to drive higher revenue per client and customer retention ratio in the going-to-be-reported quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that ADP is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: ADP’s Earnings ESP is +2.99%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 69 cents is couple of cents higher that the Zacks Consensus Estimate. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: However, ADP carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Cypress Semiconductor (CY  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +11.11% and sports a Zacks Rank #1.

1785,ADP,"The world’s leading electronics components distributor, Avnet Inc. (AVT  -  Free Report), last week announced that its board of directors has increased the current share repurchase authorization by $200 million, thereby bringing the total authorization limit to approximately $500 million. However, management stated that the timing and number of shares to be bought will depend upon prevailing market conditions as well as other factors.Apart from this, management also announced a quarterly cash dividend of 18 cents per share to be paid on Dec 19 for the shareholders of record date as of Dec 6.Avnet has a steady track record of returning value to shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payouts. The company notified that in the past six years, it has returned more than $1.7 billion to its shareholders through share buybacks and dividend payments.Also, it should be noted that the company has approved nearly $2 billion of cumulative share repurchase program since 2011, of which it has completed the purchase of approximately $1.43 billion worth of common stocks.The company’s strong balance sheet and cash flow provide it with the financial flexibility to undertake shareholder-friendly initiatives and scope for product innovation and expansion in newer markets. The company ended first-quarter fiscal 2018 with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of nearly $737.6 million.Avnet, Inc. Price  Avnet, Inc. Price | Avnet, Inc.

Through share repurchases and dividend payouts, companies bolster investors’ confidence, persuading them to either buy or hold the scrip. Looking ahead, Avnet remains confident on its growth potential, thereby raising hope for further rise in shareholder value.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1786,ADP,"Thursday, November 2, 2017Following the heaviest inflow of Q3 earnings reports of the entire quarter yesterday after the closing bell, we see new economic data reads and news from across the pond. There will also be a long-awaited unveiling of the GOP tax reform plan today. And this is all aside from a new group of Q3 earnings reports coming out before the opening bell this morning.Initial Jobless Claims fell again, to 229K last week from a slightly upwardly revised 234K the previous week. Continuing claims have sunk to multi-quarter lows beneath 1.9 million to 1.884 million specifically. This is more positive news, following yesterday’s ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) strong 235K new private-sector jobs results for October. Tomorrow’s Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) non-farm payroll report is expected to bring in north of 300K new jobs last month. All of these numbers speak to an unwaveringly strong U.S. labor market.Productivity and Labor Costs reads were also released early today. Preliminary productivity hit 3.0%, a bit higher than the 2.8% analysts had been expecting. The last time this metric registered this high was back in 2014. Labor costs were close to in-line with expectations at 0.5%, following a 0.3% read last time around. A surge in productivity with slight wage increases would seem to be music to the ears of economists and market participants alike; solid growth without unruly inflation creating headwinds is likely as Goldilocks as it gets.Which brings us to the tax reform proposal key to the Republican-run Congress today and its success in next year’s mid-term elections, and my question is one that is almost never asked by market analysts these days: with 3% growth, still-cheap borrowing costs and solid employment numbers, what do we need a tax cut for? These types of measures are typically used to pry an economy out of being stuck in the mud; if we’re already at or near our goals currently, wouldn’t a tax cut at this stage be simply borrowing against future gains, with the possible additional problems of blowing a hole the the national deficit, which would create longer-term economic issues?This aside for now, the Bank of England today has decided to ratchet up its interest rates 0.5%, amounting to its first rate hike in 10 years. This announcement comes as inflation in the U.K. remains at 3% while economic growth is slowing, not speeding up. The Bank also stayed pat with an asset buyback program worth U.S. $574 million. It’s far from a typical move for a central bank to raise rates while the country’s economy slows; starting new businesses, obtaining mortgages, etc. will now be more difficult. Perhaps the logic is that giving commercial and investment bank in England a leg up will spur the economy indirectly in the months ahead.Q3 Earnings RoundupWe will hear from Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) after the closing bell. Yesterday afternoon we saw a big beat from Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) augmented by remarks from CEO Mark Zuckerberg that security measures will add to costs at the social media leader at the expense of future profits. Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report), on the other hand, missed expectations on a Model 3 “bottleneck,” but future projections for auto deliveries in 2018 remained hopefully robust.Newell Brands (NWL  -  Free Report) shares have tumbled more than 20% this morning following its disappointing Q3 earnings results, where by the consumer plastics maker missed the 92 cent Zacks consensus and posted just 86 cents per share. This was still 10% growth year over year. Revenues in the quarter narrowly missed the 3.7 billion expected, and the company lowered earnings estimates for full-year 2017.Global quick-service restaurant major Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report) beat estimates by 2 cents per share to 68 cents in its most recent quarter, with $1.44 billion in revenues topping the $1.40 billion in the Zacks consensus estimate. Comps at KFC of +4% assisted the positive results in the quarter. Shares are trading up 2% in today’s pre-market.Hyatt Hotels (H  -  Free Report) surpassed expectations greatly on the bottom line, posting earnings of 26 cents per share compared with the 17 cents expected. Revenues of $1.12 billion topped the $1.09 billion we had been looking for. RevPAR rose 1.6% quarter over quarter, slightly offset by adjusted EBITDA down year over year.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

1787,ADP,"On this first day of November — following a robust October, which was the best trading month since February — the ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) private-sector payroll wastes no time shedding light from the month of October from labor market activity. This also means Friday will bring us the non-farm payroll report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) which together bring us more or less up to date on the health of the domestic jobs market.The latest ADP headline number was well out in front of expectations: 235K new private-sector jobs filled well surpassed the 190K analysts had expected. However, September’s total was revised downward by 25K new jobs to 110K overall. Averaging the two months — which may be useful in helping comb-out anomalies related to the two major hurricanes that struck the continental U.S. shores several weeks ago — we come up with 170K. This is still far stronger than what the economy “needs” to continue strengthening the U.S. labor market.Pointing toward the post-hurricane rebuild, the sector breakdown shows 62K Construction jobs having been created in the month, the top job-creating industry last month, followed by the steadily growing Leisure/Hospitality and Education/Healthcare results of 45K and 39K, respectively. Goods-producing jobs reached 85K while Services maintained its strong advantage at 150K jobs in October.The estimate for Friday’s BLS report is 315K. This is an impressive headline, but also may be susceptible to the same hurricane-related affects, including downward revisions. Somewhere in the high 100Ks is where analysts are looking for that two-month average to wind up.Bitcoin’s Record HighThe CME Group (CME  -  Free Report) announced it will launch a futures trading platform on the Bitcoin cryptocurrency sometime before year’s end. Bitcoin has been hard to ignore in 2017, trading up nearly 500% year to date, and currently trades at an all-time high near 6500. Not too shabby for a product without any federal government backing anywhere in the word, and with plenty of high-powered naysayers like JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon.Huge Day for Q3 EarningsAfter the closing bell today, we will see earnings results from a metric ton of notable companies in big tech and elsewhere. Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report) and the two marquee names, but this afternoon also includes Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report), Kraft-Heinz (KHC  -  Free Report), Fitbit (FIT  -  Free Report), Shake Shack (SHAK  -  Free Report) and dozens of others. Q3 earnings season is again bearing out market strength, even among small-cap stocks, as this interview with Tracey Ryniec and Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian illustrates: Is This a Buying Opportunity in Small-Cap Stocks?Ahead of today’s opening bell, specialty retailer Estee Lauder (EL  -  Free Report) is up 7% on a strong fiscal Q1 2018 quarter which saw earnings rise 42% year over year and revenues up 14%. $1.21 per share topped the 98 cents in the Zacks consensus, and sales of $3,274 million outperformed our estimate of $3,164 million. Estee Lauder also raised its earnings guidance for both Q2 and full-year 2018.Consumer discretionary giant Clorox Group (CLX  -  Free Report) also outperformed its fiscal Q1 2018 expectations during today’s pre-market, posting $1.46 per share for a 5-cent beat on $1.50 billion in quarterly sales, ahead of the $1.48 billion anticipated. However, the company shaved down full-year estimates for both sales and earnings. Shares are up 1% ahead of the opening bell.Specialty tech products firm Garmin (GRMN  -  Free Report) also beat estimates on its top and bottom lines this morning: 75 cents per share topped the 66 cents expected, and revenues of $743 million outpaced the $718 in the Zacks consensus. The company also raised guidance, and we see shares up 4.7% in today’s pre-market.

1790,ADP,"Wednesday, November 1, 2017On this first day of November — following a robust October, which was the best trading month since February — the ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) private-sector payroll wastes no time shedding light from the month of October from labor market activity. This also means Friday will bring us the non-farm payroll report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) which together bring us more or less up to date on the health of the domestic jobs market.The latest ADP headline number was well out in front of expectations: 235K new private-sector jobs filled well surpassed the 190K analysts had expected. However, September’s total was revised downward by 25K new jobs to 110K overall. Averaging the two months — which may be useful in helping comb-out anomalies related to the two major hurricanes that struck the continental U.S. shores several weeks ago — we come up with 170K. This is still far stronger than what the economy “needs” to continue strengthening the U.S. labor market.Pointing toward the post-hurricane rebuild, the sector breakdown shows 62K Construction jobs having been created in the month, the top job-creating industry last month, followed by the steadily growing Leisure/Hospitality and Education/Healthcare results of 45K and 39K, respectively. Goods-producing jobs reached 85K while Services maintained its strong advantage at 150K jobs in October.The estimate for Friday’s BLS report is 315K. This is an impressive headline, but also may be susceptible to the same hurricane-related affects, including downward revisions. Somewhere in the high 100Ks is where analysts are looking for that two-month average to wind up.Bitcoin’s Record HighThe CME Group (CME  -  Free Report) announced it will launch a futures trading platform on the Bitcoin cryptocurrency sometime before year’s end. Bitcoin has been hard to ignore in 2017, trading up nearly 500% year to date, and currently trades at an all-time high near 6500. Not too shabby for a product without any federal government backing anywhere in the word, and with plenty of high-powered naysayers like JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon.Huge Day for Q3 EarningsAfter the closing bell today, we will see earnings results from a metric ton of notable companies in big tech and elsewhere. Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report) and the two marquee names, but this afternoon also includes Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report), Kraft-Heinz (KHC  -  Free Report), Fitbit (FIT  -  Free Report), Shake Shack (SHAK  -  Free Report) and dozens of others. Q3 earnings season is again bearing out market strength, even among small-cap stocks, as this interview with Tracey Ryniec and Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian illustrates: Is This a Buying Opportunity in Small-Cap Stocks?Ahead of today’s opening bell, specialty retailer Estee Lauder (EL  -  Free Report) is up 7% on a strong fiscal Q1 2018 quarter which saw earnings rise 42% year over year and revenues up 14%. $1.21 per share topped the 98 cents in the Zacks consensus, and sales of $3,274 million outperformed our estimate of $3,164 million. Estee Lauder also raised its earnings guidance for both Q2 and full-year 2018.Consumer discretionary giant Clorox Group (CLX  -  Free Report) also outperformed its fiscal Q1 2018 expectations during today’s pre-market, posting $1.46 per share for a 5-cent beat on $1.50 billion in quarterly sales, ahead of the $1.48 billion anticipated. However, the company shaved down full-year estimates for both sales and earnings. Shares are up 1% ahead of the opening bell.Specialty tech products firm Garmin (GRMN  -  Free Report) also beat estimates on its top and bottom lines this morning: 75 cents per share topped the 66 cents expected, and revenues of $743 million outpaced the $718 in the Zacks consensus. The company also raised guidance, and we see shares up 4.7% in today’s pre-market.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

1791,ADP,"The earnings season is well past the halfway mark. More than 54% the S&P 500 companies have already released results till Oct 27. Total earnings for these companies (accounting for 64.2% of the index’s total market capitalization) are up 8.7% year over year on 6.7% higher revenues, with 75.7% beating earnings estimates and 66.2% surpassing top-line expectations. Based on the hitherto observed pattern, the July-September quarter is anticipated to register modest single-digit percentage earnings growth on a year-over-year basis. Per the latest Earnings Preview, overall earnings for all the S&P 500 companies are expected to be up 5.4% on 5.5% growth in revenues. It represents a slightly tempered growth projection compared with the double-digit growth rate of the previous quarter, largely due to drag from the insurance industry that was hit hard by devastating hurricanes, Harvey and Irma. However, total earnings for the S&P 500 are on track to reach a new all-time quarterly record, surpassing the previous high reached in the preceding earnings season. Experts widely believe that earnings growth is likely to improve steadily in 2018 and beyond.The Business Services sector appears modest this quarter. For the sector, earnings are expected to improve 6.6% year over year while sales are touted to rise 3.7% due to relatively stable economy.Let’s have a sneak peek at three major Business Services stocks scheduled to report earnings on Nov 2 to see how things are shaping up for the upcoming results.With diligent execution of operational plans, Gartner, Inc. (IT  -  Free Report) has recorded double-digit growth in key metrics for more than a decade. In addition, this performance-driven firm has a strong cash flow and a healthy balance sheet position. It has a vast, untapped market opportunity worth an estimated $61 billion. The acquisition of CEB, an industry leader in providing best practice and talent management insights, further reinforces Gartner’s market strength. The combination of its analyst-driven, syndicated research and advisory services with CEB’s expertise is likely to provide a comprehensive and differentiated suite of services portfolio across the globe.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Research segment revenues is currently pegged at $687 million, up from $462 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Revenues from the Event segment are expected to be $38 million compared with reported revenues of $33 million in the year-earlier quarter. However, revenues from the Consulting segment are anticipated to be $75 million, down from $79 million reported in the year-ago quarter.

(RSG  -  Free Report) has significantly expanded its product offerings in the e-commerce platform to address the evolving needs of the customers. This low-cost sales channel is likely to aid the company in the quarter. At the same time, Republic Services is focused on increasing operational efficiency by converting its fleet to compressed natural gas collection vehicles and modifying rear-loading trucks to automated-side loaders, which will reduce costs and improve profitability. The company is realigning its field support functions by combining two organizational layers. It expects these initiatives to contribute approximately $25 million of annual cost savings from 2018. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Collection segment revenues is currently pegged at $1,883 million, up from $1,814 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Revenues from the Landfill segment are expected to be $318 million compared with reported revenues of $293 million in the year-earlier quarter. Revenues from the Transfer and Disposal Services segment are anticipated to be $136 million, up from $126 million reported in the year-ago quarter.

1792,ADP,"Following a heady read from private-sector payroll numbers Wednesday from ADP (ADP  -  Free Report), where reported new jobs were well beyond 200K for the month of August and far surpassed the estimates in aggregate, we see mildly disappointing results this Friday for the BLS non-farm payroll report: 156K new jobs in August, beneath the 180K consensus. Unemployment rose to 4.4% from the previous and expected 4.3% — still healthy, but not as robust as expected. And August is one of those strange months where things like hiring new employees lags, seasonally.Average hourly earnings rose only 0.1% for the month, further pushing the narrative that inflation — which was expected to have hit the economy much harder by this point in 2017 — remains tepid. If you were looking for a final possibility the Fed might still raise rates another quarter-percent this month, you can put a fork in it — it’s done.Revisions for the previous two months also sank in this morning’s report: June fell from 231K to 201K and July went from 206K to 189K, for a total loss of 41K new jobs over the summer months. In August, while the private sector reportedly brought in 165K jobs, the Government (mostly state and local) lost a total of 9K. Otherwise, Manufacturing filled 36K new positions and Construction brought in 28K. The U-6 (“real employment”) stayed unchanged at 8.6%, as did the Labor Force Participation Rate of 62.9%.None of these numbers are tragic; they are at most slightly off, with wiggle room in future revisions to push back toward that 180K consensus. After all, this remains about the average job growth per month we’ve seen throughout 2017 and for the past few years. And it remains above what we need from the domestic labor force to provide a positive impact to the U.S. economy.In short, no need to worry. There is no Hurricane Harvey impact in any of these numbers, so they may augment certain aspects downward initially but perhaps bolster Construction job totals, etc. And this storm’s after-effects will be demonstrably different than those of Hurricane Katrina a decade-plus ago: home ownership and household income in Houston in 2017 are both far higher that in New Orleans in 2005. Meaning the efforts to put the fourth-largest city in the U.S. back together in the aftermath of this storm will be far greater than they were in the other one.Regarding the recovery from Harvey, residents are returning home to assess the damage to their property, and more businesses are beginning to re-open their doors. Although the Arkema (ARKAY  -  Free Report) chemical plant reportedly expects even more fires due to lack of cooling agents on its stored chemical compounds, elsewhere things look to be drying out. In any case, Harvey is already expected to be the most expensive storm in U.S. history… that is, unless Hurricane Irma hits an even bigger section of the country in the next week or so, such as New York City…

1794,ADP,"This morning, two key economic reads hit the tape ahead of the opening bell: the first revision of Q2 GDP and the ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) private-sector payroll results were both better than expected. GDP hit 3.0% for this second read, up from 2.6% in the initial release and 20 basis points higher than analysts were expecting. ADP jobs posted a big 237K number, well beyond the 185K expected.Personal consumption grew at a higher rate than earlier recorded, and corporate profits swung to a positive 0.8% in the quarter, up from a negative read the first time around. This demonstrates the economic strength many investors have been anticipating since the surprise win of President Trump last November, and shows enterprise confidence is indeed having a positive impact.For the private sector payroll reads, ADP also revised its July total to 201K, 23K higher that in the initial read. Services once again supplied far more jobs than the Goods segment of the U.S. workforce, and the usual suspects of Trade/Transportation, Leisure/Hospitality and Education/Healthcare were the biggest gainers. Large companies (more than 500 employees) led the way with 115K new jobs for the month. We will look to see if analysts raise their estimates for Friday’s BLS non-farm payroll report, which currently expects 179K new jobs from the month of August.Of course, Southeast Texas is currently in need of major rebuilding efforts, which should bolster Construction jobs, but we may not see the positive impact of this for at least a month, depending on when the numbers shake out. But there seems to be nothing in the way of continued growth with an improving global economy and a cheaper U.S. dollar helping prime the pump.Harvey Recovery UpdateSpeaking of Southeast Texas, while it remains to be seen if Hurricane Harvey will be the most costly in U.S. history, much progress has already been made in recovery efforts. Millions of dollars have been raised, first responders have rescued thousands, and even the lights in downtown Houston are back on in most places. Many Houston residents will even be heading back to work today.The flooding was worse than the last major storm to hit the Southeastern coast, Hurricane Ike, but the good news is the winds were not as strong as they were in the previous storm. This kept many power lines intact, even while flood waters still need to come down in several areas. So while yesterday’s headlines spoke of 30K citizens being displaced and no end to the turmoil in sight, it appears as if today a positive corner has been turned.One note of caution, however, comes from a report by Black Knight Financial Services reported on CNBC this morning: that 75K mortgage holders may finds themselves unable to pay for the next two months, with 45K expected to be seriously delinquent. This increases the risk for mortgage defaults in the Houston region, which sees more homeowners ad more of these highly leveraged than we saw in New Orleans in the wake of Hurricane Katrina 12 years ago.

1796,ADP,"Paychex Inc. (PAYX  -  Free Report) appears to be striving to capitalize on the rising opportunities in the professional employer organization (PEO) industry. In this regard, the payroll and human resource solutions provider recently acquired Charlotte, NC-based HR Outsourcing Holdings, Inc. (HROI) for an undisclosed amount.Founded in 2001, HROI is a well know name in the PEO industry, which, along with its subsidiaries, offers human resource solutions to small and medium-sized businesses in over 35 states across the U.S. Importance of HROI Buyout A PEO is a firm or company to which organizations can outsource their HR functions, including payroll and benefits administration. The benefits offered by a PEO make it a viable choice for organizations.The most important benefit is that an organization gets full administrative support without investing in technology and employees. Apart from this, a PEO takes care of all aspects of an employee’s tenure. Organizations get trained representatives who can better address their HR related matters. Moreover, the growing regulatory burden on small companies signifies that the need to outsource non-core activities is growing.Therefore, in our opinion, the acquisition is a strategic fit for Paychex as more and more companies are willing to use PEO services rather than creating their in-house HR management departments. Also, both the companies have similar target customers,  small and medium-sized businesses.As of May 31, 2017, Paychex had nearly 605,000 payroll clients but the market is still highly untapped. Per the company, there are about 12 million businesses in the U.S. under its total addressable market, half of which are still untapped.The recent buyout of HROI will expand its services, thereby helping it to add to its customer base.Bottom LineThe company’s initiatives to boost revenue growth through acquisitions are encouraging. Since its inception, the company has completed 13 acquisitions of which eight were under the leadership of current president and CEO, Martin Mucci.These buyouts have helped the company to expand its services as well as global reach, thereby boosting its revenues. Notably, in the last five fiscals, i.e. 2012 to 2017, the company has seen its revenues rise at a CAGR of 7.2%.Going ahead, one of the key secular growth drivers of Paychex is the demand for outsourcing. Human Resource Services outsourcing is a large, less-than-half-penetrated market that offers significant cost saving potential.The company seeks to capitalize on this opportunity by periodically introducing products and services for upselling to the client base and moving into the mid-market.However, for the last few months, payroll client growth has been affected by political uncertainty, which in turn is impacting outsourcing-decision making in the mid-market. This was highlighted by Paychex during its fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 conference call.This makes us sceptical about the company’s near-term performance. Intense competition in the outsourcing space from major players like Automated Data Processing (ADP  -  Free Report) and Insperity (NSP  -  Free Report) could add to its woes.Paychex has underperformed the industry to which it belongs to in the last year. The stock has lost 8% of its value in the said period while the industry declined just 1.3%.Currently, Paychex carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock in the same industry space is Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (BR  -  Free Report) which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The stock has an estimated long-term EPS growth rate of 10%.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

1797,ADP,"Equifax Inc. (EFX  -  Free Report) recently completed the acquisition of ID Watchdog in an all-cash deal. The company had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire ID Watchdog on Jun 16, 2017.Per the agreement, Equifax will pay approximately $63 million in cash, which translates to nearly 40 cents per share, to acquire all outstanding shares of ID Watchdog. The buyout is aimed to provide a boost to Equifax’s capabilities to serve customers better.Founded in 2005, ID Watchdog is one of the leading providers of identity theft protection and resolution services to the Employee Benefits marketplace. The acquisition is anticipated to further strengthen Equifax’s identity theft protection services and fortify its presence in the employee benefits space.According to Dann Adams, President of Global Consumer Solutions at Equifax, “""We are excited to have ID Watchdog's industry leading products become an important part of our organization."" Adams further added, ""Merging our Identity solutions and industry relationships will significantly increase the access, range, and depth of our employee benefits solutions.""Equifax is the world’s largest data management company which organizes and assimilates data related to more than 820 million customers, and 91 million businesses globally.The company has made strategic acquisitions to supplement its core business. In 2014, the company acquired TDX Group and Forseva, while it closed the Veda Group Limited buyout in first-quarter 2016.We believe that management’s efforts, such as strategic initiatives for product innovation, expansion of data assets through acquisitions and continuous share gains in North America, should act as tailwinds. Moreover, the company’s strong correlation with the consumer and financial markets, as well as exposure in the U.S. and Europe are likely to propel growth, moving ahead.However, we foresee the company’s investments in new initiatives to weigh on its upcoming quarterly earnings. Additionally, uncertainty surrounding IT spending and the strengthening U.S. dollar remain concerns.Moreover, increasing competition from the likes of Fiserv (FISV  -  Free Report), Automatic Data Processing Inc (ADP  -  Free Report) and Total System Services (TSS  -  Free Report) are other factors likely to affect earnings in the near term.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year. With compounding, rebalancing, and exclusive of fees, it can turn thousands into millions of dollars.But here's something even more remarkable: You can master this proven system without going to a single class or seminar. And then you can apply it to your portfolio in as little as 10 minutes a month.Learn the secret >>

1799,ADP,"Paylocity Holding Corporation (PCTY  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Aug 10. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 133.3%. Let's see how things are shaping prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayPaylocity’s both top and bottom-lines for the third quarter increased year over year. The company also raised fiscal 2017 guidance.We remain positive about Paylocity’s regular investments in SaaS technology. Notably in the last few quarters, clients switching from traditional payroll service providers to the company’s SaaS-based services generated a significant portion of its revenues. Therefore, we believe that regular investments in technological upgrades, along with product innovations, will continue to boost the company’s top-line in the long run. Such initiatives are also likely to have positive impact on forthcoming results.Furthermore, higher adoption of Paylocity’s ACA dashboard application, which specializes in tracking employee count, employee status and health care plan affordability, will act as a tailwind.However, competition in the payroll processing sector from new entrants as well as existing players such as Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP  -  Free Report), Oracle Corporation and SAP SE remain major headwinds.Paylocity Holding Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Paylocity Holding Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Paylocity Holding Corporation QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Paylocity will beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Paylocity ESP is 0.00% since both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 10 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Paylocity’s Zacks Rank #3 when combined with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:CACI International, Inc. (CACI  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +1.83% and a Zacks Rank #2.

1800,ADP,"Another big morning for Q2 earnings posts, with mostly positive results. We also see new Initial Jobless Claims numbers ahead of tomorrow’s big non-farm payroll report and unemployment rate headline. After yesterday’s ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) private sector payroll report that was consistent with good news we’ve mostly been experiencing of late, expectations are for roughly 180K new jobs created. The unemployment rate last read was 4.4%.Initial Jobless Claims fell 5000 to 240K last week, as the previous week had been revised up 1000. Again we see results range-bound between 225K-250K week to week, with very few outliers, over the past year or more. The 4-week moving average is currently 241,750, down 2500 week over week. Continuing claims again remained below 2 million, at 1.968 million.And the Bank of England is taking steps to brace for its coming Brexit — the separation of Great Britain from the European Union, which was voted on last year (and cost Prime Minister David Cameron his job, pretty much) to the greater world’s surprise. BOE Governor Mark Carney is quoted as having said, “the assumption of a smooth transition to a new economic relationship with the EU will be tested.” As such, the Monetary Policy Committee will be keeping rates unchanged, and the BOE has lowered economic growth projections. The British Pound is down today.Ahead of the bell, medical insurance giant Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) blasted past earnings estimates of $2.34 per share to post $3.42 ahead of this morning’s open. This represents 46% growth year over year. Membership was actually down year over year by 1.6%, but revenues also easily topped forecasts: $15.50 billion versus $15.35 billion expected. Shares are up over 4% in the pre-market.Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report) beat projections on both top and bottom lines this morning, posting 68 cents per share on sales of $1.45 billion in the quarter. The Zacks consensus had been looking for 61 cents per share and $1.41 billion in revenues, respectively. Comps at both KFC and Taco Bell were up: 3% and 4%, respectively.Avon Products (AVP  -  Free Report), however, has faired badly ahead of this morning’s open, down 10% in early trading on missed earnings and sales. A loss of 3 cents per share was lower than the gain of 5 cents expected, and revenues of $1.35 billion failed to reach the $1.44 billion in our Zacks consenus. Further, CEO Sheri McCoy has announced she will be stepping down from her post. Reports are that board pressure is the main reason.Clorox (CLX  -  Free Report) posted narrow beats on top and bottom lines this morning. Earnings of $1.53 per share and revenues of $1.65 billion outperformed the $1.49 per share and $1.64 billion we had been looking for. Earnings grew 21% year over year, and the company’s fiscal year 2017 guidance was upped 9%. It’s Clorox’s third-straight earnings beat, as its Cleaning, Household, Lifestyle and International segments were all up in the quarter.

1802,ADP,"We take a break for a moment this morning from our normal Q2 earnings season checklist of prominent companies reporting results before the opening bell to bring you the (ADP  -  Free Report)  private sector payroll numbers for July: they were good. The headline number of 178K was a smudge below the 180K the analysts had been forecasting, but June numbers were revised upward significantly, from 158K on the first read to 191K this morning. Goods production was a little weaker than expected at 4000 new jobs, but 174K in Services made up the slack.Medium-sized businesses (between 50-499 employees) did the most hiring last month with 83K jobs. Small firms brought in 50K and large companies hired 45K new workers. Education and Healthcare led the way with 43K hires, followed by Trade/Transportation at 24K and Leisure/Hospitality with 15K. Construction, which had been seeing a slight resurgence in recent months, is now back down where it had been previously, at 6K. Manufacturing, also a recent beneficiary of “Make America Great Again” spirits, lost 4000 jobs in the month.Friday’s non-farm payroll estimate currently sits at 180K, and today’s ADP read will not move this needle. We are essentially operating at what economists call “full employment,” although wage growth remains stagnant overall, and thus business owners are actually having difficulty filling positions higher up the economic food chain. Should we see wage growth gain traction in the coming months — as well as policies long-promised regarding infrastructure and corporate tax reform — there is an opportunity for the U.S. to see a stronger labor market than perhaps any time in our readers’ lifetimes.To say Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) posted a “big surprise” in its fiscal Q3 earnings report after Tuesday’s closing bell would be a bit overstating the case. After all, this is the company that, in the final years of Steve Jobs’ tenure, would wallop expectations on the top and bottom line each quarter for years. Since Jobs’ passing, Apple has come back down to earth a bit, although the bull rally of the last 9 months or so has brought AAPL shares to new all-time highs — to nearly $160 per share as of pre-market trading today.Consider this has happened even before the release of the iPhone 8, currently not scheduled for release until the beginning of fiscal Q1 2018. For sure, some of AAPL’s current price point has already priced in the future sales of this long-anticipated smartphone. But consider for a moment that Apple posted improved sales for its Macs and iPads in its most recent quarter, and the company has an astounding $261 BILLION in cash. This company could buy out entire INDUSTRIES with that kinda scratch.Electric car leader Tesla Inc. (TSLA  -  Free Report) releases its Q2 earnings results after today’s closing bell, with CEO wunderkind Elon Musk’s conference call to follow. The company is more than doubling its revenues year over year, but so are its capital expenditures. The best way to look at Tesla is not necessarily in its quarterly earnings but how the company is growing: look at the Gigafactory numbers, Model 3 orders, and the like. This could be one of the most important companies of the 21st century, but execution is entirely key.Tesla shares are up nearly 50% year to date, but are exactly flat in today’s pre-market. The company sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), with a Zacks Style Score (Value-Growth-Momentum) of F. Earnings ESP is -18.5%, indicating a greater chance of missing the Zacks consensus estimate when the report comes out. Keep in mind, however, Elon Musk has his eye trained on the much bigger picture. So should anyone looking at this stock.
